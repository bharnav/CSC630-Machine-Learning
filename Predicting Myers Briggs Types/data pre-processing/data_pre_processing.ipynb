    "# Data Pre-Processing for Predicting Myers Briggs Types\n",
    "### By Arnav Bhakta$^{1}$ and William Yue$^{1}$\n",
    "#### $^{1}$ Phillips Academy Andover\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The authors would like to thank Patrick Chen, Michael Huang, Ali Cy, and William H. Yue for their helpful input and advice in crafting this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be going through the data pre-processing steps that are necessary in order predict Myers Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI). To give a bit of an overview, MBTI is an \"introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions\" [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator). It \"divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)\n",
    "* Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)\n",
    "* Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)\n",
    "* Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "and assigns everyone a label, based on which of the personality types they fulfill [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). \"For example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system\" [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). In doing so, it is possible to get more of an overview of someone's personality, their preferences, and behaviors, and psychological perspective. Hence, in the current study, we look to levarage machine learning (ML) to correctly and accurately classify people's personalities or MBTIs, based on how it is that they \"speak\" and interact with others. The data is taken from the Kaggle [(MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type), which provides text of people interacting in a forum, as we presume from reading over samples in the dataset, which are then labeled with their corresponding personality type [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current notebook, we have seperated the presented dataset into a smaller set, consistent of two types of labeled data, Introversion (I) and Extroversion (E). Using the provided texts for each of these labels (Introversion being labeled a 1 and Extroversion being labeled a 0), we hope to be able to accurately predict each of these personality types."

    "\n",
    "We import the below libraries to help us with data pre-processing. Pandas is primarily used for loading in the data from a csv, and creating DataFrames. NumPy is primarily used for creating arrays and simple arithmetic. Regular expression operations (re) are primarily used for splitting up the samples and removing unwanted or implicative text from the dataset. Tokenize and Tokenizer are primarily used to split up sentences into smaller units or words called tokens, to helping to understand the text and build the model, by making it easier to understand the meaning of the text, by analyzing it as a sequence of words. The remaining libraries are used for importing and exporting data."
