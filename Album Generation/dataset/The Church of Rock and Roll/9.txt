Well, I tried so hard but still I fall
Fall back down the great below
And it's been a while since I have prayed
But tonight I'm on my knees

I'm asking why, why, why me?

The streets is where I's born
And the streets is where I'll die
Until then the streets is where I'll be

So keep pouring the drinks till I forget my name
I love my life but it gets hard
As I'm sure it does for us all from time to time

So keep living it through, I'll keep living it too
I hang my head, hang it low
And I pray that it gets a little better down the line

Why? Why me?

The streets is where I's born
And the streets is where I'll die
Until then the streets is where I'll be

Oh, sweet mother of two, you work hard
So hard to keep your heads above the water
And although I stand on the shore with a line
I can't seem to untangle it

From the selfish dreams of my own
I wish I had just a little more money
To help you out in the times
When it's hard, so hard, so hard

The streets is where I's born
And the streets is where I'll die
Until then the streets is where I'll be
