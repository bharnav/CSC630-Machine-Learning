You're a lady, I know, baby
And I'm a man, I know that too
So this might come as some surprise
A bit unusual when I lay down the rules

You got my heart, now you want my body
Keep my cool, girl, you lucky you's a hottie
Ain't no games that I play that you can win
If you want inside my temple, I'm gonna have to let you in

You're holding out for sweet surrender, baby yeah
It won't be coming no time soon
Our love has just begun to simmer
And when it boils you'll be cooked through

You got my heart, now you want my body
Keep my cool, girl, you lucky you's a hottie
Ain't no games that I play that you can win
If you want inside my temple, I'm gonna have to let you in

Your eyes are filled with fire
And your mouth is filled with cuss
And I'm tired, baby, I'm tired

When I get home through the door
And I walk into the kitchen
And I'm tired, tired, tired

And I walk into the door
And you're wearing that mad face on your head
And I'm tired, fuck you, baby

I'm the king
In my own world I am the king
Maybe not in your world
But in my world I am the king
