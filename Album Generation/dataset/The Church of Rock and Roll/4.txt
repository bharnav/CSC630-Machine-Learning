When I go on tour, my son always tells me
Wish he had a normal dad just like all the other 9 to 5's
He don't understand what it is to be in a band
In rock 'n' roll land, they don't understand

Before I go on tour
He always looks me in the eye
Makes me feel real bad, he says

Don't bid me farewell, don't tell me goodbye
Please, be here tomorrow when I wake up
Forever together, that's what we'll be
Forever together, just you and me

Stay up late, drinking wine with my friends
And spill purple all over my shirt
We down to the funny show, sit in front row
And try to laugh away the hurt

But they don't understand
At the end of the day it's not funny
I miss my family far away

Don't bid me farewell, don't tell me goodbye
Please, be here tomorrow when I wake up
Forever together, that's what we'll be
Forever together, just you and me

You wouldn't know it to look at me
But there's a constant battle raging inside
It's so hard to live these two lives
Hello Dr. Jekyll, Hello Mr. Hyde

We don't understand
Travel's said to broaden the mind
I'm just losing mine

Don't bid me farewell, don't tell me goodbye
Please, be here tomorrow when I wake up
Forever together, that's what we'll be
Forever together, just you and me
