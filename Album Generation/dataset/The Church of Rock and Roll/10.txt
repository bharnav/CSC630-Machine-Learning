Liberty queen
She was an American dream
They put a statue of her in the river
Boats passing by catch the big woman's eye
But a second glance, sailor don't give her
Gathering moss, staring across from the city
It's a pity
Nobody care-a
Bout a relic from a bygone era

Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Free, that's what I was born to be

Home of the brave
Cradle to grave
Being righteous don't make you no money
Cause I'm barely able to put food on the table while
Big Bear's rolling in honey
But don't cry
There's only one thing you take with you when you die

Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
