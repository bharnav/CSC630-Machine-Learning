[Verse 1: Eric Nally]
There was a time when I used to care
I had a heart man, something was there
I didn't know it then but now
That it's gone the fire died

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
Heal me with your holy touch
Heal me with your holy touch, oh baby
Heal me with your holy
Kick down the door and hold me
Heal me with your holy touch

[Verse 2: Eric Nally]
There was a line that I used to walk
I used to cross it just to get them to talk
But I'd regret it if I did or not
Cause I hate both sides

[Chorus: Eric Nally]

[Bridge: Eric Nally]
I'm just sitting here crying
The fire is dying

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
