When we were young I played the cowboy
And you were my beauty queen
I loved you then, I love you now, baby
But this time it's the real thing

There's a way about you
That turns me on
There's a way about you that
Just keeps me going

But now it's too late, baby
There's no place left to go
I said, it's too late, baby
No, no, no

The story's over, the curtain's closing
We take our final bow
Once the hottest ticket around
The seats are all empty now

There's still a way about you
That just turns me on
There's a way about that
Just keeps me going

It's too late, baby
There's no place left to go
I said, it's too late, baby
No, no, no
