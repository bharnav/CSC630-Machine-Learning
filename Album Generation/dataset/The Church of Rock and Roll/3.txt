She says, "Can I hold you?"
I'm too far for a touch
She says, "I'm so lonely"
Girl, you say that too much

There's nothing I can do
Nothing I can do
This is my last chance, baby
My last chance, baby
And I gotta see it through

This is my last chance at love
It's all I've ever dreamed of
This is my last chance at love

It's all I've ever wanted
All we've ever needed
Last chance, baby
My last chance at love

This won't be for nothing
I can promise you that
I've got to run now
The devil's calling me back

There's nothing I can do
Nothing I can do
This is my last chance, baby
My last chance, baby
And I gotta see it through

This is my last chance at love
It's all I've ever dreamed of
This is my last chance at love

It's all I've ever wanted
All we've ever needed
Last chance, baby
My last chance at love

Last chance, baby
My last chance, baby
This is my last chance at love
It's all I've ever dreamed of

This is my last chance at love
It's all I've ever dreamed of
This is my last chance at love

It's all I've ever wanted
All we've ever needed
All we've ever needed
All I've ever needed
