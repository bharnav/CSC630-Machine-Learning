Big magic woman
Oh you got me
Under your spell
You hypnotize
Me with your hips and thighs
I wear these shades
So when I stare
No one can tell

[Pre Hook]
So c'mon! (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Show me a little more (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)

[Hook]
Thats the biggest black ass I've ever seen
And I like it, I like it
Thats the biggest black ass I've ever seen
And I like it, I like it, a lot

My gangsta girl
With the wavy curl
And a sexy
Street talking slang
You mesmerize
Me and you mess with I
When you booty pop and drop it
Like it ain't no thing

[Pre Hook]

[Hook]

Thats the biggest black ass i've ever seen
And I like it, I like it
