Feelings of color are painting another
Closet inside which to hide
Like a crow on a wire, with longing
Desire, waiting for the things below to die

What a wonderful way to waste a feeling
There's gotta be some kind a way we can work it out
What a wonderful way to waste a feeling
Open up the window, let the inside out

Why are we crying?
Why are we crying girl?

Perfectly crafted, that's why it's lasted
There, inside, for so long

What a wonderful way to waste a feeling
There's gotta be some kind a way we can work it out
What a wonderful way to waste a feeling
Open up the window, let the inside out

Why are we crying?
Why are we crying girl?

Like a kite on a wire, the wind blows me higher
Higher from the ground where I used to be
