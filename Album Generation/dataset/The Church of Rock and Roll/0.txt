So what's the plan, brother man?
We're waiting on your cue
There's nothing new to listen to
We've heard it through and through
We've done your bidding the best we can
The truth is we don't give a damn

He's God! (I'm God!)
Sing it! (Ahh!)
Welcome to the Church of Rock and Roll [x6]

Hey!
Your music sucks, including us
It's time we clear our name
If all of you can feel it, too
We urge you, too, to do the same
You're all suckers, a flock of sheep
I'll be your shepherd; follow me

He's God! (I'm God!)
Yeah! (Ahh!)
Welcome to the Church of Rock and Roll [x6]
