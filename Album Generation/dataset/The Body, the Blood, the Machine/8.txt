We are just a child
We are just a child
We are wide awake
But our legs are shaking
We're unaware
We're hyper and we stare into space
With grins on our faces

So give us what we're asking for
Cause either way we're gonna take it
Our power doesn't run on nothing
We need the land you're standing on
So let's go, move it

We are old as hell
We are old and tell the children
When to kill, when to sit still
Everyone doing what we say
'Til our dying day
'Til our breath is empty

They'll give us what we're asking for
Cause either way we're gonna take it
Our power doesn't run on nothing
We need the land you're standing on
So let's go, move it
Yeah, You need to let go, move it
Yeah, we're more equal
We'll move you people off the planet
Cause goddamn we need the fuel

So, so let the beat roll over
The beat roll over
Every one in line
One in line
Let the beat roll over
The beat roll over
Every one in line
One at a time

They'll give us what we're asking for
Cause god is with us
And our god's the richest
Our power doesn't run on nothing
It runs on blood
And blood is easy to obtain
When you have no shame
When you have no shame

So let the sun fade
Let the sun fade
We'll still have light
We'll burn even brighter
We'll drain the well
Tunnel to hell
And leave the earth's surface
For the dirty and worthless

Let the beat roll over
The beat roll over
Every one in line
Every one in line

Do you think we'll cease?
Do you see a reason?
Do you think it's fair?
Do you think it's fair?
Do you think we care?
