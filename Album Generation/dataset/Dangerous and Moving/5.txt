[Verse 1]
What I thought wasn't mine
In the light
Was a one of a kind
A precious pearl
When I wanted to cry
I couldn't cause I
Wasn't allowed

[Chorus]
Gomenasai for everything
Gomenasai, I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

[Verse 2]
What I thought wasn't all
So innocent
Was a delicate doll
Of porcelain
When I wanted to call you
And ask you for help
I stopped myself

[Chorus]
Gomenasai for everything
Gomenasai, I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

[Verse 3]
What I thought was a dream
A mirage
Was as real as it seemed
A privilege
When I wanted to tell you
I made a mistake
I walked away

[Chorus]
Gomenasai, for everything
Gomenasai, gomenasai
Gomenasai
I never needed a friend
Like I do now
Gomenasai, I let you down
Gomenasai, gomenasai
Gomenasai till the end

[Outro]
I never needed a friend
Like I do now
