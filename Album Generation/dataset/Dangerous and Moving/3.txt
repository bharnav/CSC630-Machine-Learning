[Verse 1]
I complicated our lives
By falling in love with him
I complicated our lives
Now I'm losing my only friend

I don't know why
I had to try
Living my life on the other side
Now I'm so confused
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me

[Verse 2]
I started blurring the lines
'Cause I didn't care
I started crossing the line
'Cause you were never there

Nowhere to turn
No one to help
It's almost like I don't even know myself
Now I have to choose
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me
She loves me
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
He loves me, he loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
