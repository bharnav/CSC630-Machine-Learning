[Verse 1]
Can you tell me softly
How you always haunt me?
Can you help me? Hold me
Come to me now, slowly
You caress me smoothly
Calm my fears and soothe me
Move your hands across me
Take my worries from me

[Chorus]
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life to clear my conscience
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Can you fill me solely
Deeper still and wholly?
With your understanding
And your arms around me?
Can you help me? Hold me
Whisper to me softly
Move your hands across me
Take my worries from me

[Chorus]
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life to clear my conscience
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice
I will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life to clear my conscience
I will sacrifice, I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
