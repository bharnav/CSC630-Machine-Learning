[Verse 1]
And when I left you, I flew
Did you fly too?
And nakedness befell my way
Only seen in light of day

[Hook]
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want

[Verse 2]
And creativity, it soaks my soul
I asked not to be alone
You don't have to ask me for my hand
I already know where I stand

[Hook]
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want

[Verse 3]
And consequences in the future
And feel it as now
And now I can't feel the future
But I can be there for you now

[Hook]
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want
I only want what I can't have
I only need what I don't want
I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have
