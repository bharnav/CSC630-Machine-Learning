[Verse 1]
I will forget my dreams
Nothing is what it seems
I will affect you, I will protect you
From all the crazy schemes
You traded in your wings
For everything freedom brings
You never left me, you never let me
See what this feeling means

[Chorus]
Everything that you feel
Is everything that I feel
So when we dream
We shout
We shout

[Verse 2]
You say it's all complex
Passion can pass for less
We never bothered telling each other
What we were bound to guess
Will anybody care?
We could go anywhere
Going through danger, talking to strangers
Will there be someone there?

[Chorus]
Everything that you feel
Is everything that I feel
So when we dream
We shout
We shout, we shout, we shout
We shout, we shout, we shout
We shout, we shout
