[Verse 1]
Why should I welcome your domination?
Why should I listen to explanations?
I'm not pretending to make it simple
Try to be something experimental

[Chorus]
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before
Are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll forever stay your
Perfect enemy

[Verse 2]
No longer waiting
Remove illusions
No more complaining
Forget confusion
No more compassion
Not sentimental
I am now something experimental

[Chorus]
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before
Are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll forever stay your
Perfect enemy
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before
Are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll forever stay your
Perfect enemy
You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before
Are now for sale
Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll forever stay your
Perfect enemy
