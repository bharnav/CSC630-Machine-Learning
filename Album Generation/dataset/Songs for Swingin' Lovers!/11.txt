[Chorus]
Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

[Verse 1]
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee

[Verse 2]
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
And think what a year can bring

[Pre-Chorus]
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

[Chorus]
Another bride, another June
Another sunny, a sunny honeymoon
Another reason is that season
For makin' whoopee

[Verse 3]
A mess of shoes, a gang of rice
The groom is nervous that he answers twice
It's really killin' this cat so willin'
To make whoopee

[Outro]
Now he's washin' dishes with those baby clothes
He's so ambitious, man, he even sews
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee
