[Verse 1]
Everybody's hand in hand
Swingin' down the lane
Everybody's feelin' grand
Swingin' down the lane

[Verse 2]
That's the time I miss the bliss
That we might have known
Nights like this
When I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moon is on the rise
Baby I'm so blue
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes
Like we used to do

[Chorus]
When the moon is on the way
Still I'm waitin' all in vain
Should be swingin' down the lane
With you

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moon is on the rise
Baby I'm so blue
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes
Like we used to do

[Chorus]
When the moon is on the way
Still I'm waitin' all in vain
Should be swingin' down the lane
With you
