[Frank Sinatra]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know damn well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats repeats in my ear

Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Beause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear

Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Beause I've got you under my skin
And I like you under my skin
