I hate you sometimes
But i love to be your queen
You are my muse
Got me smokin nicotine

I watch you sometimes
From oh so far away
But i can't forget you
Or anything you say

You sang that song in my ear
And it tickled those tiny hairs

Love is a puzzle
Some pieces they adjoin
It's not like that with us
But i keep flipping that coin

I watch you sometimes
From oh so far away
But i can't forget you
Or anything you say

You sang that song in my ear
And it tickled those tiny hairs
