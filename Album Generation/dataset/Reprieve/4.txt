Step up and forfeit your frontal lobe
To the sexed up strobe of celebrity
Never mind that the nanoseconds in between
Are some of the darkest darkness you've ever seen

Keep your eye on my finger
And listen to the sound of my voice
Get your subliminal decree and your false security
Be all that you can be
Be all that you can be

In hospitals and schools
Airports and banks and bars
Big ones on street corners
Little ones driving by in cars
Glowing through countless
Bedroom curtains at night
That 20k tone
And that pale blue light
Saying
Daddy knows best
Yes, this is the news
In 90-second segments
Officially produced
And aired again and again and again
By the little black and white pawns
Of the network yes men
While the stars are going out
And the stripes are getting bent

Cancer, the great teacher
Has been opening schools
Downstream from every factory
Still, everywhere fools
Are squinting into microscopes
Researching cells
Trying to figure out a way
We can all live in hell
Well
Step back
Look up
You'll see i'm dimming the sun
But you won't, will you?
No, that's a good little one

Cuz daddy knows best
Yes, this is the news
In 90-second segments
Officially produced
And aired again and again and again
By the little black and white pawns
Of the network yes men
While the stars are going out
And the stripes are getting bent

The stars are going out
And the stripes are getting bent
