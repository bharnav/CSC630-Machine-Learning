I will not lie down
On the wrongful groundwork laid
While it's still a radical sound
Just to call a spade a spade
Dear friends, women and men
Please check my math once more
In the totality of all war's history
There's but one common denominator

The answer is in the intention
That lies behind the question
Put that on your standardized multiple choice
I mean, how's this supposed to look to me?
But half of divinity
Out there trying to make harmony
With only one voice

You know, i've got experience
Looking right past the obvious
And i know what is so big and so close
Is always the hardest stuff
For us to reckon with
The hardest stuff to know
Dear friends, especially the women
Tell me are you up to the task
Of turning the wheel of human history
At long last

The answer is in the intention
That lies behind the question
Put that on your standardized multiple choice
I mean, how's this supposed to look to me?
But half of divinity
Out there trying to make harmony
With only one voice

I will not lie down
On the wrongful groundwork laid
While it's still a radical sound
Just to call a spade a spade
Dear friends, women and men
What better time to face
That we've been looking for
The answer to war
In the wrong place
