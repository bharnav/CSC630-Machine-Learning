On one hand i'm walking
The way that i do
Lookin like i'm lost in thought
But i'm lookin for you
It's so subconscious
The way that i feel
Too bad my subconscious life
Is the more real

And i ain't in the best shape
That i've ever been in
But i know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been
I know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been

Some kind of anxiety
Has gotten hold of my heart
And i just wanna run home
When i feel it start
Plastic bottles of water
Sealed windows, forced air
Gazillions of cell phones
Beaming through my hair

And i ain't in the best shape
That i've ever been in
But i know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been
I know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been

I'm tossing and turning
Between sleepless dreams
I'm poised on the edge of
What it all means
So i turn my back
And i spread my arms wide
And i let myself fall in
Way deep inside

And i ain't in the best shape
That i've ever been in
But i know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been
I know where i'm going
And it ain't where i've been
