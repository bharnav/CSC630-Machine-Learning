Millennium theater
Get out there and buy that water and gas
Ramadan, orange alert
Everybody put on your gas mask
First leak it out about the president
Then stand up and shout impeachment
Pull them coattails out from under that little v.p
Before he has a chance to get in the driver's seat

Millennium spectacle
Everybody put on a show
Slip the little prince in the back door
21st century here we go
Digital whiplash
So many formats so little time
While out in tv nation
Under darkening skies
The resistance is just waiting
To be organized

Halliburton, enron
Chief justices for sale
Yucca mountain goddesses
Their tears they form a trail
Trickle down pollution
Patriarchies realign
While the ice caps melt
And new orleans bides her time
New orleans bides her time

Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to tonight's show
The millennium theater
Asks that you not smoke
Please turn off your cell phones
And forget what you think you know
