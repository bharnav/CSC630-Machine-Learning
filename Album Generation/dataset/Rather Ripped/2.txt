[Verse 1]
Stand behind his drunken amp
Stand behind his light of love
Hear him yowl his bloody tongue
Hear him yell for blood and war

[Chorus]
Do you believe in this sweet sensation
Do you believe in second chance
Do you believe in rapture babe

[Verse 2]
A terrible hit strikes today
A terrible hit for the parade
Burning eyes seek Jesus coming
Jesus comes to pave the way

[Chorus]
Do you believe in this sweet sensation
Do you believe in second chance
Do you believe in rapture babe

[Verse 3]
Can you tell me what to feel
Open up your tender soul
Can I drink your drunken mercy
Wine burns the devils whole

[Chorus]
Do you believe in this sweet sensation
Do you believe in second chance
Do you believe in rapture babe
