[Verse 1]
She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix your grave

[Chorus]
'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for you

[Verse 2]
He rolls his eyes
At the thought of paradise
But when he makes that insect sound
Then it's time girl for you to leave town

[Chorus]
'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for you

[Verse 1]
She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix your grave

[Chorus]
'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for you
