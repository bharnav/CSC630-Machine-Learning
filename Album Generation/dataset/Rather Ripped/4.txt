[Verse 1]
Hey give me hollow stimulation
It's so sleazy to be free
Let's invest in dull creation
Thrill city cheap legacy

[Chorus]
What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

[Verse 2]
Vapid signals lead me to you
A sublime spectacular dud
Safe and sound from chatter confusion
Get the picture yes it's clear as mud

[Chorus]
What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

[Verse 1]
Hey give me hollow stimulation
It's so sleazy to be free
Let's invest in dull creation
Thrill city cheap legacy

[Chorus]
What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

[Outro]
I wouldn't lead you on
Ever since your song yeah
You could have had it all
But you didn't call me
