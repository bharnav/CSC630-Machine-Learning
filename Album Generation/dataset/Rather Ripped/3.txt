[Verse 1]
Sleeping around sleeping around
What will the neighbors say
Sleeping around all over town
What will the neighbors say

[Chorus]
What you did was wrong
What did you good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight

[Verse 2]
Sleeping around sleeping around
What will the neighbors do
Sleeping around all over town
What will the neighbors do

[Chorus]
What you did was wrong
What did you good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight

[Verse 3]
Sleeping around sleeping around
What will the neighbors think
Sleeping around all over town
What will the neighbors think

[Chorus]
What you did was wrong
What did you good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight
