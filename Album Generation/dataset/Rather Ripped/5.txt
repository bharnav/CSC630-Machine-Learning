[Verse 1]
Blasted earth
Oh immersed
Gold in cave
The blondes come first

[Chorus]
I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
Where the light is green
Where the light is green

[Verse 2]
Jagged brain
Slow refrain
We love the jams
And jams run free

[Chorus]
I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
Where the light is green
Where the light is green

[Verse 2]
Jagged brain
Slow refrain
