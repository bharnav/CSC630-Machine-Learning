[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I just come by to run you over
I just come by to see you quiver
You can come, you can slip inside, babe
Killer eyes and a burnin' heart, babe

[Chorus]
Don't you know you need no other
I'm the man who loves your mother

[Verse 2]
Open up your arms to me, girl
Let me feel your wild heartbeat, girl
Sweet lips, flowers and cream
Deep in love surrender pink steam

[Chorus]
Deep in love you need no other
Deep in love your lonely lover

[Bridge]
Feel your wild heart beat
Lonely lover
Open up to me
Lonely mother
Your sweet lips on mine
Like flowers and cream
Oh killer, killer eyes
Surrender pink steam
