It's finally here
It's that special season
The day is near
You know that's the reason

And it's smelling so Christmasey
When we're smelling that Christmas tree
And all the goodies are stashed away
Waitin' for you on a silver tray

And we're feelin' so Christmasey
Like the feeling that it used to be
And I'm happy as a little kid
We're guessing where's the present's hid

Put up the lights so we can see
It's so Christmasey

It's almost time
To light up the candles
The church bells chime
It's a song of Handle's

And the music's so Christmasey
Percolatin' inside of me
Like a little bit of rock 'n' roll
Like a little bit of Chritsmas soul

And we're feelin' so Christmasey
Goin' out on a shoppin' spree
Give a present with a great big bow
To a stranger we don't even know

We'll have our fun and be carefree
'Cause it's Christmasey

Now is the time
We've waited for
Go let in the neighbors
'Cause they're knockin', so open the door

And I'm feelin' so Christmasey
Percolatin' inside of me
And it gives me such a great big lift
Makes me want to give myself a gift

And I'm feeling so Christmasey
I want someone to dance with me
Christmas caroles are understood
Let the people know we're feelin' good

It didn't snow but we all agree
It's still Christmasey

It didn't snow (it didn't snow) but we all agree
It's still (it's still) Christmasey
