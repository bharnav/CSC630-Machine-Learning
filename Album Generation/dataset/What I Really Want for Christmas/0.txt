He's the man with all the toys

Someone found a lighted house late one night
And he saw through the window a sight
A big man in a chair and little tiny men everywhere
He's the man with all the toys

Oh, how thrilled that someone must have been
And he must have been tempted to go in
He stayed out in the cold and when he left them he told
About the man with all the toys

He's the man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys

Let every heart prepare him room
Let every heart prepare him room
Let every heart prepare him room
Let every heart prepare him room
Let every heart prepare him room
