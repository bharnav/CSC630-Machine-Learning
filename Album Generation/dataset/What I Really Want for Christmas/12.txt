We wait all year long for the
And now that they're here, we'll celebrate

The bells are ringing on Christmas day
The wake up the children and they're starting to play
Look what's under the Christmas tree
All kind of goodies from Santa and me

Ding-dong, ding- dong, ding-dong day
Frosty the Snowman's melting away
Deep inside my heart there's a glow
All of a sudden, it's starting to snow

We all share the joy that comes along just once a year
Spreading so much love and bringing cheer

The bells are ringing on Christmas day
The wake up the children and they're starting to play
Look what's under the Christmas tree
All kind of goodies from Santa and me

Ding-dong, ding- dong, ding-dong day
Frosty the Snowman's melting away
Deep inside my heart there's a glow
All of a sudden, it's starting to snow

The bells are ringing on Christmas day
The wake up the children and they're starting to play
Look what's under the Christmas tree
All kind of goodies from Santa and me

Ding-dong, ding- dong, ding-dong day
Frosty the Snowman's melting away
Deep inside my heart there's a glow
All of a sudden, it's starting to snow

Ding-dong, ding- dong, ding-dong day
Frosty the Snowman's melting away
Deep inside my heart there's a glow
All of a sudden, it's starting to snow
