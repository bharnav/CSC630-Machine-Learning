The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields as they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth, it gave a great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did, both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields as they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
