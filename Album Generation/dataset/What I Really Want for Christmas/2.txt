God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings to the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

(*verse*)
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

(*verse*)
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry, gentlemen
(Comfort and joy)
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
