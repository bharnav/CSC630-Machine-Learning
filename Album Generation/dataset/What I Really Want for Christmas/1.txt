Snow's so deep, stars so bright
Hear winter wake and angels sing on Christmas night
I'll build a fire, you'll hold me tight
We'll pray for peace on Christmas night
Lift our hearts, hope to find
A world that stops to think of love at Christmas time

Children's laughter brings joy beyond our dreams
Full of hope to give, these times in which we live
Please no more lists, send no more gifts

What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time

Is peace tonight, peace for all
That season's greetings last beyond a festive fall
Santa's home, his reindeer sleep
A child's strength is their belief
Lift your hearts, hope to find
That belief that children have at Christmas time

The dying embers glow
We watch the falling snow
Lucky to be home when some are all alone
Please no more lists, send no more gifts

What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time

Is peace tonight, peace is hard
Peace is more than just a sentimental card
So be good, so be kind
Look inside your hearts at Christmas time

What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time

What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time

What I really want for Christmas
What I really want for Christmas
What I really want at Christmas time
