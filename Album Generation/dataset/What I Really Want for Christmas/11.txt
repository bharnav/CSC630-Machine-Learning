Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
In days of old lang syne

And surely you’ll be your pint-stowp
And surely I’ll be mine
We'll take a cup o’ kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
May old acquaitance be forgot
In days of old lang syne
