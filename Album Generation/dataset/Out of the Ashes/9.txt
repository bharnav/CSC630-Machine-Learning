[Verse 1]
Don't lay your bridle on my shoulder
Don't bring your bit to my mouth
Don't lay your blanket on my body
Just take your saddle and move out
Just take your saddle and move out
You were playing with my fire
You put your brand on my heart
But like a wild colt in its fury
Eye to eye we stand apart

[Chorus]
It's a long way down the canyon
Only the stars would see you fall
If you only wanted your way
I believe you should take it all
I believe you should take it all

[Verse 2]
I've been beside you for a long way
I've tried to let you have it all
But the canyon's going narrow
Seems there's room for one that's all
Seems there's room for one that's all

[Chorus]
