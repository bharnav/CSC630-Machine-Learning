[Verse 1]
Maybe you and I can't play
Maybe we won't ever be together
Maybe childish needs in me
Makes me think that I can win forever
Maybe the roads we both took
Brought us to a different vain level
I'll call this shot while it's still hot
I won't go down with one more midnight lover

[Chorus]
Starman, shine your light away from me
Starman, this won't ever, ever be
Your way (your way) with me (with me)
So just leave
You're going to have to bleed from me

[Verse 2]
I've been here once before
Took me years to know it for
What it was
I know it was
Him shining his light, turning me on
Burning me up, then leaving me to wonder
And, oh, I wondered
Oh, it ain't never going to change, no
We ain't never going to be
We ain't never going to work
You're not the same, you and me

[Chorus]
