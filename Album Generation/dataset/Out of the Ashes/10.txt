[Verse 1]
What's this feeling I'm having
What's coming over me
I'm afraid I can't recover
From what you've done to me
Without you I feel cold and lonely
Oh, my heart feels so strange
You've got me walking the wild side
Feel so strong, I feel danger

[Chorus]
These empty arms of desire, baby
Stayed open way too long
But I feel like I'm going crazy
But my love rages on, mmmm

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure you've got to heart, baby
Never seen love you make
You didn't think I'd go there
But you lead me all the way

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I will never (I will never)
I will never (I will never)
I will never (get over you)
I will never (I will never)
I will never (I will never)
(Get over you)
