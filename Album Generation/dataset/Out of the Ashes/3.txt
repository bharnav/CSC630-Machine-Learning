[Chorus 1]
If I give my heart to you, are you gonna break it
If I give my hand to you, are you gonna take it
If I give my life to you, are you gonna take it
And break it into a million crystals
Making me desperate for you, for you

[Chorus 2]
Outta the ashes, the Phoenix rises
Outta the ashes, the Phoenix rises
Outta the ashes, the Phoenix rises
Outta the ashes, the Phoenix rises

[Verse]
New beginnings are so hard to find
New beginnings are mountains to climb
Blue sky over the horizon
But the sheer cliffs of copper pierce my mind
Emerald-green rivers speak quietly
And the black nights bring stars in my eyes

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
