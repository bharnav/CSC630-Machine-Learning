[Chorus]
What are we going to call this relationship
Not quite in love and not quite it
C'mon, c'mon
Your eyes shine so bright to mine
You make me feel velvet inside
C'mon, I said, c'mon
You call me a high-stepping mama
I say you're a slow moving daddy, c'mon

[Bridge]
Can you take it to the limit and see
See about you and me

[Verse]]
Velvet and steel, velvet and steel
Velvet and steel, c'mon get real
(C'mon get real)
It's in the mix, baby
This can be fixed, baby
It's gonna get crazy
It's in the mixin', baby
It's in the mix, baby
It's in the mix, baby
It's gonna get crazy
It's in the mix, baby

[Chorus]

[Outro]
