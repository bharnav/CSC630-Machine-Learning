[Verse]
Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come
Why should my heart fell lonely and long for Heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion, a constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches over me
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me

[Chorus][x2]
I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me, He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches
I know He watches, I know He watches me
