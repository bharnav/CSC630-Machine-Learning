[Verse 1]
You took the wrong road, baby
I tried to tell you all along
You took the wrong road, baby
I tried to tell you all along
We've hit the dead end, baby
Now, there's no road at all

[Chorus]
You can pick them, baby
You can pick them, baby
You can pick them, baby
But you know it's against the law

[Verse 2]
There was the one from Memphis
There was that one from West LA
But the one from New Orleans
She tried to put you in your grave
There was the one from Texas
Lord, she made you squirm
But the one from Arizona
Left you no soul at all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
There's a rope hanging, baby
I'd like to slide you down
There's a rope hanging, baby
I'd like to slide you down
(I'd like to slide you down, baby)
Let's have a party, baby
Let's see who comes around
