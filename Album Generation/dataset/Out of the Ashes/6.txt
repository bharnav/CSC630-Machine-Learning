[Verse 1]
Oh, well, they'll stone ya when you're tryin' to be so good
Yeah, they'll stone ya just like they said they would
They'll stone ya when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 2]
Oh, now, they'll stone ya when you're walking along the street
They'll stone ya when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone ya when you're walking on the floor
And they'll stone ya when you're walking to the door

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, now they stone ya when you're at the breakfast table
Yeah, they'll stone ya when you are young and able
They'll stone ya when you're trying  to make a buck
They'll stone ya and then they'll say, good luck

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
They'll stone ya then they'll say that's the end
They'll stone ya then they'll come back again
They'll stone ya when you're riding in your car
Oh, they stone ya when you're playing your guitar

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Oh, they'll stone ya when you walk all alone
They'll stone ya when you're trying to go home
They'll stone ya when you're set down in your grave
Oh, they'll stone ya, then they'll say
Hey, you're brave

[Chorus]
