[Verse 1]
When the blood curdling scream
Of the fear in my vains
Pierces the darkness circling my brain
When the pain in my soul is too great to explain
I reach out for you, I'm calling your name

[Chorus]
Lord, please have mercy on my troubled soul
You keep me together when there's nothing to hold
Lord, please have mercy, I've nowhere to go
When the temptation is over, please carry me home

[Verse 2]
Would the jewel of deception rest in the crown
Upon the heaven, the tempter who's hand keeps me down
Living so carelessly, so easy to do
But now that I'm paying, I running to you

[Chorus]
