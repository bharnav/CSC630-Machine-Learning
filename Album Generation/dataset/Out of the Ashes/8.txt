[Verse]
So many things, so many things
So many things stand between us
Your heart and mine have touched this time
Our eyes can see us
Some bright blue autumn morning
Some winter moonlight night
You'll reach for me and I'll come
Touch me, hold me like you do
Feel me, feel you
Do you know this time
Will there be another day
Is there any place you'll say
Anytime
Anytime you want me, babe
Is all you have to say
Anytime
