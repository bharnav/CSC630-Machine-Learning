[Verse 1]
From the distance you looked so good
As I'm closer, you look better than you should
I wasn't looking until I looked in your eyes
Aah, you took me by surprise

[Chorus]
Rock me, baby
Rock me in your arms
I should know better
I know the way you charm
The way you make me feel
I've not felt before
Rock me, baby
Rock me more

[Verse 2]
From the first time I was almost there
Your hands on me were so alive
You walked into me and saw me bare
Aah, you took me by surprise

[Chorus][x3]
