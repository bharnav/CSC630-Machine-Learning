[Verse 1]
Please, could you stay a while to share my grief
It's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

[Verse 2]
Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

[Verse 3]
Doubled up inside
Take a while to shed my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted, cruel

[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
