[Verse 1]
Find a thread to pull
And we can watch it unravel
'Cause we've been living with
A ghost of summer from two years ago

[Chorus]
A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

[Verse 2]
A needle dragging thread
To form the chapters only we could know
But they will overlap
And cast a shadow on what little is left

[Chorus]
A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

[Bridge]
Find a thread to pull
And we can watch it unravel
But this is just the start
We'll find out who we are

[Chorus]
A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us
