[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, I'm so blue
Cause I'm worried over you
Oh I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you

You promised to write me
Each and every day
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away

Oh, oh
I sit by
My window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came

[Chorus]
My heart cries for
Just one little line
Anything to say you're mine

Oh, oh...

[Verse 2]
Well
I said a prayer
Every night
Hoping, hoping and praying
Someday, someday
You'd write

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
My heart cries
For one little line
Anything to say you're mine
