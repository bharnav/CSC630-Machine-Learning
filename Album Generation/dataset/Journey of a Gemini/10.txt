There is somethin between us
Whenever we look up it comes out
I go thru different emotions
And I can't quite figure it out

If I just like it
When we get down?
Or have I fallen
For u in the midst of it all?

I dunno if its lust or love (ohhh baby)
That im feelin for u
Are u feelin it too? (yeah)
I dunno but I hope its love (hope its love)
That im feelin for u girl ( girrl)

Baby im ready
To settle down
Have I been runnin
From love and its catchin up now

I dunno if its lust or love (oooh)
That im feelin for u (that im feelin for u)
Hope u feelin it too (hope ur feelin it too)
I dunno but I hope its love (hope its love)

That im feelin for u girl (girl)

I dunno if its lust or love (i dunno I dunnooo)
That im feelin for u (feelin for u)
Hope u feelin it too (baby yeah)
I dunno but I hope its love (said I hope its love baby)
That im feelin for u girl

Ive got love on my mind
Its wat I feel deep inside
When I look in ur eyes
I see that lust has turned to love
Tonight is the nite
We can make this thing right
Girl I need u in my life
Cos u gotta know that this could be love

I dunno if its lust or love
That im feelin for u
Are u feelin it too?
I dunno but I hope its love
That im feelin for u girl
X4 till end
