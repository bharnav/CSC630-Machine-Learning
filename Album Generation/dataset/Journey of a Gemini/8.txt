When I see you I go off off my mind
Set two drinks can't wait to kick this thing off
Girl I know I got to get to you before it's too late
Cause there's a lot of pimps up in this club
And I got to be the one

Let them know that I'm feeling you

Wanna get erotic do you feel me
So let's get naughty I'm feeling you
Let them know that I'm feeling you

Rocking stilleto's with those magnific toes they put
Me on think I got you but I'm waiting for that sign cause I
Got you smiling girl gotta get you out of here

So come with me. And my gangster diss so smooth so what's
The possibility you and me in a drop top fire on the clocking
To the speed cause I'mma make you see what I see
