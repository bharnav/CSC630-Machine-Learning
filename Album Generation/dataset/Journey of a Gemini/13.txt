Baby you know I love you
But you know right now, you know it’s just getting to be too much
Ooh yeah
I really don’t wanna go

Listen...
It was back in 99 I was a real nigga
Took you and your shorty in just to deal witcha
In the beginning it was rough
Cause sumtin was missing that he love
He’s always acting up
Baby I’ve had enough
Don’t need no child support cause I provided
Bought him anything that he wanted you can’t deny it
I’ve always treated him like
He’s coming between our love
What yawl got I can’t mess up

[Chorus Repeat 2x]
Maybe in another life
We can be together
Promise that next time won’t leave you ever
Maybe in another life
The sun will shine forever
With you in my life no more stormy weather

I got to walk away
Look at the big picture
A son needing his mother
Is the real issue
I’m not a selfish guy
You know I want you in my life
It’s killing me inside
Don’t wanna say goodbye
Can’t even show affection cause he don’t like it
Every time we get romantic we gotta hide it
The way we living ain't right
He’s coming between our love
What yawl got I can’t mess up

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
Listen to me lady...
I can’t come between a son and a mother
It’s unfortunate that this is over
You don’t leave me any choice
This could end up in divorce
Take a nigga straight to court
This decision is the best yeah…..
And I’m sorry it had to end this way (know what I’m talkn’ bout)
In this relationship I can not stay
I can see that this is it
It ain't nothing we can fix
Should be living for you kid
And maybe in another life

[Repeat Chorus]
