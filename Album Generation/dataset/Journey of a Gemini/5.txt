I've done my girl so wrong and I don't know what I was thinking
Now she's gone cause she was fed up with me
(this is a portrait of a woman)
Then why do we treat women so cold when we come from one
Because you wouldn't do your mother wrong
(this is a portrait of a woman)
And to the women out there struggling taking care of your kids alone
Just hold on you deserve a life of love
(this is a portrait of a woman)
Said a portrait of a woman your so beautiful la la la la la laa ooh yeah
(this is a portrait of a woman)

This is the portrait of a woman, of a woman yeah yeah yeah ooh mmm yea
(this is a portrait of a woman)

If you love them how come we can't settle down with just one
Because you wouldn't take the same abuse
(this is a portrait of a woman)
To the women if you cry almost every night cause happiness ain't inside
Just stay true cause your sun will shine again
(this is a portrait of a woman)
As I look in your picture frame girl you've been giving a wrong deal
But God loves you and you call up beautiful
(this is a portrait)

Of a woman so wonderful she plant the earth with all her seeds
And as men we should take care of them its our responsibility
So respect the one you call your love show her sensitivity
And don't be afraid to get your own or you'll end up just like me
Lost and lonely ooh yea

Said you gotta treat your woman right ooh yeah yeah yeah
(this is a portrait of a woman)
I said a portrait of a woman, of a woman yeah
Cause if she leave she ain't coming back
You better get your shit on track
(this is a portrait of a woman)
Portrait of a woman woo
Of a woman yeah, you better treat your woman right
Or she'll walk right out of your life
(this is a portrait of a woman)
Of a woman yeah
Of a woman yeah
She'll walk right out of your life
This is a portrait of a woman
