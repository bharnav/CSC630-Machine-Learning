[Verse 1:]
I remember when met you back in June
Knew you had a man, but I was diggin' you
I behaved patiently, waiting for you to come running to me (ooh yeah...)
Now we're in July, hanging everyday
Sex is on my mind, cuz you're next to me
I've been a gentleman, now it's time to let a n***a get in (ooh lady...)

[Chorus:]
Why... should I... give myself to you
I think it's too soon
So girl I'm just not your average guy
C'mon break me a piece of your apple pie
And if... I do... then tell me just what will I get from you
Oh, girl I'm a man with a hearty appetite
C'mon break me a piece and you will see tonight

[Verse 2:]
Girl it's been a while, and I'm hungry now
Know you want me to, why you holdin' out
I gonna be good to you (I wanna be good to you)
I'mma do the things your man couldn't do (lady..)
What's it gonna be, no more questionin'
Ass is tease me, patience running thin
I know you're trynna take your time
But that apple pie is bound to be mine (ooh lady...)

[Chorus:]
Why... should I... give myself to you
I think it's too soon
So girl I'm just not your average guy
C'mon break me a piece of your apple pie
And if... I do... then tell me just what will I get from you
Oh, girl I'm a man with a hearty appetite
C'mon break me a piece and you will see tonight

So tell me what do I need to do to get a taste from you
Won't you come and lay down with me and make yourself comfortable
Your booty's looking right, enough to fill my appetite
Don't put up a fight, baby let me come inside
For that apple pie
It's bound to make me lose my mind
So c'mon baby....

[Chorus:]
Why... should I... give myself to you
I think it's too soon
So girl I'm just not your average guy
C'mon break me a piece of your apple pie
And if... I do... then tell me just what will I get from you
Oh, girl I'm a man with a hearty appetite
C'mon break me a piece and you will see tonight

[Bridge:]
Break me off a piece of your apple pie girl
Break me off a piece of that apple pie girl

Break me off a piece of your apple pie girl
Break me off a piece of that apple pie girl

Said I'm taking off those clothes tonight...

[Chorus]
