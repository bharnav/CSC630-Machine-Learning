[Verse 1]
City lights shine on the harbour
Night has fallen down
Through the darkness and the shadow
I will still go on

[Chorus 1]
Long, long journey
Through the darkness
Long, long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart that's coming home?

[Verse 2]
Where the road runs through the valley
Where the river flows
I will follow every highway
To the place I know

[Chorus 1]
Long, long journey
Through the darkness
Long, long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart that's coming home?

[Chorus 2]
Long, long journey
Out of nowhere
Long, long way to go
But what are sighs
And what is sadness
To the heart that's coming home?

[Interlude]

[Chorus 1]
Long, long journey
Through the darkness
Long, long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart that's coming home?

[Chorus 2]
Long, long journey
Out of nowhere
Long, long way to go
But what are sighs
And what is sadness
To the heart that's coming home?
