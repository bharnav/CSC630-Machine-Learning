[Verse 1]
Where are you this moment?
Only in my dreams
You're missing, but you're always
A heartbeat from me

[Verse 2]
I'm lost now without you
I don't know where you are
I keep watching, I keep hoping
But time keeps us apart

[Chorus 1]
Is there a way I can find you?
Is there a sign I should know?
Is there a road I could follow
To bring you back home?

[Verse 3]
Winter lies before me
Now you're so far away
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay

[Chorus 2]
If I could be close beside you
If I could be where you are
If I could reach out and touch you
And bring you back home

[Chorus 1]
Is there a way I can find you?
Is there a sign I should know?
Is there a road I can follow
To bring you back home to me?
