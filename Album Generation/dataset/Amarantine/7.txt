[Verse 1]
Summer; when the day is over
There's a heart a little colder
Someone said goodbye
But you don't know why
Somewhere there is someone keeping
All the tears they have been weeping
Someone said goodbye
But you don't know why

[Chorus 1]
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry?
Is there a reason
You were lost although you don't know why?
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If there's a reason
I don't know why

[Verse 2]
Always looking for a meaning
All the time you keep believing
But I don't know why
You won't say goodbye
Even when the sun is shining
You don't see the silver lining
But I don't know why
You won't say goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Is there a reason
Why a broken dream can never fly?
Is there a reason
You believe and then you close your eyes?
Give me a reason
Why you hide away so much inside
If there's a reason
I don't know why

[Interlude]

[Chorus 1]
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry?
Is there a reason
You were lost although you don't know why?
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If there's a reason
I don't know why

[Interlude]
Da da-da da-da
Da da-da da-da da-da da da
Da da-da da-da
Da da-da da-da da-da da da
Da da-da da-da
Da da-da da-da da-da da da
Da da-da da-da

[Outro]
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
