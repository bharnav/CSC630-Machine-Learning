[Bridge 1:]
Capillarian
Gone away
Capillarian
Gone away

[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
It's a shattered wave
Cosmogenic cycles
Universal dreams
The unseen essence

[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Energies refreshed
Twelve years of silence
Frivolous to moments
Shake the hand of lightning

[Bridge 2]
Capillarian
Carnate
Capillarian
Carnate

[Chorus] x2
You don't have to go
Escaping from the long way
And leave us here all alone

[Verse 3: Brent Hinds]
Carve, carve out your soul
Lay it on the altar
And leave us here all alone

[Verse 4: Brent Hinds]
This river is running violence
A way to catch our breath
Rising from the mercury
We will climb to bestow our trust

[Verse 5: Brent Hinds]
Take away the anchor
Amplify the mystery
Inhale the Earth and wind
Map out the plans to our test
