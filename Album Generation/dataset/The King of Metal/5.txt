I tried to avoid falling down
A broken hearted man I fell down any way
That is when I learned it's not the falling down that counts
What counts is getting up again
When you get up it might seem like a thousand steps to take
Will impossible
Just focus on this single step forget about the rest of them
All that you do is
Just take one more step
I'm screaming in my head
Just take one more step
I'm standing up and going past the point
That I thought was the furthest I could go
You never know how tough you are
Until your life is hard and that is when you know
That is when you know that there are some things that you fight for
And some things you leave behind
Life will hit you hard and knock down and keep you there
All that you can do is
Just take one more step
I'm screaming in my head
Just take one more step
Don't count me out because I'm down and you see me on the floor
I've been here before
It's do or do not do or die I've got to get back home to you
Thats all I want to do
Sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And then I feel just like I can't go on
But not I'm dead until I'm dead and I am screaming in my head
Pick yourself back up again
And just take one more step
