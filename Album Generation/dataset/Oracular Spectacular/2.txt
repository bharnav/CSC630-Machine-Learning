[Verse 1]
This is a call to arms to live and love and sleep together
We could flood the streets with love or light or heat, whatever
Lock the parents out, cut a rug, twist and shout
Wave your hands, make it rain, the stars will rise again

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Verse 2]
In a couple of years, tides have turned from boos to cheers
And in spite of the weather, we can learn to make it together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Outro]
The youth
The youth
The youth
The youth
