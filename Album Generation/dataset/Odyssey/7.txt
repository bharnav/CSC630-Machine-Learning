When I'm lost in a tunnel of shadows and fears
With no light, only night
And I listen for kind words but nobody's here
Oh so blue, all but you

You are the one voice
That gives me my own voice
Oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
For a thirsty daughter who's finding her way
You are water, I found my oasis
I'm drinking from the fountain of dreams
You are water

You hear the melody of my song
You stop time, heal my mind
You show me struggle can make you so strong
Plant the seed, let is sleep

You are the one voice
That gives me my own voice
Oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
For a thirsty daughter, finding her way
You are water, I found my oasis
And now I've got my arms wide open
Now we've got my wishes in motion and
I want to thank you, yeah I want to thank you

Every step that you take...shows me the way

You are water on a hot summer day
For a thirsty daughter, finding her way
You are water
I found my oasis and now I've got my wishes in motion

You are water. You are water
You are water. You are water
