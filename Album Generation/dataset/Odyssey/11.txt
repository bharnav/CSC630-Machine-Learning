You know, sometimes I feel like
I gave it my hardest try
If there's anything
I lost is on the last rollercoaster ride
When I get home
This is what I say
When my baby asks “How was your day?”
I say grace
Took a rock from the garden I made here
In the back yard with a little love and some care
I come here when the world gets too crazy
I come here when I'm just feeling sad
We all need a place we can go where
You pick your dreams out of thin air
I work in this garden of faith every single day
I say grace for the blue painted sky
I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
I say grace for the love that I have found
Used to wanna be at the top of ladder
Even when you leave you just come back down
When time gets a hold of my horses
I think I'll just laugh and go for the ride
Now when I look out my window
Where I've planted my heart and my soul
It does a girl a world of good
To watch her garden grow

I say grace for the blue painted sky
I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
I say grace for the love that I have found

I've been through the hardest of seasons
Holding my heart in my hand
And every kinda thought has a reason
Now I understand…
When the roof caves in
Lets the sun shine in
Life is beautiful
Now at the end of day

I say grace for the blue painted sky
I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
I say grace for the love that I have found
