Today we took a walk up the street
We picked a flower and climbed a hill above the lake
Secret thoughts, you said aloud
We watched the faces in the clouds
Until the clouds have blown away
Were we ever somewhere else you know
It's hard to say

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that

I can't believe
Among the gold I was alone
I didn't know you, I've never seen you, or heard your name
And even now, I'm so amazed, it's like a dream
It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain
Some things are the way they are and words just can't explain

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that before

It feels like now, it feels always
And it feels like coming home

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that before
