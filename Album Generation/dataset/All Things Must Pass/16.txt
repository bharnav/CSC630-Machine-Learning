[Verse]
Let it roll across the floor
Through the hall and out the door
To the fountain of perpetual mirth
Let it roll for all it's worth
Find me where ye echo lays
Lose ye bodies in the maze
See the Lord and all the mouths he feeds

[Chorus]
Let it roll among the weeds
Let it roll

[Verse 2]
Let it roll down through the caves
Ye long walks of Coole and Shades
Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile
Handkerchiefs to match your tie

[Chorus][x2]
Let it roll, let it roll

[Verse 3]
Fools illusions everywhere
Joan and Molly sweeps the stairs
Eyes that shining full of inner light
Let it roll into the night

[Chorus][x3]
