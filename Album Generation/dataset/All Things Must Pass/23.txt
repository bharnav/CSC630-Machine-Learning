[Verse]
It's Johnny's birthday[x2]
And we would like to wish him all the very best
It's Johnny's birthday[x2]
And it's so nice to have you back to be our guest
At Johnny's birthday[x2]
We would like to wish you all what you would wish yourself
On Johnny's birthday
It's Johnny's birthday
And it's so good to have you back from off the shelf
And it's so good to have[?]
You back from off the shelf[?]
