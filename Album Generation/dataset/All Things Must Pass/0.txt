[Verse 1]
Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me roll it to you

[Chorus]
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I would have you anytime

[Verse 2]
Let me say it, let me play it
Let me lay it on you
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me grow upon you

[Chorus]
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I would have you anytime

[Verse 3]
Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
