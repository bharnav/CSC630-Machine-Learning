[Verse]
If not for you
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor
I would be sad and blue, if not for you
If not for you
Babe, the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new, if not for you

[Chorus][x2]
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love I would be nowhere at all
I would be lost, if not for you
If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you
