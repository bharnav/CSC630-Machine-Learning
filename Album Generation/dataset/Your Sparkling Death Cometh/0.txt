Dangerous lines that glow in the moonlight
I've been crossing worlds of silver seas
To numbers and colors and absolute hours
A life I lived, held down inside their arms
Now to waking night I've come to pay
All my debts they turned and tossed away
Now they drink to sparkle their mistakes
And they're burying all of the evidence
My glamorous words will catch them
Burying all of the evidence
Some thousands of eyes are watching
Now while they sleep I've got endless hours
To leap through windows flying over trees
In the waving world of polyrhythmic lines
And space to fake fictitious plans
In the waking night I've made a clamoring
While they tilted heads my faith they were questioning
Movie lines they wrap themselves up to sleep
And the creeping tune inside them spidering
