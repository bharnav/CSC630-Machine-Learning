You can see I am in shock
To catch you wearing wires underneath your heart
It was mechanical
But we were born to endless architecture
Spinning to a fault and infinitely strewn
Where you’d be ahead of your time
Cause in this place it’s beautiful
Tracing lines your flaws connect the starry skies
He is tracing lines like flashes right before your eyes
Grace comes like a thief in the night
It comes like a thief in the night
It blooms in the weak and the blind
Then they finished their machine
It’s algorithmic parts perfectly in time
And that’s how they found you
But listen you are born into a landscape
That’s glittering like water and covered by a blood
It has been bruised at the heel, the wire’s been cut
