They knew my hands were still wrapped around
What they claimed were diamonds from inside
The long hallway I'm floating down to their corridor
And at first I saw the flashes and the beams
But before I knew it I could barely breath
They looked back to see if I was following them
But I never really left at all
And they turned back to scream that I'm the terrible one
But I just finally found my heart
Beneath the construct of strange machines
They were hiding it away from reach
So betrayed them with tragic speed
My heart calls to me
