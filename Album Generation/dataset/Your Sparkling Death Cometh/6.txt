Light stings his eyes
Can't turn back now
It was so slow that they couldn't predict it
His mind is just treading in infinite space
'Cause he can't believe some mysterious chamber
Broke a dangerous leak
That turned to a storming sea it's swallowing up
That last thing that he knew of beauty
Was it all smoke and mirrors?
A man walking in the room
And sat by his son
Here are the words that are meant to be spoken
This is my purpose, of these words you should know:
Close your eyes now
This is the last strength you'll have
Remember your life; it was a brilliant color
Remember your mother; she was a glowing ember
Remember your heart; it had a Perfect Owner
Sleep now, diving up in pools
Sleep sound, leave your fears to fools
