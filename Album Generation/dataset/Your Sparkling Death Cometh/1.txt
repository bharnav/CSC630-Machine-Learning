There's a circle of tangled wires
With an endless trail into bedrooms - that connected them all
So you speak lies, speak your mind
But all these words can be dulled out with the pills they discovered
Pretend that I don't have a limit
Your body of glass and your fingers intwined stringed
They're behind your back
Can be seen
You have made a terrible plan
But I can still run
Shot across a distant outlet
Electrical lungs can't hold back a beautiful beat
That's coursing my veins
'Cause my heart's a perfect wonder
Turning pages and signing paychecks
With a stack to Heaven and back
It stands like a towering fear
While the signal just spins around us
An invisible tangling machine
With an ominous gear
You pretend that I don't have a future that you can destroy
With the touch of your hand on my hand
Like you don't have a promise that would (song says "wouldn't") be kept
So how can you reach me?
