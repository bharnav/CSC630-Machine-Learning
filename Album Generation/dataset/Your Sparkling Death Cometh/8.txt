Help! Things have shaken me
Vascular waves, tracing the same three colorings I have
But now I've just noticed this
Slow motion inside
Changing this all somehow
Calling out to take us
Life in between lines
We're wounded and terrified
Calling out to save these lonely forms and shapes
This light with angles spinning here
Worked through my lungs
And spoke out the seams with architect
Now how could I turn back?
You're formed lovely
Mysterious lines have traced you out a beautiful life
"It's poor but resonates the sound of Falling Grace"
