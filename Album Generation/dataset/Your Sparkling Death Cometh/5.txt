(When will your love unfold your life?)
From a lonely spell I felt another life
It leapt before me some dangerous grace
Believe when I say that I want to try
'Cause I've been used up and hope has run out
See me alone - This is what they wanted
To see me alone
If Your heart's an ocean, then I will drown
Beneath the waves, there will be love
I found a cavern right below my life
That time has passed through and folded inside
And now the future is a waving rise
A mysterious turn, that's telling me that - I saw the future
