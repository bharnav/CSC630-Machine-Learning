We are drifting in and out of time once again
A moment with suspended hours
All the while oblivious to casts from the grave
Some quiet poised and waiting aim
We are no more than criminals to take what we never had
And across the night there's some criminal who gives what we never had
This is the life everyone has
Dangerous in, dangerous out
So take your heart and cut some holes out, breathe in slower speeds
Let gravity take its heed
Of rhythms in a mellatronic rise and recede
A tragical note resonates
We are no more than criminals to take what we never had
No greater love comes from all we know, a Grace, like we never had
Love take hold when leaving this home
Take hold when leaving this home
But all we know are the things that float between stars and our extremities
And when we die there are holes the size of the things we fear would be left behind
