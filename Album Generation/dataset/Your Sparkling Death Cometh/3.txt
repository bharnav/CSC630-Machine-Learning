Diamnds Lyrics
Storm turns inside me like seas in the storm drains
This is not who I am
Patterns of futures that wander away in mysterious planes
Through the window
I can see you sun lit golden eyes
You got me so caught up oh my God
Arms wrap around you
It's reckless but true once you let it in
Born in the water, take quick to the trees
I want all that you are
I'm taken from the brokenness- it's telling you to start
I'm taken from the brokenness- it's telling you to start
Oh what a strange place
