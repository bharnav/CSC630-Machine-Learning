People might pass you by, but they're going to be around without you
If you might find the time then they're going to find a way without you
People might pass you by, people might pass you by

People might pass you by, so you better go and think about it
Yeah, you might give the time, but you better learn to live without it
People might pass you by, people might pass you by

Please stop leaving yourself, can you please stop leaving yourself?

Oh just wake up inside, it's a noise that passes, take some time
When you can learn to decide if the people sign to change a tide in you

People might pass you by, but there are never many ways about it
So if you're going to live a lie, the you're going to live a lie without it
People might pass you by, are you ever going to live a lie without it?
And if they sive you the time are you ever going to be around to doubt it?

Please stop leaving yourself...

Oh just wake up inside, it's a noise that passes, take some time
Oh just wake up inside when the people sing to change a tide in you

People might pass you by
