So everybody's pulling you in all directions
You don't know how much longer to take it
So you've learned how to fake it

That smile on the outside's fading fast
Like the things that you thought for sure would last
But they didn't
You know something's missing
Is it your life you're not living?

Your heart is cold, your soul is numb
You don't like who you've become
You played the game and paid the cost for long enough
So grab the reins, take the wheel
Lose what's not and keep what's real
It's not too late
Just close your eyes and feel, feel

You can't tell if you're happy or sad
Can't tell the good from bad
You're senseless
To waste your senses

Maybe stop thinking with your head
Start using your heart instead
Just try it
You just might like it
Aren't you dying to start livin'?

Your heart is cold, your soul is numb
You don't like who you've become
You played the game and paid the cost for long enough
So grab the reins, take the wheel
Lose what's not and keep what's real
It's not too late
Just close your eyes and feel, feel

Every breath that's going through you
Take each day that's given to you
To love back the ones who love you, yeah, yeah

Your heart is cold, your soul is numb
You don't like who you've become
You played the game and paid the cost for long enough
So grab the reins, take the wheel
Lose what's not and keep what's real
It's not too late, it's not too late
It's not too late
Just close your eyes and feel, feel

Your heart is cold, your soul is numb
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
You've played the game for long enough
Everybody's pulling you in all directions
