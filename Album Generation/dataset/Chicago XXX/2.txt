Caroline... Caroline

There's always people talkin'
It makes their world go round
Don't mean you have to listen
Don't let them get you down

Oh Caroline, Caroline
Everything will be just fine
Caroline, Caroline
You can work it out this time!

You know they're only jealous
They want what they can't have
(and they never will)
Don't let it get your crazy
'Cause life is just too short for that
(and that, and that, and that)

And you know it ain't easy
But girl, you gotta let it go

Oh Caroline, Caroline
Everything will be just fine
Caroline, Caroline
You can work it out this time!

You can work it out this time
You will find out about it just in time
Caroline
Make your sun come out and let it shine
Everything will be just fine, Caroline

Oh Caroline, Caroline
Everything will be just fine
Caroline, Caroline
You can work it out this time!

You will find out about it just in time
Make your sun come out and let it shine!
