Here I am
In this broken town
Missing you
Wishing you were still around

The streets are full of people, happy
Heading on their way
Why am I the only one
Who's cold on such a pretty day?

90 degrees and freezing
I'm out here on my own
I can't shake this feeling
That I'm really all alone
The sun way up there shining
But down here on the ground
It's 90 degrees and freezing

Right or wrong
This is how it is
The love that kept me warm
Well, now it's his

I remember how the heat in your eyes
Helped me find my way
Why am I the only one
Who's cold on such a pretty day
(Pretty day)

90 degrees and freezing
I'm out here on my own
I can't shake this feeling
That I'm really all alone
The sun way up there shining
But down here on the ground
It's 90 degrees and freezing

90 degrees and freezing
I'm out here on my own
I can't shake this feeling
That I'm really all alone
The sun way up there shining
But down here on the ground
It's 90 degrees and freezing
