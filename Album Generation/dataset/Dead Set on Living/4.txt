[Verse 1]
Hard drinks and nicotine
Chase that with Benzedrine
The toxic parties pumping
Through my brain and out my spleen

Gimme poison put the inside of me
I need that quick explosion
Keep me going make me feel

[Pre-Chorus]
I will never forget

[Verse 2]
Rage 'til the break of dawn
Won't stop until it's gone
There never was a problem
Nothing's broken nothingâ€™s wrong

Gimme poison put it inside me
There's nothing like forgetting
Can't contain me set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
I will never forget
I will never forget

[Chorus]
The day the doctor told me son, you're gonna die
If you continue to live like this
You've got another year at best

[Bridge]
15 years is a hard habit to quit

[Verse 3]
Cocaine and cigarettes
Stacked up with all the stress
Now mix with tons of boozing
In excess oh what a mess

Gimme poison that shit was killing me
All this for cheap excitement
Float my coffin out to sea

[Pre-Chorus]
I will never forget
I will never forget

[Chorus]
The day the doctor told me son you're gonna die
If you continue to live like this
You've got another year at best

The day the doctor told me son you're gonna die
I decided then and there to get
Dead set on living

[Outro]
Dead set on living
Dead set on life
Dead set on living
Dead set on life
