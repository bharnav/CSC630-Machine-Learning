Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one
We still hold on

Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

It is done, I'll see you there
I know you're well prepared
Put aside all your fears
Jah will answer all your prayers
My team that no one cares
Been working hard for years
Keep climbing up the stairs
Gotta know that you are ready there

Blood, sweat and the tears now
None of them can take your shares now
Enemies better be aware now
Champions got a lot to bare now
I'ma tell you this I'ma swear now
I are the tiger I got the stair now
Carry on until we see the sun
We're holding on

Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one
We still hold on

Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now

All the broke guys know
Be the strongest bit
All that you know
Is that the road is steep
Pain and trouble and try a long grief
But you must soak cause you must worry
Hard times will never get you beat
And you never will get defeat
From your old and strong concrete
Do the work, cause talk is cheap

Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one
We still hold on

Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now

Oho, oho, oho, oho
Hold on

Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one
We still hold on

Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now
