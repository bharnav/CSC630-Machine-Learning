I'm on a high and I don't even know why
I'm punishing myself with all your innocent lies
You're ready now to forget what we have
You better seal it tight before the memories go bad

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hand
Sold down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me, for girl like me

It's getting late and I pretend I'm asleep
I'm planning my revenge as you silently creep
I I I I I I... I heard you're leaving and I'll never know why

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hand
Sold down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me, for girl like me

I heard you're leaving and I'll never know why

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hand
Sold down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me, for girl like me
