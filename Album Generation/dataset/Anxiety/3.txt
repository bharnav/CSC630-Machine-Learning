In my bed I dream at night
About a man who couldn't see
He took my hand and held it tight
He said what will people think of me

Sit tight one or the other will win
Cool hand no time for leaving we're in
I think I'm dreaming
What will people think of me

You'll be my vaccine yeah
And I will be your inbetweener
We'll wake up happy yeah
From all our dreams, all our dreams

You'll be my vaccine yeah
And I will be your inbetweener
We'll wake up happy yeah
From all our dreams, all our dreams

Counting sheep past 2 AM
Hoping you will comfort me
But still the man he sits and waits
To say what will people think of me

You'll be my vaccine yeah
And I will be your inbetweener
We'll wake up happy yeah
From all our dreams, all our dreams

You'll be my vaccine yeah
And I will be your inbetweener
We'll wake up happy yeah
From all our dreams, all our dreams

From all our dreams, all our dreams
From all our dreams, all our dreams
From all our dreams, all our dreams
From all our dreams, all our dreams
