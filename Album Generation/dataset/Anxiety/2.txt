[Verse 1]
Time is never easy when you’re alone, oh, oh, oh
Your mother, she always told you to hold your own, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
Cause this is real life

[Chorus]
On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white and blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white and blue for you

[Verse 2]
Life inside your head has come undone, oh, oh, oh
Your slow descent to madness has just begun, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
Cause this is real life

[Chorus]
On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white and blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white and blue for you

[Bridge]
Waking from a strange dream
Spinning cause you had too much last night
No communication
Wondering if you’ll ever feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]
But this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
Cause this is real life

[Chorus]
On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white and blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white and blue for you
