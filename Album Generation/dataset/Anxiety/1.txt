I, want to see
What you, what you can be
You, you make it easy
For me, to want to know you

I can't pretend to hate you
'cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I'll run and say...

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you'll come around and
Take me on a Sunday drive

Wait, till the end
Who, will you be then

See, what I can do
With this life, that was made for two

I can't pretend to hate you
'cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I'll run and say...

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you'll come around and
Take me on a Sunday drive

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you'll come around and
Take me on a Sunday drive

I can't pretend to hate you
'cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I'll run and say...

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you'll come around and
Take me on a Sunday drive
