Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea yea

In the winter, if you listen
You can hear my heart beating faster
It’s another cold December
Feeling homesick, waiting for summer time

‘Cause you know I am lone haves
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Self destruction, self obsession
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea yea

After midnight, when I’m anxious
Close the room, is all closing in on me
You were always right beside me
Help in silence my insecurity

‘Cause you know I am lone haves
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Self destruction, self obsession
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea yea

‘Cause you know I am lone haves
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Self destruction, self obsession
Vanity yea yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea yea

Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea
Vanity vanity vanity yea yea yea yea
