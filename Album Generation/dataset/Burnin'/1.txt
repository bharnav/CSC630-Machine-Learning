Hear the children cryin'
But I know they cry not in vain
Now the times are changin';
Love has come to bloom again

Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops
But the sweat from man's brow;
The substance from our spine
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time:
Hallelujah time!

Yes, you can hear the children singing: Hallelujah time!
As they go singing by and by: Hallelujah time!
Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning
Hallelujah time! Let them sing; don't let them cry

Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around
Over hills and valleys
They are everywhere to be found
But though we bear our burdens now
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough

Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree

Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time! Yes, as they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time! Oh "hallelujah" singing in the morning
Let them sing; never let them cry
Hallelujah time! "Hallelujah" singin' in the morning
