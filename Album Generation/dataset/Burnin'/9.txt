Hear the words of the rasta man, say
Babylon throne gone down, gone down
Babylon throne gone down

Said, I hear the words of the higher man say
Babylon throne gone down, gone down
Babylon throne gone down

And I hear the angel with the seven seals, sayin, sayin, yeah, yeah, yeah
Babylon throne gone down, gone down
Babylon throne gone down

I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home
I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home
One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home

One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home
One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home

I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home
I say fly away to Zion, fly away home
One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home

Fly away home, fly away home
Fly away home, fly away home
