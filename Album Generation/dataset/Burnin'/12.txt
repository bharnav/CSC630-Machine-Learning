The man oppressed will seem to do the worst
But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes from not burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

While oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascends
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
There's no rest in the west, so to the east he goes, to the east he goes
Where he can find peace of mind, oh
