[Verse 1]
What your hands do
It is your own eyes that have seen
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean
It's your own conscience
That is going to remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is going to judge

[Chorus]
Be not selfish in your doings
Pass it on
Help your brothers in their needs
Pass it on
Live for yourself and you will live in vain
Live for others, you will live again
In the kingdom of Jah men shall reign
Pass it on

[Verse 2]
What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light
We are not here to judge what is good from bad
But to do the things that are right
On a hot, sunny day
Follow the shadows for rescue
But as the day grows old
I know the sun is gonna find you

[Chorus]
