[Verse 1]
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?
I feel some heat is on my back

[Hook]
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
(He say)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands, the life you save could be your own
You're preaching about my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
Go!
Go!
Go!
Aaow!

[Hook]
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket
I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
