[Verse 1]
Are you ready for a real good time
Are you ready for a real good treat
There'll be so much dancing, singing
I let you fall into me

[Chorus]
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey

[Verse 2]
If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
I’ll be so proud if you let me love you girl
Let me love you for a little while

[Chorus]
Don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey
Oho yeah yeah
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah

[Verse 3]
Now she started finger popping to the beat
So I said let’s get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No no don't mess around with me
I ain't  playing

[Chorus]
Don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around  (with me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey

So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (with me) hey hey

Listen to me
