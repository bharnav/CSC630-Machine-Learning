[Intro]
Aaow!-hoo hoo!

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you talking 'bout baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walking begging back mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain’t no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!
Just stop dogging me around (just stop dogging me)

[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of making me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walking, begging, I ain’t loving you
Don't you get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Pre-Chorus]
(There's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing baby? Don't you know
(There's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!
Just stop dogging me

Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone-stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Outro]
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't, I, aow!
Hee hee!
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it
