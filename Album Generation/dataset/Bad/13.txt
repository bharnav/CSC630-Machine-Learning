[Verse 1]
You're the one that I adore you
Everyone they don't know me
Tell me things they all believe, I do
All the things I want to say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Uh, uh, uh, baby

Yesterday is when I felt down
And you save my faith off the ground
And you have to say you looked at me
All they say, I do
That's right, I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I'm in my

[Verse 2]
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I want to know you
Feel the vibe cause I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Uh, uh, uh, no

Yesterday when I felt down I start
Try to make [?] I was around and y'know
Life is just a thing you donâ€™t
Pass the way I do
Because I want to be

Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I'm in my (day, alright)

Oh, ah
Alright
Ah ah
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Yesterday is when I felt down
I start try to make it look like I was around
And you  try to make a way to see, what it is I do
Because I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
(Free like the wind babe)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
To feel letting my hair blow
(I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Take my time wherever I go)
I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh, my, my)
To feel letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blow
(You'll be free, now)
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I want to be free)
To feel letting my hair blow
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
(Ho!)

I've got to be free, baby!

[Laughing]

"Ronny, you're so silly"
