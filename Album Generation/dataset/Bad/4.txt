[Intro: Stevie Wonder (Michael Jackson)]
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Nah!
(Hoo-hoo! Dancin'-hee!
Doggone lover!)
C'mon boy

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe (hee!)
There's something I would sure appreciate...(If you can keep a secret)

[Refrain - Michael]
Baby loves me
But she never shows
She cares
(No, you won't see her kiss
And hug me)
Baby loves me
No she acts like I'm
Not there
(That doesn't mean she
Doesn't love me-ooo)

[Chorus - Michael]
If They Ask Her
Tell 'Em That We're
Just Good Friends
Dah! Chika-Chika-Chika-Ah!
Just Good Friends
Ah! Chika-Chika-Ah! Ooo
(Doot-Do-Do-Doo, Hee! Aaow!)
Just Good Friends

[Verse 2 - Stevie Wonder]
You Better Take Advice
Never Trust First Impressions
I Tried To Hide This Affair
From Their Suspicions
So Even If She's Asking You
To Stay
You Better Know Where
You Stand
(You Better Know Where
You Stand)

[Refrain - Stevie (Michael)]
Baby Loves Me
Though She Never Shows
She Cares
(No, You Won't See Her Kiss
And Hug Me)
My Baby Loves Me
Though She Acts Like I'm
Not There
(That Doesn't Mean She
Doesn't Love Me-Ooo)

[Chorus - Stevie]
Now If They Ask You
Jus' Tell 'Em That We're
Just Good Friends
Yes Just Good Friends
(Just Good Friends)
Root-Do-Do-Do
(Doot-Do-Do-Do)
Just Good Friends

[Bridge - Michael (Stevie)]
Listen Up, Hee
We've Got A Problem Here
(I Can See The Signs)
I Guess The Lady
Is Still Making Up
Her Mind (Her Mind)
Say We're Just Good Friends (Ohhh!)

[Refrain - Stevie (Michael)]
Baby Loves Me
Though She Never Shows
She Cares
No, You Won't See Her Kiss
And Hug Me (Just Good Friends)
(My Baby Loves Me
Though She Acts Like I'm
Not There
You Doggone Lover, Hee!)
Aaow!
Don't You Wanna Know?

[Outro - Stevie (Michael)]
Baby Loves Me
Though She Never Shows
She Cares (Hee! Hee!)
She Doesn't Kiss And Hug Me (Just Good Friends)
(My Baby Loves Me
She Love Me, She Love Me
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!)
My Baby Loves Me, Baby
My Baby's Gon' Stay There
My Baby Loves Me
Baby Loves Me, Baby Loves Me, Ooh-ooh-ooh!
(My Baby Loves Me
She Love Me, She Love Me
She Loves Me, Hee! Hoo! Hoo-hoo!)
You might gon' try to get her, I'm not gonna give up like that
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na, Ohhh Yeah! (Just Good Friends)
Baby Love Me, Don't She? Oh! (Oh!)
Don't Even Try It! (Hee-Hee)
