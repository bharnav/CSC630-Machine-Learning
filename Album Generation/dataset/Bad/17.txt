[Verse 1]
Our love's in motion
Give me a notion cause
You know we'll never part
Our love goodbye

I love in season
Give me a reason cause
You know we'll never part
Our love goodbye

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it

[Chorus][x2]
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Going to stay
Love today

[Verse 2]
I love a notion
Give me a motion cause
You know we'll never see
The thing you see

I love a reason
Give me a treason cause
You know we'll never part
I love so hard

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
(I'll give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it

[Chorus][x4]

Love is here to stay

Alone at last
I give you my heart
(I give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
[Michael (sample)]
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you girl
Make me fly away
