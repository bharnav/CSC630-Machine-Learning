[Verse 1]
There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And after be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And after we all did?

She told me she forgiving me
A lifetime Love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing to keep from feeling blue

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

[Verse 2]
Here I am so all alone
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t explain, I’m all alone
You used to love me
I feel I’m your blue

They told me you should sing a song, of happy when your feeling blue
I’m singing for so very long
Still crying, tell me what should I do

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)


[Verse 3]
She told me she forgiving me
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing crying helplessly
But I’m keep singing

[Chorus]
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

(Woo)

[Chorus]
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada daa (That’s why I want to be free)
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
Come on take me please
(Set me free)

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Woo, Woo, Woo)
Tschada dada dada daa (Woo I, Oh)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

(Woo) (Woo)
