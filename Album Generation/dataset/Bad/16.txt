[Intro]
(Why don't you give me some time)
(Won't you give me some time)

[Verse 1]
Pretty baby
Kisses for your loving
I really get it when you're
Next to me yeah yeah
I'm so excited how you
Give me all your loving
I got it coming and it's ecstasy

Streetwalking baby

Cause every day I watch you
Paint the town so pretty
I see you coming in and off
On my thought yeah yeah
You don't believe me then
You can ask my brother
Cause every day at six
Home alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Because
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I want you
Baby come love me
Baby I need you
You're so satisfying

[Verse 2]
I hear you walking
Cause your body's talking to me
I chase you every step of the way yeah yeah
An invitation to some
Faraway hot island
If I can show you baby
Home with me

[Chorus]
You see I never met a girl
Just like you
Come so easy
Don't you break my heart
Cause I love you

You see I never met a girl
Just like you
Come so easy
Don't you break my heart
Cause I love you

Streetwalking baby

(Why don't you give me some time)
(Won't you give me some time)
(Why don't you give me some time)
(Won't you give me some time)

[Verse 3]
I have to tell you
That you give me strong hot fever
My every thought is you
And that's a fact yeah yeah
I'd like to take you places
How about New York City
Or Paris, France
What do you think of that

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
You see I never met a girl
Just like you
Come so easy
Don't you break my heart
Cause I love you

[Verse 4]
You see I never met a girl
Just like you
Come so easy
Don't you break my heart
Cause I love you

Streetwalking baby
I got it coming baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I want you
Baby come love me
Love me baby
Got to have some loving
Got to make you mine
Got to give some loving
Going to give you loving
Make you mine
Got to get your love
Got to give some love
Got to make somebody

[Chorus]
You see I never met a girl
Just like you
Come so easy
Don't you break my heart
Cause I love you
