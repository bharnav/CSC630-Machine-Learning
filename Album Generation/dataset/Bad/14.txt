[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way that things could have been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy had turned to pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't you feelin' no pain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feeling no pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

[Verse 2]
I am a cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine”
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move

[Pre-Chorus]
My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feeling no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling this way boy

[Verse 3]
I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really started taking pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wondering where have you been?
I feel the envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And then get a taste of my blues

[Chorus]
It’s the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feeling this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling no pain boy
