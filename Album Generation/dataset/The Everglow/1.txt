[Verse 1]
Remembering everything
About my world and when you came
Wondering, the change you’d bring
Means nothing else would be the same

[Chorus]
Did you know what you were doing, did you know?
Did you know how you would move me?
Well, I don’t really think so
But the night came down and swept us away
And the stars they seemed
To paint the most elaborate scene today

[Verse 2]
How could we know? That song, this show
We'd learn so much about ourselves
From Toledo to Tokyo
The words were scribed on every page
And now there’s books up on our shelves

[Chorus]
Did you know how you would move us, did you know?
When the lights first came upon us
And we saw The Everglow
And the moment's magic swept us away
And the young man's dream was almost seen so plain

[Bridge]
When was the night
That showed us the sign?
Revealed in the sky, to leave all behind
But where to begin?
Throwing caution to the wind
We reached for the stars
Everything was now ours

[Chorus]
Did you know how you would move me, did you know?
Did you know how you would move me?
Well, I don’t even think so
But the moment's magic swept us away
And it’s so close, but we’re so far away
It’s so close, but we’re so far away
