[Verse 1]
The sun was barely coming up
My heart was all but slowing down
But I could barely make out the sound
It was my personal symphony
Striking the chords for only me
There was a coursing all through my veins
Another chance to get away, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Until this empty place is filled
I'll keep pretending

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait, knock me down and I'll get up again
Oh! Pain: a remedy that can erase your sting
I'll keep holding and I'll keep trying
To feel this fight and it's slowly dying now
But I feel painless

[Verse 2]
The days and nights blend into one
But one more night was all I need
Another chord from the symphony
To float above the world for now
To lose control is bliss somehow
And wring the color from the gray
Another chance to get away, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Until this empty place is filled
I'll keep pretending

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait, knock me down and I'll get up again
Oh! Pain: a remedy that can erase your sting
I'll keep holding and I'll keep trying
To feel this fight and it's slowly dying now
But I feel painless

[Bridge]
All these reckless nights have left me spinning out of control
Is there not a cure for sorrow?
All these fading lights has made me search for something more
Will there be a new tomorrow?

[Pre-Chorus]
Until this empty place is filled
I'll keep pretending

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait, knock me down and I'll get up again
Oh! Pain: a remedy that can erase your sting
I'll keep holding and I'll keep trying tonight
Hey! Wait, knock me down and I'll get up again
Oh! Pain: a remedy that can erase your sting
I'll keep holding and I'll keep trying
To feel this fight and it's slowly dying now
But I feel painless
