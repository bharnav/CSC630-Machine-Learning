[Verse 1]
"It's magic", she says to me
My hand to her waist, she approaches sweetly
It's enough when I see that look in her eyes
It's enough for me to paralyze

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown

[Verse 2]
"It's tragic", she says to me
A song in the air, we're together floating
What I miss everyday since our goodbye
Was enough for me to realize

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Is it ever going to come?
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown

[Bridge]
So take care what you wish for, for it may come true
But that September sky, how it whispered "I love you"
But I couldn't take it any longer, no I couldn't stand
But the nights brought sparks and the sparks brought flames
And you had to be sure this wasn't one of those games
But I'm going to show you if you could just give me tonight
Tonight...

[Verse 3]
"It's fragile", she says to me
The hair in her eyes, she removes it smiling
There's a wound that I know this song could mend
A step in time for us will never end

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Is it ever gonna come?
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good, being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Is it ever gonna come?
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good being under the gun
Woah, I'm waiting for the breakdown

[Hook]
I'm waiting, for the breakdown
I'm waiting, for the comedown
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the breakdown I'm floating weightless
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the comedown here comes the breakdown
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the breakdown I'm floating weightless
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the comedown here comes the breakdown
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the breakdown I'm floating weightless
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the comedown here comes the breakdown
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the breakdown I'm floating weightless
I'm waiting she says it's magic
For the comedown here comes the breakdown
