[Verse 1]
Here's a night and it shines
And it calls us on and on
So be here by my side and watch the stars
They're ours
Make a wish or just take charge
The moment comes, get lost and go far

[Chorus]
I think that we've got what it takes
To get this heart start beating again
So take it all the way
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
So just let go and fall into it

[Verse 2]
We began, breathe it in
Here's our chance to go for something
So this is where we win
And take the game, no blame
There's a neon light inside that shines
And tearing down the walls in the way

[Chorus]
I think that we've got what it takes
To get this heart start beating again
So take it all the way
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
Deep inside we both know that
Everything's hanging on this moment
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
So just let go and fall into it

[Bridge]
It's cold inside but deep in the night
The light is bright enough to save the weakest ones
But you're in the running
Oh don't you give up, or fade away

[Chorus]
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
Whoa
So just let go and fall into it
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
Deep inside we both know that
Everything's hanging on this moment
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
Every action has a reaction
Figure it out and make it happen
Whoa
And our hearts are on The Everglow
So just let go and fall into it
