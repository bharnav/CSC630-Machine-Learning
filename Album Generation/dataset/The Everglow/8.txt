[Verse 1]
We made plans to be unbreakable
Love was all we knew
No insurance for the unthinkable
Blindly get us through
We've been searching for a lifetime
Short as it may seem
Riding on the fumes that spark us
While igniting dreams

[Chorus]
Mistakes we knew we were making
Mistakes we knew we were making
Don't think about chances we're taking
Mistakes we knew...
Do da na na na
Do da na na na na na na na
Do da na na na
Do da na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
Driving in the rain to the hospital
Quiet makes it tense
What at once just seemed the impossible
Now makes perfect sense
We held hands to face the uncomfortable cold
And lonely room
Magazines and empty distractions
Barely got us through

[Chorus]
Mistakes we knew we were making
Mistakes we knew we were making
Don't think about chances we're taking
Mistakes we knew...
Do da na na na
Do da na na na na na na na
Do da na na na
Do da na na na na na na na

[Bridge]
And when we try to think of the life inside
We found ourselves looking at the world through new eyes

[Verse 3]
What can now be said?
Oh, little one on the other side
Dance until the band stops playing
Sing with all your might

[Chorus]
Mistakes we knew we were making
Mistakes we knew we were making
Don't think about chances we're taking
Don't think about rules we were breaking
Mistakes we knew...

[Outro]
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
The list goes on and on
