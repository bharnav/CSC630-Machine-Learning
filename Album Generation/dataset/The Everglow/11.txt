[Verse 1]
Drowning just as fast as I can
But don't throw me a line
Don't reach out your hand
Cause I'm on the brink of something beautiful
And I want to sing about it
But I don't know where to begin
Write a letter
But the words don't come out right
Try and explain how nobody can do me like
You don't understand how helpless I can get
Since the day that we met
Oh can you feel it yet?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never been more perfect being alive
I've never been so satisfied
Oh, Oh, Oh

[Chorus]
I could feel something different from the first time
Heaven made sense
And all the words rhymed
No chance in stopping now
I'm taking it all
And now I'm caught in the air
It's a good glide
Pass it up, wouldn't dare
Oh, What a wild ride
I remember being ready
And waiting to fall
Just like I did tonight

[Verse 2]
Spinning around and around
Until my left was my right
And up became down
With just one look
You knocked me off of my feet
So unable to speak
Oh how you made me weak
Though it was a while ago
I still can recall
That moment, so ready
And waiting to fall
Can you take me back in time
Remembering when
You captured my heart
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never been more perfect being alive
I've never been so satisfied
Oh, Oh, Oh

[Chorus]
I could feel something different from the first time
Heaven made sense
And all the words rhymed
No chance in stopping now
I'm taking it all
And now I'm caught in the air
It's a good glide
Pass it up, wouldn't dare
Oh, What a wild ride
I remember being ready
And waiting to fall
Just like I did tonight

[Bridge]
Ready and Waiting to fall

[Chorus]
I could feel something different from the first time
Heaven made sense
And all the words rhymed
No chance in stopping now
I'm taking it all
And now I'm caught in the air
It's a good glide
Pass it up, wouldn't dare
Oh, What a wild ride
I remember being ready
And waiting to fall
Just like I did tonight
