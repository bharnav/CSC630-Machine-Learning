[Verse 1]
Love, it's the wave I ride
That won't ever reach the shore
Overwhelmed by the tide
And wanting nothing more tonight
Than to take this time
And make it all mine
It's coming around again

[Chorus]
Every now and again sometimes
I get lost on the wind of a dream
The air gets clean and the seas get wide
And I can do anything
The pain it won't even cross my mind
There is wonder in everything
The rope gets loose and the chains unbind
And I can do anything

[Verse 2]
Hope, it's the light that strikes
That burns inside of me
It's a blinding light
But somehow I can see again
When I've lost my way
It's becoming very clear
And it's coming around again

[Chorus]
Every now and again sometimes
I get lost on the wind of a dream
The air gets clean and the seas get wide
And I can do anything
The pain it won't even cross my mind
There is wonder in everything
The rope gets loose and the chains unbind
And I can do anything

[Bridge]
Somewhere between the darkest and the light
My spirit takes to fly
The colors fill the sky
And I am free, oh oh
It's coming around again
It's coming around again
It's coming around again

[Chorus]
Every now and again sometimes
I get lost on the wind of a dream
The air gets clean and the seas get wide
And I can do anything
The pain it won't even cross my mind
There is wonder in everything
The rope gets loose and the chains unbind
And I can do anything
Every now and again sometime
I get lost on the wind of a dream
The rope gets loose, the chains unbind
And I can do anything
