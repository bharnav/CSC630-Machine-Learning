[Verse 1]
Wasted time...
I cannot say that I was ready for this, but
When worlds collide
And all that I have is all that I want
The words seem to flow and the thoughts, they keep running
And all that I have is yours;
All that I am is yours
Oh...

[Verse 2]
Painted skies...
I've seen so many that cannot compare to
Your ocean eyes
The pictures you took that cover your room
And it was just like the sun, but more like the moon
A light that can reach it all
So now I'm branded for taking the fall
Oh...

[Bridge]
So when you say, "forever,"
Can't you see?
You've already captured me

[Outro]
