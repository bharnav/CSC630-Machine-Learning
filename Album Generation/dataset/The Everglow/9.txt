[Verse 1]
Hey
The world is ending, Don't you even know?
Well how did evolution get so slow?
The grass don't even grow
Say
Your body telling throw it all away
And hope it never gets to you too late
This plan is gonna blow

[Chorus]
Everything is better
And everything is right
And everything comes together
And everything's done tonight
If you cover me
But the music's much too loud
To hear this alarm sound
Too loud, will you cover me?
But the emptiness I've found
Can't keep me on the ground
The ground, can you cover me?

[Verse 2]
Hey
What's the point in trying to get away?
The never-ending search to find your escape
It's gonna leave you cold

[Chorus]
Everything is better
And everything is right
And everything comes together
And everything starts tonight
If you come with me
But the music's much too loud
To hear this alarm sound
Too loud, will you cover me?
But the emptiness I've found
Can't keep me on the ground
The ground, can you cover me?

[Bridge]
This is the last breath I, I think I'll ever take
This is the last move I, I think I'll ever make
Will there be a chance now to figure this out?
And to be free tonight

[Chorus]
But the music's much too loud
To hear this alarm sound
Too loud, will you cover me?
But the emptiness I've found
Can't keep me on the ground
The ground, can you cover me
But the music's much too loud
To hear this alarm sound
Too loud, will you cover me?
