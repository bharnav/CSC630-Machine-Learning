[Verse 1]
Are you getting tired?
I think we've gone and lost the fire
But I don't want to fight anymore
I've had enough of this town
I can see the signs
And I can read between the lines
But I don't know what we were fighting for
I'm just trying to break out

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on

[Verse 2]
You put your nets out
But still you chose to do without
The only way to catch the butterfly
Is never waiting for the wings and
As seasons bring change
And as the seconds fade away
I still don’t know why we were holding on
But I’m still trying to break out

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on

[Bridge]
Should have known better than to listen
When the dreams and the words started falling apart
I should have known
Would have hit the ground running
Did you think that night would possess us?
Take us over like the rain that's falling down?
Did you notice when the clock stopped running, running, running, running?

[Verse 3]
This is the countdown
You see, our time is running out
I tried to stay above the water line
But never taking off the weights that
Keep us stuck here
In the comfort and the fear
I'll never know what we were fighting for
But I'm still looking to break out

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something
I've been sitting for too long
I've been waiting, but oh, tonight
This one last try goes on and on and on
