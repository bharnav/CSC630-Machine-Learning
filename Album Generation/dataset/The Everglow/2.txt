[Verse 1]
Two days and I've not slept a wink
These thoughts that I've been thinking
This is the mark I aim to miss
Again
You toss and turn, I lie awake
Who knows what I've been drinking
Another cheap, meaningless kiss
To give

[Pre-Chorus]
From the beginning
Dulled down and lost with all its charm
I just want to wake up, wake up in someone's-

[Chorus]
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up

[Verse 2]
Six days and I can see the same
Brown eyes in this reflection
Is this the man you say I'll be?
Become
You toss and turn, I lie awake
Into the sand we're sinking
Holding us back from breathing free
I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
From the beginning
Dulled down and lost with all its charm
I just wanna wake up, wake up in someone's-

[Chorus]
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up

[Bridge]
More than words, keep to yourself
Like a curse, fares thee well
One man came, one truth to tell
All this blame hammers your way to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a feeling it’s not the safest place to start
This heavy breathing
It seems we’re better off breaking hearts
It's in the beginning, dulled down and lost with all its charm
I just want to wake up, wake up in someone's-

[Chorus]
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up
I just want to wake up in someone else's arms
