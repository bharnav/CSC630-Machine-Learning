The first degree was a riot
We're making sure
My lesson's learned
I'm not ashamed but I'm trying
I've come to expect the standards you have set

Tell me just how dangerous is second best
You've settled for less and I'm sure you'll settle again

There's no stopping me
I'm gunning you down (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this
I'm gunning you down (Does this make you feel safe)

The closer that I look is just the further that you get
Already stubborn skin thickens
In attempt to understand
Understand

There's no stopping me
I'm gunning you down  (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this
I'm gunning you down (Does this make you feel safe)

I got tired (got tired) of waiting When (of waiting)
The guilt subsides, the night begins
I know it's not what you deserve

(Guitar Solo)

Came as a gift from a good friend (a good friend)
That disapproves (but understands)
That you represent
And actively encourage
All of my worst habits
They all are
Proof that we're both capable of the most terrible things
Don't test me

There's no stopping me
I'm gunning you down (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this
I'm gunning you down (does this make you feel safe)

You got tired (got tired) of waiting when (of waiting)
The guilt subsides (still waiting)
Go up against
I know it's not what you deserve

You got tired (got tired) of waiting when (of waiting)
The guilt subsides (still waiting)
Go up against
I know it's not what you deserve

How dangerous is second best?
(You've settled for less)
Well I know it's not what you deserve (It’s not what you deserve)
I know it’s not what you deserve (I know it’s not what you deserve)
