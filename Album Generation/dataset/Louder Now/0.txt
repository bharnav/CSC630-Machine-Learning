And then you said a little more
About your dreams like that was my call (my call)
If you would only listen
Bypass everything and
Went straight for the neck

I study
We're studied
Up nightly
Dragged you out into the street
Before you buckled at your knees (buckled at your knees)

Whats it feel like to be a ghost?
(louder now, louder now)
Whats it feel like to be a ghost?
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)

This is quick but not quite painless
It sits perched on your arm
Tacky and irrelevant, so what?
A permanent reminder that
Oh Christ

I study
We're studied
Up nightly
Dragged you out into the street
Before you buckled at your knees (buckle)

Whats it feel like to be a ghost?
(louder now, louder now)
So whats it feel like to be a ghost?
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)

I said so look closely there might be something you'd like
What was it like
Oh and I...
Look so close its been months who knows if I
Will get this right
Oh and I..
Look so closely there might be something you'd like
What was it like
Oh and I...

So whats it feel like to be a ghost?
(louder now, louder now)
Whats it feel like to be a ghost?
Are up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well are you up for, are you up for..)
