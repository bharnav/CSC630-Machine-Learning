I'm so sick and tired of the shit on the radio
And MTV, they only play the same thing
No matter where I go
I see Ashanti in the video
I want some thing more

We are in need of a musical ReVoLuTioN!
We are in need of....

How can you make your way through the world today
When everybody is so angry?
And what we HEAR affects our HEARTS...
There's got to be a better way to communicate
So show your LOVE not hate

We are in need of a musical ReVoLuTioN!
(we're so tired of the same old)
We are in need of some spiritual evolution
(we're so tired of the same old, same old)

We are in need of love
We are in need of love

I'm calling, calling, I'm calling out
Calling you
Doesn't anybody wanna do something new?

I'm calling all creators in the movement
It's time to offer a solution to the dilution of what we love
And the greats would be so disappointed
'Cause we've sold our souls for what we don't own anymore...

We are in need of LOVE
Lets start a musical ReVoLuTioN!
(we're so tired of the same old)
We are in need of some lyrical evolution
(we're so tired of the same old, same old)

I'm so sick and tired of the SHIT on the radio
And MTV they only play the same thing
No matter where I go
I see Ashanti in the video
I want something
'Cause I'm sick and tired of the shit on the radio
And MTV they only play the same thing
No matter where I go
I see Britney on my video screen
I WANT SOMETHING MORE

Lets start a musical ReVoLuTioN!
I want something more
Lets start a musical ReVoLuTioN

Tell me why....
A grown man can RAPE a little girl
But we STILL hear his SHIT on the radio
A grown-ass man can videotape a little girl
But we still see his mug up on our video screens?

I want something more......
I want something
