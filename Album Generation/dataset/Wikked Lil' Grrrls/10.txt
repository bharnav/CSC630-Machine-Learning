[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
And some might say we're
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
Tight tight tight-tight
(Dukes up, baby, dukes up)

[Verse 1]
You think that I'm a lady?
You think that I won't fight? (put 'em up, put 'em up)
I'll make your eyes shine like a liliqoi moonlit night, whoa oh
You think you're my one and only, only?
Sophisticated Yoni told me:
"You gots to love livin' while you livin' or you won't love life"
(Liiiiife)

[Verse 2]
I'm the high pimpstress (you know her)
I'm honey brown
I'm the baddest bitch to ever hit this town (uh uh)
Cornbread woman, yoo hoo and a bottle of yum (oh yeah)
I'm gonna have a party with my body, do ya wanna come?
Well alright
('Cause we're such)

[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
And some might say we're
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
Tight tight tight-tight

[Verse 3]
Hey girls!
I'm back again, (that vixen Nobel) and that Bride of [?]
Bend the rules, headline "Bad News"
"It's the Sisters of Salem, they, they on the loose" (hell yeah)
Shakin' her caboose like Dottie
Octopussy like a James Bond hottie
Smokin' like a Cuban
When you're with Mikey Rubin, better know what you're doing
Or get kicked out right away, gonna hide away
I'd advise you not to play with those

[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
And some might say we're
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
(Tight tight tight)
Don't you play with those

[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
Some might say we're
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
Tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight
Tight tight tight tight-tight

[Bridge]
Here come those devils, cheeky sneaky rebels
(Every day and every night) hot steppin' is what we like
I say here come those devils, cheeky sneaky rebels
(Every day and every night) hot steppin' is what we like
Cheeky sneaky rebels

[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
And some might say we're
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
Lock lock 'em up tight tight-tight

[Chorus]
Wicked little girls, kissed the boys and made them cry
Raisin' double trouble every time we pass them by
And some might say we're (some might say)
Wicked little girls
With curves and kissers and pearly whites
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
(Hot steppin' is what we like)
Tight tight tight tight-tight

[Outro]
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
(Naughty naughty! Naughty naughty)
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
(Hot steppin' is what we like)
You better keep an eye on your boys and lock 'em up tight
(Hot steppin' is what we like) Yeah
Hot steppin' is what we like
What we like
Dare ya to (play with me)

Wicked little girls (yeah yeah ya know it)
Wicked little girls (ya know it)
