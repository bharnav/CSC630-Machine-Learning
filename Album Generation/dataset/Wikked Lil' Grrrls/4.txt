Thank heaven for you and the way you take care of me
You hide my secret so well, thank heaven for you
No matter storm to come your way, whatever season in this house, day to day
You've weathered them all and you are so strong

So thank heaven for you (you're my angel)

Whenever I get lost, you never let me disappear for long
You always bring me water you never let me falter

So thank heaven for you (you're my angel)
