I met him on sunday
I loved him by Tuesday afternoon
Woke up on friday
Changed my whole life to make some room
Around a quarter to two
I have remembered all my lines
I'll say, "when I think of you
You're like my favorite song
And that melody, that melody I love"
And it goes

La da da da da da da da da
Da la da da da da da la da
Da da da la da da da da

Hopped on a Metro
And I made my way home
But I can't get him out of my mind
No matter just how hard I try
And if the rumours are true
Then I can look forward to
Some better days and getaways
So nice 'cause when I am with you
You're the crescendo to that melody
That melody I love
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll have better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
Better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you

You've gotta let me know
I gotta know for sure
Don't leave me out in the cold
I've gotta know for sure
La la la la la la la la...

When I think of you
I see better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
Better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
Better days and getaways
'Cause everyday is a holiday with you
