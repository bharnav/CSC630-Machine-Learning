She knew this love would break her heart
But rebellion always turned her on
She liked the dangerous type, pullin' stick up heists
Waitin' for him to come around so they could be alone
And she would say…

Bad Boy Clyde, you know you drive me wild
Put away your gun, why don't you play with me?
Rollin' with your boys, you're always on the run
For just this once, why can't you stay with me?

She had a gut feeling, call it intuition
Wishing that it would subside
It's just a day like any other, there's no need to cause a fight
He has to go, his boys are counting on him, you know
Oh my my…

Bad Boy Clyde, you know you drive me wild
Put away your gun, why don't you play with me?
Rollin' with your boys, you're always on the run
For just this once, why can't you stay with me?
(2x)

Thinkin' about, thinkin' about the life that we have
You're always on the run (you were always running around)
Thinkin' about what you take for granted
And if you cared about yourself, you'd let go baby

(The cycle never ends)

I love me, I love me some bad bad boys
