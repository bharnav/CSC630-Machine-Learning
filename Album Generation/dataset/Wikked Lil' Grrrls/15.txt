Find me
Find me in an open sky
And then wish me
Wish me far from you and free

Swallow whole the love I give you
Then give it back to me
Tell me, what am I supposed to do
With the mess you've made out of me
Dragonfly, dragonfly

Give me
Give me back my wings so I can fly
And then catch me
Catch each breath right from me
When you smile

Swallow whole the love I give you
Then, give it back to me
Tell me, what am I supposed to do
With the mess you've made out of me
Dragonfly, dragonfly
