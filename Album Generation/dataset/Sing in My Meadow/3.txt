Under his pillow whisper low
They creep in through his radio
That long-distance howling at the moon

Wille Stargel at the bat
Some freak singing about his Siamese cat
"Ask the Pastor" sowing through his dreams

Hey girl, wanna touch my soul?
Do you listen to late night radio?
Come away with me

He likes the way it eats the miles
The way it pulls you, like a child
Holds your hand
Briefly lifts the veil

The way the music curls like smoke
Where the mildly sane and the madmen float
The hum of night, the freedom in the air

Hey love, can I reach your soul?
Do you listen to late night radio?
Come away with me

Under his pillow whisper low
They creep in through his radio
All that distance filling up the room

Firmly locked in the long grey middle
He reaches out and starts to fiddle
Just to hear them howling at the moon

Hey babe, do you doubt my soul?
But I listen to late night radio
Come away with me
