I was forced to pay a bride's price
I couldn't look the other way
She hooked me with her "fuck me" eyes
They still haunt me to this day

She says, only you can know these secrets
Buried deep beneath my skin, only your tongue
Can uncover them

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In a room as cold as Winter
I explored her with my hands
She said, "darling you must forgive, in order to understand"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

My breathe it slowly left me
I snaked my way inside
The next thing that I knew
You were not lying by my side

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In the end we find a single door
And all the things we should have done
Piled high on all the surfaces
Fears, excuses given

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
