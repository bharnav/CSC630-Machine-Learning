It's heavy down here
Pressure building day-to-day
Everyone's got too much to say
It's heavy down here

It's heavy down here
Thunder clouds roiling in the late afternoon
Old Man rising from his noon day snooze
It's heavy down here

It's heavy down here
A final post for all to see
The loving embrace of Infamy
It's heavy down here
It's too damn heavy down here

He took a small box
And he buried it away
"Now my heart will be home
So I need not stay"

It's heavy down here
It's too damn heavy down here
