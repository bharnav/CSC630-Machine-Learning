Here's the story of a dying man
Told by a friend of mine
He said that he heard it from a friend of his
Who was a real close friend one time
One night he chose to choke his wife
Until the light that was there turned cold
He'd heard some stories 'bout her
From a friend of a friend I'm told

The continental drift
The continental drift

Why do you say "no"
When what you mean is "yes"?
Why do you say "never mind"
When it's obvious that you do?
Yeah, I love you too
When it's obvious that you do
Yeah, I love you too

Let's hang around and watch
This good man lose his goodness
And leave a trail of misery behind
I heard he chose to choke his life until the light in it went cold
I heard it from a friend of a very good friend of mine

The continental drift The continental drift
The continental drift The continental drift
