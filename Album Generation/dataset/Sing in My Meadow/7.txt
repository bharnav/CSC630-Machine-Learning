A drift of wild turkeys
In the field across the way
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For those coyotes to make a play
But they never do
So I move on

A pack of wild children
In the field across the street
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For the bell to set them free
But it never does
So I move on

51 years, a child upon the Earth
Trying to find the answers
Without digging in the dirt
So I'll never know
And I'll move on
