[Verse]
If you knew, Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
About Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes I love you Peggy Sue

[Chorus][x2]
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you girl and I need you Peggy Sue
I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue

[Outro]
Oh well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
