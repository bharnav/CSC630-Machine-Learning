[Verse 1 - Buddy Holly]
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Chorus - Buddy Holly]
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Verse 2 - Buddy Holly]
Let me hear you say
The words I want to hear
Darling when you're near
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Chorus - Buddy Holly]
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Outro - Buddy Holly]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
