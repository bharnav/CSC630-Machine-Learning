[Intro: Pierre Bouvier]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Let’s go

[Verse 1: Pierre Bouvier]
My Fender Strats sits all alone
Collecting dust in the corner
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I haven’t called any of my friends
I’ve been MIA since last December
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
My Blackberry’s filled up with E-Mail
My phone calls goes straight through to voicemail

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of velcro
At the park, in the back of my car
It don’t matter what I do
No, I can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
Can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)

[Verse 2: Rivers Cuomo]
There’s fungus growing in the icebox
All I got left are Fruit Roll-Ups
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
My clothes are six months old
But I don’t care, no, no, no, I don’t notice
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
My bills pile is so high, it is shocking
The repo man just keeps on knocking

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of velcro
At the park, in the back of my car
It don’t matter what I do
No, I can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
Can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
Can’t keep my hands off you

[Bridge: Pierre Bouvier]
Sorry to all my friends
And to anyone I offend
But I can’t help it
No, I can’t help it
(Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my) Can’t keep my hands off
(Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my) Can’t keep my hands off
(Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my) Can’t keep my hands off
(Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my) Can’t keep my hands off

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier]
'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of Velcro
(Stuck like two pieces of Velcro)
At the park, in the back of my car
It don’t matter what I do
No, I can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
Can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)

[Outro: Pierre Bouvier]
I can’t keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you (Can’t keep my, I can’t keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you
