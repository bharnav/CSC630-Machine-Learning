[Verse 1]
There’s a lot of talk about me
People lining up to meet me
I’m on a verge of celebrity
So what you think about that?
I’ve got friends in high places
Louis Vuitton suitcases
Look at all their pretty faces
So what you think about that?
So why do I feel like it’s all just a show?

[Chorus]
You make me wanna shut it all down
Throw it all away
'Cause I’m nothing if I don’t have you
What’s the point of being on top?
All the money in the world
If I can’t blow it all on you
So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
'Cause it’s all so clear
Now without you here
I’m the loser of the year
Loser of the year

[Verse 2]
I’m at a party in a mansion
There’s a lot of high fashion
And I’m cooler than I’ve ever been
So what you think about that?
I’m living life in the fast lane
I’ve got fridge full of champagne
And I’m hanging out with Lil' Wayne
So what you think about that?
So why do I feel like it’s all just a show?

[Chorus]
You make me wanna shut it all down
Throw it all away
'Cause I’m nothing if I don’t have you
What’s the point of being on top?
All the money in the world
If I can’t blow it all on you
So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
'Cause it’s all so clear
Now without you here
I’m the loser of the year
Loser of the year

[Bridge]
I can try real hard, I can try to pretend
That all these dreams make any sense
Without you
But that just ain’t true
I thought these things would make me forget
About you and me, but you’re stuck in my head
I’m a loser
If I lose her

[Chorus]
You make me wanna shut it all down
Throw it all away
'Cause I’m nothing if I don’t have you
What’s the point of being on top?
All the money in the world
If I can’t blow it all on you
You make me wanna shut it all down
Throw it all away
'Cause I’m nothing if I don’t have you
So send the cars back
Put the house on the market
And my big dreams too
'Cause it’s all so clear
That I need you near
And it’s all so clear
Now without you here
I’m the loser of the year

[Outro]
Loser of the year
