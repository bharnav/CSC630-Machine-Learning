[Verse 1]
Can anybody hear me?
Or am I talking to myself?
My mind is running empty
In this search for someone else
Who doesn't look right through me
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down?
Because I'm tired of drifting around and 'round
Can I please come down?

[Verse 2]
I'm deafened by the silence
Is it somethin' that I've done?
I know that there are millions
I can't be the only one
So disconnected
It's so different in my head
Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite?

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down?
Because I'm tired of drifting around and 'round
Can I please come down?

[Bridge]
Now I lie awake and scream, in the zero gravity
And it's starting to weigh down on me, whoa
Let's abort this mission now
Can I please come down?

[Alternate Chorus]
So tonight I'm calling all astronauts
All the lonely people that the world forgot
If you hear my voice, come pick me up
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got

[Chorus]
And tonight, I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot

[Outro]
'Cause tonight, I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
To the lonely people that the world forgot
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got
Can I please come down?
(Please, please, please come down)
Because I'm tired of drifting around and 'round
(I'm tired of drifting 'round)
Can I please come down?
(Please, please, please come down)
Can I please come down?
Can I please come down?
