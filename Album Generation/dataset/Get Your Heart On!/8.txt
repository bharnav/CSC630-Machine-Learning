[Verse 1]
Hey there now, where'd you go?
You left me here, so unexpected
You changed my life, I hope you know
'Cause now I'm lost, so unprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
In a blink of an eye
I never got to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Like a shooting star
Flying across the room
So fast, so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be the same here without you
You were gone too soon

[Verse 2]
You were always there, like a shining light
On my darkest days, you were there to guide me
Oh, I miss you now, I wish you could see
Just how much your memory, will always mean to me

[Pre-Chorus]
In a blink of an eye
I never got to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Like a shooting star flying across the room
So fast, so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be the same here without you
You were gone too soon

[Bridge]
Shine on, shine on
To a better place
Shine on, shine on
We'll never be the same
Shine on, shine on

[Chorus]
Like a shooting star
Flying across the room
So fast, so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be the same here without you
You were gone too soon

[Outro]
Shine on, shine on
You were gone too soon
Shine on, shine on
You were gone too soon
Shine on, shine on
You were gone too soon
