[Intro]
I'm staring at the clock
I'm wondering why I'm still here
And my head's about to pop
I'm thinking that you best stay clear

[Bridge]
Oh, how did I get stuck in this predicament? I don't know
I wanna throw this repetition out the window
I'm getting tired, of wondering why I'm still here

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wish that I could
Snap my fingers, make myself disappear
Snap my fingers, get myself out of here
Snap my fingers, snap my fingers, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be, anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I could be catching a wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top down, kissing my girl
I could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

[Verse 2]
The sun is coming up, don't wanna get out of bed
Well here we go again, I'm back to where I began
Oh, you can take my checkbook
Credit cards and keep them
I'd give them up just for a little bit of freedom
And my escape, I'm planning it in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wish that I could
Snap my fingers, make myself disappear
Snap my fingers, get myself out of here
Snap my fingers, snap my fingers, oh, oh


[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be, anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I could be sipping a drink
I could be getting a tan
I could be hanging on the beach with my toes in the sand
I could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

[Bridge]
No more bus stops, sitting in traffic
Waking up at six in the morning, ain't gonna happen
No more office, no more line-ups
You can just forget about it, we want freedom
We want, we want, we want
We want freedom
We want, we want, we want

[Chorus 3]
And I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

[Bridge 2]
I could be catching a wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top down, kissing my girl
I could be slipping it in
I could be living it up
I could be sitting at home not giving a fuck!

[Outro]
Could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
