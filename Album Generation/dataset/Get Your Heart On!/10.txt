[Verse 1]
I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you, my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me
Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

[Chorus]
I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself

[Chorus]
I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

[Bridge]
You'll never know what it means to me
That I'm not alone, that I'll never have to be

[Chorus]
I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life
This song saved my life
