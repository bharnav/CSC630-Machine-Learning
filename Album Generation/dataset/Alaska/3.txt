(Slip into something more comfortable... proceed into space)

Innocent individuals...
Concerned about nothing but happiness...
Progress becomes easy due to this social situation
Unfortunate turn of events...
Collapse this idea of the childish thought

No judgement towards one another, no social status to compare...
All as one...
Market this change...
Exploit the idea of innocence...
Goddamn television god...
Corrupt me...
Separate us...
Groups of difference seem to comfort what we once didn't think of...
This show was in their head for years...
Enjoy this life of wonder and imagination...
For it will be torn down

You will be torn down...
Time to hate, kill, fight, conquer...
This is human life at its best...
We'll televise this event...
You can learn how to live, breath...
Then finally die

(The sweet relief is a must)
We can speak obsession...
We can love the endless
