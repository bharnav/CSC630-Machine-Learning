[Verse 1]
The early love seems to become jaded
I’m never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror
Imagination towards the stars
(The endless) desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I’m never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror
Imagination towards the stars
(The endless) desire for my one and only true love

[Verse 2]
This will never change I predict, I predict
I predict
But I do get, I do get tired
This will never change I predict, I predict
I predict
But I do get tired, do get tired
If only they knew what push we have given
For this music (This happiness that keeps us all sane)
For this music (Cold nights seem to force questions)
For this music (Not wanting to accept these thoughts)
For this music
For this music

[Verse 3]
I have worked and I will keep working
To keep the tradition
Of my one motive in life
Once building drum boxes
And pretending to be
The artist
Guess I’m here, but it feels weird
To know how weird all this can be
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned
I guess I’m here, but it feels weird
So weird
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned

[Verse 4]
One day it will come together
(First place in a backwards marathon)
One day it will come together
That’s all we can ask for
One day it will come together
(First place in a backwards marathon)
One day it will come together
That’s all we can ask for

[Bridge]
It’s raining
It’s raining
It’s raining...
It’s raining
It’s raining
It’s raining...
It’s raining
It’s raining
It’s raining...
It’s raining
It’s raining
It’s raining...
When the sun comes up
It still rains
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
When the sun comes up
It’s raining, it’s raining
It’s rain...

[Verse 5]
The early love seems to become jaded
I’m never expecting this
Dance for the mirror
Imagination towards the stars
(The endless) desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I’m never expecting this
Dance for the mirror
Imagination towards the stars
(The endless) desire for my one and only true love

[Outro]
Dreams won’t let go
Thoughts will not change
Can’t watch this fly away
Dreams won’t let go
Thoughts will not change
Can’t watch this fly away
