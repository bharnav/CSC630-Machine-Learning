If all you really ask every turn is a little faced
Suit yourself, though or I'll go down agitated and anxious
Waste the entire day? try to come up for air
For the last time disappear, very moving

It's the last time, it's the last time
It's the last time, it's the last time

There's no stopping now you switch back on
While we walk you turned your back, disabled
I know that will do for something to change
Everyone's gone when you finally go 'round

It's the last time, it's the last time
It's the last time, it's the last time

It's the last time, it's the last time
It's the last time, it's the last time

When I see you down
When I see you down
When I see you down
When I see you down
When I'm high, I try...
Yeah, I'm dyin' in denied
When I see you down
When I see you down
