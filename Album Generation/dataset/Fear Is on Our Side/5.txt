When you carry yourself through the room
Youthful... to drag no broom
We smoked the last cigarette
I closed my eyes and took in your breath

Give yourself a minute to catch your breath

It's your turn to roll the ball
You drenched your breath right behind the chill
We smoked the last cigarette
I closed my eyes and took in your breath

Give yourself a minute to catch your breath
Give yourself a minute to catch your breath
Give yourself a minute, figure out wonders

All of your friends are now ghosts
On the last road to go before we go

If they only had some... they will run
They associate... and they went nothing

I weld the last ride
I weld the last ride
I weld the last ride
I weld the last ride with you
