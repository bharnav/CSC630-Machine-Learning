Are you here forever standin' by the road
With the benefit of feelin' on your own
Where the river ends the sun is comin' down
Through the vision valley waitin' to be found

Aah, aah, ooh, ooh
Aah, aah, ooh, ooh

Are you here forever standin' by the road
With the benefit of feelin' on your own
Where the river ends the sun is comin' down
Through the vision valley waitin' to be found

Aah, aah, ooh, ooh
Aah, aah, ooh, ooh

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
