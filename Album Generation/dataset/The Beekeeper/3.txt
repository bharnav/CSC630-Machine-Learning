[Verse 1]
Can you patch my jeans, Peggy Ann?
Just a little stitch to mend the hole
He has torn, if you can
Maybe I got too set in my ways
He says she reminds him of me
When we first met in those early day

[Chorus]
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's, beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn, in the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn

[Verse 2]
With the gales my little boat was tossed
How was I to know that you'd sent her
With a lantern to bring me in?
"Are you positive this is a friend?"
The captain grimaced, "Those are cliffs
Of rock ahead, if I'm not mistaken"

[Chorus]
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's, beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped

[Chorus]
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's, beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn, in the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn, in the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn, in the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
