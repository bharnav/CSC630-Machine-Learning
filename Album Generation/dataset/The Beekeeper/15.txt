[Intro: Tori Amos & The London Community Gospel Choir]
Uh, uh
Hoochie woman, hoochie woman
Hoochie woman, hoochie woman

[Verse 1: Tori Amos]
I wasn't thinking, my head was in the book
His hands were on her, everywhere
I saw his face, I dropped my coffee
He's cheating on me with a, a hoochie woman

[Chorus: Tori Amos]
You can keep your hoochie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause boys I bring home the bacon

[Post-Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Hoochie woman, hoochie woman

[Verse 2: Tori Amos]
I went to work and the office girls
Were all burning their poetry
It wasn't good but in the neighborhood
Now they're all just hoochie women

[Chorus: Tori Amos]
You can keep your hootchie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause boys I bring home the bacon
I said, boy, I bring home the bacon now

[Post-Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Hoochie woman, hoochie woman

[Verse 3: Tori Amos]
He called me up and said, "She has needs"
I said, "You'll find them on Barney's fourth floor"
He said, "I need a loan", that's not a problem
You'd better keep this from your hoochie woman

[Chorus: Tori Amos]
You can keep your hoochie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause boy I bring home the bacon
I said girls I bring home the bacon now

[Post-Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Hoochie woman, hoochie woman
