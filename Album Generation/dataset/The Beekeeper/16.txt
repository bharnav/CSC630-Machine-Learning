[Verse 1]
I don't, I don't know why
In your boy's life you become like a bull
Like a bull in a china shop
Smash it up into smithereens

[Chorus]
There you, there you go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all I am, just a doll you got used to?
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces

[Verse 2]
I cried and I washed my tears
That turned into diamond
Ice into ice and if it could freeze
My heart wouldn't float away

[Chorus]
There you, there you go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all I am, just a doll you got used to?
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces

[Verse 3]
So how, how will I go
Back on, back on the shelf
With a smile, with a smile
To the customer and say, "On sale by the owner"?

[Chorus]
Here I, here I go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all I am, just a doll you got used to?
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye my Pisces
