[Verse 1]
General Joy I know, I know you'll take me there
Where your boys were left behind
General Joy it seems you need a soldier girl
Now they have Liberty gagged

[Pre-Chorus 1]
By boat, by tram, by motor bus
Could it be the fates are protecting us
From the hawks that have stolen the bird from the sky

[Chorus]
And I know
You will always love sorrow
Is that why
You gave her dress to happiness?
'Cause it matches her eyes
When she cries

[Verse 2]
General Joy it seems you don't love your Bride
That doesn't mean you're a bad guy
Generally you're friends, but she is not
The love of your life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To dye, to perm, to change your hair or your wife
The possibilities are there
And it's time for you to decide

[Chorus]
And I know
You will always love sorrow
Is that why
You gave her dress to happiness?
'Cause it matches her eyes
When she cries

[Verse 3]
General Joy I know, I know you'll take me there
But you'll need strength from within
General Joy it seems you need a soldier girl
And a willing coalition

[Pre-Chorus 3]
By boat, by tram, by motor bus
Could it be? The hawks are protecting us
From the men who have now assumed their name

[Chorus]
And I know
You will always love sorrow
Is that why
You gave her dress to happiness?
'Cause it matches her eyes
When she cries

[Outro]
'Cause it matches her eyes
When she cries
