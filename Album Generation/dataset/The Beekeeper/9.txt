[Verse 1]
If I choke, boy, you start me up again, restring my wires
You know this gearbox can make the shift
Polish my rims
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
I swear it seems of late boy
I've even curved this body to fit your bow

[Chorus]
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come
Come in rhythm
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says, "What if I
Keep on driving
Keep on driving"

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
"Yeah that whip has skirt", you said it proud
Sometimes I'd watch her idle
While you'd tune her up, me with silencer on
You and your crocodile clip
Me and my alligator pears yeah
All tricked out for the trip that slid into a spin

[Chorus]
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come
Come in rhythm
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says, "What if I
Keep on driving
Keep on driving"

[Bridge]
You say that "I miss you"
You stop at my drive-thru
You know who you'll order some, some, boy

[Chorus]
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says, "What if I
Keep on driving
Keep on driving"

[Outro]
If I choke, boy, you start me up again, restring my wires
You know this gearbox can make the shift
Polish my rims
