[Intro]
There was a garden in the beginning
Before the fall, before Genesis
There was a tree there, a tree of knowledge
Sophia would insist, you must eat of this

[Chorus]
Original sin?
No, I don't think so
Original sinsuality
Original sin?
No, it should be
Original sinsuality
Original sin?
No, I don't think so
Original sinsuality

[Outro]
Yaldaboath, Saklas, I'm calling you
Samael, you are not alone
I say, you are not alone
In your darkness you are not alone
Baby, you are not alone
