[Verse 1]
Airplanes take you away again
Are you flying above where we live?
Then I look up, a glare in my eyes
Are you having regrets about last night?
I'm not, but I like rivers that rush in
So then I dove in
Is there trouble ahead for you the acrobat?
I won't push you unless you have a net

[Chorus 1]
You say the word, you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I don't hold on to the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to
Kiss away night, this girl only sleeps with butterflies
With butterflies
So go on and fly then, boy

[Verse 2]
Balloons look good from on the ground
I fear with pins and needles around
We may fall then stumble upon a carousel
It could take us anywhere

[Chorus 2]
You say the word, you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I don't hold on to the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to
Kiss away night, waiting by this girl
This girl

[Chorus 1]
You say the word, you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I don't hold on to the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to
Kiss away night, this girl only sleeps with butterflies
With butterflies
With butterflies
So go on and fly, boy
