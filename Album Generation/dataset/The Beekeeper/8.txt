[Verse 1]
She's a girl rising from a shell
Running to Spring
It is her time, it is her time
Watch her run with ribbons undone

[Verse 2]
She's a rose in a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right, there will be time
To chase the sun with ribbons undone

[Bridge]
She runs like a fire does, jJust picking up daises
Comes in for a landing, a pure flash of lightening
Past Alice blue blossoms, you follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you, arms filled with lavender
Yes, my little pony is growing up fast
She corrects me and says, "You mean a thoroughbred"
A look in her eye says the battle's beginning
From school she comes home and cries
"I don't want to grow up, Mom, at least not tonight"

[Verse 3]
You're a girl rising from a shell
Running through Spring
With Summer's hand in reach now
It is your time, it is your time
So just run with ribbons undone

[Verse 4]
It is your time, yes my angel
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
Run, run, darling

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Ribbons un...
