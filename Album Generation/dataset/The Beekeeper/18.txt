[Verse 1]
I thought it was Easter time
The way the light rose, rose that morning
Lately you've been on my mind
You showed me the rope, ropes to climb
Over mountains and to pull myself
Out of a landslide, of a landslide

[Verse 2]
I thought it was harvest time
You always loved the smell of wood burning
She with her honey hair
Dalhousie Castle, she would meet you there
In the winter, butter yellow
The flames you stirred, yes, you could stir

[Bridge]
I raise a glass, make a toast
A toast in your honour
I hear your laugh and beg me not to dance
On your right standing by is Mr. Bojangles
With a toast, he's telling me it's time
To raise a glass, make a toast, a toast in your honour
I hear you laugh and beg me not to dance
Cause on your right standing by is Mr. Bojangles
With a toast, he's telling me it's time
To let you go, let you go

[Outro]
I thought I'd see you again
You say you might do
Maybe in a carving
In a cathedral somewhere in Barcelona
