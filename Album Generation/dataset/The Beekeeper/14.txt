[Verse 1]
Take a walk down memory lane with me
Past a watermelon stand on the way
Thinking I had everything we'd need
On Martha's foolish ginger
You were late, how could I forget
What you said, the part about that
Love taking over your life was not in your plan

[Chorus]
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done

[Verse 2]
Through the cliffs, out of the Bay I went
From the starboard side I could black my
Visions and my passions, they keep me awake

[Chorus]
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done

[Bridge]
A familiar voice, "Hi - surprise!
I've been searching trying to find you"
I couldn't speak, my hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger
We talked until the moon came up
About how life without love
Isn't worth very much, then I played this song

[Chorus]
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done

[Post-Chorus]
What I would have done
What I would have done

[Outro]
"Memories that we have yet," you said
"To make like our burning bed"
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe
On Martha's foolish ginger
