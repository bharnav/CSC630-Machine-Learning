[Chorus]
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

[Verse 1]
So when I was out in the desert
And a cowboy tried to lasso me
He said, "You're red and made of clay, a virgin portrait"
I let him wake me, but decided not to stay

[Chorus]
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

[Verse 2]
Next in New York I fell out with a dragon
Of the white collar kind, but just as ferocious
I remembered Mark running faster than the horses
Then an encounter with a voice that caressed me

[Chorus]
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

[Bridge]
Wasn't it you who held off a surrender
To one spoiled nun who taught you the names
Of the mountains on the moon and then a Jesuit
Proceeded to arrange your soul while I prayed on my knees

[Chorus]
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends
Yes, on my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time

[Outro]
Such a long, long time
It's been a long time
A long time
