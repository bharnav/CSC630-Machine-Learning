[Verse 1]
Lucky me, I guessed the kind of man
That you would turn out to be
Now I wish that I'd been wrong and then
I could remember to breathe
And all along the watchtower
The night horses and the black mares
Ready themselves for the outcome
For the strange times upon us

[Chorus]
But what you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A Mother Revolution
But what you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A Mother Revolution

[Post-Chorus]
You could've had me
You could've had me
You could've had me right there beside you
You could've had me, boy
You could've had me, yeah
You could've had me right there beside you

[Verse 2]
A wife on loan in a cafe in old El Paso
Next I go to Seven Gates and my sister's bass bonanza
And all along her watchtower
The night horses and the black mares
Steady themselves for the outcome
For the strange days upon us

[Chorus]
What you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A Mother Revolution
But what you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A Mother Revolution

[Post-Chorus]
You could've had me
You could've had me
You could've had me right there beside you
You could've had me, boy
You could've had me
You could've had me right there beside you

[Outro]
What you didn't count on
Was another mother of
A Mother Revolution
