[Intro]
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Thought I had a witness to this crime
Thought I had a witness
Thought we were on the same side of becoming
Then the judges called in a witness
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
So then when did you then begin your craving for white powder?
Exotic matter that cells divide
Arresting time
So in your furnace then you drank my tenderness feldspar and mica then
You thought that you would own
My temple of gold

[Chorus]
Gotta rise in the night
And pick myself off the floor
I know now that it's over
I had a life before
You left me burning in
Your petrol emotion, boy
Your petrol emotion
Wanting more

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Thought we had a friendship
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard you whispering murder
Thought this witches brew was more than bullet-proof
But words are like guns when you shoot the moon
'Cause everybody whispers, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
So then when did you then begin your craving for white powder?
Exotic matter that cells divide
Arresting time
So in your furnace then you drank my tenderness feldspar and mica then
You thought that you would own
My temple of gold

[Chorus]
Gotta rise in the night
Pick myself off the floor, girls
I know now that it's over
I had a life before
You left me burning in, boy
Your petrol emotion
Your petrol emotion
Wanting more

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder, baby?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?
I'm out the door
I'm out the door now
Is there any way, is there any way forward?
Is there any way, is there any way forward?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?

[Interlude]
Thought I had a witness
Thought you were you
Thought I was a witness
You could turn to, not in
Thought I had a witness
Thought I did

[Outro]
Thought had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, hit it, boys
Thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come
