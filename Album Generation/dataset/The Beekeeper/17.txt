[Chorus 1]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone

[Post-Chorus]
"Relax love," he said before he left
"Take those hands away from your eyes
From where I stand, you're in my sky"

[Verse 1]
You must go, must flee for they will hunt you down
You and your unborn seed
In all of Gaul is there safety?

[Pre-Chorus]
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
You will dance the ring
Marys of the Sea
The lost bride weeps
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
We will dance your ring

[Chorus 2]
Hey, there's a new Jerusalem
Hey, you built on rock that's on sand
For now you have hijacked the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone

[Post-Chorus]
"Relax love," he said before he left
"Take those hands away from your eyes
From where I stand, you're in my sky"

[Verse 2]
I hear a voice and it says
"The red of the red rose is its own
And something no man can divide"
So Saint Germain hear the prayer of this supplicant
For two scarlet women, Black Madonna

[Pre-Chorus]
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
You will dance the ring
Marys of the Sea
The lost bride weeps
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
We will dance your ring

[Chorus 3]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
I know it's your day in the sun

[Chorus 1]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone
