[Verse 1]
Barons of suburbia
Take another piece of my good graces
I'm in my war, you're in yours
Do we fight for peace as they take another piece of us?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But, baby, I would let your darkness invade me
You could maybe turn this white light into navy
Before you leave

[Chorus]
It was a slight miscalculation that my friends
My friends would be waiting
On the other side of the bridge
On the other side of this
This mole hill of a mountain
This potion now a poison
They're on the other side of right
We're on the other side of her midnight
Her midnight, her midnight

[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done we will lose a piece
To a carnivorous vegetarian
Barons of suburbia, I have heard you pray
Before you devour her

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So, baby, will you let my darkness invade you?
You always liked your wafer sweet in the middle
Before you leave

[Chorus 2]
It was a slight miscalculation that our friends
Our friends would be waiting
On the other side of the bridge
On the other side of this
This mole hill of a mountain
This potion now a poison
They're on the other side of right
We're on the other side of her midnight
Her midnight, her midnight

[Bridge]
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion
To combat your poison

[Outro]
She is risen
She is risen, boys
I said, she is risen
