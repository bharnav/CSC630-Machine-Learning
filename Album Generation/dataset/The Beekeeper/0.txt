[Verse 1]
When I come to terms, to terms with this
When I come to terms with this
When I come to terms, to terms with this
My world will change for me

[Verse 2]
I haven't moved since the call came
Since the call came I haven't moved
I stare at the wall knowing on the other side
The storm that waits for me

[Chorus]
The Seated Woman with the Parasol
May be the only one you can't betray
If I'm the Seated Woman with the Parasol
I will be safe in my frame

[Verse 3]
I have no need for a sea view
For a sea view I have no need
I have my little pleasures
This wall being one of these

[Chorus]
And the Seated Woman with the Parasol
May be the only one you can't Betray
If I'm the Seated Woman with the Parasol
I will be safe in my frame

[Verse 4]
When I come to terms, to terms with this
When I come to terms with this
When I come to terms with this whip lash
Of silk on wool embroidery

[Chorus]
And the Seated Woman with the Parasol
May be the only one you can't betray
If I'm the Seated Woman with the Parasol
I will be safe in my frame

[Chorus]
And the Seated Woman with the Parasol
May be the only one you can't betray
If I'm the Seated Woman with the Parasol
I will be safe in my frame

[Outro]
I will be safe in my frame
In your house, in your frame
