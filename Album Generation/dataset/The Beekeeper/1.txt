[Intro: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Sweet, sweet, sweet now
Sweet sting

[Verse 1: Tori Amos]
With a strut into the room
With his hat cocked sure defiantly
He said "I- I have heard
That you can play the way I like it to be played."
I said, "I can play any way that you want
But first I want, I want to know

[Chorus 1: Tori Amos]
Baby, is it sweet, sweet, sweet the sting?
Is it real, this infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody shake, shake, shake me sane
'Cause I am inching ever closer"
To the tip of this scorpion's tail

[Post-Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Sweet, sweet, sweet now

[Verse 2: Tori Amos]
He said, "I laid my weapons down
With my pistol fully loaded
A hunted man to my root
Will it end or begin in your cinnabar juice?"

[Chorus 2: Tori Amos]
Is it sweet, sweet, sweet, your sting?
Is it real, your infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody, shake, shake, shake me sane
'Cause I am inching ever closer
To the tip of this scorpion's tail

[Bridge: Tori Amos]
Love let me breathe, breathe you in
Melt the confusion until there is
There is you, union

[Chorus 2: Tori Amos]
Is it sweet, sweet, sweet, your sting?
Is it real, your infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody, shake, shake, shake me sane
'Cause I am inching ever closer
To the tip of this scorpion's tail

[Outro: Tori Amos & The London Community Gospel Choir]
Sweet, sweet, sweet now
Baby, is it sweet, now, now?
Sweet, sweet
Baby, is it sweet, boy?
Sweet, sweet, sweet now
Baby, is it sweet?
