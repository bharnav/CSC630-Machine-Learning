The day you drew your final breath
And parted from the Earth
Is carved into the stone that bears your name
And date of birth

Oooooooooo...Imperia
Oooooooooo...Imperia

He was leaning over you with flowers
And his hand
Trying through the years to see the heart
Inside the man

Oooooooooo...Imperia
Oooooooooo...Imperia
