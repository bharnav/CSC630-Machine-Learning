They called him Great Scott
Because he was great
They called her Great Susan
Cause she was his date
She climbed in a box
He cut her in two
And when he was through
She was just half a woman

And he'd tie her up
Set her on fire
He'd douse her with oil
The crowd would go wild
She was always alright
At the end of the night
But somehow she felt
Like just half a woman

The show went the same way
Year after year
He'd wave his magic wand
She'd disappear
One day she asked
How did this come to be
Somewhere there must be more to me

One day she left

She climbed through the stage
And into the trap door
Under the lion's cage
And after a spell
He said what the hell
It was just as well
She was just half a woman
