Midnight, on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave she came
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my whole world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown, on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here tonight
Searching for her silver light

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my whole world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, oh no

Day job, in the city
Robin Hood and William Tell and Ivanhoe and Lancelot
They don't envy me
Sitting as the sun goes down
In dreams the world keeps spinning round and around

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my whole world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

No, I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my whole world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, oh no
