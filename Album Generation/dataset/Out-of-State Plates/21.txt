I know a girl that should never be alone
I know a girl that should never be alone

Shes a danger to herself
And im worried about her health
Shes got a problem and shes gonna do something dumb

I know a girl who you've got to keep an eye on
I know a girl who you've got to keep an eye on

Every time she goes outside she barly gets home alive
Shes got a problem and shes gonna do something dumb

Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And i can see the signs

Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Cause shes only killing time

Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And shes not long for this world

Shes a danger to herself and im worried about her heath
Shes got a problem and shes gonna do something dumb

Shes got a problem and shes gonna do something dumb
