I'm going coast to coast
I'm going nation wide
I got my hand on the trigger
Got my girl by my side
I've got the looks that kill
I've got a liscense to love
I've got a German Shepard
And his name is DOUG!

I'm heading for the sun
I'm gonna become
A California Sex Lawyer

Oh yeah
Well it's not fair
But baby I don't care

I've got big ideas
I've got back-up plans
I've got cha cha charisma
Got the slight of hand
I'm gonna do some damage
Gonna bust some heads
I'm gonna go the distance
And then I'm going to BED!

I'm headed for the sun
I'm gonna become
A California Sex Lawyer
Oh yeah
A California Sex Lawyer
Oh yeah
A California Sex Lawyer
Oh yeah
Well it's not fair
But baby I don't care
