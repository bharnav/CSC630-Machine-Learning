Oh whoa
Leave your nightlight on
You don't have far to go

Oh whoa
Leave your nightlight on
You don't have far to go

Out the door, down the hall
That is all
Down the hall, down the stairs
Pretty soon you'll be there

Oh whoa
Leave your nightlight on
You don't have far to go

Oh whoa
Leave your nightlight on
You don't have far to go

Down the stairs
Take your time, don't be scared
You'll be fine, nothing's changed
In the dark it's all the same
