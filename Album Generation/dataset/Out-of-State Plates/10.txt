On this day, I'm walking a fine line
Imagining my minds fine, ok
Tougher than nylon
Safe as a house on the way

My little darling
Don't you cry, it makes you look older
C'mon now hey, don't you be down
I want you around
I want you around
I want you arooooouuunnnnddd

Here's my plan, I'm losing the halo
It's time to lay low man, some plan
Come the high water
I'll be your drowning man

My little darling
Don't you cry, it makes you look older
C'mon now hey, don't you be down
I want you around
I want you around
I want you arooooouuunnnnddd
I want you around
I want you arooooouuunnnnddd

While I'm doing battle with myself and me
I'm doing battle with gravity
And I can't face myself alone
I can't bear to be alone with me

Hey don't you be down
I want you around
I want you around
I want you arooooouuunnnnddd
