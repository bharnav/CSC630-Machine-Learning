If you love me. why do you hurt me
Come on baby. don't desert me
I was there when you were in trouble
Now you're fine but I guess you changed your mind

'Cause you're never satisfied
God only know why I try to please you
You're just never satisfied

I don't mind it when you get angry
I'm not asking for you to beg me
All I want to do is remind you
How many times I put my ass on the line

'Cause you're never satisfied
God only know why I try to please you
You're just never satisfied
You're just never satisfied

You don't care if I stuck with you
Covered for you, put up with you
'Cause all you wanna do
Is try your love with somebody new
Ooh

I've been wasting my time

'Cause you're never satisfied
God only know why I try to please you
You're just never satisfied
You're just never satisfied
You're just never satisfied
