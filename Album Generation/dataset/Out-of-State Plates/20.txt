Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows
And tomorrow's rainbows I will share
Share with you
So dry your eyes, little girl
Dry your eyes
We're gonna see skies of blue

Had a tough time getting started
Maybe just a little downhearted
All you gotta do is count to ten
Maybe you'll be smiling when...

Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows
And tomorrow's rainbows I will share
Share with you
So dry your eyes, little girl
Dry your eyes
We're gonna see skies of blue

Gonna be just love and gladness
Don't wanna hear nothing 'bout sadness
Come a little closer, come to me
With each kiss you're gonna see

Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows
And tomorrow's rainbows I will share
Share with you
So dry your eyes, little girl
Dry your eyes
We're gonna see skies of blue

Gonna be just love and gladness
Don't wanna hear nothing 'bout sadness
Come a little closer, come to me
With each kiss you're gonna see

Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows
And tomorrow's rainbows I will share
Share with you
So dry your eyes, little girl
Dry your eyes
We're gonna see skies of blue
