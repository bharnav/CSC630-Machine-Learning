She knows nothing at all about nothing
The moment I saw her was something
I found ' alarming, that certain nothing behind her eyes

TV, she finds ' intoxicating
Shows about cops and dating
She has a soft spot for cops who are robots

And I don't know where this is goin'
But I've got a feelin', I'll do the drivin' from now on

Sometimes we stare at the stars from my roof
She wants to know if they're fire proof
I say "I guess so," how else could they glow on for so long?

We're out, the juke box plays Jumpin' Jack Flash
She says "I love Johnny Cash,"
The man in red, I turn my head, and pretend not to hear what she said

And I don't know where this is goin'
But I've got a feelin', I'll do the drivin' from now on

And I don't know where this is goin'
But I've got a feelin', I'll do the drivin' from now on
