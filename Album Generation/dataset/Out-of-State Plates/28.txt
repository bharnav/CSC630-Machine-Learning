I have to sit you down
Let me tell you what it's all about
Cause I've been carrying a torch around
And I've forgotten how to snuff it out

And you have been unkind
And that's a matter I cannot ignore
You have to skirt around the truth sometimes
But it's time I told you what I came here for

To thank you for all the small favors
I'm thinkin' now I hope it doesn't change us
And take us to a time when we were strangers
In a two-station town
You can't get the train to slow down

Small favors
Oh to you as sure as she was honest
And now do you remember when you promised
To forgive me someday
The debts that I can't repay
The debts that I can't repay

And I cannot forget
You looked at me as if I'd lost a bet
And I hadn't opened up my big mouth yet
And I thought of crawling back into the plane

And though it's sad to tell
I still remember how the dry-eye felt
Across the curtains in the cheap hotel
Lit-up dust clouds in the window pane

And I thank you for all the small favors
I'm thinkin' now I hope it doesn't change us
And take us to a time when we were strangers
In a two-station town
You can't get the train to slow down

Small favors
I'm thinkin' now I hope it doesn't change us
And take us to a time when we were strangers
In a two-station town
You can't get the train to slow down

Small favors
Oh to you as sure as she was honest
Now do you remember when you promised
Forgive me someday
The debts that I can't repay
The debts that I can't repay
The debts that I can't repay
