Gold sunglasses and a wandering eye
He looks like he's wearing a cheap disguise
But it's real
Don't you know how it feels?

He goes to work and he scares the hell
Out of all the girls down in Oradell
What a deal
Don't you know how it feels?

Lay it down, lay it down
You've got to cover a lot of ground
Lay it down, lay it down
Karpet King
Karpet King

Half a drink and he's out of his head
He puts the boys back into their beds
And he's free
That's the way it should be

Out every night with the girl of his dreams
He knows it will never be quite what he seems
To be
Don't you want him to be?

Lay it down, lay it down
You've got to cover a lot of ground
Lay it down, lay it down
Karpet King

Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
