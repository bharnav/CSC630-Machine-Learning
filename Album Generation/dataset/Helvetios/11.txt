Whoa

Scorched earth we left
A barren land of ash
Our fatherland laid waste
Be the void our fucking monument

At a laden dawn
At this omnous morn

Pila loomed on the horizon
Talons of the wolverine
Exanimate legions formed
At the very gates of Avaricum

Believed invulnerable
This Gallic wall
But straight out of nowhere
Before our eyes this goddamn bane arose

Thus Avaricum burns
Under a dead sky
Avaricum drowns
In blood and demise
And demise

Siege towers emerged
Protruding from the ground
Standing out against the threatening sky
As if to mock all valiantness

Face to face
With an eye-levelled enemy
Serried Roman ranks
Embattled upon our hold

Yeah
Whoa

Cut off and trapped inside
As the carnage was at hand
As the creak of the winches extolled our doom
The slaughter befell Avaricum

Death siffered the Oppidum
Left to pillage sack and rape
Avaricum, the brave
Became Avaricum, the grave

Thus Avaricum burns
Under a dead sky
Avaricum drowns
In blood and demise
And demise
