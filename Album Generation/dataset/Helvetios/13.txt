The grass was as green as it always was that sinister day
The blackbird sang their songs as they always did that black-letter day
The day we passed the great gate for the very last time
I did not look back, I knew we`d stay

I knew they I would not let us go leave the death strip
I saw the gleam in their eyes of fear and enslavement
Suffering from the crushing weight

Beloved ground take me home

Alesia, alisanos
Wake me when I`m gone
Ianotouta,eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

On that ground we cherished life
And embraced death
As the children`s cries trailed off
Sob yielded deathly hush

The grass was as green as it always was that sinister day
As we walked the alleys like thousand times before
I knew we`d stay

Outside Alesia
We offered a living sacrifice

Outside the doors of Alesia
Where our tears run dry
