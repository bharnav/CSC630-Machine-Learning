She sits alone in the hall
And soon she'll climb the stairs
To her room, she's so lonely
With sadness and despair
She can hear the static

Vast is the canvas, she painted
To justify the cause, of her life
In her childhood
She barely spoke a word
She was so dramatic

She's leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
God only knows she's been given
She's so frail

And you know she's going back
To a place she calls home

Frozen in time, there's a picture
That stands upon a shelf
And the fire's last ember
It burns in silent grace, for a new tomorrow

Leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
God only knows she's been given
She's so frail
And you know she's going back
To a place she calls home

Lost in a dream, there's a window
Of opportunity
Soon she'll join all her loved ones
That wait behind the door
Take away the sorrow

She's leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
And god only knows she's been given
She's so frail

She's leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
And god only knows she's been given
She's so frail
And you know she's going back
To a place she calls home

She calls home
She calls home
She calls home
