Load it up now hear the gun
Ain't got time waiting for the sun
I gotta generator
I need a little funk to go

Load it up now make it real
Somebody gotta take the wheel
I need a regulator
I like a little rodeo

I confess, I tell you yes
And it's a bust

Find me an hourglass
Burn the flame, gonna make it last
I gotta a movin' violation
You kill me now, you got to know

I confess, I tell you yes, and it's a bust
I'm insane, I feel no pain

Forgiven, I'm livin', I'm driven
I got a lone vision, precision, decision
So make it go faster, I gotta, outlast ya
I'm a low-rider, beside ya
I'm steppin' on

I tell you every detail
Won't you let the sucker derail
Cuz the music's my religion
I need a new place to dwell

Gotta find me an hourglass
Burn the flame, gonna make it last
Gotta a movin' violation
You kill me now, you got to know

I confess, I tell you yes, and it's a bust
I'm insane, I feel no pain

Forgiven, I'm livin', I'm driven
I got a lone vision, precision, decision
So make it go faster, I gotta outlast ya
I'm a low-rider beside ya
I'm steppin' on
