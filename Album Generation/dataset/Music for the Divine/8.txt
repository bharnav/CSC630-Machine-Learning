You're so electrified
But you're infected by the pain
You've been identified
And it's hello Mary Jane

You look so terrified
Inside your curiousity
But you just can't decide
Just what you want to be

You keep it down low
You let it all go

You're too high

You wanna be the best

Cuz you're too high

You never touch the ground

Cuz you're too high

You're different from the rest

Cuz you're too high

You're never comin' down

Into the sky above
There's a symbol of world peace
But you did kill the dove
Negativity release

They seek you everywhere
You're connected to your fame
But you don't really care
I think it's time to change your name

You keep it down low
You let it all go

You're too high

You wanna be the best

Cuz you're too high

You never touch the ground

Cuz you're too high

You're different from the rest

Cuz you're too high

You're never comin' down

Cuz you're too high

You wanna be the best

Cuz you're too high

You never touch the ground

Cuz you're too high

You're different from the rest

Cuz you're too high

You wanna be the best

Cuz you're too high

You never touch the ground

Cuz you're too high

You're never comin' down

You keep it down low

Haaaa!
