This is how I feel
This moment
This is how I feel
Right now

Don't know what will be tomorrow
Take it all the way
Take it all the way

I'm on the ladder
The sun is shinin'
And nothin' stands in my way
I say goodbye to the fear
Goodbye to the fear

And it don't matter, I need remindin'
Come with me, don't be afraid
And I know just why I'm here
Know just why I'm here

This is how I feel
This moment
This is how I feel
Right now

Don't know what will be tomorrow
Take it all the way
Take it all the way

I'm on a wave in the clear blue water
And theres' no cloud in the sky
And I know just what it is
And I know just what it is
Cuz I'll be safe
And you know I oughta
And I'm not livin' to die
And you know I can't resist
Know I can't resist

This is how I feel

And I know what I see
There's so many things I want to be
And I always wonder why
Just what is meant to be
And I only wanna say
Just what I really feel

This is how I feel
This moment
This is how I feel
Right now

Don't know what will be tomorrow
Take it all the way
Take it all the way
Take it all the way
