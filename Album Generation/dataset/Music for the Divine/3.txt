I'll keep the present that you bring
You know it's part of everything
Your perfume lingers in the air

There is nothing left to do
You know it's me, I know it's you

You are the ghost in every room
You always take away the gloom
You are no ordinary friend

There is nothing left to do
You know it's me, I know it's you

I'll sacrifice myself
Now don't you go away

This house
Has never known the sadness
And it's
This house
It doesn't hold a secret
Anymore
It was built on love

I'll bring a rose and juniper
We'll float away across the earth
High on a cloud we live as one

There is nothing left to do
You know it's me, I know it's you

This house
Has never known the sadness
And it's
This house
It doesn't hold a secret
Anymore
It was built on love

I'm wondering why
I wanna see your face
Cuz I can't take it anymore

We're lost in a time
And it's so hard to fake it
Will you open up the door?
This house
Has never known the sadness
And it's
This house

This house
Has never known the sadness
And it's
This house
It doesn't hold a secret

And it's
This house
It doesn't hold a secret
Anymore
It was built on love
