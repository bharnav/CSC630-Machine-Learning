You've been misled
By the thoughts in your head
Entangled with your dark endeavor
Your angels tread
And the blood has been shed
I'm telling you it's now or never

Lost in a stream
With you own malady
For as long as you know
And forever
In god you depend
When it comes to the end
Such a long way to go
Such a long way to go

The valiant denial
The great untold
The valiant denial
The lies unfold
The valiant denial
The great untold

I wonder why

And you never reply
It's always the same with your ego
Caught in a lie
I just cannot rely
You're filled with the shame
But you don't know

You raise the shield
You will never be healed
Such a long way to go
Such a long way to go

The valiant denial
The great untold
The valiant denial
The lies unfold
The valiant denial
The great untold

The valiant denial
