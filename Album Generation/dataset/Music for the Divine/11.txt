I don't, really want to suffer
Earthquake, in the engine room
You scream, you don't get enough a
I shake, when you pack the boom

You don't relay
You don't accept
You will be swept away
I won't delay
I only want to say

I'll tell you something for nothin'
I'm not your monkey man
Now I'm gonna send you a letter
Cuz I'm not your monkey man

It's so real
It's so real
It's so real

Glad rags, you have got me thinking
You creep behind my back
My bags have been packed, I'm swearin'
I reap, just what you lack

I won't delay
I only want to say

I'll tell you something for nothin'
I'm not your monkey man
Now I'm gonna write you a letter
Cuz I'm not your monkey man

It's for real
It's for real
It's for real

You don't relay
You don't accept
You will be swept away
I won't delay
I only want to say

I'll tell you something for nothin'
I'm not your monkey man
Now I'm gonna send you a letter
Cuz I'm not your monkey man

I'll tell you something for nothin'
I'm not your monkey man
Now I'm gonna write you a letter
Cuz I'm not your monkey man

It's for real
It's for real
It's for rea
