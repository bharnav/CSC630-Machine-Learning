Down in Saint Jude's hall, you star in a play
You're ready to free fall, the children do say
Euphoric recall will take you away

Underneath your skin

I know that you travel, on your astral plane
The deepest respect, can your hear my refrain
So nice to meet you, when I was in Spain

Underneath my skin
Here it comes again

Say yeah, yeah yeah

You got soul
You got soul

You ain't done nothin' wrong
The flesh is weak, but the spirit is strong

You got soul
You got soul

I knew it all along
Your eyes do speak, when I sing my song

The Dalai Lama do whisper and say
Deep in your karma the demon you slay
You be the one and you blow me away

Underneath my skin
Here it comes again

Say yeah, yeah yeah

You got soul
You got soul

You ain't done nothin' wrong
The flesh is weak, but the spirit is strong

You got soul
You got soul

I knew it all along
Your eyes do speak, when I sing my song

Underneath my skin
Here it comes again

Say yeah, yeah yeah

You got soul
You got soul

You ain't done nothin' wrong
The flesh is weak, but the spirit is strong

You got soul
You got soul

I knew it all along
Your eyes do speak, when I sing my song
