You fly with the locust
Down in the western sky line
But you're out of focus
In every way you design

The crux of the matter
You've taken the life of my friend
Her dreams you did shatter
They're takin' you down to the end

You always wanted to be right
You never wanted to stay
You are a soul burnin' too bright
Your guardian angel did say

Into the black light, you will go
Into the black light, you will know

I hope you can hear me
You lie alone in your cell
And you never be free
You live in your own private hell

I know Johnny Lennon, is watching the curse of your fate
There's too many people
Too frightened to speak
Of your hate

You are a soul burnin' too bright
Your guardian angel did say

Into the black light, you will go
Into the black light, you will know

You always wanted to be right
You never wanted to stay
You are a soul burnin' too bright
Your guardian angel did say

Into the black light, you will go
Into the black light, you will know

Into the black light, you will go
