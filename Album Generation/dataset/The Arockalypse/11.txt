[Verse 1]
You've been pushed around
Until you mumble
Beaten to the ground
But you won't crumble

[Pre-Chorus]
They strike you dumb, they bring you down
They keep you on the losing end
They tell your right is wrong, your high is low
Give 'em hell

[Chorus]
Kick up a row, we're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the phantoms
Deal out the blows, like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none

They can't make you out
That makes you bogus
They think they know what we're about
But they just don't know us

[Pre-Chorus]
They strike you dumb, they bring you down
They keep you on the losing end
They tell your right is wrong, your high is low
Give 'em hell

[Chorus]
Kick up a row, we're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the phantoms
Deal out the blows, like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none

[Chorus] 2x
Kick up a row, we're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the phantoms
Deal out the blows, like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none
