[Verse 1]
You did the trick
I didn't see it coming
I did not hear a sound
Though you were quick
I will not be forgiven

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't be waiting
For my return
I promise, baby
You'll burn

[Chorus]
Now it snows in hell!
This is the day fortold til death do us part
Now it snows in hell!
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred

[Verse 2]
Your life goes on
And it's infuriating
How did you not get caught?
Your deed will spawn
A fate beyond your making

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't be waiting
For my return
I promise, baby
You'll burn

[Chorus]
Now it snows in hell!
This is the day fortold til death do us part
Now it snows in hell!
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred

[Bridge]
You shouldn't visit me at my grave
My hands will grab you through the dirt
I giveth, I taketh away
Witness my rebirth from the devil's churn

[Chorus] 2x
Now it snows in hell!
This is the day fortold til death do us part
Now it snows in hell!
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred
