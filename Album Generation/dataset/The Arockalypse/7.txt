[Verse 1]
You know you saw them, but no one ever listens
They'll be long gone by the time the sun has risen
You feel 'em lurking, hear 'em howling in the shadows
Wreaking havoc on your perfect world
They are the tricking trolls
They've got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of your sight

[Chorus]
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!

[Verse 2]
The shadows breathe with a venom like no other
A silent evil where there shouldn't be another, no, no
I feel 'em lurking, hear 'em howling in the shadows
Wreaking havoc on my perfect world
They are the tricking trolls
They've got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of my sight

[Chorus]
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)

[Bridge]
Don't know what's at stake
I think they're right beside me
Gotta stay awake
And keep them all from biting

[Chorus] 2x
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)
They only come out at night (They only come out at night!)

[Outro]
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!
They only come out at night!
