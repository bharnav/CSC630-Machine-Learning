[Verse 1]
Now beware the streets tonight
Lay low til the sunrise
The undead casanovas hunt for love
Lock the doors, drop the blinds
Keep quiet and stay inside
But nothing helps when push comes to shove

[Pre-Chorus]
Bequeath thy loving, my body's cold
I take you in my coffin where you can kiss my bones

[Chorus]
On the night of the loving dead
Love the un-living, no skins attached
On the night of the loving dead
The night of the loving dead

[Verse 2]
Dressing sharp, all natural
Looking drop dead gorgeous
Sins of the rotten flesh for you to hold
My caress is terminal
Cause my touch is torture
There's no way in hell I'd let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Bequeath thy loving, my body's cold
I take you in my coffin where you can kiss my bones

[Chorus]
On the night of the loving dead
Love the un-living, no skins attached
On the night of the loving dead
The night of the loving dead

[Bridge]
Six feet underground
If I had a heart you would make it pound
You make the dead come alive

[Chorus] 2x
On the night of the loving dead
Love the un-living, no skins attached
On the night of the loving dead
The night of the loving dead
