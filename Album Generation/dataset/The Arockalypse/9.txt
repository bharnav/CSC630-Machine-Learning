[Verse 1]
Pigtails, the cutest smiles
But it's all delusion
Kneesocks, the sweetest eyes
It's just a grand illusion

[Pre-Chorus]
When they're bad
They just get badder
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens will shed their skin

[Chorus]
All the naughty Lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good..
Good to be bad!

[Verse 2]
She-Hulk's in a girl disguise
You'll fall into confusion
Now they might play it nice
But you're heading for an execution

[Pre-Chorus]
When they're bad
They just get badder
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens will shed their skin

[Chorus]
All the naughty Lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good..
Good to be bad!

[Bridge]
All the naughty Lordi girls
They know it's good..
They know it's good..

[Chorus] 2x
All the naughty Lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good..
Good to be bad!
