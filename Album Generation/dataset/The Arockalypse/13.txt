[Verse 1]
Your shindig's kinda boring
Shall I spike the punch with cyanide?
Well I gotta warn you
You'll need a coroner tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
If you see me, better flee me
If you hear me, better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer into the fire

[Chorus]
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
I'm the death of every party
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
And I don't care if you don't like me, no!

[Verse 2]
I'm here to fix your troubles
Brute force applied with some finesse
When people are the problem
My hatchet always works the best (Oh, yes it will)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you see me, better flee me
If you hear me, better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer into the fire

[Chorus]
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
I'm the death of every party
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
And I don't care if you don't like me, no

[Bridge]
I made you suffer and that doesn't feel right
I thought my knife would snuff you out like a light
How rude of me, a quick be-heading will end your fright

[Chorus] 2x
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
I'm the death of every party
Na na na na na, calling Mr. Killjoy
And I don't care if you don't like me, no, no!
