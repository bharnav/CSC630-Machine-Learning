[Intro]
Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand beauty of the beast?
Fire at will, will, will, will

[Verse 1]
Fire at will
Yeah, I would kill
Yeah, I would freeze all hell over just to get a chill
Yeah, I would slay
Yeah, I would maim
Yeah, I would vanish in thin air and reappear again
Be right in the squares, yeah, I would be sincere
Yeah, I would lie
Yeah, I would lie
Yeah, I would be there waking up the dead to get a thrill
I say yeah!
I say yeah!

[Chorus]
Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you
Would you do it all, do it all for me?

[Verse 2]
Take your time, you'll be fine
Yeah, there is nothing wrong with this, you ain't committing crime
You don't know why it passed you by
You search for something never found along these lines
Someday you may turn around and terrify
You can't deny, you crucify
Would you get down in the gutter, swallowing your pride?
I say yeah!
I say yeah!

[Chorus]
Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you
Would you do it all, do it all for me?

[Bridge]
All that you get is less than you deserve
Leaving for now someday I may return

Would you love a monsterman?

[Chorus] 2x
Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you
Would you do it all, do it all for me?
