[Verse 1]
All the vixens stand in line
Waiting for my fright night
Be the new flesh for the sacrifice
Screaming out the mating call
I've become the lord of love

[Pre-Chorus]
I break your will
I'll break your will for good
I treat you like a brute

[Chorus]
Who's your daddy?
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy?
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?

[Verse 2]
She's a battle-axe in pinstripes
Get ready for your prime time
Max out the triple-X-drive
Screaming out the mating call
I've become the lord of love

[Pre-Chorus]
I break your will
I'll break your will for good
I treat you like a brute

[Chorus]
Who's your daddy?
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?

[Post-Chorus]
Get down, get down
Lay down, lay down
Stay down, stay down
For daddy!

Get down, get down
Lay down, lay down
Stay down, stay down
Ooh! Ooh!

[Bridge] 2x
Who's your daddy?
Say, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?
Girl, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Who keeps you in line?

[Chorus] 2x
Who's your daddy?
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy?
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?
