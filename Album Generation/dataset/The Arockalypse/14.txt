[Verse 1]
I gave you deep red roses
The thorns cut your hands
We are an owl and a mouse's doomed romance

Now I would like to fondle
But my nails rip your skin
My most tender kiss pricks your lips like pins

[Pre-Chorus]
Your cries, they make no difference
I'll always love you the same
Now I try to restrain myself
Cause my affection means pain

[Chorus]
Honey, honey, lemme hug you like a spider
Honey, honey, lemme give you evilove
Honey, honey, lemme kiss you like a viper
Open up your heart, receive my evilove

[Verse 2]
Our night in Paris with candles
Ended up in flames
And cupids' arrow mangled your pretty face

I wanna be your dream-date
Who takes away your breath
But I'm the man of your nightmares, the gentleman death

[Pre-Chorus]
Your cries, they make no difference
I'll always love you the same
Now I try to restrain myself
Cause my affection means pain

[Chorus]
Honey, honey, lemme hug you like a spider
Honey, honey, lemme give you evilove
Honey, honey, lemme kiss you like a viper
Open up your heart, receive my evilove

[Bridge]
Honey, honey, lemme hug you like a spider
Honey, honey, lemme give you evilove
Honey, honey, lemme kiss you like a viper
Open up your heart, receive my evilove
Evilove, evilove..

[Chorus] 2x
Honey, honey, lemme hug you like a spider
Honey, honey, lemme give you evilove
Honey, honey, lemme kiss you like a viper
Open up your heart, receive my evilove

[Outro]
Receive my evilove
Receive my evilove
Receive my evilove
