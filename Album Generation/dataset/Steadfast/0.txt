There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love

Just the two of us
And nobody else insight
There's nobody else
And I'm feeling good just holding you tight

So listen very carefully
Get closer now
And you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream

The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
"I love you forever and ever"

There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
People just like us are falling in love

So listen very carefully
Get closer now
And you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream

The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
"I love you forever and ever"

There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
People just like us are falling in love
All over the world
People just like us are falling in love
