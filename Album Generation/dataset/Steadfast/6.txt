Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms
Of the sea, yeah

Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be comin' home
Wait for me

Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered
Hungered for your touch
Oh, a long, lonely time

And I know that time
Goes by
So slowly
And time
Time can do so much

Are you
Still mine?
I need your love
I, I need your love
God's speed, your love
To me
