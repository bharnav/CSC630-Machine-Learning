Doo doo doo down doo be do down down
Come on come on
Down doo be do down down
Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me

Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'cause breaking up is hard to do

Remember you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on babe let's start a new
'cause breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
I wish that we are making up again

I beg of love away from me

Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'cause breaking up is hard to do
