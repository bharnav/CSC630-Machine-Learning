[Verse]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end waitin' 'round the bend
My Huckleberry friend, moon river and me

Two drifters, off to see the world
And there's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end waitin' 'round the bend
My Huckleberry friend, moon river and me
