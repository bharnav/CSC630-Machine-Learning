It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you goin' through me?
Split the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushin' to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more?
It's just impossible

And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love is just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you goin' through me?
Split the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushin' to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more?
It's just impossible

And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love is just impossible

Impossible, impossible
