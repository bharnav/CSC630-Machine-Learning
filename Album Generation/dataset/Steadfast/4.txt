My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I give for you
My heart or wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes and dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayer, my hope, my schemes
You owned my every dream
But it's only make, make believe

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayer, my hope, my schemes
My everything
But it's only make
It's only make believe
