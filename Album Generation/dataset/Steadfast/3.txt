I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello

You wished me well
You couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you and you said, "So long"
And left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, oh, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?

You don't love me
And I'll always be

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now, now that you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying

Crying, crying, crying, crying, crying
You left me crying, crying, crying
Crying, crying, crying alone and crying
