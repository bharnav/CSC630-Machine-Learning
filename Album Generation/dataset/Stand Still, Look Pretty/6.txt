Got my headlights shining
Down an old dirt road
Smoke my cigarettes
I should quit I know

The radio's playing
Old country songs
Someone's leaving
Someone's cheating
On and on

I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'Cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt road

See, I left another
Good man tonight
I wonder if he'll miss me
Lord knows I tried

But I think that maybe
The thing that I did wrong
Was put up with his bullshit
For far too long

I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'Cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt road

I ain't gonna sleep, I don't wanna dream
About the things that I used to need
I ain't gonna cry or go on living lies
I'm just gonna drive

'Cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me
Someday I won't have to prove
All my worth
But until then I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes

'Cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt road
