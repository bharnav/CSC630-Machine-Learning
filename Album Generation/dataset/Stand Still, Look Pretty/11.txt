[Chorus]
Only crazy people
Fall in love with me
They come from all over
To be with me
Bank robbers and killers
Drunks and drug dealers
Only crazy people
Fall in love with me

[Verse 1]
He came from Carolina
On a west-bound freight train
He didn't have no ticket
But he got here the same
He left me a reminder
With nine months to go
That's why I killed his wife
And wrecked up his home

[Chorus 2]
He fled Mississippi
With me at his side
A trunk full of money
And no place to hide
Well he loved his whiskey
And his fist loved my face
So I buried that man
And they won't find a trace

[Outro]
Only crazy people
Fall in love with me
