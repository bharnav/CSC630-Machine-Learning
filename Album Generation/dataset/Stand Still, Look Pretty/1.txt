Somewhere in the country
There's a place
Where nobody knows your name

When I'm feeling lonely there's a train
That helps me run away

(Chorus)
I know my mother
She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home

Somewhere in the city
There's a face
That makes it hard to stay

He never listened to me
When I'd say
That things would never change

(Chorus)
The way back home
The way back home

(Chorus)
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home
