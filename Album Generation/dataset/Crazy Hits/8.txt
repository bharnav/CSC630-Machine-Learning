Pump up the Jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look at here, the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my make, make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my make, make my day

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my make, make my day

Make my day
Make my day
Make my make, make my day

Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get your party getting on the dance floor
See cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Pump up the jam punp it up
A pump it up, pump it
Pump up the jam, pump it up
A pump it up, pump it up
Pump up the jam, punp it up
A pump it up, pump it
Pump up the jam
Pump it Pump it Pump it Pump it!
