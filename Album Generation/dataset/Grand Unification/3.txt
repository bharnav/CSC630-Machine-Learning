Sleep well tonight
I'll wake you t the first sign of light
If you make sure you sleep well tonight

Take care, stay with us
All you've seen has gone
If you dream the truth will all come clear

Put me up just to make a stand

If you could take a lifetime away
And make me come back down
If you could take the hours then
Maybe we could fall apart
I could stay the same

Sleep well tonight
I'll wake you t the first sign of light
If you make sure you sleep well tonight

We fell like everyone else has
Our mark
Will show where we were for our last time

We'll carve the mark to remember this

If we could take a lifetime away
And make us come back down
If you could take the hours then
Maybe we could fall apart
I could stay here

Sleep well tonight
Sleep well tonight

If we could take away the summit
We could climb the highest we've ever been to
If you could take away the summit
