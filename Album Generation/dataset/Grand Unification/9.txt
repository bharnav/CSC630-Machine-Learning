If time can break us down
Not keep us around
I won't wait
I won't mind
Not this time

I've started up the clocks
It's time I left behind
And everything we've lost
Disappears

(I'm calling, I'm calling out)
I've started up the race
(For answers on the long walk home)
It's something I can't change
(I'm calling, I'm calling out)
And now we're not the same
(For answers on the long walk home)

I'm running past the words
To finish up the faults
(Can't come back)
I won't wait
(Won't live like that)
Not this time

I've started up the clocks
It's time I left behind
And everything we've lost
Disappears

(I'm calling, I'm calling out)
I've started up the race
(For answers on the long walk home)
It's something I can't change
(I'm calling, I'm calling out)
And now we're not the same
(For answers on the long walk home)

(Scream)[?]
(Scream)[?]

(I'll find myself once more again)
I've started up this race
(I'll find myself once more again)
It's something I can't change
Now we're not the same
(I can't help by myself again)
