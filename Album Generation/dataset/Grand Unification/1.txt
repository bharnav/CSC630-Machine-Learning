Covered and coarse
I could wait my turn
Too pay them all back
So Original
Let's take it all back
You could hide but I won't, how do you know?

I can't believe it!
Take it away!
One look and you'll never leave
Cause this can't hold, us down

If I wake up
On my own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go

If you never know
It can never hurt
As much as this does
It's so original
Let's make this all work
You can run but I won't, how do you know?

I can't believe it!
Take it away!
One look and you'll never leave
Cause this won't hold us down

If I wake up
On my own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go on

You can't hold us down
This won't hold us down
You can't hold us down

If you wake up
On your own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go
I hope you're happy on your own
