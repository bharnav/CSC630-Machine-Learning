We'll hold this off to build these machines

Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder

Just look out of your window and you'll find us here
We can make a stand to stop the uproars
If you can fight in wars for that

Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder

If you could give us the answers now

Help us to end all the suffering
We'll clean the blood from all of our eyes
Take the rage away from us

If you could give us the answers now

We could crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder

I hope that in time that I'm okay with all of this. X2

Don't you make me cry

Crush
