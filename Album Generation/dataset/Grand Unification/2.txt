I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for anything

I'm alone and self-anaemic
But sometimes you wake up
If I could hold this hope inside my hands
You'd understand they let us down

I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for anything

I won't waste a moment
I won't waste a moment with fear

We're alone or self-anaemic
But sometimes we win

I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for anything

I won't waste a moment
I won't waste a moment

I could run
I could run
I could run
I could run
Let me go

Just cover up your eyes
So I can make sense of it all
Waking me up
Just shut your eyes
So I can make sense of it all
