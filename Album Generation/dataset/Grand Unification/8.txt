Would you change this all if you'd had your way
Waking up in darkness must have been hard
Finding all these moments burned into reminisce
Desperaltely you crawl and ask yourself

If you could just open your eyes
If you could just open your eyes

Foe everyone's sake
For everyone's sake
Stay away from here
For everyone's sake
I got left behind
For eveyone's sake
Stay away from here

Making sense of senses you never found
Clutching on to dust as hope becomes clearer
People breathing air in hope of a perfect world
All these chances you could make it all fit

If you could just open your eyes
If you could just open your eyes

Foe everyone's sake
For everyone's sake
Stay away from here
For everyone's sake
I got left behind
For eveyone's sake
Stay away from here

If you could just open you eyes
