If you have the answers to all of my questions
Why are you her
Turn around, face me now
I promise you they'll let you in

I don't mean to make you so upset
But the air is so thin and I'm losing sleep

Blackened and unrested
Replace your armour to make this stand

Bring me round to let me down
Take this for ever so I can sleep quiet
I'll wait around to let you in
What has begun

I don't mean to make you so upset
But the air is so thin and I'm losing sleep

I don't mean to make you so upset
But the air is so thin and I'm losing sleep

Wake Up

You laid me down to sleep
