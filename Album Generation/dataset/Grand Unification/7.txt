I'm not from around here
I'll hold on to you but
I can't hold on to this day its all gone
Waiting always untouched open
It cam down to save us and end us all
Cause im under the outside
And over all
Cause im a thousand miles away
And im out of oxygen
And im falling faster than id like to be
And im closer to the sky
Than ill ever be to you again
Find the exit signs and disappear
We were hated it seems we were all wrong
Find me bleeding peacefulness
We looked up to lose our way again
Cause im under the outside
And over all
Cause im a thousand miles away
And im out of oxygen
And im falling faster than id like to be
And im closer to the sky
Than ill ever be to you again
Find the exit signs and disappear
Somethings dont, somethings dont
Somethings dont, somethings dont
Change
Fall
Born from angels
Lets start this all over again
With the same generation
Born from angels
Lets start this all over again
With the same declaration
Born from angels
Lets start this all over again
With the same generation
It's neon-genesis
