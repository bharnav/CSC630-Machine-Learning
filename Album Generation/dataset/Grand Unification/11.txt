With all apologies you wake me up
You hold the porcelain to take me home

Hold my hand until the waves come
Hold my hand until the waves come

This is our last, take care love
It won't stop, it won't stop a thing

The waves come
Just hold my hand until the waves come around

Kids doing it becasue - you know - the physics is intuative. Grade school kids know about Black HOles
And they might want to know: "Well, gosh, what happens if I drop a Black Hole in a Black Hole?")
