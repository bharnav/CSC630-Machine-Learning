It's strange that I should meet you here
It's obvious we're desperate to comprehend the time that we have left
Even if we could
You would understand this conversation is the end of us

It hasn't been perfect for a long time
Now we're here again
You were just not supposed to hear this from the other side

The way we were
When we weren't the ghosts we've become
And even if we realised
A part of you is missing every time
You seem to wake yourself up

It hasn't been perfect for a long time
Now we're here again
You were just not supposed to hear this from the other side

If you fight it hard enough
You'll find a way to come back down
It takes all these memories
To be turned around and lived again
To go on and on and on and on

It had to be perfect for the first time
Now we're here again
You were just not supposed to hear this from the other side

(On and on till we're)
It had to be perfect for the last time
(Here again)
Now we're here again
(On and on till we're)
You were just not supposed to hear this
(Here again)
From the other side
