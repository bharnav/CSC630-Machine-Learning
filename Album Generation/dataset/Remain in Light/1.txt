[Verse 1]
Lost my shape
Trying to act casual
Can't stop
I might end up in the hospital
Changing my shape
I feel like an accident
They're back
To explain their experience

[Bridge]
Isn't it weird
Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away
That was the policy

[Verse 2]
I'm ready to leave
I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost
Facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there!
No information left of any kind
Lifting my head
Looking for danger signs

[Bridge]
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us

[Refrain]
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting

[Bridge]
The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

[Verse 3]
The island of doubt
It's like a taste of medicine
Working by hindsight
Got the message from the oxygen
M-M-Making a list
Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right
Facts are useful in emergencies

[Bridge]
The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

[Verse 4]
Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are lame
Facts don't come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of men

[Refrain]
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
