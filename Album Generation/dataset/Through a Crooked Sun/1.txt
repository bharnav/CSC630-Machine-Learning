Hey, there fear, you're always in tow
Never too far behind, your presence is always known

Will you live to carry on living underneath my wing
Or will you finally move along, watch distance grow between?
Hey fear, hey fear, time to finally move along
Watch the distance grow between

Hey there fear, you've been there for me
A familiar voice in a raging sea

Will you live to carry on living underneath my wing
Or will you finally move along, watch distance grow between?
Hey fear, hey fear, time to finally move along
Watch the distance grow between
