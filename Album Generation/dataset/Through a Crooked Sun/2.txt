Hey there, Fear
You're always in tow
Never too far behind
Your presence is always known
Will you live to carry on
Living underneath my wing
Will you finally move along?
Watch the distance come between
Hey Fear, Hey Fear
Time to finally move along
Watching distance grow between

Hey there, Fear
You've been there for me
A familar voice
In a raging sea
Will you live to carry on?
Living underneath my wing
Will you finally move along
Watching distance come between
Hey Fear, Hey Fear
Time to finally move along
Watching distance grow between
