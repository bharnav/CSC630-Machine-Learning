I hear you're falling again and you're bringing me down
But that's not where I'm going
There's no one around you this time but you haven't noticed yet
When you do, will you speak softly?

This time I'm rolling, no bringing me down
With all the news I've been hearing, it's all over town
Tells of a sad man, who doesn't know he's out
He spends his time reeling in a world of doubt

Back when you told me a lie
Do you realize you're looking straight in a mirror?
Far be it from me to explain what you're doing now
Will go on and on forever

This time I'm rolling, no bringing me down
With all the news I've been hearing, it's all over town
Tells of a sad man, who doesn't know he's out
He spends his time reeling in a world of doubt

Back when you told me a lie
Do you realize you're looking straight in a mirror?
Far be it from me to explain
What you're doing now will go on and on forever

This time I'm rolling, no bringing me down
With all the news I've been hearing, it's all over town
Tells of a sad man, who doesn't know he's out
He spends his time reeling in a world of doubt
