The tides are turning, there rolling in
The seas of past lives tell me where I’ve been
I’ve seen the shelter from deep inside
And watch my spirit come out and fly
Chorus
Here with me in this drifting story of our lives
I’ll follow you down to the places lost but never found
So as the telling goes, I wonder what was shown
To you will be living in this number
In the deepest part of night I lie awake in awe
Of paths that lie in front of me
Are they blocked by fear or apathy
Unlike an eagle getting water
Chorus
Here with me in this drifting story of our lives
I’ll follow you down to the places lost but never found
(Double intro lick) ad lib lead
Here with me in this drifting story of our lives
I’ll follow you down to the places lost but never found
You’re here with me, you’re here with me, you’re here me
You’re here with me in the places lost but never found
