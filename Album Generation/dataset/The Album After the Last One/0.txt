Its no joke, being stony broke
Canʼt afford no tinsel for the tree
I know i should buy a christmas pud, but i ain't got no money
We all get the itch, to be filthy rich
I knew that i would never make a mint
For sure i am poor, but i never thought iʼd be this skint
Do we wanna party, nooooo
Do we wanna celebrate
Do we wanna party, nooooo
Do you wanna celebrate, we don't wanna celebrate
Christmas

Chorus:
Here comes a credit crunch christmas a credit crunch
Oh no mistletoe, crackers or a turkey oh
Here comes a credit crunch christmas a credit crunch
Gloomy locked in, blue till boxinʼ day
Carol singers, thereʼs nowt worse
Sittinʼ in the dark and penniless
Knockinʼ at the door, can't take anymore, iʼm gonna kill good
King wenceslas
Heatings off, nothing left to scoff
I darednt turn the fairy lights on
It sucks when ya stuck in a christmas recession
Chorus, guitar bit and stuff
Now
