Dont drive your car up draycott avenue
If you do you'll regret it
An hgv will come the other way
You'll still be there next pancake tuesday
Staring up the ridgeway wishing you were home
With your feet up watching tv
Want to arrive in style go an extra mile
Take the fryent way instead
Dont drive your car up draycott avenue
If you do you'll regret it
Time it wrong catch the mums on the school run
You'll just sit there twiddling your thumbs
Watching mum getting lairy at the kids on the backseat
Pumped up on suggery snacks
Its much less stress lighten your load
Take the watford road instead
Dont drive your car up draycott avenue
If you do you'll regret it
You'll get boxed in front and behind
They'll be out their cars exchanging hand signs
Air turning blue with a stream of abuse
But everbodys stuck so its no use
Its much less stress clear your head
Best take the tube instead
Dont drive your car up draycott avenue
If you do you'll regret it
An hgv will come the other way
You'll still be there next pancake tuesday
Staring up the ridgeway wishing you were home
With your feet up watching tv
Clear your head its much less stress
Best take the tube instead
Clear your head its much less stress
Best take the tube instead
