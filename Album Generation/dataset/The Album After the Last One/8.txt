He, decca, told me, decca said he won't be drinkin’
We, know it ain't true, decca ain't foolin’ me or you
At the bar, deccas here, he’s gone too far. I need another beer
A goon, a nut, a liver shot gut
Till ya get another round in he’s gonna stay put
Chorus
Oh decca no, deccas doctor said
Stay away from the pub, think of tomorrow
Oh decca no, deccas drunk instead
Don't be dumb drunken decca don't die
He, decca’s possessed, he’s george best, never sober
Me, i’ll have a swift half, he says yer havin’ a laugh, you ain't with me
Half past ten, he can't stand up, pissed again, i need another sup
A sip, a drop, he’s never gonna stop
Now the doctors dreadin’ decca when deccas on the pop
Guitar etc
Don't be dumb drunken decca
Drunk dumb drunken decca
And oh decca no decca
