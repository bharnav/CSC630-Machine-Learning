Molly marked the end, of her rotten marriage
When she began to spend, her time round the garage
A libido & lots, hey hey hey, more than elsie tanners
Molly had the hots, for kevins tools & spanners
The devil with his dungarees on
Kevin was giving molly one
Chorus
Everywhere that tyrone goes they say mollyâ€™s wicked
Since kevin had his leg over
And everyone that tyrone knows call kevin his best pal
And she was immoral molly
Molly had her plans, hey hey hey, brazenly got the balls
To get her filthy hands, inside kevins overalls
She went in a huff, started being grumpy
Coz she was up the duff, from having rumpy pumpy
The devil, chorus
Guitar bit
The devil
Chorus
Chorus repeat
