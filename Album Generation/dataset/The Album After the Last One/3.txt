Down on the street where kevin’s house stands
You’ll never meet none of his soft pans- y kids there
They’re nowhere to be seen
He’s keeps them locked indoors all day
Nobody knocks no more to play, with kevs kids
Coz hes got them hidden away
We get bullied on the bus
Too cowardly to discuss
Were kevin’s kids us
Chorus
We are, cry babies, they’re softies coz kevin
We are, cotton wool kids, cotton wool kids, cotton wool kids, cotton wools kids
They’re sissys, coz what he’s wrapped them in
Comics and cds no chance when
Watching the tvs forbidden, he says blue-
Peters too violent
He follows them to the bog and back
A mollicoddling maniac, soft as crap
Cotton wool wrapped by kevin
We get bullied on the bus…
