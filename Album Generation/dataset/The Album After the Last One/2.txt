Gimme a B
Gimme an E
Gimme an b
Gimme an R
Oh my head hurts like a bastard, but i'll do it again
Open up the door and i'll walk right in
Cos when your friends start calling the beer starts pouring again
And when the beer starts pouring we all start rolling again
Gimme a B
Gimme an E
Gimme an E
Gimme an R
Oh my head hurts like a bastard, but i'll do it again
Open up the door and i'll walk right in
And when the music gets pumping we all get jumping again
When your friends start calling the beer starts pouring again
The beer starts pouring we all get rolling again
The music starts pumping we all get jumping again
