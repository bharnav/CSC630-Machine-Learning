Maggie thatcher don’t scare me, even though she’s a tory
Alistair darlings a con, still i watch him when the budgets on
He’s a moron, he’s monotonous, gormless gordon bores the pants off us…

Chorus:
Norman tebbit, give him credit, neil kinnock he knew
Gordon, gordon
Tony blair, its only fair, there’s nothing he could do
Gordon, gordon
Gordon makes me yawn, woooo, gordon gets me down, woooo
And now we’ve had enough of gordon, boring, boring gordon brown
Cameron he made no sense, at the party con, conference
He’s a nerd and he’s a creep, least he doesn't send me to sleep
Hes a moron…
Chorus
Guitar bit
Id rather listen to than not, an interview with john prescott
Tedious and dull no less, whatever boring gordon says
Hes a moron
Chorus…
