Miles from nowhere
I guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

Look up at the mountain
I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there

Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end

Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

I creep through the valleys
And I grope through the woods
’cause I know when I find it my honey
It’s gonna make me feel good

I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, I’ll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it’s alright

I have my freedom
I can make my own rules
Oh yeah, the ones that I choose

Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end

I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, I’ll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
