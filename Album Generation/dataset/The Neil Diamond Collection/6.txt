Mmmmmmmm
I got a song been on my mind
And the tune can be sung
And the words all rhyme
Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet
Deet deet deedle dee doo

Though it don't say much
And it won't offend
If you sing it at school
They're liable to send you home
Never knowin' what you're showin'
Think you're growin' your own tea
Good Lordy

Let me hear that get me near that
Crunchy Granola Suite
Drop your shrink and stop your drinkin'
Crunchy granola's neat
Sing it out
Alright
Da da da da
Da da da da da
Dee dee dee dum

I know a man was outta touch
And he'd hide in a house
And he didn't say much
Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet
Deet deet deedle dee doo

And like a man
With a tiger outside his gate
He not only couldn't relax
But he couldn't relate
Now he can, family man
Tried my brand
Dig

Let me hear that get me near that
Crunchy Granola Suite
Drop your shrink and stop your drinkin'
Crunchy granola's neat
Sing it out
Alright
Da da da da
Da da da da da
Dee dee dee do
Deedle-ee dum dum
I'll have a double please
