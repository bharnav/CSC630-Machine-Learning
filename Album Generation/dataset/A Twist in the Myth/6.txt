Can you tell me is there any other way?
I cannot hide it
I have doubts
I'm not afraid to stay

I'm here when the curtain falls
Once I've touched the rainbow
The man on the moon will appear
I won't show fear

I turn to you, father death
I am begging you, please
Consider, you may have been wrong

Just close your eyes now
Just close your eyes now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air

There's magic everywhere
Just be aware
Wake up when the crow will call

There is no truth
There are no rules
There's no plot here
It's twisted
We're still on course my friend
Down to the abyss - Orcus lane
Shelter of your memories
Shelter of your pain

The mirror shows truth
Reveals what you are
A phoenix in flames
Arise from the ashes again
We're on our way now
We're on our way now

We sail through miracles
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air

I feel there is something wrong
It's twisting and turning
When everything's burning awake
It's not safe

I'm coming down to you again
We'll sail on miracles and then
If you don't mind I'll sing a song
A sort of lullaby this time

When you're asleep I'm back again
A world of miracles in hand
If you don't mind I'll sing a song
A sort of lullaby this time

We're on our way now
We're on our way now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air

There's magic everywhere
Just be aware
Wake up when the crow will call
Wake up when the crow will call
