[Verse 1]
I don't want to be the filler
If the void is solely yours
I don't want to be your glass
Of single malt whiskey hidden in the bottom drawer
I don't want to be a bandage
If the wound is not mine
Lend me some fresh air
I don't want to be adored
For what I merely represent to you
I don't want to be your babysitter
You're a very big boy now
I don't want to be your mother
I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months
Show me the back door

[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well I
Already know that you'd find
Some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor

[Verse 2]
I don't want to be the sweeper
Of the egg shells that you walk upon
And I don't want to be your other half
I believe that one and one make two
I don't want to be your food or the light
From the fridge on your face at midnight, hey
What are you hungry for?
I don't want to be the glue
That holds your pieces together
I don't want to be your idol
See this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights
I don't want to be lived through
A vicarious occasion
Please, open the window

[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well I...
Already know that you'd find
Some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor

[Verse 3]
I don't want to live on someday
When my motto is last week, and I
I don't want to be responsible
For your fractured heart and it's wounded beat
I don't want to be a substitute
For the smoke you've been inhaling
What do you thank me...
What do you thank me for?

[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well I...
Already know that you'd find
Some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor
