[Verse 1]
If something has to change, then it always does
If something has to change, then it always does
You don't need this disease, not right now
No, you don't need this disease, not right now

[Chorus]
Oh, you don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease

[Verse 2]
If something has to give, then it always will
If something has to give, then it always will
You don't need this disease, not right now
No, you don't need this disease
Not right now, no, no, not right now

[Chorus]
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease

[Bridge]
Would you fall down?
Would you fall, would you fall, would you fall down?
Would you fall down?

[Chorus]
Oh, you don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't

[Outro]
You won't fall down
