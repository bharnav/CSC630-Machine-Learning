[Verse 1]
With my eyes closed
I'll look closer
I'll always
Remember

[Bridge]
Juggernauts screaming to a stop
Sound like devils are laughing

[Chorus]
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

[Verse 2]
These dark pubs
We drink in
Somehow light up
When I'm with you

[Chorus]
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

[Outro]
For myself
For myself
For myself
Self, self
