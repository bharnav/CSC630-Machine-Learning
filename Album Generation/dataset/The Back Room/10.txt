[Verse 1]
Distance, I'll keep my distance
These things I never seem to mean
So I'll leave the murder scene

[Verse 2]
Honey, what got broken
Won't go back together again
So I'll leave this while I can

[Chorus]
Here
Here
Here
Here

[Verse 2]
Nothing to be scared of
My dreams they keep a hold of me
My guide when I can't see

[Verse 3]
Come, I will be there
I'm sure you're passing the test
I wish you all the best

[Chorus]
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
