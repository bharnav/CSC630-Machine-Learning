[Verse 1]
Someone said they saw you in the night and on your own
There's beauty in the lonely
You're the moonlight in this town

[Verse 2]
Seems like every moment is another from before
Your eyes have nothing behind them
Your arms and legs are sore

[Chorus]
Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I

[Verse 3]
Someone said they saw you
Said they saw it as a sign
Well every single second catches up the next in line

[Chorus]
Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I

Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I

[Outro]
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
