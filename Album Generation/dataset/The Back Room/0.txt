[Verse 1]
I still love the light on, baby
It keeps me awake, but I don't mind
Everything I always wanted
Is right there, but soon it won't be

[Chorus]
Oh, if fortune favours the brave
I am as poor as they come
I've got a million things to say
I've got a million things to

[Verse 1]
I still love the light on, baby
It keeps me awake, but I don't mind
Everything I always wanted
Is right there, but soon it won't be

[Chorus]
Oh, if fortune favours the brave
I am as poor as they come
I've got a million things to say
I've got a million things to

[Bridge]
I still love the light on, baby
I still love the light on, baby
I still love the light on, baby
I still love the light on, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, if fortune favours the brave
I am as poor as they come
I've got a million things to say
I've got a million things to

[Outro]
Ahhhh, a million things to say
A million things to say
A million things to say
A million things to say
