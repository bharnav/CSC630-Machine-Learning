[Verse 1]
I picture something, it's beautiful
It's full of life, and it is all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach, yeah
It makes me feel calm
When I'm calm, I feel good

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings

[Verse 2]
I see birds fly across the sky
And everyone's heart flies together
Food is frying and people smiling
Like there is no other way to feel good

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings

[Chorus]
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing

Can you feel
Can you feel
Can you feel that the joy it brings
And if you can feel the joy
Then you can let your self sing
I love to share my things

[Verse 3]
Cause
It brings me freedom
Freedom
Got to get you some of that freedom
It's a freedom
Cause my Heart  living in your heart  beat
Freedom
You deserve freedom
Love to feel in it beauty
Freedom
And It's all for you all for you
All for you all for you

Singing freedom

[Outro]
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone freedom
