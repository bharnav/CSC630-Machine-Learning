Verse 1:
All those who are hangin' round the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
You're like a long game token that keeps the game goin'
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back
You watch your back
You're growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keepin' secret weapons in your fanny pack
You're like my laughing gas
You got the cat to dance
You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And you're teaching us to let go
You're a wise old owl when you're the cats meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And I'd bow down to you
So grateful to the Gods for making you

Chorus:
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it

Verse 2:
You'll be standing up for equal rights of the American people
And you'll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream
You've got a front seat saved that's emblazed with your name
And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
You're not the average Joe
You're not the average Jane
You're not above or below
But you're never just plain
You never take no, personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell 'cause we're activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And we're all that is
How p-e-are-f-e-c-t your a-t-t-i-t-you-d-e be

Chorus:
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
Freestyle!

Verse 3:
When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumpin' in the water you be makin' a splash
You be keepin' your heart beat going
And you be keepin' the harmony going
Well there's an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well there's an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keepin' your back bone strong
And you be keepin' the trombone blowin'
Well every friend of mine will give each other high-fives
When your beautiful mind is to your own devices
You do what you like and you always like what you try
You touch me like an iPhone application
Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Do what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my God
You're quick to be so quotable
Damn you got a way with words
You got a magical handshake for saving the earth
You are a generous man
You are so awesome it hurts
And you are a-w-e-s-o-m-e

Chorus:
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it
Outro:
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-me
