[Verse 1]
Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
He could handle everything; he was my granddad
He grew his own food and fixed his own car
I watched it all happen in our backyard
He'd reinvent the part to fix the broken home
He restored the heart

[Chorus]
I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

[Verse 2]
If Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well he may laugh at me and he may have a lot to say
Well he might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid and be his protégé
What happened to the ground right where we are?
What happened to the family farm?

[Chorus]
I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

[Verse 3]
Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma says
He would never lose his head

[Chorus]
I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

[Verse 4]
I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a Garden of Eden
I would bless the family with the gifts that granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
Baby I'll make that guy be me
