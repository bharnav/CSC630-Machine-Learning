[Verse 1]
Who's thinking about you now?
If you were building a wall, who would tear it all down and pull you
Through?
Who's thinking about you?
Who'd care enough to send you flowers, that you could call at all hours
And give your love to?
Somebody must believe if they could see what I see
If they haven't, well they will
Baby they all will

[Verse 2]
Just when you suspect that life couldn't get no harder, something comes
Along and makes your dark day darker
The weight of it all falls on you
Who will be the one to listen when it's time to listen?
Who will be the one to miss you when you've gone missing?
Well, I do
Do I qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify?
I want to be the one to help you ignore Mr. Loneliness peeking his head
Into your door
I'm hoping you can feel me
I'm hoping you can give me a new chance, chance, yes
I'm hoping that you notice how you're blessed

[Verse 3]
I feel like starting something
I feel like calling off today to be with you
Yeah, I beleive we all do something that's familiar like a deja vu
Familiar like a deja vu
Yeah, and I know this one cause I've seen the fight and I know it love
We're giving it up
Do I quallify, quallify, quallify, quallify, quallify?

[Verse 4]
I want to be the one to help you move from Mr. Loneliness living in the
Kitchen of your home
I'm hoping you can feel me
I'm hoping that I don't run out of breath, breath, yeah

Ooh, Ooh
*whistles*

[Verse 5]
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you

When you're sleeping, darling when you're next to me
I scan you like a credit card, connecting freckles like I do the stars

[Outro]
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am
I am thinking about you
