[Verse 1]
Maybe I annoy you with my choices
Well, you annoy me sometimes too with your voice
But that ain't enough for me
To move out and move on
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love

[Verse 2]
We don't have to hurry
You can take as long as you want
I'm holding' steady
My heart's at home
With my hand behind you
I will catch you if you fall
Yeah I'm gonna love you like the woman I love

[Verse 3]
Sometimes the world can make you feel
You're not welcome anymore
And you beat yourself up
You let yourself get mad
And in those times when you stop loving'
That woman I adore
You can relax
Because, babe, I got your back
Uh, I got you
Uh, Yeah
I don't wish to change you
You've got it under control
You wake up each day different
Another reason for me to keep holding' on
I'm not attached to any way you're showing up
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love
Yeah I'm gonna love you
Oh, Yeah I'm gonna love you
Cause you're the woman I love
