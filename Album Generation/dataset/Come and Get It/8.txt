[Verse 1]
My baby drives a car
Hey!
He calls me when he wants
Hey!
I don a pair of zip-up boots (uh huh huh)
I go and shake my hair out loose (uh huh huh)
I never take my eyes off you
Oh no no, oh no no
No I don't think so

[Chorus]
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

[Verse 2]
Footloose and fancy-free
Hey! Oooh
My baby waits for me
Hey! Oooh oh oooh
He likes to put his own records on (uh huh huh)
He likes to tell me the things he's done (uh huh huh)
Such a strange way of having fun
Oh no no, oh no no
And away we go

[Chorus]
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

[Hook]
Hey, stop!

You made a promise to make me a star
(A hat, a lift)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A chat, a gift)
You made a promise to make me a star
(A drink, a kiss)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A hit, a miss)

[Chorus]
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

[Outro]
(You made a promise to make me a star)
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
All I seem to get is the other other
(You made a promise to make me a star)
This won't last for long, not forever
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
(You made a promise to make me a star)
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better
