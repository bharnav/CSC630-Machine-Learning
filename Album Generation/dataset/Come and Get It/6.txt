[Intro]
Let's run and hide

[Chorus]
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide

[Verse 1]
One single hole in the ice
We dived in with
One little glimpse, paradise
I gave into you, ooh
I knew heaven right there (right there)
One private kiss, stung my lips
Now I'm stuck on you, and who cares
I just want to do it, want to shoot
'Cause you're a trigger for me, I'm a sucker for you
Nothing can stop this feeling
Let's get carried away, lost in the dark

[Chorus]
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise, a secret garden

[Verse 2]
Since it just keeps me confused
My heart didn't choose
God, can't feel, now all I want to do is shoot
'Cause you're a trigger for me, I'm a sucker for you
Nothing can stop this feeling
(No, it can't, yeah, yeah, I know)
Let's get carried away, lost in the dark

[Chorus]
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise, a secret garden

[Bridge]
Your private invitation into ecstacy
Take cover, keep it locked in
Let's swallow the key
(Let's swallow the key, yeah)

[Chorus]
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise, s secret garden
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise, a secret garden
I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise, a secret garden
Let's run and hide
