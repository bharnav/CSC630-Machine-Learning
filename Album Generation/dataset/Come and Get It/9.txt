Don't be late
'Cause I can't wait
And you know
I've been looking forward to our time
Don't be shy
Boy, I'll erase
I'll make you over
You'll be new angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name
Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again
Je m'appelle Rachel
I wait
Come baby, right this way
I will live what you say
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Old sweet sins
You must not fear
Shame little know me
Don't believe all the things you hear
'Cause they won't know
If I don't say
So don't think it over
Let's go now angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name
Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again
Je m'appelle Rachel
I wait
Come baby, right this way
I will live what you say
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Some like it hot
And some need to cry
Sing nothing, baby
Make up your own mind
What you want
If you are game
I'll make you over
You'll be new, Angelo
Oh, let me hear you say my name
Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again
Oh loud, angel
Oh, let me hear you say my name
Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again
Je m'appelle Rachel
I wait
Come baby, right this way
I will live what you say
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away
Come on in from the rain
Come, I'll warm you again
Je m'appelle Rachel
I wait
Come baby, right this way
I will live what you say
Je m'appelle Rachel
Fire away
Fire away
Je m'appelle Rachel
