Round and round we go
Round and round again
Then I got to thinking
I want to be more than your friend

Round and round we go
Here we go again
Can we be together
I'm going to carch you if I can

Is it okay if I meet you in heaven
Is it alright if I'm with you forever
(I will be there)
I will be there
(There forever)
I will be there and I hope you'll be there too
(I will be there)
I will be there
(There forever)
I will be there and I hope you'll be there too

Round and round we go
Here we go again
Can you hear me calling
I want a love that we can share

Round and round we go
Round and round again
We can live forever
This doesn't have to be the end

Is it okay if I meet you in heaven (is it okay)
Is it alright if I'm with you forever (is it alright)
(I will be there)
I will be there
(There forever)
I will be there and I hope you'll be there too
(I will be there)
I will be there
(There forever)
I will be there and I hope you'll be there too

[Instrumental break]

I will be there
I will be there

Is it okay if I meet you in heaven
Is it alright if I'm with you forever
Is it okay if I meet you in heaven
Is it alright if I'm with you forever
Is it okay if I meet you in heaven
Is it alright if I'm with you forever
