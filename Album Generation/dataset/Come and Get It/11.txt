Yeah, every little thing

The sweeter you taste
The bitter I feel
The slower I play
The quicker you deal
Your hand on me

The softer I stroke
The harder you ache
The less that I give
The more that you take
Your time (Take your time)
Take your time with me (Take your time with me)

You can't stand it
Just because I won't let
You step over me, oh

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me
You want every little thing that I don't
You seem to want to make things harder
Harder than they ought to be

The faster I ride
The more that you stow
The lower you fight
The higher I fall
Right down (Down, right down)
Down on my knees (Down, down on my knees)
(Ah)

The sting in your kiss
The twist in my touch (ahh)
You had me so hard
But you want me so much
You'll be anything for me

You can't hide it
Baby, don't deny it
I'm your fantasy, oh

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me
You want every little thing that I don't
You seem to want to make things harder
Harder than they ought to be (than they ought to be)

Oh oh
Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
[laughs]

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me (best of me, best of me)
You want every little thing that I don't (every little thing)
You seem to want to make things harder
Harder than they out to be (than they ought to be)

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me (best of me, best of me)
You want every little thing that I don't
You seem to want to make things harder
Harder than they out to be (than they ought to be)

I want...mmm...
