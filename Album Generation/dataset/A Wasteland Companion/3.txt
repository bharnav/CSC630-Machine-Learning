[Verse 1]
You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile baby
You drove me crazy
Down lovers lane

[Verse 2]
I can't explain this love I have for you
I cannot tame this desire I have for you
If it starts again...don't forget I love you

[Verse 3]
Oh my love, take my hand
We'll go walking
Moon and stars are shinning in the sky
Everyone I know must be jealous
Cause they don't have a love such as I

[Verse 1]
You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile baby
You drove me crazy
Down lovers lane

[Verse 3]
Oh my love, take my hand
We'll go walking
Moon and stars are shinning in the sky
Everyone I know must be jealous
Cause they don't have a love such as I

[Verse 1]
You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile baby
You drove me crazy
Down lovers lane

[Verse 2]
I can't explain this love I have for you
I cannot tame my desire I have for you
And when it starts again...don't forget I love you

[Outro]
Oh my love, take my hand
We'll go walking
Don't forget I love you
