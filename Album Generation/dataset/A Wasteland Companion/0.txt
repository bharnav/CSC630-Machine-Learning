When I was a younger man
I thought the pain of defeat would last forever but
Now I donâ€™t know
What it would take to make my heart back down

Cause I only have to wait a little while
Before I get my clean slate

Then somewhere in another place
Who knows? Could be another lifetime
Everything we gave away
Returns like a seed from a fugitive tree

And you only have to wait a little while
Before you find the truth
(Truth)

And I only had to wait a little while
Yeah I only had to wait a little while
Yeah I only had to wait a little while
Before I got my clean slate
