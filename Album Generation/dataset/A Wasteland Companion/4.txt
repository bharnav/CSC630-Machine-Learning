[Verse 1]
When we are dancing
And you're dangerously close to me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you
So much closer than I dare do
I want to scold you
'Cause I care more than I care to

[Verse 2]
And when you touch me
With a fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight
And still you linger
I kinda think that you get ideas too

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are always saying
The things you'll never say
I think they could be saying
That you could love me too
But that's the whole idea, it's true
The lovely idea
That I'm falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
When we are dancing
And you're dangerously close to me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you
So much closer than I dare do
I want to scold you
'Cause I care more than I care to

[Verse 2]
And when you touch me
With a fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight
And still you linger
I kinda think that you get ideas too

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are always saying
The things you'll never say
I think they could be saying
That you could love me too
But that's the whole idea, it's true
The lovely idea
That I'm falling in love with you
