[Verse 1]
The first time I ran away I saw
Faces in the dreams I heard
Voices in the storm they say
Uh, uh...
By the waterfall
Uh, uh...

[Verse 2]
The second time I ran away I saw
Warriors of the train catching
Tigers by the day
They say
Uh, uh...

[Verse 3]
Cause when they look at you as if you were a stranger
The way they talk to you as if you were in charge
By the waterfall

[Verse 4]
Last time I ran away will open this with you
Let me show you where to run
Water falls
Uh, uh...
By the waterfall
Water falls
Uh, uh...
