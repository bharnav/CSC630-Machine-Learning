There is a singer everyone has heard
At night he turns into a Mockingbird
If I whistle in the dark, he'll do that too

I met him on the road
At the close of day
He talk like me, he walk this way
I said, "Mockingbird, you ain't no innovator"

And there is a singer everybody knows
He makes rounds of the late night shows
Shake the hands of the host
And the masquerade is on

You turn him off on the radio
And he say "me and my shadow"
Shoot out the lights my shadow's gone

Down at the bottom of the Kelena Bay
Find my raychad I can see your face
If I'm tied up to the tracks
Then he's tied up to the road
Down at the bottom of the Kelena Bay
And it's one for the money, two for the show
For me and my shadow

Shoot out the lights and my shadow's gone
Shoot out the lights and my shadow...gone

There is a shadow everyone has heard
At night he turns into a Mockingbird
If I whistle in the dark, he'll do that too
I have met him on the road today
A silhouette on a black highway
I said "You can have this world
This world is not my home"
Then he said " You can keep this world
This world is not my home"
