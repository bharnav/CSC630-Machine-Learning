[Verse 1]
She's a primitive girl, she says it herself
She cuts to the chase, yeah like nobody else
If you say "how you doin'?", she'll say "I'm doin' well"
She's a primitive girl, she says it herself

[Verse 2]
She's a primitive girl, she don't like to boast
From her natural head to her natural toes
The girl's got a lot of what they call the most
Yeah she's a primitive girl 'cause she don't like to boast

[Bridge]
And I'd like to think I'm a primitive guy
I see the difference, the difference between
What I want and what I need
And the primitive girl, she don't need me
No, she don't need me

[Verse 3]
She's a primitive girl, she's setting me free
And her back's in the basics of philosophies
She's nobody's fool, I know she never was for me
She's a primitive girl, she's setting me free
