Yes Baby, I been drinkin'
And I shouldn't come by, I know
But I found myself in trouble
And I had no place else to go

Got some whiskey from the barman
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on movin'
'Til I was back in your arms again

I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life

How come I never do
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing that I try to do
Ever turns out right

You know--You know how it is with me, Baby
You know I just can't stand myself
It takes a whole lotta medicine
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else
