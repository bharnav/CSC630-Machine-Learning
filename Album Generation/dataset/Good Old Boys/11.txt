I never drink in the afternoon
I never drink alone
But I sure do like a drink or two
When I get home

Every evening what I do
I sit here in this chair
I pour myself some whiskey
And watch my troubles vanish into the air

[Chorus]
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more

Used to worry about gamblin'
Throwin' my money away
Used to worry about wastin' time
And layin' round the house all day

But I'm all right now
I'm all right now
I never thought I'd make it
But I always do somehow
I'm all right now

[Chorus]
