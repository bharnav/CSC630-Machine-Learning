[Verse 1]
There she is sitting there
Out behind the smoke house
In her rocking chair

She don't say nothing
She don't do nothing
She don't feel nothing
She don't know nothing

[Refrain]
Maybe she's crazy I don't know
But maybe that's why I love her so

[Verse 2]
Her papa was a midget
Her mama was a whore
Her granddad was a newsboy 'til he was eighty four
What a slimy old bastard he was

Man, don't you think I know she hates me?
Man, don't you think I know that she's no good?
If she knew how, she'd be unfaithful to me
I think she'd kill me if she could

[Refrain]
Maybe she's crazy I don't know
But maybe that's why I love her so

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid of the grey wolf
Who stalks through our forest at dawn
As long as I have her beside me
I have the strength to carry on

[Verse 3]
Today we will be married
And all the freaks that she knows will be there
And all the people from the village will be there
To congratulate us

I will carry her across the threshold
I will make dim the light
I will attempt to spend my love within her
But though I try with all my might

She will laugh at my mighty sword
She will laugh at my mighty sword
Why must everybody laugh at my mighty sword?
Lord, help me if you will

[Refrain]
Maybe we're both crazy, I don't know
Maybe that's why I love her so
