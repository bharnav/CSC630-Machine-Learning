I used to think it was all in the drink
It made him the way that he was
He swore he'd change, poured it all down the drain
And finally he'd given it up
But tonight in the kitchen
I sat there and listened
To words he could never take back
I didn't see no Jack or Jim Beam
He was drinking his coffee black

(CHORUS)
Oh, I wish he'd been drinkin' whiskey
When he told me he didn't love me
But he was stone cold sober
He meant what he said
And he did what he did
'Cause in his heart it was already over
The truth doesn't lie
So I can't deny it like I've always done before
Oh, I wish he'd been drinkin' whiskey
When he told me he didn't love me no more

He used to come home drunk to the bone
After he'd stayed out all night
He'd start slammin' doors and pacin' the floors
And we'd always end up in a fight
But tonight there's no screaming
Just the sound of him leaving
And the silence that rings in my ears
This house is dry, but for the very first time
I wish there was a bottle 'round here

(REPEAT CHORUS)
Yeah, I wish he'd been drinkin' whiskey
When he told me he didn't love me no more
