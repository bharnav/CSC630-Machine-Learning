I'm not gonna lie or act like I'm that tough
There might be a tear in my eye when I watch theat airplane liftin' up
I never was much for tellin' you how much you ment
But I need you to know you were heaven sent

We went together like highways and T-birds
Saturday sinners and Sunday church and
Lookin' back and cryin and laughin bout the life between us too
We went together like memories and long gones
Cowboys and sad old songs
After all the holdin' on tight that we went through
You're damn right I'm going to miss you

I guess there are times when all of us re-learn
And life is a book, and the pages, you know they're about to turn
And I don't know where the story ends
Where it's gonna go now
Just as long as this chapter tell the whole world how

We went together like highways and T-birds
Saturday sinners and Sunday church and
Lookin' back and cryin and laughin bout the life between us too
We went together like memories and long gones
Cowboys and sad old songs
After all the holdin' on tight that we went through
You're damn right I'm going to miss you

We went together like highways and T-birds
Saturday sinners and Sunday church and
Lookin' back and cryin and laughin bout the life between us too
We went together like memories and long gones
Cowboys and sad old songs
After all the holdin' on tight that we went through
Yeah after all of the fairytales that didn't quite come true
After all the nights and the fights that we went through
You're damn right I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
