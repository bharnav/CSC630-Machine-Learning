I have found my calling
The mission's all too clear
The voice I hear inside me
Is louder than the fear
I follow the bright lights
Into the dark nights
Chasin' after words and melodies

We could sail the ocean
Lay back on the waves
Or you can drop an anchor
And be the one to stay
Either way you see
It's okay with me
'Cause love can only grow if its set free

(CHORUS)
These gypsy feet keep changin' shoes
And are you the one that I belong to
That'll be my saving grace
And guide my way back home
My path is like a broken sidewalk
With cracks and stones and tear-stained raindrops
That testify to the dreams that won't let go
I wanna know
Can you love this travelin' soul

If I rest here in your arms
Long enough to let you in
Without ever askin' why
Will you let me run again
Believe in my need to fly
Just like the changin' tide
I'll keep coming back if you'll be my welcome shore

(REPEAT CHORUS)
My path is like a broken sidewalk
With cracks and stones and tear-stained raindrops
That testify to the dreams that won't let go
I wanna know
Can you love this travelin' soul
Can you love this travelin' soul
