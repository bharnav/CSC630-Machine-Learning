I was third alton on the second row of the First Baptist church choir
I was keeper of the minutes for the Tri Delts, in charge of the homecoming bonfire
I was a staight 'A', straight laced, level-headed as they come
And parked at the Sonic, isn't that ironic, when my whole world came undone

One slot over was a calf roper gibeing me his Geoge Strait smile
And before I knew Miss Good-Two-Shoes was two0steppin', runnin' wild

Back in my cowboy days, Lord what a honky tonkin' haze
He was forbidden fruit in them tight Wranglers and boots
It was all dangerous fun, we were two outlaws on the run
Tastin' that rodeo dust, two unliklies in love
I swore I'd never give him up, back in my cowboy days

Well, Mama said, "He's crazy" Daddy says, "He's lazy"
Sister said, "Does he have a brother?"
Well, I changed my dress and who woulda guessed
I'd be wearin' them jeans and ropers

It was passionate nights and dashboard light
Nobody was watchin' the clock
It was love in the makin'
Eggs and bacon at the Seventy-Six truck shop

Back in my cowboy days, Lord what a honky tonkin' haze
He was forbidden fruit in them tight Wranglers and boots
It was all dangerous fun, we were two outlaws on the run
Tastin' that rodeo dust, two unliklies in love
I swore I'd never give him up, back in my cowboy days

Sometimes I lay here thinkin' 'bout him
And laugh about my crazy past
Then I roll over and kiss the calf roper
Who'da though it'd ever last

Back in my cowboy days, Lord what a honky-tonkin' haze
