Just go
Go and don't ever look back
Out of sight,out of mind,out of heart
And you won't have to witness the damage that follows
I'm a wide eyed animal
Lost and scared on the freeway
Having traveled this far to die alone
To die alone

Broken lines and soft goodbyes
The worst is yet to follow.I can see it in your eyes
It's cold outside,you wonder why...

In the dark
We stand at the edge of this three year hole
Push me in and I'll pray for the bottom
In this cheap hotel room an empire crumbles
Rest your head
The fall begins tomrrow
I wish I could hold you but I...

Can't

This is not right.This is not right
This is not right.This is not right
Lock me up in Guantanamo Bay and throw away the key
Encased in soundproof glass,I will scream until my lungs turn
Inside out.Inside out

I can feel the walls closing in.I'm alone in a crowded room
This is innocence:a dying bloody mess
This is children playing while monsters wait in the closet
With baited teeth,ready to strike
Slit my throat from the inside
I'll choke on my own blood

Rest your head,it starts tonight
