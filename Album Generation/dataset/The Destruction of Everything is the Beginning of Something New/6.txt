"The Diamond Ring"

I'll peel back the skin from my head
Let the sun melt you from my memory
I'll drink myself to sleep and escape
The nightmares of being awake
I'll set the air afire
You never even tried to tell me
What went wrong, what went wrong
In this train wreck that we built together
What went wrong, what went wrong

Under shaking skin, underneath it all
Kill me from within. Kill me, kill me

You said always
Say you will, pretend to care
Say you will be there
Always
Say you will, pretend to care
Say you will be there

Always

Steal my breath, taint the air
Every bone in my body's been broken
And my life is a jaw wired shut
My voice is my curse and my shelter from the pain
And I'm breathing carbon just to fall
Asleep at night. Asleep at night
In this train wreck that we built together
Nothing's right, nothing's right

I'm teething
I'm cutting gums for the first time

Under shaking skin, underneath it all
Kill me from within. Kill me, kill me

You said always
Say you will, pretend to care
Say you will be there
Always
Say you will, pretend to care
Say you will be there

You said always

You're stabbing my heart

Broken hearts, broken doors
Dying on a hotel floor
Because of a small black box you couldn't receive
I'll drive you home tomorrow in silence. My sister will return it

This is the end of the summer, and the beginnings of the fall
You'll leave me two months later. In an airport goodbye
And as the weeks go on the letters and the phone calls decrease
Ah, to fade from memory

So keep the punches coming:
Left,right,right,left,left
Kick the throat you used to kiss
Push face into concrete
A smile, a giant fist
The bloody face of bliss
And as I gasp for my last breath
I crawl back into your perfect poison arms
