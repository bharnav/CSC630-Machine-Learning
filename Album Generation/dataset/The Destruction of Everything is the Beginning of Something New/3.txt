Learn to seperate your jaw
When you find things are hard to swallow

The wolves are closing in
I've got a head full of pills
And my hands are shaking
I need to shed this winter skin
It's a fall from grace
I think we all should take

If you're careful with the flame
You could save yourself
Quite a bit of pain
And if you're careful with a heartbreak
You could cover up
And replace

You can say you don't care at all
But I know better
It's your eyes that betray you
As you stand and face the squall
Don't be afraid
I won't let you die alone

I can't seem to stop
I'm bouncing back and forth
And everywhere around you
And I can't seem to get up
My head's so cloudy
The wolves are coming and it's...

Dangerous
