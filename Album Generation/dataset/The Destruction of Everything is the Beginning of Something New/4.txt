From California to the longest island
To that sleepy Midwest town where I was born
I have walked across this globe searching for something
Now I find myself right here,outside your door

I have found myself again outside your door

And it's driving me...

If I say something would it make a difference?
It's so strange to find home in the face of a stranger

For so long it felt like I was falling down
And I couldn't wait to finally hit the ground
Oh if only I could say the words to make you stay
But I've been through this and heartbreak's all I've found

And it's driving me...

After everything I've done,after every song I've sung
You should know that you're the greatest thing I've ever touched
And every breath you breathe
It helps me to believe

Life is folding and unfolding and unfolding
Right in front of me
