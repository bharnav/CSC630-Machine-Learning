In the snow,angel lay.Mouths join in the cold
Whispers lie as they say you will never go
Memories,empty sheets,they will smother me
Wrap me up,the deceased,underneath the frozen sea

Murder me

I'm sorry that I can't seem to forget you
I'm sorry tha I ever let you down
Does this epic ever have an ending?
It just begins again,right now

Worlds away.Empty fights.You can drop your guns
Souveniers.Foreign nights.The damage has been done
With no trace.With no trace.I will disappear
Fade away,with no trace,like I was never here

It just begins
Over and over

She sold you out,she sold you out
And now you'll never be the same

(Finale)
Now that we're done
Now that we're over
I find myself back at the start
In Eden with you three years ago

The edge of our lives
The edge of a knife that
Cut from across the world
The five becomes ten,the ten:forever

And as this new life
Begins from a distance
I'm staring across the sky
Longing for you

Longing for all we left behind
