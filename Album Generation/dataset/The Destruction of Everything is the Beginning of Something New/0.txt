Rehearse the memories and practice all the lines
Play it one last time and then erase the tapes
And I wonder: could you ever feel the way you did before?
All the same skin and the same fingers are there

And it's the hardest thing to live here with your ghost

Burn it down
Darling it's too late
We've danced around this flame too long
We can't be saved

I trace your silhouette across the sky with signal flares and smoke
Listen as the tanks roll in to wipe away the past six years
So sound the air raid sirens, barricade the doors
Tell me what is left when all our hope is lost

Burn the city down
