Sing me a song
I know we've used up every dawn
And yet I wonder
When the scholars find our bones
A thousand years from now under
All the ashes of the earth
Will we be together?
The only thing I know for sure

The plates may shift
And slit your wrists
But wear your scars
I will follow you through the dark

Don't be afraid
This is the last night of our lives
Buried in flames
So kiss me one more time tonight
In your darkest night
When all is lost
I will be your light
At whatever cost

Let the plaster flow into
The space our bodies used
To occupy
Let it be a record of
The love that buried us alive
Underneath the sands of time
A testament that even after death
Love survives

Exit the vein
Exit the lungs
Exit the body
Never the heart
