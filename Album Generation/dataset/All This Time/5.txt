Oh, I want to go
To a place we've never been
Be down for a while
While comin' up to the surface

I swallowed a dragonfly
In the hopes that it would help me fly
And it did for just one day
And that day I saw everything

And I keep on, on movin' forward
Even when I'm down
And I keep on movin' forward
All the time

Yeah I keep on movin' forward
All the time
I keep on movin' forward
Even when I'm down

And I don't know
Don't know what it is
That keeps me down
