Help, this feeling has captured your soul
It's holding on tight and it won't let you go
For a long time your heads been in the sand
Try to help out but you won't let me in
And through the years all things crumble and fall
The mounds they build up to it's too much too crawl

Things they don't turn out perfectly
Don't let yourself go sinking into the sea
It ain't so easy finding yourself, when you're searching through valleys
Valleys of debris
Come up for air
Come up for air
Ain't no use lyin' to yourself and to me
You got to keep it together
You got to let yourself breathe
You got to keep it together
You got to let yourself breathe

Day after day things are movin' so fast
Thinkin' too much and drownin' the past
Too much time left in your hands
Don't know what to do just do what you can
And now I'm tryin' to find
A way to help you ease your mind
But there ain't no use in me hangin' around
When all that you're doing is bringin' me down
It ain't so easy finding yourself
When you're searching through valleys, valleys of debris
You're building a wall and you're building a fortress
You're always smiling, smiling like me
People say: "You always seem so happy"
They don't see what I see
You can't wear your mask all the time
Sometimes you got to let yourself breathe

Oh find your fire
Oh find your fire
Oh find your fire
Oh find your fire

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
