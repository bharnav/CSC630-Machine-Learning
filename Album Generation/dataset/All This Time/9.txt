Sometimes a silence seems so loud to me
And I'm thinkin' out loud and I'm tryin' to keep
Too much reflection isn't healthy for me
Present and future is where I need to be

But I'm stallin' this story
I'm gonna fill it with glory
'Cause there's no place to go but up
And I'm changin' my outlook
'Cause lookin' inwards
Isn't always a good place to go

And I hold my head now
With a tear in my eye
'Cause I don't really care no more
Always so little things
That eat at your soul
And I'm not gon' worry about them no more

I came a long way
Came a long way
Came a long way
Came a long way

Day by day, livin' this way, I'm gonna carry on
I'm, I'm takin' my time
Gonna do things just right
I'm gonna carry on, oh, oh

Oh, my head's always been filled with worry
And I think it apart and it will always bleed
I got no expectations, ain't got no regrets
When I was livin' that way, I wasn't livin' at all

(Repeat 2nd and 3rd verses)

(Chorus)

(Refrain)

Into despise, let me discover
Don't want to rewrite, my lover
And livin' nearby 'cause I'm in your life and
How did I get here?
