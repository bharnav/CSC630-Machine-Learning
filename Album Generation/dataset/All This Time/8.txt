I am a'comin' to the end of this road
My cursed hands they are worn and swollen
For a long time I've been carryin' this load
Now I'm restin' my arms of these things have been holdin' now

Oh, now where do I go
When there ain't no signs or pointin' arrows
So many things that I wanted to fulfill
That I could not think straight and I could not sit still
And I could not sit straight and I could not think still

I am a'doin' the best that I can
With what I've been given, these things I have taken
Nothin' has ever turned out as I planned
But that's how the path of your  life is what you make it and

(Chorus)

Animal born in, oh, to myself
I got so many reasons to look outside myself
All the old familiar faces
And the unfamiliar faces
That's what every day is, and I do it again
Oh, in the morn' I wake with the sun
Oh, in the evenin' another day is done
And oh I feel restless, I never have guessed
That I'd be at this point at the end of this road
