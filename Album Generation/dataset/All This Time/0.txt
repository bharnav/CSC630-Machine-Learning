I just want to go
But I didn't wanna let go
I just want to go
But I didn't wanna let go

And I find myself
In a fleeting moment
Travelin' far and wide
To the great big open

And things are comin' into focus
And things are comin' into focus
I've got wind in my face
And it's gettin' me on
I've got wind in my face
And it's gettin' me on
On

All of this time I was searching
Searching for my home
And I discovered
Home is where I am

And I find myself
Here in the middle
Of a great divide
And in the moment

(Repeat 3rd verse)

(Chorus)
