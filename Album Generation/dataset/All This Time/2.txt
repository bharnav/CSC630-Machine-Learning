Home is where I long to be
Things turn out so differently
(x2)

I (?)
We're taking everything I tol' ya'
Taking everything I tol' ya'

Finding solutions, finding solutions

Home is where I long to be
Things turn out so differently

We're taking everything I tol' ya'
We're taking everything I tol' ya'

(Chorus)

Going through the desert and we're headin' for the setting sun
(?) our troubles and we're headin' for the setting sun

All I want is a will to find, a will to find
A peace of mind
(x2)

And now, we never look back, we never look back, we never look back
And now, we never look back, we never look back, we never look back

How we never look back (x4)
