It's been a long day
When nothin' seems to be goin' my way
I really don't need a lot
Just tryin' to hold on to what I got
Lord knows it's been a while
Since my face has cracked a smile
So hot in the midday sun
Seem to be burnin' everyone

Oh, self destruction
It is keep me from functionin'
I try to build things up
I build things up and I tear them down

Oh, I'm escapin'
I'm escapin' this big blue day
And now I, I'm tryin'
Tyin' to look out into the horizon

Oh, I got no motivation
Oh, I need some inspiration
Try and get some motivation
To help me, help me get through this day

And then the winter comes
I'm hardly seein' any sun
Hibernation's takin' me
Into a distant sleep
Lord knows it's been a while
Since my face has cracked a smile
So cold in the winter months
Seem to be chillin' everyone

(Climb)

(Chorus)

(Refrain)

(Chorus x2)
