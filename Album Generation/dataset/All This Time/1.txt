Hotel rooms and highway signs
And other books to pass the time
Empty cans and bottles lying
This room is almost like a shrine

To an idea and a place
We've all been lookin' for
Been searchin' now forever
And it's right behind the door

And now I've been searching
Searching for the ghost
I saw an apparition once
A long, long time ago
Been searchin' now forever
And I found it here today
And it's changed its meaning
But it still feels the same

Along the way we hit some bumps
Got cuts and bruises on our hearts
Always knowin' where we wanna go
But still get lost in every part

Nothin's ever easy
Easy for me
That's the way it's always been
The way it seems to me

(Chorus x2)
