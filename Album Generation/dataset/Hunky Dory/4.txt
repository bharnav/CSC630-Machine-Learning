[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
Because we believe in you
Soon you'll grow
So take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
Because we believe in you
Soon you'll grow
So take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

[Verse 1]
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
Because if you stay with us
You're going to be pretty kooky too

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
Because we believe in you
Soon you'll grow
So take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

[Verse 2]
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
Because I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
Because we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
