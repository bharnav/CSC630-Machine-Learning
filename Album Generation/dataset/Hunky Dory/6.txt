[Verse 1]
Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind
Forget your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll be free, yeah
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

[Chorus]
Because they are
Free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it free

[Verse 2]
Happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your head
Only in your head
Fear is in your head
Only in your head
So Forget your head

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

[Chorus]
Because they are
Free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind
And makes you free!

[Outro]
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah
