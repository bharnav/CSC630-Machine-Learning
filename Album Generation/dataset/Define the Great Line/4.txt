[Russian:]
The mighty one, God the Lord
Speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth

Our God comes and does not keep silent, a devouring fire is before him
And a mighty tempest all around him

Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth
He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people

"Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"
The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge
