Last week all the oceans dried up, now all there is is land scientists
Predicted that this is the end of man
Religious freaks took to the streets and put the “left” on trial
They hunted down the witches and then left them in a pile
Hurricanes have come and gone, now where to place the blame?
Ravaged by the stormstris all the cities burn in flames
Evacuate the village 'cause you know the end is nigh
Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye
The animals were freakin' out, where were they supposed to go?
There were some countries that didn’t hear about this 'til it was too late
Massive amounts of suicide have broke out all over the world
The wiseman shakes his head as he looks out across the field
The world is run by a bunch of actors
They get what they want no matter what the cost
Their strings are pulled by the shadow's power
“Do it now or the war is lost!”
They fuel hatred all around the world
By trying to tell you what's right and wrong
Their bellies are fat with pride
Their allies weak, but their budgets strong
Our weapons have destroyed the world
That is Har Megiddo
Your weapons have destroyed the world
This is Har Megiddo
When I say our weapons have destroyed the world
I'm talking about our weapons
Our weapons of mass destruction
The ones that we America have stockpiled
How long will it take for the pot to realize it's calling the kettle black?
How long is it gonna take for them to realize that Har Megiddo is the end of the world?
Last week all the oceans dried up, now all there is is land scientists
Predicted that this is the end of man
Religious freaks took to the streets and put the “left” on trial
They hunted down the witches and then left them in a pile
Hurricanes have come and gone, now where to place the blame?
Ravaged by the stormstris all the cities burn in flames
Evacuate the village 'cause you know the end is nigh
Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye!
Our weapons have destroyed the world
That is Har Megiddo
Your weapons have destroyed the world
This is Har Megiddo
