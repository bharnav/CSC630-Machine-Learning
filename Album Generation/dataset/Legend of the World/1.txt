I can bring your mind back to life
Shake your head 'til the sweat runs free
You're due for a resurrection
You're jaded beyond belief
Who do you run with honey?
Why do you act this way?
Big brother’s watch has ended
We’re gonna make them pay!
This prison earth was not for me
But where were we to go?
The information that I sought
Was not for me to know

I walked a million miles
I was shot down in the street
They tried to take us out
Before the mission was complete
I walked a million miles
I was shot down in the street
They tried to take us out
Before the mission was complete

Wake up from your deep sleep
Can’t you see those people are tryin' to rip you off?
You must have shit for brains if you believe anything that comes from
That little box we monitored progress over the years and if one thing
Remains the same it's that monkey see and monkey do if it'll get 'em just
A bit of fame I got down I got down on my knees I was twisted
Resurrected fake death and brainwash your mind has been rewired
Flatline to the other side come back and you’re never tired
E.T.'s and earthlings live together in harmony
When they die just put 'em back together resurrection'll set you free
