There’s a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
Possibility the choice in life for instant stimulation
It's similar to the choice of fate or destiny
Do your choices affect those around you?
Back out your problems and take a look around
Connect the dots on your current situation
Retrace your steps is the only thing I've found that works
Can you grasp the grid of possibility?
Every choice in your life is one that counts timestreams not a footrace
Friction causes all the magnets to make DNA
Greeks and Romans thought of themselves as the gods!
All their choices now are history
Technology surpassed the sun
Universal expansion has hushed the guh-lo-buh
Some people try to live their life and walk all around this land
As if we’re guided by someone else’s hand
Now that we live on earth, we got responsibility
Don’t ever trade your freedom for their security
You’ll never catch me without a fight
There ain't a man in the world who can stop our rock and roll
You wanna taste of our choice? Give it to 'em!
There’s a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
Possibility when you find yourself in that situation
It's similar to the choice of fate or destiny
There’s a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
Possibility the choice in life for instant stimulation
It's similar to the choice of fate or destiny
What will you choose?
Infinity looms don’t blindly commit to any set path
The will to survive will keep you alive
Back out of your thoughts and fall in the net
