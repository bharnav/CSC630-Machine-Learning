I heard it through the grape vineyards
Gossip, data, knowledge, updated classified facts, no!
It was all an illusion!
These savages use smoke and mirrors to throw you far away from any real facts
Sight beyond sight and careful scrutiny is required
When listening to your commander in chief
We are being faced with a facade of civility
For some reason all hands are on deck
And our country is armed to the teeth
And doing everything in their power to disarm everyone else
While simultaneously turning the country into
A gigantic money makin', money spending shit machine
This lust for newness is more addictive than any drug
Weâ€™re all hooked and we can all do better
We should be ashamed for listening to this clown
Only probability can heal the splintered mind
