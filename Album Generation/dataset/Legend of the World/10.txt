The conscience is a concept I don't believe in
Power over someone through manifestation of guilt
It's a problem I've always dealt with
But when you isolate a problem, you feel it
You might not want to but you can feel it
A poundin' in your head this problem you feel it
Figure it out 'cause you don't wanna deal with it

Conscience is a makeshift word
A passive-aggressive tool for mind control
This power in the wrong hands
Can lead to self destruction of your world as a whole

They use hurt and fear as weapons
A guilt trip'll grab you by the balls
You get proud and make a mistake
Well, in our design that's one of our flaws

I use cheap things all the time
But I'm using the rich things' law
The better you do the worse off you are
Why should you feel guilty when you seem to be dialed?

Weight of the world restin' on your shoulders
Work your skinny fingers to the bone
We're fightin' for no reason whatsoever
A hundred thousand hassles are birthed on the phone

Is this a plot to thwart our hero?
His head and heart are poundin' from the pain
Tell Jagger you get anything you want
But havin' to wait is driving you insane!

My conscience tells me what to do
My conscience tells me what to do
My conscience tells me what to do
My conscience tells me what to do

Dear everyone else who exists in this world
I can't watch you for the rest of my days
If you got a problem, I suggest you try and solve it
And leave me to my business so I can get paid

Weight of the world restin' on your shoulders
Work your skinny fingers to the bone
We're fightin' for no reason whatsoever
A hundred thousand dollars are borrowed on loan

You can get anything you want
You just can't get it when you want it
You can get anything you want
You just can't get it when you want it
You can get anything you want
You just can't get it when you want it
You can get anything you want
You just can't get it when you want it, oh!
