Earthly bodies won’t live on forever
Beyond the grave rippers buried in leather
We’re all tempted by the glory of strangers
We will bask in the sounds of their danger
Oh, well alright
When the stormstris comes it's a box that's filled with light
(Then it opens up)
I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared
But when the box opens up you got 48 hours to solve a puzzle
A riddle, or everything in your life will expire (You can suck on this)
There’s no more gettin' high, when a riddle comes from the sky
In a box that can destroy us all, what superhuman can we call?

When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes

December 31st
I wake up in an earth girl's bed screaming
The vision I saw was horrible
How was a man like me gonna save the world?
Can you believe this horseshit?
They’re gonna push the red button!
But the stormstris was pure nature…
All those deaths were for nothing
They say the meek will inherit the earth
But what are we going to inherit, what’s left?

And I came and I saw the stormstris
Stretched out across the horizon
No government force could stop it
No future’s gonna come your way

When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes

When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
When the stormstris comes
