This goes out to the fans who was digging through my mail
You think you can get in my personal business, Jack?

The choice is up to you my friend
'Cause I ain't ever gonna come back again
Well hop on this rocket gotta get outta town
It looks like the shit is about to go down
Mission control received an urgent message
A faint signal coming from the wreckage
It's still alive, we gotta take 'em out
The heatseeker was designed to make 'em scream and shout

You don't need a ticket
Whoa, you know what you need
Oh, and I'm feelin' wicked
Heatseeker is gonna make 'em all bleed

You think you've seen a threat to national security?
You ain't seen nothin' yet, baby!

The choice is up to you my friend
'Cause I ain't ever gonna come back again
Hop on this rocket gotta get outta town
It looks like the shit is about to go down
Heatseeker's classified in case you need to know
I take it with me when I go out on patrol
Don't need no coffee, don't need no coal
This motherfucker runs on rock and roll, come on
Huh, alright

Bring it down a little bit

I'll fly all day, I'll fly all night
The size and power of this rocket's outta sight
Don't need no coffee, don't need no sugar
I'll get some cream when I come over
Don't need no tickets, don't need no coal
This motherfucker runs on rock and roll
You know what I'm talkin' about?

We got technology down in this studio, baby
I've been using it, using it to track you in that parking lot
I know where you are
You can't get away, girl, I got technology
It's a satellite system, it's been tracking your GPS dial all week long

You don't need a ticket
Girl, you know what you need
And I'm feelin' wicked
Heatseeker is gonna make 'em all bleed
Come on, I want you to bring it to 'em

It's what you need, it's what you need
It's what you need, it's what you need, it's what you need
Come on
It's what you need, it's what you need
It's what you need, it's what you need, it's what you need
It's what you need, it's what you need, it's what you need
Come on
It's what you need, it's what you need, it's what you need
Come on
It's what you need, it's what you need
It's what you need, it's what you need, it's what you need

Everybody put your hands up in the air
Even you in the back, I can't see 'em, put 'em way up
I wanna see everybody in here bang their head
We gonna take it off, let's do it right now
Uh, come on

Heatseeker's comin', yeah, you know
Heatseeker's comin', baby

You ain't ever gonna get away from it, girl
'Cause it's still comin' for you
