Before the dawning of mankind
Other creatures roamed this land
They were from a far off time
And they brought with them a plan

From a dying portal in the sky it came
A grey transporter set the sky ablaze

It was raining fire from the heavens

In search of sanctuary to the earth they came
All life before this point had just been washed away

Asteroids and comets ripped right through the atmosphere
Laid waste to all the dinosaurs it's a cycle
It's a cycle that's been going on since before this world began
Even though they cause destruction they're vital they're a vital part of reality

The spores inside were alive, when the dust settled over the ocean bed
They watched it, they watched the natural process of evolution in the raw
Lifeforms grew in the water and this is what they saw

They saw volcanoes, Earth was a wreck
The cooling of the lava produced a side effect
They saw amoeba combine with light
They saw the first thing crawl on land and try to walk upright
They saw the dolphin, they saw the ape
The combination of the two would help the world take shape

(They bred them) on the beaches, it was called Pangea population spread
So fast it caused an imbalance, but that couldn't stop 'em even then

C'mon
Let's get on the road, I got something to show
Pull up your roots, and pack your bags, let's go

Let's get on the road, I got something to show
Pull up your roots, and pack your bags
Let's go to the mountain and then you will see the place
Where Pangea Major used to be

The tectonic plates moved where workers had mined
The shift in the continents divided mankind
Tidal waves broke the goddamned thing in half
Seven pieces that wouldn't last
Spread like germs, that's the human virus form seeds were planted here on Earth

Young mothers then gave birth
They remembered the men from the sky
Named them gods and never questioned why?

Climb up the mountain and see for yourself, the ice caps are melting away
From the shelf
The earth is evolving, you must have forgot
The life on this planet has only one shot
Tidal waves broke the goddamned thing in half
Seven pieces that wouldn't last
Earth's been silent many times, you seem to forget:

We are temporary
You are temporary
We're all temporary
