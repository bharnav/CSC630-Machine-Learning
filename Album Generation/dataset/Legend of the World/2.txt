They sent your son with a plan
To fight some war in a desert land
He ain’t gonna come home again
He’s makin' some money for a Texas man

Helicopters in the sky
All the little soldiers die
Their mothers and their daughters cry
'Cause of politician's lies!

Have your innocence stolen and you're traded like a slave
Have your promises broken and you're in for an early grave
They’re deep in the schools now, recruitin' for their war
They know to skip all the rich kids, 'cause the focus is on the poor
It's always been like this, you wanna be all you can be
First they shave all your hair off, and then you're no longer free
I have never understood compliance to assimilation that just doesn’t make sense
Take a look at the state of the world, I've never seen foreign relations more tense
Chaos reigns where troops are stationed, a panel of suits couldn’t save 'em
If they tried bombed on all sides no plan for escape
This mission is fucked! This mission is fucked!
All this is is a money game
Let’s get down to the core
Fight your battles here at home and don’t go off to war
Don't waste your time stealin' oil, for Bush and Uncle Sam
They don’t give a damn about our lives, this war was all their scam
Preying on minorities' insecurities in ads
The possibility of winning a war on terrorism is mad
The oppurtunity just didn’t arise, this was all a part of their plan
Do you think they give two shits about the future man?
Don’t give up on your dreams my son
The fight for terrorism can’t be won
With guns and bombs and tanks and planes
Peaceful progression is the only way!
