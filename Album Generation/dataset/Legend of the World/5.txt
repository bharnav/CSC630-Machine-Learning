The veil of lies is gone
No democracy was real
We never knew the truth and I guess we never will
The owl and the pyramid sold lies just to stay alive
All the knowledge you can handle for $19.95
There’s people that live on Earth they believe everything they read
This government promised justice this government delivered greed
If you study historical knowledge, then you know that we’re not free
Not wisdom that you find in textbooks, take a look and I'll help you see
You don’t have to buy it, you just need to hear my words
Then if you believe it, go to others and set them free
Timelines are crossing, the hourglass is running out
Another war is starting, how much more of this can we take?
The owl and the pyramid sold lies just to stay alive
All the knowledge you can handle for $19.95
They’ve been misleading us with false information
And I'm not talking about on television
Everybody knows that but these dudes personally acted as moles within the system
But were really working for the owl all along!
They’re gonna try to put a microchip inside your hand!
You gotta escape you gotta escape you gotta escape bust out and run like hell!
The owl and the pyramid sold lies just to stay alive
All the knowledge you can handle for $19.95
If you study historical knowledge, then you know that we’re not free
Not wisdom that you find in textbooks, take a look and I'll help you see
You don’t have to buy it, you just need to hear my words
Then if you believe it, go to others and set them free
Timelines are crossing, the hourglass is running out
Another war is starting, how much more of this can we take?
