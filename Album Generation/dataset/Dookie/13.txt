[Verse 1]
Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

[Chorus]
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

[Verse 2]
Stuck down in a rut of dis-logic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done, it's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

[Chorus]
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
To say

[Bridge]
You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

[Chorus - Variation]
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you
So listen up 'cause you might miss

[Bridge]
You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

[Outro]
Good night
