[Verse 1]
I saw my friend the other day and I don't know
Exactly just what he became
It goes to show

[Chorus]
It wasn't long ago
That I was just like you
And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
How have I been?
How have you been?
It's been so long
What have you done with all your time?
And what went wrong?

[Chorus]
I knew you back when
And you
You knew me
And now I think youâ€™re sick and I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Anybody ever say no?
Ever tell you that you weren't right?
Where did all the little kid go?
Did you lose it in a hateful fight?
And you know it's true

[Chorus]
It wasn't long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home
