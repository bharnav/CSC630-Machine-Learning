[Verse 1]
I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

[Verse 2]
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment
Sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 3]
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user
So I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down
Because I know you're right

[Verse 4]
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt
Means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Outro]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
