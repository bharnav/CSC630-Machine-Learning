[Tre Cool]
I was alone, I was all by myself
No one was looking, I was thinking of you
Oh yeah, did I mention I was all by myself?
All by myself...
All by myself...
All by myself...

I went to your house, but no one was there
I went in your room, I was all by myself
You and me had such wonderful times
When I'm all by myself,
All by myself
