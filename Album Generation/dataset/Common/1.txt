ANITA
Puerto Rico
My heart's devotion
Let it sink back in the ocean
Always the hurricanes blowing
Always the population growing
And the money owing
And the sunlight streaming
And the natives steaming
I like the island Manhattan
Smoke on your pipe
And put that in!

GIRLS
I like to be in America
Okay by me in America
Everything free in America

BERNARDO
For a small fee in America

ANITA
Buying on credit is so nice

One look at us and they charge twice

I have my own washing machine

INDIO
What will you have though to keep clean?

Skyscrapers bloom in America

ROSALIA
Cadillacs zoom in America

Industry boom in America

BOYS
Twelve in a room in America

Lots of new housing with more space

Lots of doors slamming in our face

I'll get a terrace apartment

BERNARDO
Better get rid of your accent

ANITA
Life can be bright in America

BOYS
If you can fight in America

GIRLS
Life is all right in America

BOYS
If you're all white in America

GIRLS
Here you are free and you have pride

BOYS
Long as you stay on your own side

GIRLS
Free to be anything you choose

BOYS
Free to wait tables and shine shoes

BERNARDO
Everywhere grime in America
Organized crime in America
Terrible time in America

ANITA
You forget I'm in America

BERNARDO
I think I'll go back to San Juan

ANITA
I know a boat you can get on (Bye Bye!)

BERNARDO
Everyone there will give big cheer!

ANITA
Everyone there will have moved here
