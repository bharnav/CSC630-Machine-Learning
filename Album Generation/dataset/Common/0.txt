[Verse 1]
Why do I second guess everything I've ever tried?
Nothing real ever happens when I take your advice
I don't wanna show you honesty
It's such a waste
You don't wanna know that side of me
So go away

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I fall in line?
It left me blind
I'm feeling useless
I've lost my mind

[Chorus]
It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again
Caught it again

[Verse 2]
Why did I let you in, let you win, give you a chance?
Fighting fire with fire till it ignites our skin
I don't wanna show you honesty
I never do
You don't wanna know that side of me
Replay it whole

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I fall in line?
It left me blind
I'm feeling useless
I've lost my mind

[Chorus]
It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again

[Breakdown]
I can't take another step
I'm lifeless, out of breath
I've hidden underground
But it found me in the depths
I can't take another step
I'm lifeless, out of breath
I've hidden underground
But it found me in the depths

[Chorus]
It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again
