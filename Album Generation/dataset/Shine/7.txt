Beams blaze like an iron rod that burned into my soul
We made such a beautiful sound it can't be told
And I knew, hardly knew you, loved me too
Left me with an empty hole
To long, not long enough that it took me by surprise
This pain that you left me with, just from looking in your eyes
And I knew you, hardly knew you, love me too
Left me with an empty hole
Love is freedom
Love is freedom
Love...we all know
This pain I would not have know, had you not arrived
Still burns down inside of me but it makes me feel alive
Because I knew you, hardly knew you, loved me too
Left me standing here alone
Love is freedom
Love is freedom
Love...we all know
Too long, not long enough
And it's burned into my soul
This pain...
Took me by surprise
