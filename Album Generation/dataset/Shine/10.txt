Tried to maintain
All that you can
When the story that ends
Is not so clear
Tried to replay
All that was good
When the lullaby
Ends in darkness
Black, black...to see you now, to see you now
Black, black...to see you now
Time for drifting
Ropes turn to sand
You'll be borne on the winds
Off the sea
On your own now
Our time is through
Let the promises be broken
Black, black...to see you now, to see you now
Black, black...to see you now
Just let it slip away
