The days go by and I?m still alive
Lost inside but I will arrive
And I?m starting to fall
Can?t escape from it all
It?s better to go down easy

When I?m stuck in this spin
Look at the shape that I?m in
It?s pulling me down
But I?m enjoying the view

So lift up now if you?re all alone
Better start or you?ll never know
Time goes by in a flash
If you?re starting to crash
It?s better to go down easy

In a circular dive
When I finally arrive
It?s taking me down
But what else can I do?

Time goes past and still it?s all the same
(And I?ve been with you all these nights)
In time when you change the game
(And hold yourself up to the light)

It?s past and you?re all alone
(But I will be here till the end)
And I?ll lead you home
(If you can see it through, my friend)

Now we?re caught in this slide
Seems like one hell of a ride
Taking me down, so easy
When I finally rise and I open my eyes
Looking around and I?m enjoying the view
