Black water and a feast in the summer
Slow dancing with the trees all around
I'm spinning in the breeze with my mary-ann
I'd like to see her when the sun goes down

One day, mabye tuesday evening
Im dancing with the trees all around
One day and the spin slows down

Slow colors as we lift through the canopy
Still laughing with her hair all around
I'm spinning throught the trees with my Mary-Ann
Flipped over and we drift on down
One day, mabye tuesday evening
She comes running when her baby comes round
One day and when the beat slows down
I'm dancing with the trees all around
One day and when the beat slows down

One day and you can feel it all around
One day and the beat slow down
One day and I can see it somehow
One day and the beat slow down
Rosewater is my drink in the summer
I'd love to see her with her hair hanging down
Slow dancing in the trees with my Mary-Ann
She comes running when her baby comes round
One day and you can feel it all around
One day and the beat slow down
One day yea I can feel it somehow
One day and the beat slow down

Black water and a feast in the summer
Slow dancing with the trees all around
One day and you can feel it all around
One day when the beats slow down
One day and I can see it comin round
One day when the beats slow down
One day and you can see it all around
One day when the beats slow down
One day and I can see it somehow
Ond day when the beat slow down

One day and the beat slow down
One day and you can feel it all around
One day and the beat slow down
One day and you can feel it all around
One day and the beat slow down
One day and you can feel it all around
