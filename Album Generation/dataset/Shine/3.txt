This time, when melody
Calls me up to say hello
These kinds of fantasies
Long enough that laid below
Come as melody
Come as energy
Come as memories
Come at all...
In time the memories
Fall away and stay below
In shadow energy
Long enough today to go
And try to see
What's wrong with me
Or never know
Come as melody
Come as energy
Come as memories
Come at all...
And now will lead
To all you prayed for
Why, to say what's come
What's made to last...
To cry for, live
You'll see what's one
To be, what's done
What will be last
To see and why...
To make one one
Come as melody...
Come as melody...
One one will be love now
I'm free
Undone
Unheard from...
Love, will beg
Will see...
Will cry for will
Will try to be
To all of one
Thru all to love...
