Roses float across the water
And the ice is slowly melting next to you
In our hideout down by the boathouse
Lonely days are through

'Cause when you walked into that room
I've never seen two eyes so blue

Sweet dreams Melinda
The summer days we knew
Laughing down by the water
Sweet dreams to you

Went from Charlotte all the way to Savannah
Laughing, your feet up on the dash
Stumbled through the yellow lights of Toledo
And the rain was falling fast

Flew from Boston down to Tulsa, Oklahoma
In a dream above the clouds
In a dream above the clouds

Sweet dreams Melinda
When summer days are through
I'll think of you on those long lonely nights
Sweet dreams to you

And time after time
I go back to that morning
And the water's so fine
Sweet dreams Melinda

Sweet dreams Melinda
The summer days we knew
Laughing down by the water
Sweet dreams to you

Sweet dreams Melinda
Sweet dreams Melinda
Sweet dreams Melinda
Sweet dreams to you
