Another letter to remind me
Walking circles on the phone
While this distant fog surrounds me
I let it settle on the ground

Whenever you find it
Look all around
You're never alone
But if you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

What's said in tunnels to remind me
Spread out in liquid on the ground
And drawn in circles all around me
Until its time to set it down

Whenever you find it
Look all around
You're never alone
Until you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

Whenever you find it
Look all around
You're never alone

(guitar solo)

So if your hinges aren't alligning
What falls away and rolls along
And when our breathing is divided
We weather battles on our own

And so if you find it
Look all around
You're never alone
Until you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

Wherever you find it
Look all around
You're never alone
But if you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home
