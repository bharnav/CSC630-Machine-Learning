Now...
You left the solid wall behind
To lead the balance of below
Now you left the solid wall behind
To lead the balance of below
Love that breaks all lines...
Love that breaks all lines...
Unseen, a time to break your mind
To see the shadow of the signs
And watch the water fall alone
To see the center of the road
Unlined...
Unwavered and unfree
Undone to love, the same as me
Unturned, untaken and all alone
Unseen, another chance to understand the movements
In the corners of your mind...
To see the balance of behind
And walk the centerline alone
Love that breaks all lines...
