Last time when you were waiting for me
I tried to tell you all we had was a
Wrapped up scene like I knew that it would
It all seems thin but it sure feels good

?Cause it?s the best I?ve seen
When you fall down good
Sink in the water
But you?re walkin? on wood

This time, what are you waiting for?
Is it your time to walk away?
Because the law?s unseen, levels all good
The hurdles all down like another time would

?Cause it?s the best I?ve seen
What a fall down should
Sink in the water
But you?re walkin? on wood

Last time seen, walkin? on wood
Downstream drifting like a long time should

But now we?re invisible so all that's good
The law?s unseen, levels all good
Downstream drifting like a long time should
But now we?re invisible so all that's good

Next time and I could wait forever
Old times because I thought I?d never
Wrap that scene like I knew that I should
It all seemed thin but it sure felt good

?Cause it?s the best I?ve seen
When you fall down good
Sink in the water
But you?re walkin? on wood, walkin? on wood

Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible
Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible so all that's good

Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible
Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible so all that's good

Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible
Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible so all that's good

Last time, walkin? on wood
Now we?re invisible
Last time, walkin? on wood
