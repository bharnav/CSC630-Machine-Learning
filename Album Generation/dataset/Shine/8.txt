Slow slow, my brother
You will sleep again
Long long, when it passes
You will breathe again
Snow falls...
And it passes
Time time, in good time
You will live again
Long long, on and on
Carefree and downstream
You will live again
You will live again
All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...
You will live again
You will sleep again
