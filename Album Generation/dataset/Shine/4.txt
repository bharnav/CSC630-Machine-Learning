Currents on an endless sea
What I want to carry me
Up above this silent scene
What's unseen I will rise and see
Severed and free
Believe what you want to believe
Step into the air...
Said to me
Turn out to be what you'd never be
Air said to me
Turn out to be what you'd never be
Lights out on the final scene
Turning in the summer breeze
While crooked fingers point at me
In lifts and dives I will rise and leave
Severed and free
Leave what you want to leave
Escape into the air
Said to me
Turn out to be what you'd never be
Sweet sparks
Open and surrounding
Blue waves
Open and surrounding
Turn and taste the air...
