[Verse 1]
Blissful queen
Magazine
Making art
Stuck between
Limousines
Break my heart

[Chorus]
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming

[Verse 2]
Blissful queen
Sweet sixteen
Brand new car
Hit machine
Keep her clean
Razor sharp

[Chorus]
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming

[Guitar breakdown]

[Verse 3]
Blissful queen
Velveteen
Shining star
Glistening
Wedding ring
Gone too far

[Chorus]
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming

[Chorus]
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
(Ahhh ahhh ahhhhhhhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming baby
(Ahhh ahhh ahhhhhhhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming

[Outro]
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
(Ahhh ahhh ahhh)
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
You got me running
But I can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
Can't see you coming
