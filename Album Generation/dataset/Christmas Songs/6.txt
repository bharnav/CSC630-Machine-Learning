I just came back from a lovely trip
Along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole
To spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plan to me

You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows if you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Look out Santa's coming to town!
