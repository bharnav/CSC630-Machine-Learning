Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "you-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up
Let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintery fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up
Let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintery fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
