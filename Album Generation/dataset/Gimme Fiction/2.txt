[Chorus 1]
I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
The way I'm slippin away
I turn my feelings off
Y'made me untouchable for life
And you wasn't polite

[Chorus 2]
It hit me like a tom
You hit me like a tom
On on and on

[Verse 1]
When I turn my feelings on
I turn my feelings on inside
Feel like I'm gonna ignite
I saw them stars go off
I saw them stars go off at night
And they're looking alright

Keep on blowin up
Keep on blowin em off
Get up roll it out
Keep on showin em out

[Chorus 2]
Y'hit me like a tom
It hit me like a tom
On and on a tom

[Chorus 1]
I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
I feel me slippin away
I wipe my feelings off
Y'made me untouchable for life
And you wasn't polite

[Chorus 2]
Y'hit me like a tom
I don't know where it's from
It hit me like a tom-tom

[Outro]
Here comes the flan
