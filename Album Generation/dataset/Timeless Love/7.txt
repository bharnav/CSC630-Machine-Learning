Speak low when you speak love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon

I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near
Tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon

I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon...

I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me
Slow to me, oh please
Just don't say no to me
Let it flow to me, slow to me
Soon...Soon...Soon...
Ooo...Soon...Darling, speak low to me
Darling, speak slow to me...
Oh, oh, oh!
