It's late at night and you're not home
I'm still waiting for your call
But it never - it never comes
Do you ever think of me?
Can you hear my empty plea
For your love and affection?

I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I can't let go
It's what you do
Not what you say
That keeps you one step away
Am I that easy to forget?
If only you'd make one sacrifice
Do what it takes to make it alright
Am I that easy to forget?

I'm standing in the bitter cold
Wish that you were here to hold
'Cause I miss you
The way you used to be
Am I in this love alone?
When I speak, the words just fall
And you listen (but not to me)
