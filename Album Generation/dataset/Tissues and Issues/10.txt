Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?
Who am I?

Darling, when I'm hurt
That's when I'm satisfied
Tell me what it's worth
To pursue the Holy life
I can see your face
Even when I close my eyes
I can give you love
Even when I've been denied

Who's loving who?
Who's fooling who?

Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?
Who am I?

Darling, what is love
If it never gets you high?
Should we sit and wait
While the wasted years roll by?
Is there time to say
If I lied, I apologize
Never go away
Please stay here by my side

Who's fooling who?
Who's loving who?

Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes I thought this dream would last
Who am I to question why?
Who am I?

They try to break you
They try to steal your stars
If they ever take you
Just remember who you are
They try to hate you
Just like some love bizarre
It's a sign of weakness
To be afraid of what you are

Who's loving who?
Who's fooling who?

Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes I thought this pain would pass
Who am I to question why?
