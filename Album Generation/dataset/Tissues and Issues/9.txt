The silent night is keeping me from sleep
2am, I'm running with bare feet
Heartbeat racing, I was just sixteen
Caught a taxi, hoping I'm not seen
So naive, I could not bear to wait

Oh, oh what I didn't know
I never loved him
So what was real
And oh, he was a drag to me
But he's the casualty of love

Through my neighborhood
(I didn't care)
Nothing could stop me from getting there
Had a sickness, he was my medicine
So in lust, he could have been anyone
Not so special, Mama was right after all

Mama was right there was no love
It's all in my mind
Just an obsession with him
What a waste of my time
