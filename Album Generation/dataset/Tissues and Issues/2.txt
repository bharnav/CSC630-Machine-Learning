Now first of all I want to let you know that
I've been known for some minor
Mood swings now and then
It all started back when people were doing me wrong
And because of my position I would hold my tongue for then
Bad relationships and people I thought were friends
And people judging me before they get to know a thing
When you decide to step to me
It shows me so clearly
You just want to see, see the other side of me

And you don't know what I'm going through
And you might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been holding back
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

I try to keep my cool, yes, that's what I try to do
But it's so hard dealing with people just like you
I try to walk away from situations that run
Into complications that make me lose control
If I give in to you then it's what you want me to do
And if I lose my cool then I'm only pleasing you
You know just how to push me, my temperature is rising
Blood pressure is building, I'm about to lose control

I'm sorry, did I cross the line
I tried to warn you away
Way ahead of time
I'm so frustrated that I feel like I could cry
This could be the time
But I'm not going out like that
