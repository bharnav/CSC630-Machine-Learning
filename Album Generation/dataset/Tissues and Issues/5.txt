You and me were meant to be
Like the summer sun
And midnight moon we shine
Day and night our time is right
Don't wanna waste this moment
Make it last all night
Do you know how much I care for you
Whatever you may do

Nothing can come between us
Now that the seed's been sown
Why won't anyone leave us to be alone?
When are they coming to save us?
Like trying to get blood from a stone
Why does the world love to hate us?
Let's be alone, let's be alone

Don't make a sound, just lay me down
Why search for words (there's nothing left to say)
Baby, you're the sweetest thing to me
I wanna love you now

Nothing can come between us
Now that the seed's been sown
Why won't anyone leave us to be alone?
When are they coming to save us?
You are my light you're my savior
So why have the fumes blown?
You are my favourite flavour
Let's be alone, let's be alone
