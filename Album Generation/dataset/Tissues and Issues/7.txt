You are guilty
Of every sin I know
You don't take care of me
And I'm feeling so low
Now I do love you
But you make it so hard

Now I've tried to let go
But I just can't say no
I've cried all my tears
Over you
Tell me what, what can I do

You can't fool my heart anymore
So now I'm walking out the door
You've taken my soul now let go
I'm not that fool I was before
I'm not your fool no more

Don't you judge me
As I leave it all behind
I was the victim
It was you that did the crime

Now I'm losing control
But I just can't say no
I see through your smiles, your disguise
Won't take more, no more of your lies

You can't fool my heart anymore
So now I'm walking out the door
You've taken my soul now let go
I'm not that fool I was before

So (so) what went wrong
Held me down for so long
Tried to forget your mistakes
But it's hard to forgive when it feels like a part of you dies, dies inside

You can't fool my heart anymore
So now I'm walking out the door
You've taken my soul now let go
I'm not that fool I was before
I'm not your fool no more
I'm not your fool no more
I'm not your fool no more
