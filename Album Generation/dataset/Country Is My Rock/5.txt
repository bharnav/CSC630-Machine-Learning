It was perfect timin'
Both of us findin' what we needed
Blind love was drivin'
An' we both went divin' off the deep end
But girl, now, lookin' back
Went way too far just a little too fast
An' that sure was fun
Oh, but now it's done

They say all good things must end, an' we did
But, baby, we sure had a real good time
It was like a never-endin' weekend
That we spent hopin' to find
Our place in the sun
Yeah, we sure had a good run

It was almost magic
Girl, we almost had it all, didn't we
It is what it was
An' nothin' less just 'cause it couldn't be
Had the love of a lifetime in no time at all
Fell in in the winter, fell out in the Fall
Oh, but that's okay
Girl, it was great

They say all good things must end, an' we did
But, baby, we sure had a real good time
It was like a never-endin' weekend
That we spent hopin' to find
Our place in the sun
Yeah, we sure had a good run
That was a good run
Sure was a good run
That was a good run
