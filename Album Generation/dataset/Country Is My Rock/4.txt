Woke up face down in a cheap motel
Had a King James Bible, a musty smell
An' a Jim Beam bottle layin' in the bed
With a lipstick note sayin'
I hope he ain't dead
Call me later if you wanna party
Signed, Susan
I need to make a resolution

No more drinkin', no more sinnin'
No more kissin' bow-legged women
No more twos that look like tens
'Til the drunk wears off an' the light sneaks in
This time I've made up my mind
I ain't gonna do that again
No, no, 'til the next time

Well, a man's just made of flesh an' blood
But that don't mean he gotta roll in the mud
Sometimes I do an' I get concerned
How weak I am, an' you think I'd learn
To put temptation behind me
Where that damned old whiskey can't ever find me

Yeah, no more drinkin', no more sinnin'
No more kissin' bow-legged women
No more two's that look like tens
'Til the drunk wears off an' the light sneaks in
This time I've made up my mind
I ain't gonna do that again
No, no, 'til the next time

Oooh, no more drinkin', no more sinnin'
No more kissin' bow-legged women
No more twos that look like tens
'Til the drunk wears off, light sneaks in
This time I've made up my mind
I ain't gonna do that again
No, no, 'til the next time

This time I've made up my mind
I ain't gonna do that again
No, no, 'til the next time
Lord, till the next time
I'm gettin' ready for the next time
(Huh, huh, huh)
