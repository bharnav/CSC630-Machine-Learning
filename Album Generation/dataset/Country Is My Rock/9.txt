[Verse 1]
Daddy's been a back-row Baptist
With his share of front-row sin
His Saturday night still on his breath
Every Sunday when he'd walk in
He's never led the Benediction
He's never sang in the choir
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Verse 2]
Mama lives by the Bible
The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head
Praying Good Lord, just be with him
I know his faith is tired
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Daddy's always been there for me
From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart
When they've been broken down
I know he calls for more forgiveness
Than most folks do require
But he's an angel with no halo
An' one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Outro]
Well, I just can't imagine
What Heaven might be like
If me and Mama make it
Without Daddy by our side
Lord, could you please remember
When it's time to call us higher
That he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire
