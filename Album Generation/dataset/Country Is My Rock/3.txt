[Verse 1]
Hey, Mr. DJ, can I make a request?
Somebody I love just up and left
And if I know her, she'll drive all night alone
And she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

[Verse 2]
Just in case she ain't that far from town
Play somethin' that'll turn her car around
And send it out from a fool who's done her wrong
Hey, she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

[Chorus]
Play something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind, tugs at her heart

[Verse 3]
Well, I know you get this all the time
Broken hearts lighting up all the lines
Begging you to play that special song
Hey, but she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

[Chorus]
So play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart

[Bridge]
I need to make a dedication
Before that late-night signal's faded
Before she drives away too far
And parks that damned old car

[Chorus]
Play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart
Tears up her eyes, turns 'round the car

[Outro]
Hey Mr DJ can I make a request?
Somebody I love just up and left
