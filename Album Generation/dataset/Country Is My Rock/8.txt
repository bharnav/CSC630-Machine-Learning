She packed that party act
Like a pack rat piled high with paper sacks
Two quarts of oil, her calico cat
Man, I never seen a woman get so mad
She caught me by surprise
When goodbye rang into the night like a steel wind chime
Caught in a storm that was gettin' worse
An' she just grabbed purse
I can't believe she said it first

'Cause I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway
I had my car all gassed up
Everything was all in place
I let her have her glory, then her faith
My heart will break an' that's okay
I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway

I watched her tail lights disappear
Grabbed a beer, chucked it down so my eyes could clear
An' fear appeared
An' suddenly silence was the only thing my heart could hear
An' this room is a tomb with empty walls, a broken broom
With marks of leavin' on the floor
Made by her shoes

Like she knew what I was gonna do
Still, I can't believe she left so soon

'Cause I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway
I had my car all gassed up
Everything was all in place
I let her have her glory, then her faith
My heart will break an' that's okay
I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway

I bet she's somewhere between
Alberquerque, Amarillo
Even at our favorite cafe
I wish I had the guts to call
Just so she could hear me say

'Cause I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway
I had my car all gassed up
Everything was all in place
I let her have her glory, then her faith
My heart will break an' that's okay
I was gonna leave tomorrow
I was gonna leave tomorrow anyway, yeah
Oooh
