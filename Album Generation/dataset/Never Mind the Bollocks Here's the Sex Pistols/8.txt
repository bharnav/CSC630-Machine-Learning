[Verse 1]
I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

[Chorus]
Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

[Verse 2]
You've got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above

[Chorus]

[Refrain 1]
For there's a mystery
Under the sea, under a water
Come share it

[Chorus]

[Refrain 2]
'Cos it's a secret
Under the water, under the sea
Octopus Rock

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Submission
Submission
Going down, down, under the sea
I wanna drown, drown, under the water
Going down, down, under the sea
