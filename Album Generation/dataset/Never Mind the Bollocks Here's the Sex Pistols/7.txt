I am an anti-christ
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passer by

Cos I, I wanna be anarchy!
No dogsbody!

Anarchy for the U.K. it's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

Cos I, I wanna be anarchy!
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest
I use the N.M.E
I use anarchy

Cos I, I wanna be anarchy!
The only way to be!

Is this the M.P.L.A
Or is this the U.D.A
Or is this the I.R.A
I thought it was the U.K
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Know what I mean
And I wanna be anarchist!
I get pissed! Destroy!
