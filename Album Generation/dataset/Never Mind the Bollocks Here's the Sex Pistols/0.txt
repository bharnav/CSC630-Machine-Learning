A Cheap holiday in other peoples' misery!

I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to new Belsen
I wanna see some history
'Cos now I got a reasonable economy

[Hook]
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

Sensurround sound in a two inch wall
Well I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine and I got World War three
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me

[Hook]
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

Well they're staring all night and
They're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
But now I got a reason it's no real reason
And I'm waiting at Berlin Wall

I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand it Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the wall the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the wall the Berlin Wall

Claustrophobia there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets I went in before
And now I got a reason
It's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

I gotta go over the wall
I don't understand this bit at all
This third rate movie show
Cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall, before them
Comm'on to the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall, before them
Comm'on to the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
Please don't be waiting for me
