[Verse 1]
God save the queen, the fascist regime
They made you a moron, potential H-bomb
God save the queen, she ain't no human being
There is no future in England's dreaming
Don't be told what you want, don't be told what you need
There's no future, no future, no future for you

[Hook]
God save the queen, we mean it man
We love our queen, God saves

[Verse 2]
God save the queen, cause tourists are money
And our figurehead is not what she seems
Oh, God save history, God save your mad parade
Oh, Lord, God have mercy, all crimes are paid
When there's no future, how can there be sin
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the future, your future

[Hook]
God save the queen, we mean it man
We love our queen, God saves
God save the queen, we mean it man
And there is no future in England's dreaming

[Outro]
No future, no future, no future for you
No future, no future, no future for me...
