[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that
He tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night
As a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)
