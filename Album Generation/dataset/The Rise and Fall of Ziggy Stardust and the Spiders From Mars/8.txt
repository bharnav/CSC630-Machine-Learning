[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah
Oooh
Oh hohoo

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar
