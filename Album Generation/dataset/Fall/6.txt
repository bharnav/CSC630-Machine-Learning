Hear the tale of my lonely life
Of emptiness without caress
Born thousands of years ago
But I can't die, I don't know why

When I look in the mirror it is not me
There's just a young man
I raise my hands
I am praying that no new day will come

I don't wanna believe my eyes
Forever young, forever strong
I just wanna leave this life
I'm all alone, time's moving on

All I need is a little chance
To hold you close until the end
But someday you'll be grey and old
And I'll move on before you're gone

I don't wanna be lonely
But I have to; world's growing older
Take my hand and
I'll follow the border till dawn

I don't wanna believe my eyes
Forever young, forever strong
I just wanna leave this life
I'm all alone and time's moving
