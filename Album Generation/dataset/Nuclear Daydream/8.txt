Don't tell your eyes
Don't tell your eyes
Your eyes are mine

Don't tell your mind
Don't tell your mind
Your mind is mine

Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know
Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know

Don't tell your dream
Don't tell your dream
Your dream is mine

Don't tell your sex
Don't tell your sex
Your sex is mine

Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know
Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know

Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know
Jesus loves you more than you know
More than you know
