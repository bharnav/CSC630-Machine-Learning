Time is moving on
You and me
You and me
Suffering is gone
You are free
You are free

I know I let you down
Those days are over now

I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was

Time is moving on
You and me
You and me
Suffering is gone
You are free
You are free

I know I let you down
Those days are over now

I'm no longer who I was
No longer who you thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who you thought I was

I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who you thought I was
I'm no longer who I was
No longer who I thought I was

I'm not afraid of nothing
I'm not afraid of anyone
I'm not afraid of losing myself
There ain't no self to lose
I'm not afraid of losing myself
There ain't no self to lose
I'm not afraid of losing myself
There ain't no self to lose
I'm not afraid

Time is moving on
You and me
You and me
Suffering is done
Let it be
Let it be

When you feel you're strong
You are free
You are free
