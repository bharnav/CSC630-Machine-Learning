Give 'em one more chance
One more thing to say
I made a very big mistake
Followed by a thousand days

Don't give up on people
Who want you to stay

Satellites and moonbeams
Signal dreams to play
Last time I saw you
Was in the sunless time of day

Don't give up on people
Who want you to stay

Don't give up on people
Who want you to stay
