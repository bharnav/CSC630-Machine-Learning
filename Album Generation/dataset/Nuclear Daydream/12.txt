It's a lark when you're looking good
Boys and girls, they both getta load of you
It's safe to stay/say, we're/where afraid
I think it's strange when you say you're gonna go to bed
And it's only 5 o'clock - p.m
You always look the same now
Always out in the rain somehow
Let the lights shine on our soul
And set the dial to Radio Euphoria
I like to hold you in the freezing cold
It's a lot like life when I want a kiss
I always thought you were my saving grace
But that was a different kind of face you had
And you can't get it back
No you never get it back
No you can't get it back
No you never get it back
You always look the same now
Always out in the rain somehow
You always look the same now
Always out in the rain somehow
Always out in the crazy rain
Always out in the crazy rain
