Woman
Woman
You make me feel
Woman
Woman
Are you for real?

Cause I don't know if I make it on without you
I don't know if I could make it on my own back
Home

Mother
Mother
Are you right here?
Mother
Mother
I share your fear

Cause I don't know if I make it on without you
I don't know if I could make it on my own back
Home

Sister
Sister
You're here I see
Sister
Sister
You see through me

Cause I don't know if I make it on without you
I don't know if I could make it on my own back home

Woman
Woman
Are you for real
Woman
Woman
You make me feel

Cause I don't know if I make it on without you
I don't know if I could make it on my own back home
