I wish I had
Open eyes
On my back
So I could see
My life
Going past
Seems when
It's good
Everything
Goes too fast
And when it's gone
You can never
Get it back

Try and take a picture
Through a dirty window
Try to touch your shadow
Fading when you follow

I been alone
For so long
It's hard to track
Down in a hole
No one knows
In the black
I know that soon
All the dogs
Will attack
I wish I had
Open eyes
On my back
