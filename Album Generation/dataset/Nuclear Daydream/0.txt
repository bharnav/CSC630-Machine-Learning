The needle says she'll tell you when she's through
No sense now in trying to believe in you

Too much to hide
In your own two eyes
Too much to hide
In your own world

There's some you know you follow into doom
By yourself and in an empty room

Too much to hide
In your own two eyes
Too much to hide
In your own world

Dream you're gone
Dream you're gone, so far gone
(So far, oh)
Dream you're gone
Dream you're gone, so far gone
(So far, oh)
Dream you're gone
Dream you're gone, so far gone
(So far away)
Dream you're gone
Dream you're gone, so far gone
(So far away)

I'm down here and walking with you still
And part of me I guess always will

Too much to hide
In your own two eyes
Too much to hide
In your own world

Be here now
