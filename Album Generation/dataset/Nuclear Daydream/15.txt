Your eyes are as big as a quarter when they're shining
Your fingers reach down in my stomach lining
Your voice sounds just like an alley cat is crying
I got the feeling you have never once stopped trying to undress me
You make yourself into a mirror to reflect me
I see my eyes are shallow stones
In a prison made of bones
Wrapped in a bag of skin
Highlighted by the lines of repetition
That all my fear's been carving

Haunted eyes
Sing in secret
And your haunted eyes
Are huge and empty
And your haunted eyes
Flutter just like butterfly wings
And your haunted eyes
They always watch you breathing

Drenching thunder rolls right by me
I'm only visible when you're beside me
And what I can't possess still remains inside of me
Its violence coming out of your mouth now
Is at once menacing and hard to see
Oh but finally I think I see
That you are fat and you are flat
You are a star in a jar
You're a monster with nothing who's been chewing
On the worm your best friend your pet fish was pursuing

Haunted eyes
Flutter just like butterfly wings
And your haunted eyes
They always watch you breathing

You're the only witness so if you die
I don't think I'm considered guilty of this crime
I take it to bed with me each and every night
The guilt wakes me up and shades my morning light
'Cause people break
In fact I helped you to destruct
I'll say anything you want but I can't reconstruct
You only tell more lies in a darker shade of white
Hurry up and punish me so I can feel alright
Forever, if ever, only ever, never

And your haunted eyes
Sing in secret
And your haunted eyes
Are huge and empty
And your haunted eyes
Flutter just like butterfly wings
And your haunted eyes
They always watch you breathing
