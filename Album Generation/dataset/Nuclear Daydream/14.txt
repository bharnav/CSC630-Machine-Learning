Hold on dear
Let me wipe away your weeping eyes
I love you
Even in a wind thats cold as ice

No rule can make you stay
My soul can make you stay
No more time

My eyes can see
Where your gonna hide
I love you
Even though your dreams
Have stolen my nights

No rule can make you stay
My soul can make you stay
There's no more time
