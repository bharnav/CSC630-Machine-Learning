No matter what you want
Do or say
I hope you make it to
Better days
If you're a junkie heart
Be reborn
And every dime in bag
Leave your home

If they don't get to you
Get to me
We're gonna walk a path
Ever free
And stare into the sun
Till we're blind
Destroying every thought
In our mind

What you say counts
What you say counts
Till you fall out away
As the night you crashed it all (?)
Till every piece grows strong (?)

No matter where you live
Where you've been
You found an open road
And a friend
If you're a peaceful soul
Peace will come
So don't you hide away
What you've done

What you say counts
What you say counts
Till you fall out (the way/back)?
As the night you crashed it all (?)
Till every piece grows strong (?)

Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
I want you all the way
I want you

Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
I want you all the way
I want you

Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
Now won't you
Slide away
I want you all the way
I want you

Slide away
