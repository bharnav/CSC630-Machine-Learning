Automatic who you blame
Like a moth into the flame
Burn your wings, have scars to show
Always gone before you go

It's all down from here
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)
The fall you prepared
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)

Damaged pride in a twisted heart
Little thief who was never caught
Wanna give you what she earns
Souvenirs of the wings she burns

It's all down from here
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)
The fall you prepared
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)

It's all down from here
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)
The fall you prepared
(Automatic, Automatic, Automatic situation)
