When I was running out of time
I turned it into a dream
And you went drifting into my mind
Things ain't the way that they seem
I turn you into a dream
And make it all go away
You know your hair looks different when you wear it that way
You've got a painted face and a body made of clay
You are my super star

They will fill you with big ideas
They'll hang your heart in the sky
I know you want to save the world
How long have you been that high
How long have you been that high
And did you make it all go away
You know your eyes look different when you look the other way
You've got a cheating heart bleeding emeralds everyday
You are a shooting star

Things ain't the same as when we was young
They hung us from shooting stars
Let's tell the world we're doing fine
I know how lucky we are
I know how lucky we are
To make it all go away
You know this world is topsy-turvy in days like today
We got a million souls looking for a place to stay
Each one a shooting star
