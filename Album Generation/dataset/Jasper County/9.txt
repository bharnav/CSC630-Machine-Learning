Black coffee and teardrops
Are all soakin' through
All over my pillow
It ain't nothin' new
But somethin' just crossed my mind
I've been feelin' like love's a crime
And if it is well I've done my time
I'm through

Hey gimme the good stuff, yeah
Hey I'm tired of this hard luck
Hey gimme the good stuff

I've settled for too long
I've let the truth lie
It's gonna keep trippin' me up
Till I kiss it godobye
Maybe it's time to put it in drive
Pull the top down and feel alive
Let the sun take over my sky
How 'bout it

Hey gimme the good stuff
Hey I'm tired of this hard luck
Hey gimme the good stuff

More than a taste
It ain't so tough
I'm not asking for much
I don't wanna wait

Hey gimme the good stuff
Hey I'm tired of this hard luck
Hey gimme the good stuff
