You got me walkin' a tightrope
Across a lover's sky
Now I'm feelin' the wind blow
I've never been so high
Promise me the moon
I'm reachin' for the stars
I need a hand to hold
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go

Finally found me a rainbow
That I can hold on to
A little taste of heaven
Pot of gold is you
Sittin' up on cloud nine
With an angel's view
But it's a long way down
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go
Don't let go

Baby you make me feel
Safe enough to fly
Hold me forever and ever
Never say goodbye

Gonna plant our dreams
In the sacred ground
Gonna watch love grow
When the rain comes down
Gonna say a prayer
For the strength we need
Put your hand to the plow
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go now
Baby don't you let go
Don't let go
Ooh
Baby don't you let go
