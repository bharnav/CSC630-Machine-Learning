Summer breeze
Easin' back the curtains in my bedroom
Ceilin' fan
Stirrin' up the heat of the afternoon
I'm puttin' on my lipstick
My ruby red lipstick
Nice and thick baby

It ain't the gettin'
It's the wishin'
It ain't the catchin'
It's the fishin'
Anticipation
Got me waitin'
For your
Sweet love baby
Sweet love

Cotton sheets
Out there on the line swingin' to and fro
Claw-foot tub
Drip drip drip honey
Nice and slow
I'm puttin' on my new dress
My pretty new blue blue dress
Oh yes

It ain't the gettin'
It's the wishin'
It ain't the catchin'
It's the fishin'
Anticipation
Got me waitin'
For your
Sweet love darlin'
Sweet love

Let's get your whispers honey
Tangled up with mine
Hurry on over and just
Take your sweet sweet time
Take your time baby

It ain't the catchin'
It's the reachin'
It ain't the heaven
It's the preachin'
Anticipation
Got me waitin'
It ain't the gettin'
It's the wishin'
It ain't the catchin'
It's the fishin'
Anticipation
Got me waitin'
For your
Sweet love baby
Sweet love
