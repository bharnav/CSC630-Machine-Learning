I wanna know
Who invented the wheel
Tell me who
Discovered steel
It was the wheel and the steel
That caused this pain
And made the car that took him away
I wanna know
Who invented the wheel

I wanna know
Who found the rock
Tell me who
Laid the blacktop
It was the rock and the blacktop
That caused this pain
And made the road for the car that took him away
I wanna know
Who invented the wheel

Somebody give me a name
'Cause I just need someone to blame
For all of this heartache
And pain I've been feeling
Since he had to go
I wanna know

I wanna know
Who invented the time
I didn't spend when he was mine
It was all that time I didn't take
It was the rock and the blacktop
That made the highway
For the wheel and the steel for the car
That took him away

Somebody give me a name
'Cause I just need someone to blame
For all of this heartache
And pain I've been feeling
Since he had to go
I wanna know

I wanna know
I wanna know
Who invented the wheel
