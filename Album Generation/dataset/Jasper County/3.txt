I told myself I'd stay away
I got no business 'round here today
You are so not good for me
And everybody knows
The way you break my heart again and again
But before I know I'm too close
One sweet look and then

You pull me under
With a touch that's like no other
I'm driftin'
Drownin'
There's nothin' I can do
But fall into the river of you

Well I thought I saw love's reflection
Just to feel your cold rejection
Every tear adds to the water
That I keep swimmin' in
Even I know I'm a fool
A reckless fool for you
'Cause I keep comin' 'round here
Like I've got nothin' to lose

And you pull me under
With a touch that's like no other
I'm driftin'
Drownin'
There's nothin' I can do
But fall into the river of you

Well you pull me under
With a touch that's like no other
I'm driftin'
Drownin'
There's nothin' I can do
But fall into the river

You pull me under
With a touch that's like no other
I'm driftin'
Drownin'
There's nothin' I can do
But fall into the river of you
Yeah I fall into the river of you
