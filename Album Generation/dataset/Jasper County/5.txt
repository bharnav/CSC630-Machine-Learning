Mother said stand up straight
Don't make your classmates make
You feel like you don't belong
So you're not like the rest of them
Someday the best of them
Will realize they were wrong

But in my world
Different meant lonely
The last place I wanted to be
Was

Standing out in a crowd
Where the spotlight finds you
And singles you out
What are they whispering about
You're thinking up ways
To take up less space
You can't see the grace in it
Standing out in a crowd

Too short, too tall
The flower against the wall
The last one chosen to play
Too smart, too dumb
Too strange a place to be from
Same shoes every day

With all these ways to be different then
Maybe that's how you fit in
By

Standing out in a crowd
Where the spotlight finds you
And singles you out
What are they whispering about
You're thinking up ways
To take up less space
Instead of embracing it
Standing out in a crowd

It's funny how now it's not such a bad place to be
Standing out in a crowd
Standing out in a crowd

Standing out in a crowd
Where the spotlight finds you
And singles you out
What are they whispering about
You're thinking up ways
To take up less space
There's no escaping it
Standing out in a crowd
Standing out in a crowd
