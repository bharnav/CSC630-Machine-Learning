I blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The day that I began
Trying to love you

The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you
I've lost and found myself in who you are
Trying to love you
So easy and so hard
Trying to love you

I've watched myself get stuck
I've squandered all my luck
I've almost given up
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
It broke my heart
It's chipped away my pride
Trying to love you
Every time I'd see that fault line slide
Trying to love you
I've crossed the great divide
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
I've screamed your name
I've slammed a thousand doors
Trying to love you
And I've worn a million miles across the floor
Trying to love you
Still I could not ignore
Trying to love you

It's pulled the best from me
For all the world to see
I guess I'll always be
Trying to love you
