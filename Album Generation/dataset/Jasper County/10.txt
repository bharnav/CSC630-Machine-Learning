You say you've been down some rocky roads
And there's a few things you wouldn't want me to know
But it's all right
Baby it's all right

You say you've been running from your past
And you've taken some turns just a little too fast
Well it's all right
Baby it's all right
Ain't got nothing to do with me and you tonight
And it's all right

There's nothing to run from
There's nothing to hide
And nothing can change what I'm feeling inside
Tonight's the beginning of the rest of our lives
And it's all right
It's all right

Someday you'll look back when we're farther along
And you won't see a trace of yesterday's wrong
And it's all right
Baby it's all right
Ain't got nothing to do with me and you tonight
And it's all right
