[Verse 1]
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life
To people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone
What country shall I say is calling
From across the world

[Chorus ]
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

[Verse 2]
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why it is though she's the door
She can't be the room
Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone
What sea shell sea is calling
From across the world

[Chorus ]
But she's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

[Outro]
They're asking is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling
It's so cold in Alaska [3x]
