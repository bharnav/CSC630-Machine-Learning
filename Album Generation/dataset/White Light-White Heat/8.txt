[Lou Reed]
Somebody shut the door
I know where temptation lies
Inside of you heart
(You can talk during this [John Cale])
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart

Well get out of here
If you're gonna try to make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
(Wrong wrong wrong wrong [John Cale])
Oh shut the door
(AHh)
That's the only chord I know

I know where the mirror's edge
Is inside of your heart
She didn't pay a dollar tonight
I know where the razors edge
Is inside of your heart, (Motown [john cale])
It's no even within five feet

Well if you're gonna make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
(You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas [John Cale])
I'm just gonna start it all over again
Somebody get her out of here

Electricity comes from other planets
(It's not that bad a solo
Four times is pretty together [John Cale])
You can't stay here, (yes I can
I can talk to myself as well[John Cale])
I'll lock the door this time

I know where temptation lies
Inside of your heart, yes he's ready
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart, is he ready?
Well if you're gonna make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong

Oh the whole mess start again
Well, New York buildings are very high
And not at all offensive, lock the door
Gonna carry on at infinite length, my dear
The Pope in the silver castle
