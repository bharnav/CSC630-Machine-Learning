Everybody's lookin' at me, thought I saw my face on MTV
A magazine that she won't read
Stole her heart, but it's not my fault
Lookin' at my picture she forgot about her boyfriend, yeah

I'll never be - a rock-and-roll star
I'll never be - anything, anything at all
Drives me crazy - can't get away
Somebody tell me - when do we get paid?

Everybody's lookin' at me
Thought by now I'd be on MTV
Or a magazine, like "Seventeen" or "Rolling Stone'"
And I won't be alone with your - money in my pocket
And my face on your T-shirt, yeah

I'll never be - a rock-and-roll star
I'll never be - anything, anything at all
Drives me crazy - can't get away
Somebody tell me - when do we get paid?

But I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, every day, every day
Said I'll never be, a rock-and-roll star
I'll never be - anything, anything at all
