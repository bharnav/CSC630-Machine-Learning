Who, oh yeah, alright
Awesome
So awesome
S-s-so awesome
Like tattered sails
The shreds of my heart
In your fingernails
Open my mouth
But I can't get this out
It never fails
A bed of roses and coffin nails
I hold my breath
'Cause I'm so scared to death
We tried to lie
And you denied
But our secret isn't safe, no
You're awesome
So awesome
You're everything
That I want in a girl
You're crazy
Well amazing
And everything
That's wrong with the world
You're great
Your filled with hate, uh huh
And you can't escape
Awesome
So awesome
S-s-so awesome
My legs are sore
My heart it black to the very core
This life of crime
But i'll get used to it in time
We keep it low
But I think they know
And our secret isn't safe, no
You're awesome
So awesome
Your everything
That I want in a girl
You're crazy
Well amazing
And everything
That's wrong with the world
Don't wait
Procrastinate, uh huh
'Cause it's not too late
You're radical
You're radical
You're radical
You're radical
S-s-so awesome
S-s-so awesome
You're awesome
So awesome
You're everything
That I want in a girl
You're crazy
Well amazing
And everything
That's wrong with the world
Don't wait
Procrastinate, uh huh
'Cause its not too late
You're great
You're filled with hate, uh huh
And I can't escape
And I can't escape
And I can't escape
S-s-so awesome
