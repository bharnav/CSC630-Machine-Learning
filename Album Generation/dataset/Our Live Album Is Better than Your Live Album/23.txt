Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh

I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame

I know it's your fault
That I'm in the mess I'm in
And you think I'm cool
But I don't, man

And maybe, it's too soon (it's too soon)
But I think it's too late (it's too late)
But things like bad timing just won't wait

Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
If she's the one or not

So I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame

Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
If she's the one or not

Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh

Well, I know flirting is nothing
And it should be where it ends
But I know, yes I know
That I want you for more than a friend
More than a friend

Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
Oh yes, I started wondering
If you're the one, ha ha

So I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame

I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
But I know, I know
That it's too late
