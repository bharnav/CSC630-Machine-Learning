[Verse]
Well, I know you can't work in fast food all your life
But don't sign that paper tonight, she said
But it's too late

And I don't remember what I read
Don't remember what they said
I guess it doesn't matter
I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Hook]
You're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
Radio plays what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool but I just don't believe it...

[Sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight
Record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be all right

[Verse]
No more flippin' burgers puttin' on my silly hat
You know I don't want that no more
And I didn't ask when we'd get paid, I quit my day job anyway
I guess it doesn't matter, I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Hook]
You're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
Radio plays what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it

Sell out, with me oh yea, sell out
With me tonight, the records company's only give me
Lots of money and everything's gonna be

[Bridge]
I don't think it'll be so bad
I know it won't be so bad
Cause the man said "that's the way it is"
And the man said "it don't get better than this" no no no noo

[Hook]
So I signed on to the record company
They say they're gonna give me lot's of money
If I play what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool, and I sure believe it...

Sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight
The record companies gonna give me lots of money and
Everything's gonna be (all right)

[outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The record company's gonna make everything alright
The record company sign that paper tonight
She said that I can work in fast food all my life
