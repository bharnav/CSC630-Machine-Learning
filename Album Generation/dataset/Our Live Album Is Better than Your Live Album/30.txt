What ever happened to Suburban Rhythm?
Why did Ed and Scott quit? (what's up with the boots on ya feet?)
Please don't go, Suburban Rhythm
All the other bands are just shit

Well the Reel Big Fish think that they've got it made
Because they signed with the record company, they gonna get paid
I say they mess up all the lyrics and they got no style
Say, they're gonna get it right, but it might take a while
So-a, don't - touch - that - dial

I've never been told if we're that good
And I said I'd never, never play with a ska band again
I guess I - never showed up (up, up)

So what ever happened to Suburban Rhythm?
Why did Ed and Scott quit? (yo, Dre would you please drop some gangsta shit?)
Please don't go, Suburban Rhythm
All the other bands are just shit (you said it)
