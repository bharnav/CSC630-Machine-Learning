You called me up last night in tears
And said you missed me after
All these years
I've been waiting here so long
I've gotten over it since
You've been gone

You called me late last night again
And said you're finished with
Your new boyfriend
Asked if you could come back home
So sorry that you left me
All alone, well...

You say you love me
Love me again
But if you love me
Where have you been?
You say you need me
More than anyone else
Well, go to hell
Where have you been?

You showed up at my door today
And said, "My friend, why do you
Push me away?"
Your life with him was just so dull
But what we had was something
Wonderful, well...

You say you love me
Love me again
But if you love me
Where have you been?
You say you need me
More than anyone else
Well, go to hell
Where have you been?

No way, you wish
I don't need this
What makes you think
I'd ever want you again?
Yeah right, as if
I don't need this
What makes you think
I'd ever want you again?

You called me late last night again
And said you're finished with
Your new boyfriend
Asked if you could come back home
So sorry that you left me
All alone, well...

You say you love me
Love me again
But if you love me
Where have you been?
You say you need me
More than anyone else
Well, go to hell
Where have you been?

You say you love me
Love me again
But if you love me
Where have you been?
And if you love me
Where have you been?
And if you love me
Where have you been?
And if you love me
Where have you been?
