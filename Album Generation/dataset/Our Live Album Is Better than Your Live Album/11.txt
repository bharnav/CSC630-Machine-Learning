He- He- He- Hey
He- He- He- Hey
Yeah

I just made an enemy of someone
I dont know,and they are upset about something
That i must have done,it really doesn't make much sense
But i got no statement in my defence

(What!)
-chorus-
I know, no matter what
No matter who
No matter what I do
Somebody hates me
(Somebody hates me)
Somebody hates me somebody hates me
(Somebody hates me)
Somebody hates me somebody hates me
And I hate somebody too

Did you missunderstand something that I did
Or was it one of my jokes that you did not get
Or do you think you got the way I think all figured out
What did I say to make you feel not cool

(WELL!)
-Chorus-

I know it's wrong
I do it too (I do it too)
And I guess i should say
Don't let it get to you

I know, no matter what
No matter who
No matter what I do
Somebody hates me
(Somebody hates me)
Somebody hates me somebody hates me
(Somebody hates me)
Somebody hates me somebody hates me
(Somebody hates me)
Somebody hates me (x5)
And I hate somebody too (x5)

Somebody like you.....
