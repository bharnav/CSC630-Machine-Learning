Let me tell you what I did
(What'd you do?)

I went out to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid I got in a fight uh-huh
It ain't no big thing (really?)
Late for my job and the traffic was bad
Had to borrow 10 bucks from Tavis' dad, uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

I went out to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'll be alright, uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Had a few beers getting high
Sitting watching the time go by, uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothing to eat and no T.V
Looking in the mirror don't do it for me, uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

Well I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Well I know you like dancing with me

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me
Come on pretty baby kiss me
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me deadly

I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid...
(and I fell into the jacuzzi.)
