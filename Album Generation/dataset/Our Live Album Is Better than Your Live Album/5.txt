I've got the measles
And she's got the mumps
I'm sick of waiting by the door
In case she comes home

You won't believe it
But don't you want to know?
I let her go but I can't let her go
I don't wanna hear it

I'm singin' too high tonight
I'm gonna lose my voice
I heard her on the radio
Don't want to sing along
But i've got no choice

She used to be my girl
But now she's famous (she's famous now)
She used to be my girl but now she is famous (she's famous now)
She was just so sweet
And now they're fallin' at her feet
She used to be my girl but now she's--

I eat the muscle
And she eats the leaves
High colesterol
And heart disease yea

You'll never touch the way that i feel
Just for the record
She got the deal
I don't wanna hear it

I'm saying goodbye tonight
I just can't stand the noise
She's signin' autographs
Don't wanna say i know her
But i've go no choice

She used to be my girl but now she's famous (she's famous now)
She used to be my girl but now she's famous, (she's famous now)
She was just so sweet
And now they're fallin' at her feet
She used to be my girl but now she's--

Well she's like me just not as ugly

She used to be my girl but now she's famous (she's famous now)
She used to be my girl but now she's
She was just so sweet
She was just so sweet
She was just so sweet
And now the're fallin' at her feet
She used to be my girl but now she's... Famous now
