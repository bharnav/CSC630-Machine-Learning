Aaron:
Oh, shit. Kicked your ass again
Scott:
Right in the ass!
Aaron:
Right in the ass
John:
Ooh, that hurts. I'm, I'm sorry we're saying 'ass' so much Lisa. I'm sorry
Aaron:
I'm on, I'm on maximum swearing tonight. Maximum
John:
What the fuck are you talking about?
Aaron:
All the "fucks" and "shits" I can squeeze in wherever I can fuckin' squeeze in those "shits" and "fucks" and "shits." That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, oh my god...
Scott:
And "asses."
Aaron:
...w- do we have a show in store for you
Scott:
Oh. Oh, boy
Aaron:
It's going to be so good. You'll only have to suffer through, like, forty minutes and then it's going to be the best show you've ever seen
John:
It's- yeah. Forty, forty-five minutes
Scott:
Then it'll, it'll kick your asses even more
Aaron:
After those forty-five minutes, it's going to be the best two songs you've ever heard
John:
That's right
Aaron:
Are you ready, are you ready to get your asses kicked?
Scott:
Fuckin' shit
