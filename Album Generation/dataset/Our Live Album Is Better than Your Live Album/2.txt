This is not a song about the one that got away
This is not a song about the girl who didn't love me
Once again I have made somebody cry
Once again, once again I am the bad guy
I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let - you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around?
Don't you?

I didn't care that she'd do anything for me
I didn't care that she would sell her soul to serve me
But as the tears fall from the corners of her eyes
I walked away, I walked away 'cause I'm the bad guy
Whoa, I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around?
Hey, hey

It's not funny
It's not funny at all, no, no
But your misery, your pain
I'm gonna laugh about it all, oh, yeah
Whoa, 'cause I'm the bad guy
I am the bad guy
Ha, ha, yeah, I am the bad guy

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean, oh, yeah
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let - you - down
It's mean but I'm not sorry I let you down
Don't you wish I never came around?
Don't you wish I never came around?
Don't you wish I never came around?
Hey, hey
