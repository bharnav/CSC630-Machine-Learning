Talking away
I don't know what's left to say, I'll say it anyway
Today is not my day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends again, but I'll be stolen away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh oh, things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love anyway

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day (Take on me)
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day
