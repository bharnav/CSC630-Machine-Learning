1, 2, 3, 4
She called me late last night to say she loved me so
It didn't matter anymore
I say, "She never cared and that she never will"
I'd do it all again
I guess, I'll have to wait until then
If I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well
You know that you're my friend
And I say, "I think, I'll have myself a beer"
She called me late last night
To say she loved me, so but I guess he changed her mind
Well I should have known, it wouldn't be all right
But I can't live without her
So I won't even try
If I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well
You know that you're my friend
And I say, "I think, I'll have myself a beer"
Maybe some day, I'll think of what to say
Maybe next time, I'll remember what to do
She looks like Heaven, maybe this is hell
Said, "She'd do it all again
She'd promise not to tell"
If I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And she said, "It's okay boy 'cause you know we'll be good friends"
And I say, "I think I'll have myself a beer"
I think I'll have myself a
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
