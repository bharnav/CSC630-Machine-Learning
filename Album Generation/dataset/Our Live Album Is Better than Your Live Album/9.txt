We are the dateless losers, yeow!

We are all on our own
With no one by our side
You are so lucky, beautiful and bright

All the cool kids go steady
They're making out at twelve
We sit in our rooms alone by ourselves

It's Friday
No phone call
Nobody asked us out

We are the dateless losers
Lonely until we die
So unappreciated
Why, why, why, why?

We're not so bad, you know
But you won't give us a chance
Take us to the movies, to dinner, or to dance

Not perfect
Not too hip
But we need loving too

We are the dateless losers
Lonely until we die
So unappreciated
Why, why, why, why? Oh!

You don't want us
You don't need us
You don't love us, ow!

We are the dateless losers
Lonely until we die
So unappreciated
Why, why, why, why?

We are the dateless losers
Lonely until we die
So unappreciated
Why, why, why, why?

Ho!
