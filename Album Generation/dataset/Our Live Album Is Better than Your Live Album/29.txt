(Sorry.)

Every time I try so hard I get nothin', nothin'
They say "Try and you won't fail," I get nothin', nothin'
I did all that I could; I got nothin', nothin'
Tried so hard for nothin', nothin'

I never wanted it that way
Guess there was nothing I could say
I don't know what I want but I know I don't want this
I give up, I give in
I know I'm never gonna win, 'cause

Every time I try so hard I get nothin', nothin'
They say "Try and you won't fail," I get nothin', nothin'
I did all that I could; I got nothin', nothin'
Tried so hard for nothin', nothin'

I know it's really not your fault
I'm going to blame you anyway
You say your sorry but I know it won't do no good
I give up, I give in
I know I'm never gonna win, 'cause

Every time I try so hard I get nothin', nothin'
They say "Try and you won't fail," I get nothin', nothin'
I did all that I could; I got nothin', nothin'
Tried so hard for nothin', nothin'
Go

I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care anymore

I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care
I don't fuckin' care anymore

(It's gonna be all right)
I don't fuckin' care (It's gonna be all right)
I don't fuckin' care (It's gonna be all right)
I don't fuckin' care anymore (It's gonna be all right)
