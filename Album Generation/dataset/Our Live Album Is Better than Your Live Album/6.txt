She told me
That I was lame
With her middle finger in my face
Won't waste her time with such a loser
So now I wallow in regret
Wanna do something right but I haven't yet
Why do my endeavors end up in failure

I think I'll go out drinkin'
Drinkin' all night long
Cuz if I go out drinkin'
Then I can stop thinkin'
Bout how the world done me wrong

I guess I shouldn't feel so bad
Ain't got much reason to feel so sad
Except that I'm poor, untalented, and ugly
I know its like they always say
Good times and bad will come our way
But theres only one thing that'll make this easier

I think I'll go out drinkin'
Drinkin' all night long
Cuz if I go out drinkin'
Then I can stop thinkin'
Bout how the world done me wrong

So wrong
I sing this song and nobody sings along
I've got a friend
He's in my hand
He understands
He said to me everything won't be so bad!

I think I'll go out drinkin'
Drinkin' all night long
Cuz if I go out drinkin'
Then I can stop thinkin'
Bout how the world done me wrong

I think I'll go out drinkin' (think I'll go out drinkin')
Drinkin' all night long (drinkin' all night long)
Cuz if I go out drinkin'
Then I can stop thinkin'
About how the worlds done me
How the worlds done me wrong (so wrong)
