[You and I are mortal
But Rock and Roll will never die.]

I never felt too good
But in this world who would?
I was always thinking
Something wasn't right
But then you came along and
Helped me sing a song and
Now I feel okay
I hope it can stay this way

You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end (Good thing!)
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end

Are these the good days
That I've heard so much about?
There goes the heartbreak
That I can live without, oh oh oh

I've been so frustrated
Bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted
All the things I've got
But now that you are here
This anger disappears
And I feel happy too
This is sappy, but it's true

You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end

Are these the good days
That I've heard so much about?
There goes the heartbreak
That I can live without
