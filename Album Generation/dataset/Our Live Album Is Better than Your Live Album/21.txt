Got some words, I don't know
Gonna sing 'em here I go
Wanna try not to be lame
Wanna make you feel the same
I just wanna be someone
Don't you know we tried to do something new
It may sound real good, but I don't think we're getting through
Because the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
I said the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
Anymore
Had a hit, famous? no
Easy come, easy go
Should be happy with what I got
Should be happy but I'm not
I just wanna be someone
Don't you know we tried to do something new
It may sound real good, but I don't think we're getting through
Because the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
I said the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
I thought there'd come a day
When I'd run out of things to say
But I know now it's true
No one listens anyway
And all we wanted was to do somethin' new
It doesn't sound so good and I know we're getting through
Because the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
I said the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
I said the kids don't like it (no, no)
The kids don't like it (no, no, no)
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all
Anymore
Got my wife beater on, steel toe Dr Martens on my feet yea
I run around in a little circle, I'm wonderin' who to beat
And you know it's really cool, cause I played football
In high school, gonna push some little girls tonight
Look out fag there's gonna be a fight
When I'm in the pit, im gonna punch and kick
When im in the pit, dont cha know?
Im gonna f*** up s***!
And you wanna be just like me, I wish I could be myself
And you wanna be just like me, I can't think
Of no one else and you know it's really great
To punch somebody right in the face
Gonna push some little girls tonight
Look out fag there's gonna be a fight
When I'm in the pit, um gonna punch and kick
When I'm in the pit I'm gonna f*** up s***!
