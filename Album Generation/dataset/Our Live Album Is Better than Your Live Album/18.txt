When I hear that song it touched me deep inside
When I saw the video, man I almost cried
You put my feelings into words, the most beautiful thing I've ever heard
I've got a record and a ticket to the show

I was a fan
Didn't understand
You said fuck off
You wanna shake my hand?

You are such an asshole [x3]
So much for rock and roll

Well maybe you had an excuse for being rude
Everybody gets it up's and moves
But then your limo pulled up next to me
My girlfriend got inside to stay
Now I'm all alone and shes with you

Who do you think you are
A big fuckin' star?
You were stuck in my head
And now you broke my heart

You are such an asshole[x3]
So much for rock and roll

[everybody jump]

You rocked my world
You took my girl
Who do you think you are?
Big big fuckin' star

I was a fan
Didn't understand
You said fuck off(fuck off!)
You wouldn't shake my hand

You are such an asshole
You are such an asshole
You are a fucking asshole

So much for rock and roll

You are such an asshole[x3]

So much, so much, so much for rock and roll
