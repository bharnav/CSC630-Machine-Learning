One, two, rock and roll, please!

Back when I met you, I didn't
Have a clue
Of the horrible agony you would
Put me through
But, now that we've done some time and
I know who you are
You're so full of shit, how did I
Let it get so far?

Well, you ruined my life
You were never my friend
And now all I can hope is that I
Never see you again

Valerie
You make me wish I was dead
Valerie
You're like a knife in my head
I'll never ever be the same
My life is ruined, you're to blame

Every moment of the
Year we spent
You pushed me further and further
Over the edge

Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe you're sorry as well
Well, I know that you are evil
You came straight out of hell

Well, you wasted my time
All of my money, too
And I never really hated
Until I met you

Valerie
You make me wish I was dead
Valerie
You're like a knife in my head, yeah
I'll never ever be the same
My life is ruined, you're to blame

Let's rock!

Valerie
Valerie

Well, you ruined my life
You were never my friend
And now all I can hope is that I
Never see you again

Valerie
You make me wish I was deadâ€”woo!
Valerie
You're like a knife in my head, yeah!
I'll never ever be the same
My life is ruined, you're to blame
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Valerie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'll never ever be the same
My life is ruined, you're to blame

Yeah!
