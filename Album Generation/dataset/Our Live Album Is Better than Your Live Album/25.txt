I hate music, I hate the scene
I hate my records, I hate CDs
I hate everyone at shows, and I hate that Rock and Roll
Cuz I know that machine sucked out my soul

Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Try thinking for yourself for once in your life

I hate the music business
It's filled with greed
It's run by old men who don't know what I need
I'm getting older fast, I hope this anger lasts
So I can have the strength to keep fighting back

Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Don't you know we're turning into zombies
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Try thinking for yourself for once in your life

Blah blah blah
Another song about the radio
Always complaining that we hate the radio
Well it's time to start the war, now here we go
Our first mission: just don't listen

Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Don't you know we're turning into zombies
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Try thinking for yourself for once in your life
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn the radio off
Try thinking for yourself for once in your life
