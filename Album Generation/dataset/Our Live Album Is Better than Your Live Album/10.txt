John:
This song's called The Set Up
Aaron:
It's about, uh. The fuck is this song about, anyway?
John:
I've never understood actually what the hell this song is fucking about
Aaron:
I really don't know, I really. Let's think about it and we'll talk afterwords. Try and figure this thing out
John:
Ok
Scott:
I think, I think. I think it's about kicking ass

Hey, hey, hey

I guess it's not fair
For me to not care
But I don't and that's why
You think I'm a great guy

But I want you and you want me too
And you need this; wanna give it to you-ooh
And I thought this time I'd say something new

Alright, yeah

I'll call you I swear
So next time be there
Can't keep up no more
Should quit but what for?

'Cause I want you and you want me too
And you need this; wanna give it to you-ooh
And I thought this time I'd feel something new

It's not cruel, I do like you
And I want you to feel that I do-doo, doo-doo
La-da, ba-da, ba-da, baa
Wow

Check this shit out

Yeah, yeah
'Cause I want you and you want me too
And you need this; wanna give it to you-ooh
And I thought this time I'd be someone true

Yeah, I want you and you want me too
And you need this; wanna give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say something new

Aaron:
So, I think that song is, like - it's about, like, a player who's, like, trying to pick up a girl and he's like, "Hey, hey baby."
Scott:
That's sexy
John:
Hey baby
Scott:
Well, with your bad back you shouldn't be picking up any girls
Aaron:
I don't know what I'm say- nah, just saying the character in the song
Scott:
Oh, well, with the character's bad back he shouldn't be up any girls
Aaron:
I can't even hear you; doesn't matter. What? Shhh. Don't yell at me, it breaks my concentration
