Your disciples are ready to kill and to die. Sacrifice women and children in
The name of an ideology. Survival instinct pushes you to commit the worst atrocities
Complete denial and stubborn. Stubbornness or intellectually challenged?
Crimes will be punished, one day your time will catch you up
It's only a matter of time. Can you hear their voices? They're all whispering
In your back. Can you feel it coming? They're plotting to cut your head off
Can you hear them knocking? They're here knocking at your door. And now all
Your enemies in an alliance are hunting you. By thousands, they're chasing you
All the ghosts of the victims plotting to cut your head off. Haunting you
