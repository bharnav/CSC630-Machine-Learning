Can you hear the silence we fill this room with? These are the noises you will
Never make, the melody for a deaf audience
And I feel so naive to have believed in you and your so-called innocence. I
Was wrong. These are the thoughts you'll fight forever
Can you hear the silence and your comforting passivity? These are the words
You'll never hear, the message you will never get. Wasting what is left
Spitting my blood to the face of humanity. Wasting what is left. I said it
Before and I'll say it again
And I feel so naive to have believed in you and your so-called innocence. I
Was wrong. Trying so hard to reach you; all in vain. Useless
Wasting my time on your polluted mind. These are the noises you'll never make
The melody for a deaf audience. Comforting yourself in a passivity
The revolt you will never endorse. In the end, I said if before and I'll say
It again: we're better off dead
