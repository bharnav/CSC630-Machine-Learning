Dying on your pedestal, alone, aside from the rest of the world. A pedestal
They built for you. Your intentions remained intentions...
Your art is a product of mass consumption benefiting some through the sale of
Plastic. Manufacturing a sound they can dance to
The illusion of a rebellion and you play along. For the record; you're
Useless. For the record; insignificant. For the record; you're futile
For the record; you think you're special; you're not. you're nothing but a
Commodity. Nothing. You think you wrote a page of history; it's false
Your actions are based on selfishness. For the record you're useless. For the
Record; you're insignificant. For the record, you're futile. For the
Record; you think you're special; you're not. There is a thousand just like
You out there dying on your pedestal, alone, aside from the rest of the world
A pedestal they built for you. Your intentions remained intentions and nothing
Else. Nothing
