Sitting in the dark, hearing voices. Voice of reason? Voices you know. Voice
Of truth? Waging a war at your demons. War at your impure thoughts
All your demons outnumbered by voices. Impure and outnumbered. the danger in
Searching for a brighter light, is to find one where there is none
Your so called impure thoughts you have is nothing but proof you're alive
Murmurs you hear when you shut your eyes are nothing but a medical condition
The danger in searching for a brighter light, is to find one where there is
None
