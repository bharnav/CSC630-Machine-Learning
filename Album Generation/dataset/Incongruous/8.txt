Oh, and this is also life. Worshiping imperfection and no one ever answers
Young innocent, only a child, your first born taken from you
Oh, and this is also life; followed the commandments and now betrayed by your God
Oh, and this is also life; lived your life by the book and now betrayed by your
God. Worshiping imperfection and no one ever answers
Begging the sky but nothing happens. Why would he have let you down? God of
Mercy now seems to you like nothing but a bringer of pain and imperfection
Begging for nothing. Worshiping imperfection. Oh, and this is also life. And
She can't explain herself why her son was taken
She begs the sky to give him back but no one ever answers back
