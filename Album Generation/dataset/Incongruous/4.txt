The air is humid
And the floor is cold, prisoner
Crime unknown

Prisoner
Awaiting my sentence

Society's disposable son
Outcast, grown apart

Institutionalized since day one, society's unwanted son
Raised by emotionless TV screen, this is everyone's crime

Go ahead pull the trigger if this is how you want it
Anywhere but here is where I want to be right now
I am the reflection of your mad world and system
Anywhere but here is where I want to be right now

Go ahead pull the trigger on your own creation

When I'll leave
I'll watch you
Right in the eyes

Society's disposable son
Outcast, grown apart

The air is humid
And the floor is cold, prisoner
Crime unknown

Sentenced
Leaving with my eyes wide open
