And your hope will lead you nowhere. Cause your hope is an act of faith
A faith in a fairy tale. A faith that serves them well. Primitive
Living under the fear of the unholy and demons. Human monstrosity
From sheep. Righteous man, spreading fear among the herd of lose sheep
With mercantile interests. To Wolf. A romantic vision of your own demise
From sheep to wolf. Selling a romantic vision of our own death
Selling a false prophecy. And so we create this monster to our image. We can relate
In order to forgive the unforgivable and perpetuate. Living under fear of
Armageddon. Bring ourselves to the limits. From sheep to wolf
