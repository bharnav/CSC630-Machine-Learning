Don’t want to spend my time, wishing you were here
Don’t want to spend my time alone
Don’t want to waste my life, dwelling on the past
Don’t want to lock myself at home

‘Cause I want, I need, nothing less than you
I want nothing else at all

Don’t want to make my excuses
Explaining it away
Just want to spend my time with you

Don’t want to walk on ice
Don’t want to live on edge
‘Cause on the edge
I’m looking down

I want more, I want more

Don’t want to spend my time
Wishing you were here
Don’t want to spend my time alone
