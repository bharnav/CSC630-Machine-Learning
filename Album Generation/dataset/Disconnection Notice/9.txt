They say people have their ways
And people stay the same
Accept the way it is
Accept that things don't change
Some people make it worse
Some people don't want to listen
In the end it all works out
In the end, they learn their lesson

But I don't believe this shit
I know I can make things better
I know it will take some work
But I'm not afraid of the dirt

What if I do nothing?
What if I just turn my back on you?
If I say nothing
What if I just walk away from you?

Walk away
I could never walk away from you

I want to give you life
I want to give you shelter
I want to take away your pain
I want to give you freedom
I want to educate the world
I want to educate my parents
I want to turn all the wrongs right
And save the lives I can

They say people have their ways
And people stay the same
Accept the way it is
I know that I can change

Walk away
I could never walk away from you
