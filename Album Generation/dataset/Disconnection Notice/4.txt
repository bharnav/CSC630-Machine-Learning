Too many nights
With too many faces
I dont know where I ve been
And too many days
With too many places
I dont know who I am

Drive into the lights
The streets are like rainclouds
Drippin into the night
Wheels keep on turning
The sky is still burning
Thunderclouds start to fly
Far away from home

Too many nights
With too many faces
I dont know where I ve been
And too many days
With too many places
I dont know who I am

Alone in backhills
The sea is my homeland
Wishin upon a car
And miles and minutes
The days are my cities
Recording my life on a map

Far away from home

Too many nights
With too many faces
I dont know where I ve been
And too many days
With too many places
I dont know who I am

And the stars make a picture
And the stars are my heaven to see

Too many nights
With too many faces
I dont know where I ve been
Too many nights
With too many faces
I dont know where I ve been
And too many days
With too many places
I dont know who I am
I dont know who I am
Yeah I dont know who I am
