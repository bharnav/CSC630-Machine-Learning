She calls me on the phone
Hoping that I'm home
And that I'm all alone
But when I say, "Hello?"
I only hear dial tone
She thinks that I'm her own

Outside my window she crept
Watching my every step

Oh, uh oh
She's following me
Oh, uh oh
She's out of her tree
Oh, uh oh
She's off of her rocker
I wanna marry my stalker!

Oh oh oh oh oh, uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, uh oh

Sometimes she says she's my mom
Looks like she doesn't belong
She's my own peeping-tom
Flowers everyday
The cops, they tell her to stay
500 feet away

She's sleeping on my doorstep
She hasn't heard me yet

Oh, uh oh
She's following me
Oh, uh oh
She's out of her tree
Oh, uh oh
She's off of her rocker
I wanna marry my stalker!

This morning she wasn't there
I hope she still cares

I almost gave up hope
But today I awoke to a private note
She said she's going to jail
For going through my mail
But she'll stay on my trail

Oh, uh oh
She's following me
Oh, uh oh
She's out of her tree
Oh, uh oh
She's off of her rocker
I wanna marry my stalker!

Oh, uh oh
She's following me
Oh, uh oh
She's out of her tree
Oh, uh oh
She's off of her rocker
I wanna marry my
I wanna marry my
I wanna marry my stalker!
