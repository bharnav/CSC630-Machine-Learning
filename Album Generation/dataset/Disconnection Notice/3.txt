Uncomfortable
I wish i was comfotable
Cuz I could show you lovable
I d sit another hour with you

Sympathy
I need a little sympathy
U asked me what i wanna be
I want a little time with you

If i could just see you again
I d show you who I am
If I could be with you again
I d show you what , I d show you what

Uncomfortable
I wish i was comfotable
Cuz I could show you lovable
I d sit another hour with you

Apathy
I wish that wasn't half of me
I hope its not the end of me
Not wishing never made it come true

If i could just see you again
I d show you who I am
If I could be with you again
I d show you what , I d show you what

Uncomfortable
I wish i was comfotable
Cuz I could show you lovable
I d sit another hour with you
