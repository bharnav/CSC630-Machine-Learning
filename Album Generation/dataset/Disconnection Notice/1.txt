I'm wasted again
Passed out don't know who I am
I'm so wasted again
Blacked out don't know where I've been
Or who I am

I thought I could make it on my own
I thought I was indestructible
I had an excuse cause i was young
I thought I was so untouchable
I would throw it all away
I would throw my life away

I'm wasted again
Passed out don't know who I am
I'm so wasted again
Blacked out don't know where I've been

I couldn't admit that I was wrong
I didn't fit in didn't belong
I was young
I was stupid
A life of despair
I was proud
I was angry
I just didn't care
I was everything I never wanted to be
I became my enemy
I would throw it all away
I would throw my life away

I'm wasted again
Passed out don't know who I am
I'm so wasted again
Blacked out don't know where I've been
Or who I am

They Said I had potential
They said I got whats coming to me
They say I got the devil (the devil)
And I dont know whats wrong with me
Whats wrong with me

I'm wasted again
Passed out don't know who I am
So wasted again
Blacked out don't know where I've been
I'm wasted again

Passed out don't know who I am
So wasted again
Blacked out don't know where I've been
Cause I'm wasted again (so wasted)
I'm wasted again (so wasted)
I'm wasted again (so wasted)
I'm wasted again (so wasted)
(so wasted)
(so wasted)
(so wasted)
