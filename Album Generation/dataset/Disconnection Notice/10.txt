I ask myself
Where has passion gone?
Have I grown up
Am I too old
I don’t feel like I did
I need to feel
There’s nothing else
Nothing left
But your taste in my mind
Where have I gone?
Where have I gone?

Then you come along to sing this song
Restore my faith like nothing’s wrong
You come along to sing this song
Restore my faith like nothing’s wrong
But I sing a new song

I feel sick
I need more than this
Where have I gone?
Where have I gone?
What shuts me down
Tears me apart
I don’t know what I am
Where’s the man
The man with dreams
One man alone
I haven’t changed a thing
