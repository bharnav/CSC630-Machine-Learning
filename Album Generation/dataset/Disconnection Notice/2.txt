Yeah ah, Yeah
Yeah ah, yeah

I never wanted
I never needed anything but you
Or any dreams come true
I never wished for
I never asked for all your little games
Or all your guilted shame

Now you're acting like you just don't care
Like you could find this one anywhere
It isn't fair

My life is an open book

My feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you
Yeah, my feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you

So now i'm asking to what had happened
To all the words you said
Well now you want me dead
If you were made for
The thing you stayed for
All that time ago

Now you're acting like you lost a friend
Like we were only pretend
Is this the end

Cuz my life is an open book

My feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you
Yeah, my feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you
(long before i ever met you)
Long before i ever met you

I wanted to take back my life
Cuz i gave it all to you
I just want to make it right
So i'm waiting on you
Yeah i'm waiting on you

My feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you
Yeah, my feelings and my meanings
Are oceansized
Long before i ever met you
