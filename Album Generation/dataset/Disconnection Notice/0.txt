I know you take from me
I know you take away my everything
My everything
I know your everyway
I know you make your way to everything
Into everything

I know your threat runs deep
I know you in my sleep
And all this time
I find it hard to swallow

I know your history
I know what you mean to me
My everything
My everything

I know your mystery will not be clear to me
My everything
My everything

I know your threat runs deep
I know you in my sleep
And all this time
I find it hard to swallow

I know your mine to keep
I know I'll always be
All this time
I find it hard to swallow

I know you take from me
I know you take away my everything
My everything
I know your everyway
I know you make your way to everything
Into everything

I know your threat runs deep
I know you in my sleep
And all this time
I find it hard to swallow

I know your mine to keep
I know I'll always be
All this time
I find it hard to swallow
