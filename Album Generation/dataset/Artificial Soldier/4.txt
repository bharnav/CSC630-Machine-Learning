Welcome to the arena of pain
Where everyone is a victim we all are to blame
Welcome to the palace of fate
Morbid transformation, distorted complications

Alluring disfiguration
Cruel intentions
Cuts my skin alive
Infested with your sickened fascination
You need to be buried
Buried alive

This paradise which burns from within
Resurrected from an empty space of sin
Fearless contemplation discarding human race
Flying under the radar of life

Alluring disfiguration
Cruel intentions
Cuts my skin alive
Infested with your sickened fascination
You need to be buried
Buried alive

Nocturnal cold emotions feeling out of place
A shameless hallucination, a sacred eternal waste
Welcome to the palace of fate
Morbid transformations, distorted complications

Alluring disfiguration
Cruel intentions
Cuts my skin alive
Infested with your sickened fascination
You need to be buried
Buried alive

Alluring disfiguration
Cruel intentions
Cuts my skin alive
Infested with your sickened fascination
You need to be buried
Buried alive
