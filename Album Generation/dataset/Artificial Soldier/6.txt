Join in the masses, believe in what you think
This human generation creates the weakest link
No more point in trying when the end result is dying
Blow your load or self explode, I am bored with this living

As I corrode
As I implode
As I corrode
As I implode

All alone (he's so desperate!)
So disturbed, he's so borderline
So alone (so forgotten!)
In this atrium of lies

Bizarre contamination
Bizarre annihilation
Suicide
Suicide

In the wake of devastation my brain defies isolation
In the face of adversity, anti-climatic hypocrisy
Lurid pacification, rulers of this nation
A fourth world destination, self immoral annihilation

As I corrode
As I implode
As I corrode
As I implode

All alone (he's so desperate!)
So disturbed, he's so borderline
So alone (so forgotten!)
In this atrium of lies

All alone (he's so desperate!)
So disturbed, he's so borderline
So alone (so forgotten!)
In this atrium of lies
