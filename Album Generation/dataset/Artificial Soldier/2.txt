Today's the day when I hate everything
No foolish devotion and the pain that it brings
Today's the day when I am sick of it all
Broken and bruised and decayed to the core

Underneath we stand so tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free

I tried to believe and be just like you
But lost all my faith and now despise all of you
The farther I fall the less I can see
The wounds you created and inflicted on me

Underneath we stand so tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free
After all comes tragedy
Forgotten lives, no eyes to see

I tried to save a small part of me
But the layers of hate dismembered me

Underneath we stand so tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free
After all comes tragedy
Forgotten lives, no eyes to see
So afraid to speak our minds
As we crawl through these times
