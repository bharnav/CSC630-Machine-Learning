In this hell they call heaven
There is little to see
There is little to feel
There is nothing to be

Devastating devils
Devastating devils
Devastating devils
Devastating devils

They promised us what we all wanted to hear
A new realm of life for the next thousand years
A new golden age of rise and expansion

Devastating devils
Devastating devils

Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers
Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers

The skies are pouring showers of burning sand
The skies are pouring showers of burning sand

They're draining the oceans
Leveling the mountains
Filling up the valleys

Devastating devils
Devastating devils

They massacre, call it progress
They plunder and call it wealth
Exterminate, abolish and steal

They turn into carrion, everything they touch
They never know nothing, they seldom knew much

Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers
Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers

Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers
Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers

They promised us more of everything, for everybody
They promised us more of everything, for everybody
They promised us more of everything, for everybody
They promised us more of everything, for everybody

Hail the barbarians
Cheer your en-dowers
Greet the barbarians
Wave your well wishers

Devastating devils
