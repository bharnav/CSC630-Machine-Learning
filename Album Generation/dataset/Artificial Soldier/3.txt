Let my DNA run through your mind
Let my DNA destroy all mankind

Massive complication
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complication

Give me shelter from above
Send two angels and a dove
As we hang on to despair
Tears of blood run from your eyes
As we cannot hide the lies
Breathing in this toxic air

Feel, feel the anger in, in my eyes
Feel, feel the sorrow from all your lies
Feel, feel the anguish in, in my brain
Chemical, chemical mind fuck, this life in disdain

Massive complication
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complication

Give me shelter from the pain
As the hate drives me insane
Seeking refuge from the rain
All in all we do believe
As we try to conceive
In this glowing afterlife

Give me shelter from above
Send two angels and a dove
As we hang on to despair
Tears of blood run from your eyes
As we cannot hide the lies
Breathing in this toxic air

Massive complication
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complication
