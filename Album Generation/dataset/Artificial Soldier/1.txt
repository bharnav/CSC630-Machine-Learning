Hollywood is burning
Everything's turning red
Rich people squirming
Pumping out the lead
Seeing is believing
Everything is free
Endless lights of glory
Drowning in the sea

Strange different faces tell different lies
Conquest of creation, it only lasts a while

Lowlife
Let's get high
Lowlife
Let's fly

City of the angels
Lifestyles of the dead
Plastic recreation
Degenerates your head
Morbid transformation
Hard to tell what's real
Stem cell masturbation
Faces made of steel

Strange different faces tell different lies
Conquest of creation, it only lasts a while

Lowlife
Let's get high
Lowlife
Let's fly

Strange different faces tell different lies
Conquest of creation, it only lasts a while

Lowlife
Let's get high
Lowlife
Let's fly

Hollywood is burning
Everything's turning red
Rich people squirming
Pumping out the lead
Seeing is believing
Everything is free
Endless lights of glory
Drowning in the sea

Time
Time to die
Time
Let's get high
