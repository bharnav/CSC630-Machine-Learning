[Verse]
Come on and hear come on and hear alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear come on and hear , it's the best band in the land!
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before
So natural that you want to go to war
That's just the bestest band in the land, honey lamb!
Come on along
Come on along, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man
Up to the man who's the leader of the band
And if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear , alexander's ragtime band!
