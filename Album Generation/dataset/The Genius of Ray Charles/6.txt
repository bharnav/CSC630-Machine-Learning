[Chorus]
Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain

[Verse 1]
To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, i was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will

[Chorus]
Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

[Verse 2]
Although you're free and having your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill [x2]

[Outro]
And baby you, you, made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill
