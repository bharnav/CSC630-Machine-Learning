[Verse 1]
I'll always love you the same old way
No matter what may come between
Just send me a smile
Once in a lonely while
Tell me, you'll wait for me

[Verse 2]
How can i forget you starry eyes
You hair when its lit by the moonlit skies
Just keep that smile in you
Till i come home to you
Tell me, you'll wait for me

[Chorus]
You're the one, you're the one
Whom i love, and care so much for
But now, til it ends, i'll just wish to be near
Caressing you dear

[Verse 3]
I'll always dream of dreams with you
Those things we meant to say and do
Keep them a glow
Someday we'll make them so
And tell me, you'll wait for me [x2]
