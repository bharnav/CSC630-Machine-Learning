[Chorus]
Do i want you
Oh my, do i?
Honey, 'deed i do
Do i need you?
Oh my, do i
Honey, 'deed i do

[Verse]
I'm glad that i'm the one who found you
That's why i'm always hanging around you
Do i love you?
Oh my, do i?
Honey, 'deed i do
There are lots of others that i have met
Those you meet today, tomorrow forget
You're the only one who ever could stand the test
That's the reason why i choose you from the rest
You're the best

[Chorus]
