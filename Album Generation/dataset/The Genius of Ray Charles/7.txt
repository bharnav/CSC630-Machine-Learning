[Verse]
I want you, i need you, i'm all packed up to go
But darling, if you love me, you won't let me go
If a love's a true love, it never runs smooth you know
So if your love is a true love, you won't let me go
If you don't say you love me, i'm gonna walk right
Out the door
And i'll hope that you'll stop me, so i can hear you
Call me darling once more
I tell you i love you, yes i love you
With all my heart and soul, so darling if you love me
You won't let me go
Hey i love you now, i say i love you
Oh with all my heart and soul
So darling well if you love me
I know you won't let me go
Girl i know you won't let me go
