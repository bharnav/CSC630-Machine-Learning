[Verse 1]
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Crying at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more

[Verse 2]
Don't let the sun catch you lying
Lying at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
And baby, you made him so sore

[Chorus]
You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

[Verse 1]

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2]

[Outro]
Whoa, you know you done me dirty now
And i just don't want you no more
