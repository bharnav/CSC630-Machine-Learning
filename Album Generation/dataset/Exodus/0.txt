[Verse 1 ] [Bob Marley]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why

[Verse 2]
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie;
One and all have to face reality now
Although I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Although I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie

There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear

[Verse 3] [Bob Marley]
Such a natural mystic, blowing through the air
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why

[Outro]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
