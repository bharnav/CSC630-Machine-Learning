[Chorus 1]
"Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

[Chorus 2]
Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"

[Chorus 1]
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing (don't worry)
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

[Chorus 2]
Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"

[Chorus 1]
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing (worry about a thing, oh)
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright (don't worry)
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing (I won't worry)
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

Singing: "Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright (I won't worry)
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

Singing: "Don't worry about a thing (don't worry about a thing)
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
