Root, natty, roots; dread, kinky, dread
I and I are the roots

Some are leaf (shoo-be-doo)
Some are branches (shoo-be-doo)
I and I are the roots

Some are dry wood (shoo-be-doo)
For the fire (shoo-be-doo)
Whyo, look at that

They need a dry wood (shoo-be-doo)
To cook their raw food (shoo-be-doo)
Whyo, look at that
Got to survive in this man-mania downpression
Got to survive in iration

Me say, root, natty, root
Dread, kinky, dread
I and I are the roots

Some are wolf (shoo-be-doo)
In sheep clothing (shoo-be-doo)
Whyo, look at that

Many are called (shoo-be-doo)
A few are chosen (shoo-be-doo)
Whyo, look at that

Nothing they can do (shoo-be-doo)
To separate IandI (shoo-be-doo)
From the love of our Father
You see, blood is thicker than water
Whyo, look at that
Got to survive in the ghetto
Got to survive, people don't fret, no

We got a root, natty, root
Dread, kinky, dread
I and I are the roots

Root natty
Dread kinky
I and I are the roots
