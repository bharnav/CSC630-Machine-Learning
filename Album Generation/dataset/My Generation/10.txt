{Guitar riff intro}

[Verse 1]
I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
But I've freed my head from your garden rails

[Chorus 1]
Now it's a legal matter, baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

[Verse 2]
My mind's lost in a household fog
Wedding gowns and catalogs
Kitchen furnishings and houses
Maternity clothes and babies' trousers

[Chorus 2]
Now it's a legal matter, baby
Marryin's no fun
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

{Intro}

[Verse 1]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
You ain't the first and you ain't the last
I gain and lose my women fast
I never want to make them cry
I just get bored, don't ask me why
Just want to keep doing all the dirty little things I do
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you
Sorry, baby
