[Intro]
It's not true

[Chorus 1]
You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

[Chorus 2]
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
Because I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there

[Chorus 3]
I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

[Chorus]

[Verse]
If you hear more rumors
You can just forget them too
Fools start the rumors
None of them are true

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2][x2]
