[Verse 1]
If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me, who's this by my side?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies
You can't repeat what you put around
All the things that made me cry
You kicked me when I was down
And they hurt me all those lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies
I've got my girl and together we're strong
To laugh at you and prove you wrong

[Chorus]
I don't insist that you feel bad
I just want to see you smile
Don't ever think you made me mad
I didn't listen to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

[Verse 2]
If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me, who's this by my side?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

[Chorus]
