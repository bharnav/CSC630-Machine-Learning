For his age, he is wise
He's got his mother's eyes
There's gladness in his heart
He's young and he is wild
My only prayer, is if I can't be there
Lord, oh Lord, protect my child

As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him play, oh it makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, oh Lord, protect my child

While the whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things that you find are worthwhile
And though I don't ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, oh Lord, protect my child

He is young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled
And if I fall along the way
And can't see another day
Lord, oh Lord, protect my child

There'll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But till men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, oh Lord, protect my child
Oh yes, Lord, protect my child
Oh Lord, protect my child
