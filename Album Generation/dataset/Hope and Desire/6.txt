Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me
When you hold me close, and you say: "That's all over."
You won't go looking back, you don't hold the cards too stacked
Darlin', you mean what you say

Sweet forgiveness, you help me see
I'm not near as bad, as I sometimes appear to be
When you hold me close, and you say: "That's all over
And I still love you."

There's no way that I could make up
For those angry words I said
Sometimes it gets to hurting
And the pain goes to my head

Sweet forgiveness, dear God above
I say we all deserve, a taste of that kind of love
Someone who'll hold on to our hand
And whisper: "I understand, and I still love you."
