Boy, you better go back in your mind
Try to find yourself a brand new line
I'll love you but you're toying with me
So if you can't change, go on let me be

Well I'm sick of your lies
Tired of my tears
Boy if you want me, you better tell it like it is

Oh when a girl meets a boy she likes
She starts to dream, before she knows it, she's caught right in his scheme
But I used to believe every word you say
Realize now that was yesterday

When I'm with you I lose control
That's why I'm offering you my heart and soul
You better take it now, because when it's gone
I won't even answer my telephone
