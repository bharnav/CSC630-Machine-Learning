Sad and lonely all the time
That's because I've got a worried mind
You know the world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere

So just read your paper, and you'll see
Just exactly what's been worryin' me
The world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere

My love for the world is like always
For the world is a part of me
That's why I'm so afraid
Of the progress that's been made
Towards eternity

Every morning, noon and night
Finds me hoping that everything is alright
You know the world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere
