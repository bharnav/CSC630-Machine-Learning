There are multitudes of people crying
'Cause they just won't try to understand
From the Book I read, not one but all must follow him
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band

There are multitudes of people dying
Seems like temptation rules over the land
You know those people should remember his commandments
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band

Singing in a band, talking to the man
Bringing in the sheep all over the world as fast as they can
Singing in a band, talking to the man
Drop everything you're doing and join the sanctuary band

The Son of Man he speaks of revelation
And he's reaching out, reaching out his hand
You know he has promised to bring us all salvation
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band
