Un-deux-trois-go!

Sitting in the surgeon's world, a surgeon's will
A surgeon's girl with me
Standing on a river bed, where weeds can be
I'm on my knee, to you

I've seen you in glossy mags
Glossy mags, glossy mags
I've seen you in glossy mags
Go insane, go insane, go insane, go insane
Go insane, go insane, go insane, go insane
Go insane, go insane, go insane
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

I
Said you weren't a tuna fish, put in a tin
They're very big, ha-ha

I've seen you in glossy mags
Glossy mags, glossy mags
I've seen you in glossy mags
Go insane, go insane, go insane, go insane
Go insane, go insane, go insane, go insane
Go insane, go insane, go insane
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Go insane, go insane, go insane, go insane, me!
