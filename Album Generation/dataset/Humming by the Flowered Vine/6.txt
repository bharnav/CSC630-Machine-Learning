Wishing I could see you again dear
That the fire of love would burn once more;
But I guess that's wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

Just thinking of how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant good-bye;
But I guess that's wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry

I'll just live my life in dreams and long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for and it's you I'm thinking of

My heart echos the love words you've spoken
How I wish I could hear them from you;
Won't you answer a heart that is broken
And make my wishful thinking come true
