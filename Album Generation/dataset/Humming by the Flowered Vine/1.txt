I've been thinking
About you
About change
About life
It turned so strange
What you said
Turned so strange
What you said

Now I see you
And now I don't
And now the word's caught in my throat
I can't reply
To what you said

The moon in the sky
A perfect half
A perfect half
As long as the moon's forever changing
I'm forever loving you

Now you see me
And now you don't
And now the word's caught in my throat
I can't reply
To what you said
