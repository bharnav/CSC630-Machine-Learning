Your mama wasn’t one to mess around with
Had a fleet of cars and all those flashy clothes
Taught you the discipline of doing what she told
Kept her fist around the money tightly closed

She had all you kids to think of
One more precious than the rest
Big brothers running wild, you learned to kick your heels in style
Did you have it worst or have it best

When you grew like a California Rose
The color of your clothes
Blooming even as the earth cracked and dried
You sang easy and so sweet
Dust under your feet
Opened your heart as natural as can be …

Mama never suffered any in-laws
Ran them all away eventually
Had a plan to keep you near and a soldier boy who took her deal
Down to city hall a teenage bride to be
Next came along the baby carriage
Blessed event came unforeseen
No child in mamas eyes, circumstance easy to hide
Where did you put your loyalty

When you cry like a California Rose?
Scarlet Crimson Robes
Fading even as you reached to the sky
You sang heavy and so sweet
Your heart it barely beat
From the hurting it would carry from now on

No one would ever say
You’d hesitate to take the blame
I'm still wondering today
Where is your name in that hall of fame?

When you grew like a California Rose
The color of your clothes
Blooming even as the earth cracked and dried
You sang easy and so sweet
Dust under your feet
Opened your heart just as natural as can be …
