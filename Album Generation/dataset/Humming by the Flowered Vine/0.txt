I see you walking up 14th Street, and you don't know
That I'm walking right behind you, walking real slow
I don't want to catch up with you 'cause once we got started
We'd have to see it through

I see you on the street, you kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
While I'm losing sleep

I see you walking up 14th Street, and you don't know
I'm following behind you counting my steps as I go
Maybe ten steps or twelve, divide us in two
Not counting the blocks between me and you

I see you on the street, you kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
While I'm losing sleep

People said watch out for that situation
It's nothing more than crazy infatuation
Insisting it was love, I weighed common sense
I played with my heart till I saw how much I spent

I see you walking up 14th Street and you don't know
Now I'm so close behind you, almost in your shadow
Maybe one step or two, and I'd be walking next to you
Not counting the blocks between me and you

I see you on the street, you kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
While I'm losing sleep

I see you on the street and my knees go weak
Nothing to lose while I'm losing sleep
