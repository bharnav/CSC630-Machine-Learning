Khaki and corduroy
Leather jackets on the boys
Denim with a worn out place on the pocket

Open faces with knowing looks
Your heavy satchel full of books
Smiles tucked away in mamas lockets
Sometimes I see their faces in the most unlikely places

You play it straight most of the time
But you're looking for the perfect crime
Find your mark and make your move
Nothing harmed and nothing proved

One night spent on that cold tile floor
Then you creep home guilty like before
Learning how to break or bend
Broken now but sure to bend

Sometimes I see their faces in the most unlikely places

Late hours in the Spanish clubs
With your arms around the one you love
Find the beat slow and sweet
Neon glow and dance floor heat

Walk by that river in the dark midnight
With that water reflecting in your eyes
Wild currents pulling you away
Standing still I have to stay

Sometimes I see their faces in the most unlikely places
