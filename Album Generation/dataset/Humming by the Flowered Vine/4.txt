I used to take the subway
To 42nd and Broadway
Check my downtown mailbox
Check my downtown mailbox

Always felt much better
When I got a letter
In my downtown mailbox
In my downtown mailbox

Send me a letter
Send it to me when you want to reach me
Might be in California, New York City or Nashville, Tennessee

Baby and I had a fight
I couldn't sleep last night
Thought he didn't want me no more
Thought he didn't want me no more

I was satisfied
When I went outside
Found a letter on my front door
Letter on my front door

Send me a letter
Send it to me when you want to reach me
Might be in California, New York City or Nashville, Tennessee
Early in the day late at night
Whatever you're feeling you can always write
Send me a letter send it to me when you want to reach me

It wasn't very funny
I didn't have much money
There was not much food on the table
Not much food on the table

I was feeling pretty low
I heard a knock at my door
It was Western Union with a cable
Western Union with a cable

Send me a letter
Send it to me when you want to reach me
Might be in California, New York City or Nashville, Tennessee
Early in the day late at night
Whatever you're feeling you can always write
Send me a letter, send it to me when you want to reach me
