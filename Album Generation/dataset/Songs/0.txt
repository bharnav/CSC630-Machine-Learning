Oh Must be heaven, so this is how it feels

What is this I feel?
I'm so insecure
Could this be for real?
Could this be for sure?
Oh

Cause evertime that you're near
I can't get you out of my mind
In my heart, you're one of a kind

(Refrain)
It must be heaven
It's too good to be true
It's just like heaven everytime I'm with you
It feels like heaven
Yes I know that this must be love

I never ever felt this with you before
But how I wish that you could be with me once more
I guess I'm in love with you

Every night I dream someone's kissing me
And funny how it may seem
It's you that I always see
Oh

I need someone who'll share my world
I never thought it's gonna be you
Who's gonna make all my dreams come true

(Refrain)
It must be heaven
It's too good to be true
It's just like heaven everytime I'm with you
It feels like heaven
Yes I know that this must be love

* With you I think it better be now or never
My foolish heart needs to be with you
Forever
I guess I'm in love with you

(Refrain)
It must be heaven
It's too good to be true
It's just like heaven everytime I'm with you
It feels like heaven
Yes I know that this must be love

I never ever felt this with you before
But how I wish that you could be with me once more
I guess I'm in love with you

It must be heaven
It's too good to be true
It's just like heaven everytime I'm with you
It feels like heaven
Yes I know that this must be love

* With you I think it better be now or never
My foolish heart needs to be with you
Forever
I guess I'm in love with you
