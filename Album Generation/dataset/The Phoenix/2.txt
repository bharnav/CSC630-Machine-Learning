Lyfe talking:

Yeah
Alot of mysteries alot of histories
To much blowing up ans showing up
And not enough growing up
I mean it happens people change
You know better changes everything
But um most of all we've changed

[verse 1]
Sometimes, making up
Is easier than breaking up
We believe if we just
Fake it enough we can
Trick ourselves into believing that
We're still in love
But in our hearts we know that it's inevitable
Though it's hard to let you go I know I must
Sometimes memories just ain't enough
Sometimes you outgrow the ones you love
Sometimes it's none of the above
It's just the fact that people change
No one's to blame
There ain't nothing that stays the same

So we sit around and cry
Because neither one of us want to be the first to say

Goodbye
Bye, Bye. Bye Oooooo

[verse 2]
Sometimes giving second chances
Is easier than dealing with the fact that
Once the trust is gone you can never get it back
But your holding on because you're afraid of being alone
So here you are holding on to something that's already gone
And don't act like it's the first time you've heard it in this song
Cause your heart done told you all along
If your momma done showed you right from wrong
No thing should hold you down this long
There's no one to blame nothing stays the same
So we sit around and cry
Cause neither one of us wants to be the first to say good bye
So let me be the first to say...

Chorus

(Spoken)
Goodbye
