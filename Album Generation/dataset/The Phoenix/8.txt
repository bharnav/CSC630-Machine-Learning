So you know I was like
I had so many things, I mean my
My album was almost Platinum
But in, but in reality I don't know, man
It's was like, I was, I was still
I was sad all over again, man
And I could not understand, I was like
I was a spiritually dehydrated man
So I had to go back, I had to rewind back to the things
That I did when I was incarcerated man, I had to go
You know when you be spiritually dehydrated man
You gotta go back to the river
