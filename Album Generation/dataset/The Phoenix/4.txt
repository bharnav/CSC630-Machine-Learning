[Interlude]
So we was together for a while after that, you know thing-things did get a little better you know what i'm saying? You know that was about the time I met somebody else, I met this lady you know, and um, and another lady other than her. You know I got my record deal, you know what i'm saying? And things was like all love man I mean it was like, you know all these things that I had dreamed about was now coming true man and I- hell I ain't ashamed to say man, I fel- I felt like... like Biggie nigga!

[Intro]
First off I gotta send a shoutout to Brooklyn, BK in the building stand up
Second of all man I tell you, when I do these interviews out here man, all these cats always asking who do I mostly resemble in the music game
So I think to myself, why, who could I say, haha, I mostly resemble in this game, and one name keep on circulating, through my brain man, none other, ya'll know him, it's Biggie nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm from a place where them niggas don't talk a lot
License suspended so we walk a lot
Always been a thug since I was a young cat
Breast fed by Godzilla mix my Similac with cognac whoa
Now I can't even pray no more
Cause I done did, so much dirt and smoked, so much dro
I'm afraid, God'll be like, what you calling here for
Don't be tying up my line up asking me for shit no more, whoa

[Hook]
It's biggie nigga, reincarnated as a skinny nigga
Yeah, it's biggie nigga, reincarnated as a skinny nigga

[Verse 2]
I done seen church boys get killed like that
Run off at the mouth when they ain't built like that
So for all you "wanna be"'s out there who attitude is shitty
Yeah, God don't like ugly but he ain't too fond of pretty neither
I'm a hustler from the top of my du-rag
To the bottom of these Timbs that done left prints on many backs like 50 said
These industry niggas ain't friends
And if ya'll don't like what I'm saying
Ya'll gon have to murder me again, cause

[Hook]
It's biggie nigga, reincarnated as a skinny nigga
Yeah, it's biggie nigga, reincarnated as a skinny nigga

[Outro]
So for all these cats out here doing what you do man, you Biggie
For all these cats our here doing some positive in your community, you Biggie
For all you rap cats here that's on the struggle tryna come up man, you Biggie
For all you cats out here doing that nonsense on that bullshit, you ain't Biggie nigga
Hahaha...
This ya boi Lyfe Jennings man a.k.a. Biggie nigga
