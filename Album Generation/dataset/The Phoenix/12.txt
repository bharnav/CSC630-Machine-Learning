Verse 1
See im jealous of your clothes
Cause they touch you more than I do
It kills me sometimes to know
That your toes spend so much time with your shoes
And no I dont approve of your lipstick
Maybelline ain't tricking me and I see
How eager your panties be to get put on
So when you're gone I tease the ones you did not choose
I dont know about you but

CHORUS
I'm stingy
Don't want anything to touch you there
I dont wanna share you with nothing
Not even the air you breathe
Hook you lungs up to me
Stingy
Don't want nothing to touch you baby

Verse 2
And I often cuss out your bath water
For every moment you're gone
I almost lost my cool when I heard you bought that thong
Victoria Secret can't keep a secret too long
I know what they want so please don't
Be so naiive to what your bra does.When it's groping you

Cause they like to taste your nipples too
I don't know bout you but

CHORUS
I'm stingy
Let me touch you there
I dont wanna share you with nothing
Not even the air you breathe
Hook you lungs up to me
Stingy
Let me touch you there

See I wash my hands before I touch you
So I dont have to share with the germs
See my heart is so concerned(so concerned)
Oh So many things that I have yet to learn about you baby

CHORUS
I'm stingy
Let me touch you there
I dont wanna share you with nothing
Not even the air you breathe
Hook you lungs up to me
Stingy
Let me touch you there
