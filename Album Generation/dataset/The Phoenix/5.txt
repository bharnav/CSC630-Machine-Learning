[Verse 1]
We grew up in the gutter, eatin peanut butter sandwich's, with no jam
We looked up to the hustler's on the corner, throat sore from screaming, get yo money man
Had dreams of moving on up to the big leagues, like George, Weezy and Florence
But it's kinda hard when the police having you killed, resurrected and re-arrested for old bench warrants
Yeah its a struggle man, but we handle it, the best we can
Only difference between, folks that's free and folks in jail, is some of us got caught, on our way to heaven, taking the short cut through hell

[Chorus]
Ghetto superman faster than a Cadillac
Able to leap tall buildings when police is on yo back (yea)
It's a bird its a plane no its ghetto superman
Talk slicker than Republicans
Sold almost as much dope as Uncle Sam
Yo friendly neighborhood superman

[Verse 2]
If you'd played on my playground, you'll get use to hearing stay down, they shootin'
Lost my daddy in a shootout chest all blew out, another family ruined
Had dreams of findin' a good job, so he wouldn't have to rob, (nigga I'm a stick up kid)
Finally get what we deserved, instead of having to take what they give us
Yeah its a struggle man but we takin' it, one bullet at a time, but its kinda hard to get that monkey off ya back, while that monkey still on ya mind on ya miiinnd

[Chorus]
Ghetto superman faster than a Cadillac
Able to leap tall buildings when police is on yo back (yea)
It's a bird its a plane no its ghetto superman
Talk slicker than Republicans
Sold almost as much dope as Uncle Sam
Yo friendly neighborhood superman

Its a bird its a plane no its ghetto superman ya'll (4x's)
