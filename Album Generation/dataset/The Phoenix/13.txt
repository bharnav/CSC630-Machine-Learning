I remember shoot outs over necklaces
Little debbie breaksfasts
Growing up in the projects, life stinks
Drinking fifths of hennessy to forget my misery
Struggling out here in these streets
Barely living in this world
And this world is just so hateful
Chorus
It's just so hateful
The kids are so ungrateful
And I'm no longer able to disguise my disgust
And I know they're saying
We should trust the lord will come and help us
And maybe i'm just being selfish but I've had enough
But when my song comes on the radio
I forget all my troubles
And for one moment I'm not there at all
No matter where in my life I am that's my jam
Said when my song comes on the radio
I forget all of my troubles
And for one moment I'm not there

I remember fighting with my babysitter
Life without no father figure
Searching for my daddy's killer, life stinks
Working jobs that I don't like
Cussing out God every night

For giving me this awful life
And it dont stop 'cause this world

Chorus

Yo I done been in a lot of street fights
Got a hood stripes but I ain't immune to pain
Whether you are seventeen, balck, white, gay, straight, or a lesbian
We all go through the same thing on one level or another
You never had a dad, had a part time mother
You had a good girl but you was too gutter
Mommie got a man now but you still love her
Some things just fall apart like some words break your heart
Even if you dont admit it sometimes i the back of your mind
You really want to fall down and cry and never get up
But you gotta get up 'cause you gotta pay bills even though you feel like a loser
But you ain't a loser you God's child and can't nothing move ya
But when my song comes on the radio
I forget all of my troubles
For one moment i'm not there at all
No matter where in my life i am
Thats my jam, thats my jam
When my song comes on the radio
I forget all of my troubles
And for one moment i'm not there at all
No matter where in my life i am
Thats my jam
