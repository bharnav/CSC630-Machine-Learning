*Intro*

Yea, I had to come back with something,whats on my heart ya'll
I mean you like to look at dem girls in those short shorts all dat good stuff, but dont let it fool you man ,dem short shorts dont compare to dat women you got at home man, and you gon miss her when shes gone
-Verse 1-

Never miss a good thing till its gone
I never meant to hurt you girl i was wrong
I always knew that one day you would move on, wit yo life
But i guess, in the back of my mind
I thought you would come home one more time,ah
I heard it through the grapevine you got a man
They say he treats you good an he makes ya laugh
Im happy for ya baby, and i ain't mad at you
May all your kids do good in school
And may your dreams you have come true, and I will
* Chorus*

I'll always love you,girl,I'll always care

And girl you gotta know, that i'll always love you, girl, and no matter where you know that my love is never far

-Verse 2-
A happy womens worth her weight in gold
Loneliness is, good for the soul
Expensive places,lovely faces come, and go
But you only find your soul mate once
And if you miss your chance you'll never find it again
I can't complain I did this to myself
You needed me and I wasn't there to help
It breaks my heart to see you loving someone else
I will give anything I own
If I could just have my baby home

*Chorus*
(3x)
