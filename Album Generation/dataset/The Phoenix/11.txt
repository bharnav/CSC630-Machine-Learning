Lovely as summertime
Always been a friend of mine
Slicker than banana peels
Cooler than three pair of high heels
You'll always be the highlight of my life
Loved you like I love my fellas on the block
More valuable than Coca-Cola stock,whoa
If I had my way, this love will never stop
You're the only one that matters
Since i lost my pops
Girl you are...

Chorus...
More than a girl
More than a friend
Someone i can depend on
'Til the end
Most folks talk about me 'cause
They dont see what we see
Its the difference between

Hating and loving me

Wonderful like a newborn baby's smile
Amazing like being baptized in the Nile
Put me in and press rewind
Do that to me one more time
You will always be the highlight of my life
More alive than Biggie and Pac
Stronger than a pair of granddaddy's old socks
If i had my way, this love will never stop
Don't ever worry about me leaving
'cause i'm satisfied with what I've got

Chorus

More than a girl, More than a girl, More than a girl, you are my friend
Do that again, Do that again, Do that again, girl dont stop yet
Just wanna touch you, To thank you, To love you, for what you've given
You will always be my girl
And i will always be your man
