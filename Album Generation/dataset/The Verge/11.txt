[Verse 1]
I'd be changing if I were you [x2]
Get a hold of yourself
(Why don't you) get a hold of yourself
Dollar on your pillow to steal your tooth [x2]

[Pre-Chorus]
Share a bit of the wealth
(I know you)
Get a hold of yourself

[Chorus]
There you go pulling favors
Pulling favors like you would
Best of luck
Cross your fingers, cross your fingers like you should
I've been through all your lies
And I'm watching from a distance
Your lifelike pantomime

[Verse 2]
Get what you take and take what you get [x2]
Get a hold of yourself
(Why don't you) get a hold of yourself
Wonder what's next: to sink or swim? [x2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Was it something I did?
Were you gone from the beginning?
Changing faces, switching places from the start
Are you done giving in
To every role that you've been playing?
Spread the message of exactly who you are
Get a hold of yourself
Why don't you get a hold of yourself?

[Chorus]
