[Verse 1]
No need to explain 'cause I know your story
You're making your claims to have the guts and glory
You're sad, sad, sadly mistaken
Your steady mistakes give me a bloody rush
We burn at the stake while you keep bashing your love
You're sad, sad, sadly mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me make you familiar
You say you're going up, I beg to differ
I think you're going straight on down, down, down
In a hail of gunfire

[Chorus 1]
I'm on a hunt (hunt) hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust (lust) lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, 'cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
A better one naturally

[Verse 2]
Remove at the sound of every single footstep
You're laying it down as you sing yourself away
Your sad little songs tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me make you familiar
You say you're going up, I beg to differ
And now you're going down, down, down
In a hail of gunfire

[Chorus 2]
I'm on a hunt (hunt) hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust (lust) lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, 'cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
A better one naturally, naturally
Hey

[Bridge]
So whatcha saying
Who ya playing
'Cause I'm about to make you tame

[Chorus 1]
I'm on a hunt (hunt) hunt for your chemicals
I've got the lust (lust) lust for the criminal in you
Just trust me, 'cause I'll be honest
You think you got it all but I think you lost it
You're a fake or a fraud
A better one naturally

[Outro]
You're a fake or a fraud
A better one naturally
