[Verse 1]
I am a third-world product of inflation
Some secondhanded information down
So you can watch me burn
I am a good boy with some bad ideas
The only child of all your fears now

[Chorus 1]
These days were playing out like re-run episodes
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
I'm sick with something more than just a common cold
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
Save [x6] me from the light

[Verse 2]
I am a pure fuel for all your fires
The spitting image of your worst desires
Now, sit back and live and learn
So come on now and get it right
It's only a moment-less waste of time
Just come down

[Chorus 2]
These days are playing out like re-run episodes
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
I'm sick with something more than just a common cold
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
Save [x6]

[Bridge]
I can be your meaning, I can shoulder all your blame
Point me to the ceiling, so I can spark a flame

[Chorus 3]
These days are playing out like re-run episodes
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
I'm sick with something more than just a common cold
I'm done
Done with the same old, same old
So kiss me goodbye
As I dive into tomorrow for the better life, so
Save [x6]
