[Hook]
Never say you could if you couldn't
Never say you will if you won't come any closer
Then you already are, you already are

[Verse 1]
You don't need an army to soldier on
Savor the dark to turn the lights up brighter
Then ever before [x2]
Are you over going under
When everybody else is going higher
So much higher
So come up with me

[Chorus 1]
So I'm taking the joyride
Going elsewhere I suppose
I'm taking the joyride
To somewhere I don't know
Let's take the high road [x2]

[Verse 2]
We can kiss the sky with flaming lips
And deny ever sparking fires, all these fires
So burn up with me

[Chorus 2]
Well I'm taking the joyride
Going elsewhere I suppose
I'm taking the joyride
To somewhere I don't know
Let's take the high road to wherever you are [x2]
And we could drive miles away
Miles away
Take me away
Miles away

(Never say you could if you couldn't) [x2]

[Hook]

[Chorus 3]
Let's take the joyride
Going elsewhere I suppose
I'm taking the joyride
To somewhere I don't know
Let's take the high road (high road) to wherever you are [x2]
So we could drive miles away
Miles away
