[Verse 1]
I felt a hand pull me deeper under
It always makes me wonder
Was it you?
I met somebody else, the impression I fell under
It felt an awful lot like it was you

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it you caught my attention?
Was it you showed your face anywhere but here?
I'd like to see you go

[Chorus 1]
I see blu
Underwater next to you
The seven seas don't have a clue
Of where to hide someone like you
I see blu
Underwater next to you
Every wave brings me bad news

[Verse 2]
I love the deep end
It holds me so much closer
I'm drowning in the flood I know as you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
I see blu
Underwater next to you
The seven seas don't have a clue
Of where to hide someone like you
I see blu
Underwater next to you
Every wave brings me bad news, news

[Bridge]
I'm scaling half the ocean
Burying your name
But I found the seas all frozen
After coming all this way

[Chorus 2]

Bad news, news
