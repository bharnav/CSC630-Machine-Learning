[Verse 1]
You're too busy
Laying passed out on the floor, on the floor
Sitting pretty
Had it mapped out from before, from beforehand
Are you feeling the pressure from cigarette burns
You're learning your lesson from taking your turns
Fall away [x2]

[Chorus]
I could run for days, days in your circle of lies
Spin me around, round your head with your goodbyes
Come to pass, pass me by

[Verse 2]
In the city
Where you've got nowhere left to run, left to run
You can hop the fences
But you better not jump the gun, jump the gun

[Chorus]

(Saw you in your tracks
Make you come right back to life)

[Bridge]
Baby let's call it quits
While we're both ahead of time, time
Playing with consequence
Didn't you read between the lines, the lines?
Fall away [x2]

[Chorus]

[Hook - x3]
(Come to pass, pass me by)
I could run for days, I could run for days

[Outro]
(Come to pass, pass me by)
Days in your circle of lies
So goodbye
