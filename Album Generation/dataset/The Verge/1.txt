[Verse 1]
I found a road
Where they color-coated my pledge of allegiance
Cleaned out my soul
Gave me the old ways to deal with my demons
See past the smoke
They cover scars just to shadow the weakness
Not found alone
See only nothing for miles upon my house

[Chorus 1]
I was chasing down the feeling I get when I touch the sky
(When I touch the sky)
Dancing through changes all into the morning light
Now it's you and I going nowhere, nowhere tonight

[Verse 2]
Well it's always cloudy
Cause I'm burning tires to break through the ceiling
Fill in the blank, cause I'm saying nothing
Nothing you would want to miss
Hope to win over all the promises
Lock away our confidence
They say, "Forever, forever"
Whatever

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge 1]
We're going separate ways on nowhere boulevard [x2]
There's no more time to make on nowhere boulevard
We waste away our days on nowhere boulevard

[Chorus 2]
Chasing down the feeling I get when I touch the sky
(When I touch the sky)
Dancing through changes all into the morning light
Trying to be the dazzled, clip my wings to stop my flight
Now it's you and I, going nowhere, nowhere tonight

[Bridge 2]
We're going separate ways on nowhere boulevard [x2]
We waste away our days on nowhere boulevard
