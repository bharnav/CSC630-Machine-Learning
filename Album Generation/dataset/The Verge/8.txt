[Verse 1]
Slide on down
Identify with every single sound that cuts you at the core
Turn around, facing backwards
Just to hold off everything you have in store
'cause the road froze over on my way back home
It's a long October down here in the catacombs

[Chorus 1]
Slip inside [x2]
Ride the downward slope
Slip inside [x2]
How far will you go?
Open fire [x2]
On everything you know
'cause I've been sleeping
In the barrel of your gun

[Verse 2]
Here I lie
Let your head fall on the curbside
And we can dodge cars all night
'cause I can only hope you stand corrected
When the time comes to make leaps and bounds
Right out of this town

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Now I'm one step closer to the end, I know
And I'm sliding down, so here I go
Cause the road froze over on my way back home
It's a long October down here in the catacombs

[Chorus 2]
Slip inside [x2]
Ride the downward slope
Slip inside [x2]
How far will you go?
Open fire [x2]
On everything you know
'cause I've been sleeping
I've been sleeping
In the barrel of your gun
