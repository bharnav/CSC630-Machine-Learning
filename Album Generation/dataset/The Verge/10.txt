[Verse 1]
Time takes us back from going through motions
By daydream of friends are flown victim to cold hard facts
It's so hard to be patient
When quicksand is traded for dust from the past
To prove on, to prove on, move on

[Chorus]
The changing of times will blow over
We can runaway (runaway), runaway
The minute hand stopped for a second
And we're waiting for the stopwatch affair

Stopwatch affair

[Verse 2]
We're something special, we look so much the same
No difference between, the subtle intake
Well, you can take my hand, we can take a break
Imagine a time where there's time left to take
To prove on, to prove on, move on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We hold our own, hold our own
Where were you going?
Time left us no room to spare

[Chorus]

Stopwatch affair [x3]
(Move on) [x2]

[Outro: Instrumental]
