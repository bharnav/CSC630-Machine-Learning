[Hook 1]
Well, I was hoping
I could crash the course you made out of imagination
I feel it
Do you feel it?
Cause I don't want to get by, get by, get by

[Verse 1]
If pleasure is the ultimate weapon
Then what's to say about all the pain?
Well, passion is like a school in session
You better think of something clever to say
You look desperate by befriending the cool kids
But how long will the popular take?
The tension's building up, like a fever
You gotta wonder when the hell it'll break, break

[Hook 2]
Well, I was hoping
I could crash the course you made out of imagination
I feel it
Do you feel it?
Cause I don't want to get by, get by, get by this time

[Verse 2]
It's too early to find out how it works for you
You might as well be showing them plaid
If it's you got stitching out on a hard pursuit
I hope you're planning on having to wait
Cause all I want to do is throw a price on you
Count you like a number then continue to do what I must
Do what I must to get paid, to get played

[Hook 2]
Cause I don't want to get by, get by, get by
It's been lonely here lately
When you're on the other side [x2]

[Bridge]
So what's it like to be you
So one of a kind?
So what's it like to be you
On the other side?

[Hook 3]
Well, I'm still hoping
I could crash the course you made out of imagination
I feel it
Do you feel it?
Cause I don't want to get by, get by, get by

[Hook 4]
Cause I was broken
'til I put you back together from imagination
Hear me
Do you hear me?
I don't want to get by, get by, get by this time
It's been lonely here lately
When you're on the other side
