[Verse 1]
I don't need your sense of compromise
Shake you up and put you right back down to size
Yeah, one by one [x2]

[Hook 1]
Watch 'em fall [x3]
Now I'm picking up the pieces

[Verse 2]
I can [?] your picture on the wall
Stare it down to think you know it's all your fault
Yeah, one by one [x2]

[Hook 2]
Watch 'em fall [x3]
Now I'm picking up the pieces to it all
Watch 'em fall [x2]
Now I'm picking up the pieces to it all
To it all

[Verse 3]
I would claim you only for one night
Feed you dust and put you right back down to size

(Get it!)

[Hook 3]
Watch 'em fall [x3]
Now I'm picking up the pieces to it all
