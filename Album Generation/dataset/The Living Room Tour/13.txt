{Intro}

Sometimes you win sometimes you lose
And sometimes the blues just get a hold of you
Just when you though you had made it
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I've got
I just don't want, I don't want to waste it

Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know you can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea

{Bridge}

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And most times you choose between the two
Wonderin', wonderin' if you have made it
(But) I'll have some kids and make my plans
(And) I'll watch the seasons running away
And I'll build me a life in the open, a life in the country

I'm Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know you can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea
Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons, talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet, sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout ......
Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons, talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet, sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout ......
