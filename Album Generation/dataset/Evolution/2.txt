Law of Attraction is the magnetic power of the Universe
That draws to us everything in our lives
And the people around you
That hold the same vibrational frequency
The Law of Attraction responds to the thoughts you have at all times
Everything you experience is attracted to you because
The Law of Attraction is responding to the thoughts you're offering
What you think about is what you bring about
That is how powerful we truly are

Your thoughts create your reality
When you focus on the positive
Anything you wish to manifest will attract more good into your life
The most important secret to success is to feel good
When you feel good you are aligned with unlimited possibilities
Unlimited opportunities
And unlimited love
You can do anything and your desires are infinite
