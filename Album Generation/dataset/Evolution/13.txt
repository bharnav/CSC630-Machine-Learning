Every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice
Equal opportunities equal dignity without discrimination
Regardless of race, sex, religion, sexual preference, or
Social status

When you were born you were born with the same human rights
As everyone else... You have the right to live
You were born free and equal to have freedom and choice of
Your religion..

And the freedom of expression
All men and women are created equal...

Love is Love It lives through it all
Hate is all alone it makes you very small
We are one and one for everyone

So take my hand and open your heart to love
Love is kind so put aside your hate
Love is meek a closed mine will only make you weep

Land of the free...
Home of the brave...
Locked without a key...
An American slave...

The only person you need to...
Prove your love to...
Is the person who feels the same...
About you...

Don't you think love is worth fighting for
Don't you wanna live for something more
We all deserve... the right... to love...
FIGHT FOR LOVE!

Open your mind to something big...
Step out of the world In which you live...
You realize we all have the right to love...
FIGHT FOR LOVE!

Stop the war...
Put division to an end..
Break free for the faith you
Believe in...

The only person you need to prove your love to...
Is the person who feels the same
About you...

Liberty and justice for all...
United as one we stand tall...
Liberty and justice for all...
United as one... United As One!!!

Don't you think love is worth fighting for
Don't you wanna live for something more
We all deserve... the right to love...
FIGHT FOR LOVE!

Open your mind to something big...
Step out of the world In which you live...
You realize we all have the right to love...
FIGHT FOR LOVE!

Those who fight today...
Against torture...
Poverty... And Discrimination...

Are not giants or super heroes..
They're people... kids, mothers
Fathers, teachers...

Free thinking individuals who refused
To be silent Who realize Human Rights are not
History lessons they're not words on a page...

They're not speeches or commercials or PR Campaigns
They are choices we make every single day as
Human beings...

They're our responsibilities we all share...
To respect each other to help each other
To protect Those in need...
UNITY
