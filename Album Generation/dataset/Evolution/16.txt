Stellar heartbeat
I go in deep
When I'm falling in love

Unlock my heart
Let's make a new start
Love will conquer all

Right here in your arms
Right above the stars
This is where I belong
You are my one

Mesmerized by your charms
You leave me disarmed
Come and take me home
You are my love

A darkness creeps in
Won't let me win
I won't give up on you

Distance haunts me
I know you want me
Together we'll make it through

Right here in your arms
Right above the stars
This is where I belong
You are my one

Mesmerized by your charms
You leave me disarmed
Come and take me home
You are my love

No matter what you go through
I will always be, I'll be with you
No matter what you go through
I will always be, I'll be with you

Love conquers all
Love conquers all, yeah

Right here in your arms
Right above the stars
This is where I belong
You are my one

Mesmerized by your charms
You leave me disarmed
Come and take me home
You are my love
