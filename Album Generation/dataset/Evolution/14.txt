I can live a better life
Without you
On my mind
Don't need you
To decide
Without you
I'll be fine

I should've known
Something this perfect
Would've be so
Damn destructive
I can live
A better life
Without you
On my mind

Put me under
Under the knife
Love will be gone
When I open my eyes sedate
Me loveotomy
Now you're gone
Leaving memories behind
Erasing you, from my mind
Sedate me loveotomy
Now Your gone

I can finally
See now
That love really
Isn't blind
I can finally
Breathe again
Once your
Memory has died

I'm over it
I'm over you
I wished you dead
My wish came true
