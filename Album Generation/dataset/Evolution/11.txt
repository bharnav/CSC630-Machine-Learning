Time doesn't fly
It makes memories
You said "close your eyes and please remember me"
I didn't say goodbye
So now your taunting me
I wish you never died
Without you I feel so empty

Deja Vu

You used to say
That I'd miss you when your gone
You were so right
Seeing you hurt felt so wrong
But sometimes
When I'm alone
I get this feeling
And I know
Your spirit has carried on

Ghost from my past
You've come back like a haunting
I get these chills when I sense you all around me
You left this world behind
And I miss you dearly
I can hear the echoes of you
It's just like Deja Vu
You forever changed the stars
I can see so clearly
All these things I say are true
It's just like Deja Vu

I still feel you coming through
My imagination or the truth
