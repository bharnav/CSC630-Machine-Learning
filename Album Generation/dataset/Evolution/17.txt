Compassion is a deep awareness of the suffering of another with a wish to relieve it
A sympathetic consciousness of others' distress with selflessness
To see the sacredness of another person and to see their well-being
Giving to another person with love and kindness itself
We are all one, we are in this together
There is no separation, only love
When you look at someone, see them with new eyes
Right down to the very essence of their soul
Envisioning the sacredness and interconnectedness
Of their true self which is whole and complete
Love is all we are
We are all unique and special
If anyone has wronged us
We must forgive them and send positive loving positive to that person
Life is a joy and filled with all kinds of miracles and blessings
Your love is limitless
The more love you send out
The more love flows back to you in full circle
We are in control of our destiny
Every ending is a new beginning
Life is like a black board you can wipe it clean and start over
Do what you love and open yourself to all good
Find joy in everything you do and you always succeed
You have the power to overcome any challenges that present themselves in front of you
You light up the world with your presence no matter what
