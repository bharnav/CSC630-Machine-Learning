Love is the strongest magnetic force in the Universe
Love is selfless and free from fear
Love pours and constantly flows out without demanding any in return
It does not seek or demand
Love is not jealous, only healing
It heals all life and its creations
The love of self manifests inner strength
Enabling us to move forward
Love is the cohesive power of the Universe
Love conquers all
With an open heart listen to its direction
It will never fail
Love is always there and never depleted
It is infinite
I love that I can create what I desire
I love that I have more than enough
I love that I have friends and family
I love that I believe in myself
I love that I have freewill
I love that I make good choices that support me
I love that I am successful
I love that I have endless opportunities
I love that I have unlimited prosperity
I love that doors are always opening for me
I love that I am powerful
I love that I make a positive contribution
I love that my supply is infinite
