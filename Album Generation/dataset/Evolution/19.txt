You've got your secrets locked inside
You've got them hidden so well
I'm gonna break down all your walls
And find out what you won't tell
I know you think you coined the slogan of
The massive disguise
Let's go right through into the bullshit
I see all of your lies

I draw my guard, you played your card
You dug a hole in my skin
You cut me deep then watch me bleed
While you claim you're innocent
Facing your lies, your filthy lies
The truth is here on your face
You keep in mind that I'm not blind
My memories can't be erased!

Took your love and wasted all of it
On someone, who could care less for you
I gave my word, everything I said
Came directly from my heart it's true

Don't think I won't forget, the things you've done
Don't think you won't regret, for being fun
I drown my love with you, in the sand
Now I know you are the one, who is unforgiven

Unforgiven
Unforgiven

You walk me to the gates of heaven
Now I'm burning in hell
Took something pure and true
Turning into something to sell
Can you live with yourself
You think about what you've done!
This is about the game you play
Not the game that you won

You think your slick, but heres the trick
I'll always know more than you know
You choose your fate, whose masquerade
Is done when you walk out the door
Don't justify your bullshit lies
It's so obvious that you're fake
Who's fooling who? I know the truth
This drama is more than i can take

Took your love and wasted all of it
On someone, who could care less for you
I gave my word, everything I said
Came directly from my heart it's true

Don't think I won't forget, the things you've done
Don't think you won't regret, for being fun
I drown my love with you, in the sand
Now I know you are the one, who's unforgiven

You had your fun, with all that was forbidden
You are the one, who is unforgiven
Go!

Took your love and wasted all of it
On someone, who could care less for you
I gave my word, everything I said
Came directly from my heart it's true

Let go, just let go
You'll be fine on your own
Let go, just let go
You'll be fine on your own

Unforgiven
Unforgiven
