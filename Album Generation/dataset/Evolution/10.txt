Eternal pain; something I will take to my grave
Your memory is an image I just can't erase

I spend my life always walking in the shadows
Scared, alone; locked away inside my castle

And when you love something, they say set it free
If it don't come back, it wasn't meant to be

I destroy everything I touch
Even things I love too much
I am cursed with these hands
They will never understand
I don't want to let you go
Incomplete and all alone

Here I am waiting for my sacred true love
With these hands that will reach out like a scarecrow

When you love something, they set it free
If it don't come back, it wasn't meant to be

I destroy everything I touch
Even things I love too much
I am cursed with these hands
They will never understand
I don't want to let you go
Incomplete and all alone

I destroy everything I touch
Even things I love too much
I am cursed with these hands
They will never understand
I don't want to let you go
Incomplete and all alone

Uh oh uh oh
I'm incomplete and all alone
Uh oh uh oh
I don't want to let you go
