[Verse 1]
You got to ease into line, boy
But once I hit the open road
I'll be sailing off and on my own

[Chorus]
You and me in my GT
With those little red lights in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be

[Verse 2]
Would you please fill it up, boy
I'd like to stop and catch myself a bite
But I sure hate to leave the road tonight

[Chorus]
You and me in my GT
With those little red lights in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be
Woah

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
And when I'm racing the clock
You know that I would die or kill somebody
Just to move this hunk of steel one more block

[Chorus 2]
You and me in my GT
With those little white lines in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be

[Outro]
I think I see a little red light in my rear view mirror
