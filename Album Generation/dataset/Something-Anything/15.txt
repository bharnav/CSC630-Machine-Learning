[Verse 1]
Keep your head and everything will be cool
You didn't have to make me feel like a fool
When I tried to say I feel the way that I do
I want to talk with you
And make it loud and clear
Though you don't care to here but

[Chorus]
Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel?
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And couldm't we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide?

[Verse 2]
Something sure doesn't seem right to me
When you can turn your back whenever you please
And you stroll away and calmly bid me adieu
Why can't I talk with you
And put it in your ear
Though you don't care to hear but

[Chorus]
Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel?
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And couldn't we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide?

[Bridge]
(Hear me out, ooh)
Why don't you lend me an ear
(Hear me out, ooh)
You got no reason to fear
(Hear me out, ooh)
I'll make it perfectly clear I love you

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I don't come whining with my heart on my sleeve
I'm not a coward, if that's what you believe
And I'm not afraid but not ashamed if it's true
I got to talk with you
And then I'll make it clear
Make it clear
Make it clear

[Outro - Chorus]
Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And couldn't we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide
