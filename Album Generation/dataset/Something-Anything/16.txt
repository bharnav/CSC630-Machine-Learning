[Verse 1]
When you say goodbye
To the love that we knew
This you can be sure of
I will torch on for you
I will carry my torch for you

[Verse 2]
When you break somebody's heart
Nothing much left to do
Howsoever sadly
I will torch on for you
I will carry my torch for you

[Bridge]
Somewhere in the back of my heart it's there
And everyday it finds me and reminds me
Somewhere in the back of my heart it's there
And everyday it finds me and reminds me

[Instrumental verse]

[Bridge]
Somewhere in the back of my heart it's there
And everyday it finds me and reminds me
Somewhere in the back of my heart it's there
And everyday it finds me and reminds me

[Verse 3]
I will bear my cross
I will bear your cross too
I will pine forever
I will torch on for you
I will carry my torch for you
