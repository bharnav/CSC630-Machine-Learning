[Verse 1]
Black Maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
You're a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

[Verse 2]
Gay deceiver, my eyes they burned
My insides turned, my brain it rolled
Unbeliever, but now I've learned
I took my turn, I come up cold

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

[Post-Chorus]
If you must kill me
Please let me die, Lord
(Let me die, let me die)

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 1]
(Ooh) Black Maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
You're a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

[Outro]
If you must kill me
Please let me die
