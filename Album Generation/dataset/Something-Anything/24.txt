[Verse 1]
See that girl, watch her dance
If I knew her name I wouldn't have to sit on my hands
If my mouth don't work I get some help
And she don't mind if I don't keep my hands to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're all right)
(You put up such a good clean fight)
(I'm afraid that you lose tonight)

[Chorus]
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me

[Verse 2]
You're so clean, so refined
You don't care to get messy just to have a good time
She's got saggy thighs and baggy eyes
But she loves me in a way I can still recognize

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're all right)
(You put up such a good clean fight)
(I'm afraid that you lose tonight)

[Chorus]
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're all right)
(You put up such a good clean fight)
(I'm afraid that you lose tonight)

[Chorus]
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me

S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me

S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
S - l - u - t
She may be a slut but she looks good to me
