If it's stupid enough, it's cool
One, two, ah-one, two, three

[Verse 1]
We figure, my daddy and me
Things are still the same, it seems
As when he lived it in his teens as a kid in school
Aaron was a junior, the class of '32
His momma called him angel but everybody knew he was the
King king, the gross out king

[Chorus 1]
They called him Piss Aaron
They always caught him pissin' in the hall
Piss Aaron, he never would refuse when nature called

[Verse 2]
Dumb Larry from Homeroom 9
Kept his locker full of weeds
Just to satisfy his smoking needs and his love of fire
Went to a game and lit a stink bomb in the bleachers
The coach, the cheerleader and the chem teacher, and the
The dean dean, duh, dean dean dean was after

[Chorus 2]
Dumb Larry, they always caught him smokin' in the john
Dumb Larry, you never would have missed him when he's gone

[Verse 3]
Chuck Biscuits, conservative jive
The biggest pig in all the school
He would sit and smack his lips and drool as he eyed your lunch
I left a bag in his desk one night
A raw egg sandwich and when Hungry took a bite he had to
Up chuck, uh up up chuck, a-pukin'

[Chorus 3 - Outro]
Chuck Biscuits, they always caught him eatin' in the class
Dumb Larry, they always caught him smokin' in the john
Piss Aaron, they always caught him pissin' in the hall
