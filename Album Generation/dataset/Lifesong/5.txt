[Verse 1]
It hasn't always been this way
I remember brighter days
Before the dark ones came
Stole my mind, wrapped my soul in chains
Now I live among the dead
Fighting voices in my head
Hoping someone hears me crying
In the night and carries me away

[Chorus 1]
Set me free of the chains holding me
Is there anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

[Verse 2]
Morning breaks another day
Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?
The dark ones shriek they scream His name
Is this the One they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
As the God man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
The darkness cannot hide

[Chorus 2][x2]
Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains I hold the key
All power on Heaven and Earth belong to me

[Outro]
You are free[x3]
We are free
Jesus set us free
