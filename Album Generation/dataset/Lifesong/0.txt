[Verse 1]
Empty hands held high
Such small sacrifice
If not joined with my life
I sing in vain tonight

[Chorus 1]
May the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to You

[Chorus 2]
Let my lifesong sing to You[x2]
I want to sign Your name
To the end of this day
Knowing that my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to You

[Verse 2]
Lord, I give my life
A living sacrifice
To reach a world in need
To be Your hands and feet

[Chorus 1]
So may the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to You

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3][x3]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let my lifesong sing to You

[Chorus 2][x2]
