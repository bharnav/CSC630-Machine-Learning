[Chorus 1]
Is there anyone that fails
Is there anyone that falls
Am I the only one in church today
Feeling so small

[Verse 1]
Because when I take a look around
Everybody seems so strong
I know they'll soon discover
That I don't belong
So I tuck it all away, like every thing's okay
If I make them all believe it, maybe I'll believe it too
So, with a painted grin, I play the part again
So, everyone will see me the way that I see them

[Chorus 2]
Are we happy plastic people
Under shiny plastic steeples
With walls around our weakness
And smiles to hide our pain?

[Chorus 3]
But if the invitation's open
To every heart that has been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

[Verse 2]
Is there anyone who's been there?
Are there any hands to raise?
Am I the only one who's traded
In the altar for a stage?
The performance is convincing
And we know every line by heart
Only when no one is watching
Can we really fall apart
But would it set me free
If I dared to let you see
The truth behind the person
That you imagine me to be?
Would your arms be open?
Or would you walk away?
Would the love of Jesus
Be enough to make you stay?

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
