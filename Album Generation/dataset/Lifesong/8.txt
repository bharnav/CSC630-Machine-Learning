[Verse 1]
If you asked me to leap
Out of my boat on the crashing waves
If you ask me to go
Preach to a lost world that Jesus saves

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll go, but I cannot go alone
Because I know I'm nothing on my own
But the power of Christ in me makes me strong
Makes me strong

[Chorus]
Because when I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind You shine Your light on me
Because I'll never get by living on my own ability
How refreshing to know You don't need me
How amazing to find that you want me
So I'll stand on Your Truth, and I'll fight with Your Strength
Until You bring the victory, by the power of Christ in me

[Verse 2]
If you ask me to run
And carry your light into foreign land
If you ask me to fight
Deliver your people from Satan's hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll go, but I cannot go alone
Because I know I'm nothing on my own
But the power of Christ in me makes me strong
Makes me strong

[Chorus]
But if we are the body
Why aren't His arms reaching?
Why aren't His hands healing?
Why aren't His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren't His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
There is a way

[Bridge]
To reach out with Your hands
To learn through Your eyes
To love with the love of a savior
To feel with Your heart
And to think with Your mind
I'd give my last breath for Your glory

[Chorus]
Because when I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind you shine Your light on me
Because I'll never get by living on my own ability
When I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind you shine Your light on me
Because I'll never get by living on my own ability
How refreshing to know You don't need me
How amazing to find that You want me
So I'll stand on Your Truth, and I'll fight with Your Strength
Until You bring the victory, by the power of Christ in me
The power of Christ in me
The power of Christ in me
