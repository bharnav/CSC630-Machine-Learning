[Verse 1]
Living on my own, thinking for myself
Castles in the sand, temporary wealth
Walls are falling down, storms are closing in
Tears have filled my eyes, here I am again

[Chorus 1]
And I've held out as long as I can
Now I'm letting go and holding out my hand

[Chorus 2]
Daddy, here I am again
Will you take me back tonight?
I went and made the world my friend
And it left me high and dry

[Chorus 3]
I drag your name back through the mud
That you first found me in
Not worthy to be called your son
Is this to be my end?

[Chorus 4]
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again

[Verse 2]
Curse this morning sun, drags me in to one more day
Of reaping what I've sown, of living with my shame
Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made
Where one day you're a prince, the next day you're a slave

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]
