[Verse 1]
Oh, little town of Bethlehem
Looks like another silent night
Above your deep and dreamless sleep
A giant star lights up the sky
And while you are lying in the dark
There shines an everlasting light
For the King has left His throne
And is sleeping in a manger tonight, tonight
Oh, Bethlehem, what you have missed
While you were sleeping
For God became a man
And stepped into your world today
Oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping (2x)

[Verse 2]
Oh, little town of Jerusalem
Looks like another silent night
The Father gave His only Son
The way, the truth, the life had come
But there was no room for Him in the world He came to save
Jerusalem, what you have missed
While you were sleeping?
The Savior of the world
Is dying on your cross today
Jerusalem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping[x2]

[Verse 3]
United States of America
Looks like another silent night
As were sung to sleep by philosophies
That save the trees and kill the children
And while were lying in the dark
There's a shout heard cross the eastern sky
For the Bridegroom has returned
And has carried His bride away in the night, in the night
America, what will we miss
While we are sleeping
Will Jesus come again
And leave us slumbering where we lay
America, will we go down in history
As a nation with no room for its King
Will we be sleeping? (2x)

[Outro]
United States of America
Looks like another silent night
