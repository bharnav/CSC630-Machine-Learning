[Verse 1]
I once was lost, but now I'm found[x2]
So far away, but I'm home now
I once was lost, but now I'm found

[Chorus 1]
And now my lifesong sings

[Vesre 2]
I once was blind, but now I see[x2]
I don't know how, but when He touched me
I once was blind, but now I see

[Chorus 1]
And now my lifesong sings[x3]

[Chorus 2]
I once was dead, but now I live[x2]
Now my life to You I give[x3]

[Chorus 3][x4]
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
Let my lifesong sing to You
