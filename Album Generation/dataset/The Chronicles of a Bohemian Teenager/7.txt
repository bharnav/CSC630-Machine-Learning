You say go
Find yourself a new home
You say go
Find yourself a new home

But isn't it infantile
To consider yourself the judge
The judge of someones rights
To a better life today

You say go
Find yourself a new home
You say go
Find yourself a new home

So tomorrow when
You find yourself away
I ask you to stop and think about your prejudice
Because

You forgot about something
You're not even native yet you found your way
You forgot about something
You're not even native yet you found your way
You found your way home
Found your way home

And it's ironic that
The people that cast the stones
Yeah they're always the first to moan
When the stones are thrown at them

You forgot about something
You're not even native yet you found your way
You forgot about something
You're not even native yet you found your way
You found your way home
Found your way home
