I think I've been here before
Only not now at the cellar I am lying on the sunroom floor
And contemplating why
That if I'm so damn tired and so out of pocket do I
Do I turn every conversation and every contemplation I make
Into a self-pity trip?

I said that I
Would ride a wagon right out of this town and right out of this life
To find the confidence and hope that I lost in mid-2005
But did I?
Would there be a second chapter if they didn't leave the death star alive?

I want to be something that's of worth, you see?
And I want to fly like a kite in the sky
You don't need a degree to deconstruct this melody
But this one's not for you

If a song ever was
My justification for the introspective writings I make
I guess this
Is the most that anyone will ever hear about my personal life
Then why is the apology I owe you is as public as the stars in the sky
If I, if I

I want to be something that's of worth, you see?
And I want to fly like a kite in the sky
You don't need a degree to deconstruct this melody
But this one's not for you
