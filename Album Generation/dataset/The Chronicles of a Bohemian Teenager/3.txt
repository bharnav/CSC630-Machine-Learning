I spy with my little eye something that begins with 'I don't care'
That this song, has a melody
Or that the beats are not complex
I'm just trying to make you sing
And not be perplexed
It doesn't mean any less

Face, in the crowd
If you don't care then why are you singing out?
Face, in the crowd
If you don't care then why are you singing out?
Why are you singing out?

And I spy with my little eye something that begins with 'I have just'
I have just begun to realise
Put on my favourite song
Forgot this style instructs you to sing aloud
Why don't you sing along?

It goes
Face, in the crowd
If you don't care then why are you singing out?
Face, in the crowd

If you don't care then why are you singing out?
And I can hear you singing
La la la la la la la la la laaa
You're singing
La la la la la laa

It doesn't matter that this song has a simple tune
Even though it's not what I'm supposed to do
What I'm supposed to do
What I'm supposed to do
What I'm supposed to do

It doesn't matter that this song has a simple tune
Even though it's not what I'm supposed to do
What I'm supposed to do

And can you hear me singing?
La la la la la la la la la laaa
Singing La la la la la la la la la laaa

Now it doesn't matter that this song has a simple tune
Even though it's not what I'm supposed to do
What I'm supposed to do
