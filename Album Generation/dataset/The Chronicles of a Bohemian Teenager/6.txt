And you say it's fair, a labour source for the masses
Providing cheap garments we can sell and brand
As a new and hopeful answer to an existence so bland

Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy
You don't need to buy
You don't need to buy

And you do not have to be a coat hanger for a corporation in a market that's lost the plot
And you decide if it's worth having their blood on your hands just to wear the latest Nike

Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy
You don't need to buy
You don't need to buy

And if I had a cape, that made me disappear
I'd fly around the world for days just so I could hear
The rich count their dimes whilst the Africans' cry
Record it on a tape and stream it high across the sky

Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it
Open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it

And if I had a cape, that made me disappear (open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it)
I'd fly around the world for days just so I could hear (open your eyes, as you don't need to buy it)
The rich count their dimes whilst the Africans' cry (I'd fly around the world for days just so I could hear)
Record it on a tape and stream it high across the sky (I'd fly around the world for days just so I could hear)
