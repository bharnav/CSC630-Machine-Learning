Our TV sets are drenched in pseudo reality
When the truth is endemol can't save you from mundane existence
Twelve unknowns light up 7 million homes
Yet the news at ten is barely watched
As it's the same old war again
Lets talk about romance
Romance is dead
An ideology exploited for commercial gain
They want you to fall in love
With the idea of being in love
Because nothing says I love you better than flowers and chocolates and cards

But its all right now

I can see clearer now
Its all right now
Now your head is up out of the clouds

You can call me a cynic
But at least I'm realistic
I went to Ikea today
It didn't change my life
Yet everyone in my street is going Scandinavian
It's like the upper east side in semi-detached suburban Britain
You have to ask yourself why?
Its like whitewash is brainwash
They're diluting out style
