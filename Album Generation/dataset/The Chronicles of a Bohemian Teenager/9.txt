It's one of those times that I can't seem to find the words or thoughts
These hazy eyes, the perfect partner to my weary mind
And it's not been a matter of days, in fact it's felt like an age since I last sat down or I saw a town that wasn't linked by shows

And fatigue's soon ignored as your feet hit the board
Or as the beat hits the floor, these are the moments we're living for
The ones that constantly try to appease our 9-5s
They're the ones that justify all the things that we forsake

You are not your job and you are not the clothes you wear
You are the words that leave your mouth so speak up, speak up loud
For none of us want to sit in evaluations taking notes for hours
We're all sick and tired of waiting. Let's set sail

And fatigue's soon ignored as your feet hit the board
Or as the beat hits the floor, these are the moments that we're living for
The ones who constantly try, to appease our 9-5s
They're the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake

Why do we look to the tide when we find that our minds are getting stale
Why does it bag me this place on the waves
And are we looking for meaning from demeaning and soul destroying task we do all the time on the shore

And as I picture you on the television
Talking all the seller hook past all the people walking
It's about then that I realize that you're the same as me
So call me Ishmael, we are all striving for
The thing that makes this grind worth surviving
Be that our white whale or the one little moment
Where our dreams still feel alive

And as I picture you on the television
Talking all the seller hook past all the people walking
It's about then that I realise that you're the same as me
So call me Ishmael, we are all striving for
The thing that makes this grind worth surviving
Be that our white whale or the one little moment
Where our dreams still feel alive
