Take a look at the oak trees
In the park standing tall
Like a tower of resilience
Despite the leaves that fall

Stripping them back to their
Fraught frames, all naked
And on display. Like us they
Dress for the season
It will soon be spring again

But you and I were not designed to be evergreens I guess
That it's time to long for April to come

Am I willing to wait here again?
Although I'm hungry and I'm tired
And all the bridges I made on the way
Are quickly turning into fires
And as the embers are growing and no phoenix emerge
I guess another set back is another lesson learnt

Let's strip it back to the bare bones
Though not a matter of choice
There's still something of worth
In just an acoustic and a voice
As the new shoots start growing
At the start of the year
The tree is ready to deliver
Despite inital fears

But you and I were not designed to be evergreens I guess
That it's time to long for April to come

Am I willing to wait here again?
Although I'm hungry and I'm tired
And all the bridges I made on the way
Are quickly turning into fires
And as the embers are growing and no phoenix emerge
I guess another set back is just another lesson learnt
