I was stuck in minor chords
I've been here once before
With environmental echoes
By your baggage on my floor
So get over here
Let's grab ourselves another beer
To drink until tomorrow
To forget that we're still alive

Drinking to forget
Always breeds regret
And disillusioned faces upon
Friends that we've seldom met
I do believe that my
Self-constructed alibi
Is cracking under pressure
Whilst I'm breaking on the inside

Sick of making sure
I'm sick of sitting with my hands trapped, falling on my back and
Telling people I know
More than they needed to know
And this song is more
Than a self-indulgent rant, it's closure for the times that
I've let you down
You know I need you around

Well, I'm still here
Long overdue
But it feels like you're in a life of pastures new

So this one's for the friends
And also for the sound
Of distant laughter, acting as
Reminders. In a town
That made us feel at home
We broke our backs on floors of stone
But I'd rather wake there any day
Than wake up here alone

Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba

So this one's for the friends
And also for the sound
Of distant laughter, acting as
Reminders. In a town
That made us feel at home
We broke our backs on floors of stone
But I'd rather wake there any day
Than wake up here alone

Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
Baa, da ba ba ba
