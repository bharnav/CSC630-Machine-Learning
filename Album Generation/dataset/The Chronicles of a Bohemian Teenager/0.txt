[Verse 1]
Don't let the silence get you down
Though you've been sittin' here for hours
Hoping a voice could soon be found
That speaks much louder that this music

[Chorus]
If you're a little off colour and
Out for the count
Don't let it get you down

[Verse 2]
Don't let the talking keep you up
If they're your friends they share your vision
And as the phone ring breaks the silence they figure out that you don't want to answer

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't let the people make you think
That just because you're young you're useless
You know it's not naive to think that you can change the things around
And that no man is an island

[Chorus]
