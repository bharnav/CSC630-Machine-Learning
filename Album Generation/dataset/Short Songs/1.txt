[Verse]
We kill time with sleep and heal
The heartache of thousands
At the cost of ruining ourselves
Take it for granted
We hone skills of cons and steal
The same hearts and bodies
On our knees we're begging to be by ourselves
But only in our heads
Only in our heads
You're laying down in front of me
Completely unaware I'm fantasizing
About everything I want
And everything you're not
We're screaming at the top of our lungs
But only in our heads
Only in our heads
Only in our heads
