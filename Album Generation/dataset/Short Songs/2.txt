[Verse 1]
And I can't protect this
Anymore
I can't reflect this light
That you shine on me
So I'm giving up, not giving in
I'm selling out, not selling in
Judge for what I've done not who I am

[Chorus]
So take your shot now, so take your swing
Start a fight because you know you will win

[Verse 2]
A perfect storm touches down in your head
You think you've found where the bodies are buried
But you could never dig them up
This is forever

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can't expect me to forget
This is forever. This is forever
You can't expect me to just accept the lies you've said
This is forever. This is forever
I won't be here for you with forgiveness
We can't recover

[Chorus][x2]
