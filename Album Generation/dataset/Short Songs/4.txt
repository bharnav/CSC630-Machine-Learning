[Verse]
The children of the fatherland
The day of glory as arrived
Against us tyranny
The bloody standard is raised
The bloody standard is raised
Do you hear in the countryside
The roar of those ferocious soldiers
They're coming right into our arms to cut the throats
Of our sons and our women
In arms, citizens!
Form your battalions!
Let us march! (Let us march!)
Let this impure blood water our furrows
