It’s been four years of silence
But there’s still so much left to say
This dirty lens remembers
I’ve tried to clean it and hide it away
But it won’t forget you

And if this picture tells the story of my miserable life
Would you burn it for me or hang it up for everyone to see?
A thousand words judge me
