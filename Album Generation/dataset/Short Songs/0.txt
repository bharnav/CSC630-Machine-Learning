[Verse 1]
You're only sick as your secrets
How many times did you disappear?
You're only good as your word
How much longer can I believe?
I've buried bodies myself
A hundred graves, a hundred ghosts
I see myself in you
How much longer
How much longer can I believe?

[Verse 2]
You paint a picture
In my head of where I've been
You write the scripture
I hang on every word you say
As sick as thieves (As sick as thieves)
We huddle in you call the plays
How sick are we? (How sick are we?)
How sick are we now?

[Outro]
How can I believe?
