[Verse 1]
Start with the best intent you've earned it
Promise was made not kept you've burned it

[Chorus]
Sleep around, you sleep around

[Verse 2]
He's driving around his stomach churning
Peering in bedroom windows searching

[Chorus]
Sleep around, you sleep around with me

[Verse 3]
A lie and excuse will make no difference
And the shades don't ever make it down
It's obvious, we're obvious, we walk and talk so loud
In the morning we lock our bodies

[Chorus]
Sleep around, we sleep around in red

[Outro]
We'll safely stash away the guilt again
