First, I bit you and spit you out
When there was a doubt
Now, I'm calling you when I can
What is a man?

I did it my way, I did it my way
I did it my way on the highway, highway
Did it my way, I did it my way
I did it my way on the highway, highway

Be yourself by yourself
Get yourself a little green pasture
Keep yourself to yourself
Save yourself
Sure you will, sure you will, sure

Give, take, crowd control
They get in my way when I'm starting my day and
Teamwork, self-control
Is making me blue so I knew what I had to do

I did it my way, I did it my way
I did it my way on the highway, highway
Did it my way, I did it my way
I did it my way on the highway, highway

Be yourself by yourself
Drive yourself a little bit faster
Keep yourself to yourself
Save yourself
Sure you will, sure you will, sure

(What is a man?)

Sure you will, sure you will
Sure you will, sure you will
Sure you will, sure you will
Sure you will, sure you will

Sure you will, sure you will
Sure you will, sure you will
Sure you will, sure

Be yourself by yourself
Get yourself a little green pasture
Keep yourself to yourself
Save yourself
Sure you will, sure you will

Be yourself by yourself
Drive yourself a little bit faster
Keep yourself to yourself
Save yourself
Sure you will, sure you will, sure
