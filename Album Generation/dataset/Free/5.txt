First think of a name, ok
Try to keep it the same, the same all day
Now go over your lines
Relax, relax, get into character

Now open an eye, nice try
But put a foot on the floor, then one more
'Cause we're going live, in five.. four...
Get into character

I was thinking we can walk on the water and still find reasons to swim inside
But now I'm worried there's a bigger wave just behind this one
I was thinking there's a bigger wave
I was thinking there's a bigger wave just behind this one

I was thinking there's a bigger wave
I was thinking there's a bigger wave
I was thinking there's a bigger wave

I was thinking we can walk on the water and still find reasons to swim inside
But now I'm worried there's a bigger wave just behind this one
I was thinking
I was thinking we can walk on the water and still find reasons to swim inside
Now I'm worried there's a bigger wave just behind this one
Just behind this one
