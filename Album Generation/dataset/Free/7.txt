Things got better when you left, your friends always say that
But I think you better check your leaving member contract
You don't get to say, you don't get to say goodbye
And I don't want to be the one, but I could try

Things got better when you left, I hang my hat upon it
People say I'm somewhere else, what's so sad about it?
Even though it means, even though it means goodbye
And I don't want to be the one

I don't want to be the one here
I don't want to be the one, but I could try

You're not talking and I'm not talking
The dog's not talking and no one's talking at all when you're home
No bark in the street, no bark in the yard, no bark in the house
Next bark is the sound of my own war for peace

Things got better when you left, so tell your friends about it
I've been saying it to myself, that I can't live without it
Even though it means, even though it means goodbye
And I don't want to be the one

I don't want to be the one here
I don't want to be the one, but I could try
I don't want to be the one, but I could try
