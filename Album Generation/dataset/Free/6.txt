Again, again

Four times last night
I was on the visitors side
Anybody felt this?

Deep end, 3am
And if it rains again
I think I'm gonna break it again, again

Again again
Again again

Don't start telling me love is a symphony
Point that phone at the floor
You can fire anyone else in a name of hope
Haven't we been through this, haven't we been through this before?

That's my bedroom door you're kicking
Kicking, kicking, kicking

Four-star sanity tripped on a memory
Trapped under water and cold
We drift, blank refugees, tossed 'round roughly
And scream at the border control

Its easy (I'm gonna break...)
Just start kicking
Kicking, kicking, kicking

(I'm gonna break...)

Kicking

Don't start telling me love is a symphony
Don't start telling me love is a symphony
Don't start telling me love is a symphony
Don't start telling me love is a symphony
