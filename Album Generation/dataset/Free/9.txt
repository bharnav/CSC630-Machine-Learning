(Once) I didn't know you but I saw your trash on the curb
(Once) I'd sit and watch it burn, I couldn't find any words
(Now) I think I've found them, turns out you've got some words of your own
(Now) Let's try to hide them for (once) this story, this story

(Once) You made no questions and I try to hum back the words
(Once) Go see it our way when we promised no one gets hurt
(Now) Let's visualize it again, we'll write it right off the page
(Now) Feels so imaginary, (once) this story, this story

(Once) You look so happy together, and
(Once) You seem so happy together, and
(Now) This story's film is falling
(Now) This story (once) keeps falling down

(Once) You look so happy together, and
(Once) You seem so happy together, and
(Now) This story's over, it's over
(Now) This story (once) keeps falling down

(Once) You look so happy together, and
(Once) You seem so happy together, and
(Now) This story's over, it's over
(Now) This story (once) keeps falling down

(Once) You look so happy together, and
(Once) You seem so happy together, and
(Now) This story's over, it's over
(Now) This story (once) keeps falling down

(Once) You look so happy together, and
(Once) You seem so happy together, and
(Now) This story's over, it's over
(Now) This story (once) keeps falling down
