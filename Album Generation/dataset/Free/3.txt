Well said in my head, dumb in down
(Shoot / don't shoot, shoot / don't shoot)
Well, scream "that was mean, put it down"
(Shoot / don't shoot, shoot / don't shoot
If this is all, you can look for the door
(Don't shoot don't shoot, don't shoot)

But it's all gone now, (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
Now its all gone, now it's all gone

Full steam, this machine, down the track
(Shoot / don't shoot, shoot / don't shoot)
No tread, lose your head, put it back
(Shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot)
And when it stalls we can walk home alone
(Shoot / don't shoot, shoot / don't shoot)

But it's all gone now (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
Now its all gone, now it's all gone

This one, here, is starting to open up inside of you
This one, here, is already talking and talking and talking
And talking and talking and talking and talking

This one, here is already folding up inside of you
Running slowly out of oxygen, this one is falling
Is falling is falling is falling is falling is falling...

Well said, in my head, dumb it down
(Shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot)
Well scream, That was mean, put it down
(Shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot)
If this all, you can look for the door
(Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot)

But it's all gone now (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
It's all gone now (shoot)
Now its all gone, now it's all gone
