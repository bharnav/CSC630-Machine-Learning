Free!

Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
I consider myself free

Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
I consider myself free

Run run run outside
Keep your head covered
Get back in, "Outside?
Are you outta your mind?"
You're free

Watch your mouth
And watch your television
If something don't look right
Dial 1-800-YOURE FREE

Free
You're free
Free
You're free

Run run run outside
Get your hair colored
Hang that thing outside?
Are you outta your mind?
You're free

Watch the sky
And yell at television
If something don't look right
Dial 1-800-YOURE FREE

Free
You're free
Free
You're free
