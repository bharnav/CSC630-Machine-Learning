A pain, a weight your mother knows
The sun betrayed a tarnished glow
A smoke come down, erase our eyes
The sky's too low to recognize

All the while the rainbow serpent winds
As her children faintly lost their minds

Can't be TV, the buried crime
A perfect world, a plan sublime
Watch your neighbor, buy your face
Keeping time, but losing place

All the while the rainbow serpent crawls
While her children dream of wails and walls

In the veins of belief, or the diamonds of our eye, she lingers there

Big deal, debrief, a heart of chrome
Running scared as the lizards roam
The rabbit hole seems far away
But the dream of age is here to stay

All the while the rainbow serpent smiles
Watching all her children's final mile

All the while the rainbow serpent smiles
Watching all her children's final mile
