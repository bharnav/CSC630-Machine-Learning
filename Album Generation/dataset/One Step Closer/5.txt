You walk out to the edge and you stand there
Looking down at the water way below
You know if you wait too long, you'll never find the nerve
And every second that you wait just makes it harder, harder, harder

Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, moving, farther along

Remember the first time you walked by
All I wanted to do was catch your eye
Sometimes if you wait too long you'll never find the one
That'll be right there when times get harder, harder, harder, yeah

Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, moving, farther along

Now you feel like you're living
And you're breaking down those walls
Really feel like you're giving
It's not a lost cause

Sometimes you have to dare yourself
Make it good for someone else
Sometimes you wait too long and never find the words
That can light you up when times get harder, harder, harder, yeah

Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, farther, farther along
Farther, moving, farther along
Farther along
Farther along
