My heart's like a stopped clock
Twice a day it's right on time
My heart's like a stopped clock
Twice a day it's right on time

Let's dance, 'til the music's over

My hands are too empty
Gonna need something to do
My hands are too empty
Let me fill them up with you

Let's dance, 'til the music's over
Let's dance, like there's no tomorrow

If you could walk along this road
I'd walk alone, I'd walk along with you
If you could see inside this heart of glass
You'd see how much I see in you
When all of this is over we'll be
Standing in the dark, just me and you
'Til the music's over

All we have
Is all we have we need to know
Stay with me
Until the pink dawn light begins the show

Let's dance, 'til the music's over
Let's dance, like there's no tomorrow

If you could walk along this road
I'd walk alone, I'd walk along with you
If you could see inside this heart of glass
You'd see how much I see in you
When all of this is over we'll be
Standing in the dark, just me and you
'Til the music's over
