When the sunlight hits the top of the ridge
And the day is winding down
I'll be rolling on back to your arms
I'll be coming round
When the sun goes down

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
I've lived to find that is true
Somehow it don't seem so bad
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

One step closer
Love is coming into view
One step closer to heaven
One step closer to you

We went down to the river's edge
And walked along the sand
We lay down in its shadowy bed
The water rushed past our heads
I thought of something you said

That brought me back to the high mountain lake
In the West where I first met you
All around walls are coming down
But our love still stands true
Our love is still standing

One step closer
Love is coming into view
One step closer to heaven
One step closer to you
