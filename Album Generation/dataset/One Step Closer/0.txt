Give me the love I have
For all my enemies
Give me the love I have
For those I cannot please

Give me the love that knows
All the love there is
Give me the love that knows
All that love can give

That's all I ask of you
That's all I need from you
That's all I ask of you

From the sun that separates
From all the doubt
That have plagued my coming in
And my going out

May there be a bed of mercy
To lay my anger down
To feel the emptiness
Where there is no sound

That's all I ask of you
That's all I need from you
That's all I ask of you
That's all I need from you
