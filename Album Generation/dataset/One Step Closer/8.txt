No matter when it comes
One thing sure, it comes too soon
Fame, death, love, all find us
Never quite prepared, or in tune

You hunger through the years
For the proper combinations to appear
At long, long last it's crystal clear
You really cannot get there from here

Others seem to know when to make their moves

But that may not be true
More likely, they're as hungry as you
For the moment, everything clicks
The fat lady's tiger rolls and does his tricks

45th of November
26:10 on the clock
In the future, we won't remember
What will they make of such talk?

Learn the art of compromise
Pass the days when nothing works out right
We keep the faith of years
Or we blow the whole thing up in one good fight

45th of November
26:10 on the clock
In the future, we won't remember
What will they make of such talk?

Feed me sweet lemon wine
Squeeze the juice from the peel
Playing strip poker with time
And it's your turn to deal

Feed me sweet lemon wine
Squeeze the juice from the peel
Playing strip poker with time
And it's your turn to deal

45th of November
45th of November
45th of November, remember the day
45th of November, remember the day
