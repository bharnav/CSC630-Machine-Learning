Highway glimmer, morning dew
Reflected the rain in your eyes
The trees pass by like Van Gogh's brush
What were you leaving behind?

The frosted shine like broken glass
The canyon comes into view
The road is warm, all cracked and torn
From the others that came before

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive
Close your eyes and drive

Through it all I've had no doubts
Truth couldn't be farther away
But I hit bottom and didn't bounce
And found out I had nothing to say

Are we running toward or running from
Or maybe not running at all
I just know when we least expect it
Something are just destined to fall

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive
Close your eyes and drive

I saw you standing in the crowd
Show box, Saturday night
Seven summers have passed since then
Are the stars still shining as bright?

The moving village of your space-time world
Iron fist is far behind you
Levitation in a whiskey swirl
Never even got to the show

It ain't over, ain't it good to be alive
It ain't over, close your eyes and drive
Close your eyes and drive
