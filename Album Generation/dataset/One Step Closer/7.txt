They say that time will always be on your side, oh don't turn away
Place me into all the fallow fields of gray I'm on my way
Stumbling forward, tumbling dance of strangers, swimming to the stream
Pull the cord, ignite the spark, betray the dark and feed the dream

When you are near, it's all too clear
Life's a dream, then what's to fear
Love betrays, oh will you stay
Darkness falls, I'll be on my way

Tender kiss you'll always miss me when I'm gone, the time is near
Technicolor carpets here to steal your gaze, don't shed a tear
Lovers fight to mend the flight of broken wings, can't run too far
Stare away into the night and check your sight, head for the stars

When you are near, it's all too clear
Life's a dream, then what's to fear
Love betrays, oh will you stay
Darkness falls, I'll be on my way

Sacred towers falling light the sky aflame, through the windowpane
Turn me into to wispy clouds and float away, what can I say
You were there if I could care to see you through, your life today
If I could hear the lullaby you dare sing, I'd be here to stay

When you are near, it's all too clear
Life's a dream, then what's to fear
Love betrays, oh will you stay
Darkness falls, I'll be on my way
