The sound inside your head
Won't let you get to sleep
Your heart don't miss a beat
No peace can you find

The ticking of the clock
The tipping of the tap
The beating of your heart
Goes on and on

The silence in your head
Is louder than a hurricane
The silence in your head
Will never let you go

With the rising of her chest
You feel the shallow breath
Will nothing be the same?

All you give is all you gain

You got a long way to go
Before you get back home
To the place where you belong
So run rabbit run

Chorus

Who can you trust?
What can you give?
If you feel the fall
And it's all closing in
Where can you hide?
When it all comes running down

Chorus
