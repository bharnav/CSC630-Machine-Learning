Wine box man is broken down
Guilt trip cocktail, thorny crown
Rosy glasses they see just right
Softening the choices of crash or flight

Frowning suit man keeping time
Closed an eye to nature's rhyme
Hopes a mint will save his breath
Got an elevator speech for Mr. Death

Swampy waters seem so warm
Simming with the devil to the candy store

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette

Crack boy loads his mojo kit
Flicks the light and takes a hit
Cuz early to rise and early to bed
Makes one healthy, rich, and dead

Ken has got another doll
Broke the last one, broke them all
When they learn to laugh again
Come and pulls the velvet chain

Swampy waters seem so warm
Simming with the devil to the candy store

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette

Like a handle in the hand
A ticket to whatever land
Get yourself a holy cow
Cancel any time but now

Somewhere angels are frowning, but I need a good dream, as good as it gets
Don't touch me, I'm still expanding, just one more bullet for my Russian roulette
