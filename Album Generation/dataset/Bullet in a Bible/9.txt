[King for a Day]
Started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size four

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made only for girls
GI-Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, Princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen
Don't knock it until you tried it

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made only for girls
GI-Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, Princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

[instrumental]

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made only for girls
GI-Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, Princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me!!

And stop
[Shout!]
Now Wait A Minute

I Want You To Know
I Want You To Know Now
You've Been So Good
Even That I'll Admit Myself

You've Been So Good To Me
You've Been So Good to Me
You've Been So Good To Me
