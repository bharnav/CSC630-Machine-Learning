Go where you may
And do what you will
I'll see you again on a summer day
And I know I'll love you still
I can't seem to understand
But you've got my heart in your hands

The dawn's early light has now faded to grey
The ashes from the fire we had last night
Have all blown away
I can't seem to understand
But you've got my heart in your hands

You're the rainstorm, a fire, and a trainwreck
All wrapped up in ribbons and lace
You're a fistful of roadside flowers
Arranged just so in a dime store vase
I can't seem to understand
But you've got my heart in your hands
