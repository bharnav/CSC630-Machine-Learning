My hands they trembled, my knees they shook
And nothing ever was the same
I could not bear to look
The day the end finally came

The lightnin' struck the river
And the water burst up in flames
All the preachers forgot their purpose
The day the end finally came

All the children they were doomed
They were born with no names
They were cursed inside the womb
The day the end finally came

All the birds escaped their cages
And all the dogs broke their chains
And that is how it all went down
The day the end finally came
