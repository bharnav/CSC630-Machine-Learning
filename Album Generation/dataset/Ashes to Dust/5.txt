[Verse 1]
Well, you are a sight for the sorest of eyes
And these have never beheld
Such a beauty and grace in the look on your face
Well the secret you just can't tell

[Verse 2]
So blow out those candles and crawl into bed
Hold me close, and don't let go
The storm clouds are gatherin' all overhead
And the wind is starting to blow

[Chorus]
Well, I never felt better than in your two arms
The moon never shone so bright
All my woes seem to fade away
Darlin' you sure are a sight

[Verse 4]
Tea in the morning and whiskey at night
Is such a hard cycle to break
But your company is just fine by me
Just lovin' for lovin's sake

[Verse 5]
And you shoot me that look with them big doe eyes
Like a slug from a forty-four
It's as easy as that for you to lay me out flat
That's one thing that's always for sure

[Verse 6]
I never felt better than in your two arms
The moon never shone so bright
All my woes seem to fade away
Darlin' you sure are a sight

[Outro]
All my woes seem to fade away
Darlin' you sure are a sight
