I'm diggin' my grave
I'm diggin' my grave
My road to hell is surely paved
With all the love that I never gave
I'm diggin' my grave
Oh lord I'm diggin' my grave

And the hole is made
With a pick and a spade
And all the debts never repaid
Oh how I wish that I could have stayed
But the hole is made
Oh lord the hole is made

And the hole is shallow where I must lay
The hole is shallow
But that's okay
Cause I'll have peace on my final day
Down in this shallow hole where I must lay

Well this July ground is mighty hard
This July ground is mighty hard
My back is broken
My hands are scared
This July ground is mighty hard

Well lord I wish that I hadn't sinned
Oh oh I wish I hadn't sinned
That I could be with you again
Oh oh I wish Oh I wish I hadn't sinned

And the hole is shallow where I must lay
And the hole is shallow but that's okay
Cause I'll have peace on my final day
Down in this shallow hole where I must lay

This Iowa dirt is mighty cold
This Iowa dirt is mighty cold
And god will never rest my soul
Down in this Iowa dirt so cold

I'm diggin' my grave
Well, I'm diggin' my grave
My road to hell is surely paved
With all the love that I never gave
I'm diggin' my grave
Oh lord I'm diggin' my grave
