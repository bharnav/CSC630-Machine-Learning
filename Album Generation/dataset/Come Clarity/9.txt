When all is said and done
We know what's right, what's wrong
But does it matter then
When all is said and done?

When all is dead and gone
We know who who lost who won
But does it matter then
When all is dead and gone?

See everything go
End of all things
The life as we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the lights go out
We'll know what life's about
But does it matter then
When all the lights go out?

When all the laughter dies
We'll see nothingness and realize
But does it matter then when all the laughter dies?

See everything go
End of all things
The life as we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the laughter dies
We'll see nothingness and realize
But does it matter then when all the laughter dies?

See everything go
End of all things
The life as we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you
