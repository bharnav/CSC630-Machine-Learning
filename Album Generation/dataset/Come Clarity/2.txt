[Verse 1]
Shot for shot
Many bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of gold and gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

[Pre-Verse 2]
Take a chance

[Verse 2]
Better come much bigger than this
One dark star
Spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
I'll take the chance
Bring me the calm

[Pre-Chorus]
And it leaves nothing
Expose the dark side
Awakened and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

[Chorus]
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real in me

[Verse 3]
Throw yourself into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me
Sneak out before I awake

Take out the trash and burn it
Try to find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

[Chorus]
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real...
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real in me

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And it leaves nothing
Expose the dark side
Awakened and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

[Chorus]
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real...
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real...
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is real in me
