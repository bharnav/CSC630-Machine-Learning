A vanishing light
The end of a compromise
In fury, In rage
A dream will be managed

Behind enemy lines
Learn to survive
Find ways to clone
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

Slide away
Learn your ways, and fire when ready
This is the race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction

You're on the easy route
Money up front, there's no doubt

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction

Its so, so sad
But pay no mind

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction
