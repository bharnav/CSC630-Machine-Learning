[Verse 1]
Rushing through 30
Getting older every day
By two, drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add... colour...
Inside these lines?!

[Chorus]
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

[Verse 2]
Sure, if we change our perspective
I'm certain, I would change today
I'm certain, it will change our ways
Would things fall into place?

[Chorus]
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

[Bridge]
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
