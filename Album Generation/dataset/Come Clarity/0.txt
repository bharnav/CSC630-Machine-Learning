[Verse 1]
It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And curse my fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

[Pre-Chorus]
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see. Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

[Chorus]
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

[Verse 2]
The rain drops just beg to hit me
What now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see. Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

[Chorus]
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

[Bridge]
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me free and
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me free and

[Pre-Chorus]
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see. Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

[Chorus]
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
