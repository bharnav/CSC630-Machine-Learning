The blackhole, forever mine
I need the fear push me out
Be brave, show me signs
Should I feel shame
For the questions that I have?

If you, could be, the things I need
(I'll crawl through knives an inch per tear)
These knees, they bleed for you
(Let the colour persuade the hate that you fear)

Feed the lie, force the reason
Leave me in doubt, need some motivation

It's in my hands, the sky
So bright it's burning
It's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight
It's in my hands

Nailed to the floor, paralyzed
Emotions drifting, touching the new

If you, could be, the things I need
(I'll crawl through knives an inch per tear)
These knees, they bleed for you
(Let the colour persuade the hate that you fear)

It's in my hands, the sky
So bright it's burning
It's for me to decide
If flames will reach heaven tonight
