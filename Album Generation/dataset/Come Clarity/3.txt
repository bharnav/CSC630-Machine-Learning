[Verse 1: Lisa Miskovsky]
Save all your prayers
I think we're lost today
There's no morning after
No one's around to blame

[Anders Fridén]
I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among the hypocrites
The melody of our time

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]
So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the Earth
Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster

[Verse 2: Anders Fridén]
What decides when you've lost the war?
When the first man falls
Or when they erase it all

[Lisa Miskovsky]
We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed by life's tear

[Anders Fridén]
In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I could care less
Cause I will die too

[Pre-Chorus]
So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the Earth

[Chorus]
Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster

[Pre-Solo]
What will it take for us to realize
The more we provoke, winter will come twice...

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Save all your prayers
I think we're lost today
There's no morning after
No one's around to blame

[Post-Chorus]
Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster
Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster
