We are ordinary people
We all live different lives
In the end we're pretty much the same
We're just living in different lies

We just live in different lies!
We just live in different lies!

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We are ordinary people
In a world built on stress
When we build walls around us
We end up in a mess

We end up in a mess
We end up in a mess

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We just live in different lies!
We just live in different lies!

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

They scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?
