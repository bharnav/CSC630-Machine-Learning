So she walks on her way
To believe her words
And she smiles at me but it's a lie
Cause if the sand don't run through your toes it's no paradise to me
And if you're such a believer then believe everything you breathe

And you don't know and you don't laugh on your way
Do you stumble while you play?
Oh sunshine on my back and I'm with you the day
That you let me go of your fame

Don't let your conscience
Find another way
And don't let believers bleed beneath the day
