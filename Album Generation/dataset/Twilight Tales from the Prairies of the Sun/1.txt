When I was a little kid
My father told me to see the world for him
So I took my things
And painted big sunsets from the vast oceans

Send your dad a note. You made it, kid. You're on the road
Send your dad a note. You made it, kid. You're on the road

Mother, teach me about the country
Can you tell the lies from the lives that you've seen (?)
Now Mother, can you tell me
Where this road is gonna lead

Just let yourself go and sell your soul to the road
Just let yourself go and sell your soul to the road

Don't you know that I was resting under the track(s) (?)
But even then I always knew I'd be back (?)
Cause I know that my steel train
I'll ride it to the end

The skies and desert rain
Have passed my life by the course of steel train
And I'll ride to the end of the rails
I'd tell my father of all my tales

I said everything I saw, I'm singing, "I love you"
And the reason that we're here all because of you

Don't you know that I was resting under the track(s) (?)
But even then I always knew I'd be back (?)
You know that I know that my steel train
I'll ride it till the end
You know that I know that my steel train
I'll ride it till the end
And I know that my steel train...
