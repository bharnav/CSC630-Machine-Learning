And I'd rather watch a sunset
Through cellophane and glass
And as just what we find
So why you gotta rock the boat?
Ain't it time for you to choke?
My love
Only you're up here for me
So keep one eye open
What you see ain't what you got

I sold my hay to a man with a master plan
To run the world that I ran from
Last time I left you
This time I'm leaving true
In a quest to lose it all
And for a stairwell

Even these empty hands
Can hold the way to your promise land
And my soul, mind, and body will render the crime
So why you gotta be so cruel?
Uou used me like a tool
It'll never fix our love
No no

I know that it's time
To give it all up
When it all so corrupt
And im torn from childhood lust
Time sublime when pain's a rhyme
I know you thought them stars were lined for you
But beauty is my love

So keep one eye open
Keep that eye open
Keep them eyes open
Cause what you see ain't what you
It ain't what you got
