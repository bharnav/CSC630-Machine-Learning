So long since I've seen your eyes and I
Am finding out how to get by without you
I walk these streets with a lonely sky
And baby I get by
But it was you all along

Blue had you too
I lied for you
And nothing can be real till you can feel

I walk your street with a lonely sky
And baby I get high about you
Time will pass and I lose my worth
Tonight it hurts
And you can run fast like the wind

I walk these streets with a lonely sky and baby I get by
But it was you everyday
Blue had you too
Lied for you
And nothing can be real when without you I cannot feel
