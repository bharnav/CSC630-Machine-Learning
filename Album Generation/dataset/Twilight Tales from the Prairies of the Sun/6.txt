Well i ran through the river of pride and shame
I didn't even know the game
So frame a portrait of the way
The path that twists around the gypsy waves
Oh it can
Slip right through your hands
When you list your demands
Ohh the price you pay
Walking in the flames

Find, your wave
And sail away today
Your actions claim
Your soul

Can you dance on the edge of your time?
Can i rise to the changes from the cages i've been living inside?

So frame a portrait of the way
The path that twists around the gypsy waves
Oh it can
Slip right through your hands
When you list your demands
Ohh the price you pay
Walking in the flames

Find your wave
And sail away today
My actions claim
And the sky will fall in my name
Did i not write these words
In a time to leave again
Take it to forget you
