I'm big, and small
It hurts to crawl
This velvet aisle again
And their eyes feast
On my deceased
They hold the cherry of my pit

Come please and fel my deceased
I know you walk aside your child
And her eyes closed, soul rose
Earth will patch the cracks within
I dig a hole for all my sins

Big, small
A pain inside you all
Will touch your spine when i give in
And grace falls
13 years to tall
I once walked aside my child
But i left him on a velvet aisle
