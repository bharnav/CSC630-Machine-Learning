Well, you wake the love that sleeps inside
And dreamed that she had never died
Wipe that tear but you don't know why
Boy, you're pretty, but
You're just not for me
Better love I do not see

This girl, she had it kinda sweet
Till fame swept her off her feet
Sees nothing she did before
Let's her colors hit the floor
Scars are in her name
And she scars me in blame
Hey Scarlet, you're not the same

So be careful what you choose
I feel love for me and you
I'm not ashamed
So I'll walk another mile
I help you find out, child
I don't know what to do
I feel lost without you
Better love will come to you

So I flew West to see her part
Two weeks since the music died
I watch the camera shoot this girl
Seems to me a hollow pearl
Mother sat me down
"What's it like oh my boy
To be so destroyed"

So be careful what you choose
I felt love for me and you
I'm not ashamed
So I'll walk another mile
To help you find out, child
I don't know what to do
I feel lost without you
Better love to take you through

So here I sit. Some years have passed
I say I don't but I miss her bad
I smell her in my sheets you see
Like she's sleeping next to me
She'll say
Jack, I'm leaving now
So Don't you wait up for me
Cause better love I'm yet to see..
