From my cradle to your grave
To this home, I am a slave..
And darling, we look beautiful
Scratching in our cage

I write to believe
In the love that I forget
And if you were the sky
Would you let my sun set?

Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
The colors in my lullaby
Will hold you 'til I get home. (I'm coming home)

Like a junkie in his cage
I'm itching to be saved
And for every one I swallow
I'll turn another page

I write to believe
Cause honey, you'll forget
The colors in her eyes
Before her sun sets

Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
The colors in my lullaby
Will hold you 'til I get home

Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
The colors in my lullaby

Catch you on the other side
Catch you on the other side
I feel you in my sleep
I'm coming home..
