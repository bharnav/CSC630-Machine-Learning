I dig a girl who's on her own
Smiles at the lonely folk
Cause she's got nothing figured out

I laugh
Cause I don't wanna cry no more
I laugh because I hit the floor
Wiping stains from the bullets of a bang

And when you're down and out of touch
I'll be waiting at that dock
The storm will clear and your ship will come to town
And when the tides don't go your way
And the sun don't shine for days
Which someday I will make her free
And scarlet you had a real friend in me

Love
Is lying in the strangest place
Is crying cause it has no face
Faces is the pain inside my gut

And I dig
The girl who sang me lullabys
Let me kiss her tired eyes
Tired I have been since she's gone

And when you're down and out of touch
I'll be waiting at that dock
The storm will clear and your ship will come to town
And when the tides don't go your way
And the sun don't shine for days
We're singing our way to FLA
You know I had a real friend in you

And when you're down and out of touch
I'll be waiting at that dock
The storm will clear and your ship will come to town
And when the tides don't go your way
And the sun don't shine for days
Well don't you worry, girl
I've been there. I've been around
If you're lost, I'll be found
Between us
Oh, my scarlet you had a real friend in me
