Wake your eyes cause the world's still turning around the love that we built
Called in sick 'cause I spent the night dreaming loud the time she was ill
And I'm running so far from this guilt

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them
There are colors inside that I can not find the words for
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water
So don't pass me by
Yeah

All my time is in rhyme 'cause I live in a dream where she can be free
I set myself to the side and I'll watch as the lives pass as I sleep
Oh it doesn't mean I can't believe

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them
There are colors inside that I can not find the words for
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water
So don't pass me by

All I see is the girl that bleeds in the dark but no one's around
Takes her time 'cause her beauty's in rhyme with her soul, flys like the dove
And no one can tell who to love

And the weeks they just pass and it's easy to guess why I miss them
There are colors inside that I can not find the words for
And the reason we're here, it has never shined clear like the water
So don't pass me by

(echoing Oh's)

Wake your eyes cause the world's still turning around the love that we built
Called in sick 'cause I spent the night dreaming loud the time she was ill

(Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes
(Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes. Wake your eyes. Wake your eyes
(Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes (Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes (Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes
(Wake your eyes) Wake your eyes. Wake your eyes. Wake your eyes
