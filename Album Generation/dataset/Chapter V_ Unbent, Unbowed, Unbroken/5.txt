Lay down your arms this night
Surrender to the power
Embracing your metal heart
On your final walk through the snow

A hammer made of steel
From the river of blood
With magic, forged in flames
Delusions, a curse of the damned

What do you see?
Imaginary visions or reality
When you're free
Then you'll see that you are bound to rule

Rule, born, rule
We were born to rule
Rule, born, rule
We were born to rule

Born to rule, born to rule
We're born to rule forever more
Born to rule, born to rule
We're born to rule forever

The revolution forced us all to heed the final call
And if tomorrow never comes
Then we will strike the hammer down

Rule, born, rule
We were born to rule
Rule, born, rule
We were born to rule

Born to rule, born to rule
We're born to rule forever more
Born to rule, born to rule
We're born to rule forever
Forever, forever rule!
