You see me but I'm not there
Like the calm before the storm
You hear me, I'm everywhere
In the wind and in the rain

Feel me in every breeze
I'm the chill inside your spine
I'm burning you, start to freeze
As you slowly turn around

And down in your hole
Solitary darkness rule
You are forlorn
'Cause justice will be mine

Prowling the night
Justice calling, we'll track you down
Justice calling, ready to strike
Justice calling, breaking the chains
Hammer of justice seeking his revenge

Dead man walking by
There's a void inside his eyes
Judgement, a final sigh
Hear the screams electrified

As the mirror turns blank
And your essence fades away
Your chapter's closed
Sealed with thunderbolts

Prowling the night
Justice calling, we'll track you down
Justice calling, ready to strike
Justice calling, breaking the chains
Strike with the hammer of justice
Justice calling, we'll track you down
Justice calling, ready to strike
Justice calling, breaking the chains
Hammer of justice seeking his revenge
