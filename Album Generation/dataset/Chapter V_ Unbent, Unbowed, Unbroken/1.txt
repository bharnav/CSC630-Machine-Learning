Countdown, descending down to zero
Bursting into flames
Can't you see the coming of a hero?
On this enchanting day

So stand up and be counted
In the solar glance in the desert sand
No longer the hunted
United we are till the day we fall

A chain unbreakable
Every link is allied to our mighty vow

We're blood bound
We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us
High over ground
We're blood bound
Collecting the stars
We hold a power that is greater than all
We're blood bound

Watch out, the heathen's all around us
Always watch your back
We've got a lust for freedom
Whatever they say, we know we'll stay

We are indestructible
And no matter what happens
We will rise above

We're blood bound
We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us
High over ground
We're blood bound
Collecting the stars
We hold a power that is greater than all
We're blood bound

Look into my eyes
Tell me what is hidden deep inside
Chains about to break
It's the everlasting freedom for us all

We're blood bound
We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us
High over ground
We're blood bound
Collecting the stars
We hold a power together

We're blood bound
We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us
High over ground
We're blood bound
Collecting the stars
We hold a power together

Blood bound
Power forever
Blood bound
Power, we're blood bound
