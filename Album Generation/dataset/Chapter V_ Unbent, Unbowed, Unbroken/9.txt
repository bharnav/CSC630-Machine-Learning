The prophecy, the prophecy
Hell fucking yeah
The prophecy

Words unspoken, sworn in secrecy
A burning flame
For the ones who believe
The prophecy

Revelations from the sun
As of the moon
In seven nights we became history
The prophecy

On a cold dark night
We set our sails to search
For land so far away
Searching for the truth
There's a howl in the wind
On this mystic trail of water we sail on
The source of youth

And the storm breaks loose
On the seven seas
Tag on the signs
On the mounting sun

Northern light in shining on for us
Breaking the ice, in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

From the mountain side
Came a twisted wind
It brought us new insights
Whispering these words
Come in the midst, you'll see
Said a voice
I thought it was the prophecy
The secrecy unheard

And on the violent sea
There's tranquility
We saw the signs on the mountain side

Northern light in shining on for us
Breaking the ice, in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

A secret passage, never to be found
In front of us, a delusion of sights
The prophecy
From the mountains and
The rivers down below
A silent breeze
There's a wail in the wind
The prophecy

Come from a land so far away
We bow down to the words you pray
Storming down the mountain side
No place to go, no place to hide

Here we stand
Under the cover of moonlight
The prophecy was bound to fail
Here we are, nowhere to be found
We're trapped in another world
The journey's just begun

Northern light in shining on for us
Breaking the ice, in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows
Northern light in shining on for us
Breaking the ice, in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

Hell fucking yeah
The prophecy
