Sitting in my room, staring at the wall
I can't believe it's happening
Once so wonderful
Now, life's a twisted kind of reality
A fantasy
Don't know where to begin

Saw your love for me
Vanish in a single moment of stupidity
Nightmare this may be
But it is not a dream
I want to scream
A broken heart still bleeds

Never, ever talk, never, ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same
Never, ever touch, never, ever feel
I will never hear you call my name
Again

In my dreams I see
See you come to me
A memory of times of old
Waking up, I realise
Hell's as cool as ice
And the touch of sin did get me in
Nothing burns like the cold

Never, ever talk, never, ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same
Never, ever touch, never, ever feel
I will never hear you call my name
Again

As we sin, so do we suffer
I've fallen from grace, want to turn back
Time and make it undone

Never, ever talk, never, ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same
Never, ever touch, never, ever feel
I will never hear you call my name
Never, ever talk, never, ever smile
All I see, a future full of fear
Never, ever touch, never, ever feel
I can never whisper in your ear

I'm sorry
