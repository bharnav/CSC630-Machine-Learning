[Verse 1]
You've got to give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love
No, laugh a little, cry a little
Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Chorus 1]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little
Yes, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Chorus 2]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
But when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little
Yes, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Outro]
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
