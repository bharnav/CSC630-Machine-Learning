[Verse 1]
My very good friend, the milkman says
That I've been losing too much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me
My very good friend, the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
We both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me

[Chorus]
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

[Verse 2]
All my very good friends, the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And my very good friends, the neighbors say
They've been watching little things I do
They perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me
