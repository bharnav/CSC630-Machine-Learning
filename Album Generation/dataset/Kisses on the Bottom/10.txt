[Verse]
Blackbird, Blackbird, singing blues all day
Right outside my door
Blackbird, Blackbird, I gotta be on my way
To where the sun shines once more
I pack up all my cares and woes
Here I go, singing low
Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar is sweet, and so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

[Outro]
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
So, make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird
Oh Blackbird
Blackbird, bye, bye
