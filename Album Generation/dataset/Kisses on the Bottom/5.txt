[Verse 1]
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow and me

[Chorus]
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo but where is the one I love

[Verse 2]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me
We'll be here waiting
My echo, my shadow and me
