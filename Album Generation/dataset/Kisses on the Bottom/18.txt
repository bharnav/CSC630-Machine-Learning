[Verse 1]
I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm going to write words oh so sweet
They're going to knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got them

[Chorus]
I'm going to smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
I'll close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

[Chorus]
I'm going to smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe Oh I'm gonna make believe
I'm going to make believe it came from you
