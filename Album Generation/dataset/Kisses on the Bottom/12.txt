[Verse 1]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
Could it be you stop and see
How beautiful they are

[Chorus]
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
(Eight and eight are sixteen)
(Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two)

[Verse 2]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
How beautiful they are
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

[Chorus]
