[Verse 1]
Velvet, I can wish you
For the collar of your coat
And fortune smiling all along your way
But more I cannot wish you
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day
Mansions, I can wish you
Seven footmen all in red
And calling cards upon a silver tray
But more I cannot wish you
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Chorus]
Standing there
Gazing at you
Full of the bloom of youth
Standing there
Gazing at you
With the sheepish eye
And the look of the truth

[Verse 2]
Music, I can wish you
Merry music while you're young
And wisdom, when your hair has turned to gray
But more I cannot wish you
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Outro]
With the sheepish eye
And the look of the truth
And the strong arms
To carry you away
