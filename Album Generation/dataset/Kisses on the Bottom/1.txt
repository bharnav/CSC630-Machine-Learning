[Verse 1]
Evening marks the close of day
Skies of blue begin to grey
Crimson hues are fading in the west
Evening ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be
Memories of those I love the best

[Chorus]
When shadows fall
And trees whisper, Day is ending
My thoughts are ever wending home
When crickets call
My heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home

[Verse 2]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one
Night covers all
And though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home
Take me home

[Outro]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one
Night covers all
And though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home
