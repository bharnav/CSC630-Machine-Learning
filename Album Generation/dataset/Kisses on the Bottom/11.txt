[Verse 1]
At last I've wake up to see what you've done
So what can I do but pack up and run
I know the rules, go get yourself another fool
You said that you loved me, I'm yours to command
But your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand
You used me for a tool, go get yourself another fool

[Chorus]
And now, now that we're through
You say, you meant to be true
Oh, but deep in your heart
You know that our love could never grow

[Verse 2]
I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Now I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Well I know the rules, go get yourself another fool
Yeah you better get yourself, get yourself
Another fool
