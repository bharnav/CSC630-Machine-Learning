[Chorus:]
'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you?
Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you that no man is too tall
You can grow, but remember: empires always fall

[Verse 1:]
We're not your subjects
You're not our king
Nature is the only dictator that I respect and obey
You don't invent
You don't create
Now's our chance to eradicate

[Chorus:]
'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you?
Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you that no man is too tall
You can grow, but remember: empires always fall

[Verse 2:]
We're not your subjects
You're not our king
Nature is the only dictator that I respect and obey
You don't invent
You don't create
Now's our chance to eradicate

[Bridge:]
We will torture, we will slaughter in your name
We will occupy and we will invade
We will silence and suppress without blame
We will rape, steal, destroy all you made

[Chorus:]
'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you?
Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you that no man is too tall
You can grow, but remember: empires always fall

[Outro:]
Concrete eye contact, dig your nails into your palms
'Ello, Tyrannosaurus
