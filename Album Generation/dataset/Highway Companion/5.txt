Save a dream for me
Words hang in the air
Her demons take the dare
Above the lonely feather circles to the ground
The house don't make a sound

Turn this car around
Turn this car around
I'm going back

Green and gray and auburn
Gliding down the sky
The devil winks an eye
A figure in the doorway
Shouldering the blame
This ain't without a name

(Chorus)

The king and queen are loaded
Falling off to sleep
The ground begins to creep
Rockets in the tail lights
Red burns into night
Rolling out of sight

(Chorus x2)
