Headed back down south
Gonna see my daddy's mistress
Gonna buy back her forgiveness
Pay off every witness
One more time down south
Sell the family headstones
Drag a bag of dry bones
Make good on my back loans

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more

Sleep late down south
Look up my former mentors
Live off Yankee winters
Be a landlord and a renter
Create myself down south
Impress all the women
Pretend I'm Samuel Clemens
Wear seersucker and white linens

(Chorus)

Spanish moss down south
Spirits cross the dead fields
Mosquitoes hit the windshield
All document remain sealed

(Chorus)

I'll give you all I have
And a little more
