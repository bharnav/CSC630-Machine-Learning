There's some friends that I know
Living in this town
And I've come far to see them
I'm gonna track 'em down
They live in a brick house
Painted white and brown

Left a tip for the maid
And I packed up my guitar
Drop my key on the counter
Rented a car
Gonna hook up with 'em later
And go hit the bar

I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
I need a big weekend
If you don't run you rust

Well I may shake your hand
But I won't know your name
The joke in your language
Don't come out the same
There's times when I'm down and
There's nothing to blame

(Chorus)

I can work
I can travel
Sleep anywhere
Cross every border with nothing to declare
You can look back babe
But it's best not to stare

(Chorus)
