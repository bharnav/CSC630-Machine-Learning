A coyote ran across the road
On the move without a home
A flash of light reminded me of you
This could well be your last stand
Hold the sunlight in your hand
Spread your fingers, feel the sand fall through
I've done all I can do, now it's up to you

You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, but maybe
Time baby, is catching up with you

Shadow-men talk a real good game
Every punchline has your name
You cried out and no one came to you
I've done all i can do. Now it's up to you

(Chorus)

Should be more to learn from this
Can't say i know what it is
No difference tween a hit or miss
It's true
I've done all i can do. Now it's up to you

(Chorus x2)
