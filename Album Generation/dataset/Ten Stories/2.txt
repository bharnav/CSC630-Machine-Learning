[Verse]
We met by chance on the Roe River side
Our song-fires danced as our tea leaves dried
She hatched our plans in the atmospheric tides
Said, "Let's give up sacrifice next Lent
Well, that joke's long since been spent"
So as the fool on the bagpipes played
We kept cool in the parasol shade
Your thumb on my page at my tender age
East enders wives
And hidden in the fox thorn blind
We grew old as the foxtail pine
Sheep in the cold shielding our gold
Sipping on milk and water like

She packed our bags some arbitrary time
("By the time he wakes up, I'll be gone.")
Then waved like a flag from the White Star Line
("Queensland our next stop, he'll be gone.")
Unmoored, unwell, though I seldom elegize
("You still see who I once was.")
We both been untrue but I'm still counting on you
Like an invisible rosary
And as the past and all plans are undone
Slowly sank like a shipwrecked sun
Bridges and ropes, burning them both
Burned up the sky
Choir sang as the black birds fell
Sorrow rang like the church-yard bells
An axe to the trees, smoke for the bees
And all our dads died
