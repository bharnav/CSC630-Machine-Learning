Stitch up the nets but the patch won't stay
As the nail beds rest in the calico hay
The Fiji Mermaid dressed in macrame wading

Road in the fork and a bend In the spoon
Turn cut short as a shadow at noon
Melting like wax as that once full moon's, waning
Ersatz acts an insufferable bore
'Sharp Shots' dull as a harlequin's sword
When doing as you please doesn't please you anymore

Ahh, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ahh, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

Stick of the match at the paraffin show
Drop a nickel to watch the asparagus grow
'The stone in what shell?'
You sure like to know now don't you?

A loom in the heir as the medicine came
To the nest of the mare of the mystery claims
But you'll miss having someone to blame
For your sadness, now won't you?

Well maybe there'll be a bakery hiring
We'll knead a little bit of dough to get by
(Groan!)

Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?
Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?
Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?
Did you come knocking on my door?

Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?
Whose ship came washed up on whose shore?
And from what ocean floor?
Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?
Whose ship came washed up on whose shore?
And from what ocean floor?

There wasn't much to her dress
And I felt stuck in my body like a horse in quicksand
Didn't you come knocking on my door?
(Did you come knocking on my door
Or did I come to yours?)
