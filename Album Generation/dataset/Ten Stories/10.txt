All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin

All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin

[Aaron Weiss & Hayley Williams]
All circles begin with an end
They come back â€˜round
They come back 'round again

All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin

All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
But only in their leaving can they ever come back round
All circles presuppose they'll end where they begin
