I liked her face and oh those eyes
She left today oh goodbye
And looking at you I'm drained outright
And isolated in the light

And I resigned everyone
Ever since I was young
I'm starting to understand
What's going on and how it's planned

I like love but I don't know
All these girls they come and go
Always nothing left to say
