Well, I can see you're advertising
'Cause you keep givin' me the eye
It won't take long to tell you in my song
I wanna be with you tonight
I've been battling [Incomprehensible]
And he's the best contract I've known
And I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
If you keep a-comin' on
I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
Since you have set the stage
Take the key and unlock the door
Let the tiger out of his cage
Just one more big rehearsal
Another night with you alone
And I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
If you keep a-comin' on
Well, the introduction's over
We've got our hearts in two
Let me know before we start the show
Am I fallin' in love too soon?
I got a heart nearly big as Texas
'Bout the size of the Astrodome
And I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
If you keep a-comin' on
I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
Since you have set the stage
Take the key and unlock the door
Let the tiger out of his cage
I don't want no double feature
'Cause my heart just ain't that's strong
But I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
If you keep a-comin' on
Yeah, I'm a-gonna be a hard act to follow
If you keep a-comin' on
