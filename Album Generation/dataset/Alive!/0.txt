[Verse 1]
Get up
And get your grandma out of here
Pick up
Old Jim is working hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce

[Verse 2]
Honey
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby
Stop crying all your tears
Baby
Do the things he says to do
(Do it!)

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard

[Outro]
Yeah!
