[Intro]
Whoo-hoo, yeah
Whoo-hoo, yeah

[Verse 1]
She'll adore you, and she'll floor you
With her wisdom and her vision
And you'll love it and think of it
'Til you lose all intuition
Come on

[Verse 2]
She can move you and improve you
With her love and her devotion
And she'll thrill you, and she'll chill you
But you're headed for commotion

[Verse 3]
And you'll need her, so you'll feed her
With your endless dedication
And the quicker you get sicker
She'll remove your medication

[Chorus]
Get the firehouse
'Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse
And the flames keep getting higher

[Bridge]
She's like bad weather, but it seems so good
You'd never leave her, but you know you should

She's like bad weather, but it seems so good
You'd never leave her, but you know you should

[Chorus]
Ooh
Get the firehouse
'Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse
Whoo-hoo, yeah
Get the firehouse
Whoo-hoo, yeah
