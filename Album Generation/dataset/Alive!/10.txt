[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style

[Chorus 2]
Well, how could you have waited so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years

[Chorus 2]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years

[Bridge]
And baby, won't you let me
I think I'm going out of my head
I'm just about to, ooh yeah, ha

[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while, would you, babe
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
