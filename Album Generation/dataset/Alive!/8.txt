[Verse 1]
She walks by moonlight
No one really knows
Enchanted starlight
Never going home

[Chorus]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good

[Verse 2]
Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

[Chorus]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good

[Verse 2]
Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

[Chorus]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good
