[Verse 1]
Before I had a baby
I didn't care anyway
I thought about the back door
I didn't know what to say
But once I got a baby
I, I tried every way
She didn't wanna do it
But she did anyway, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby please don't refuse
You know you got nothing to lose

[Chorus]
(You got nothing to lose)
You got, got nothing to lose (Well, nothing)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah, baby)
You got, got nothing to lose (Whoo, you got nothing)
You got, got nothing to lose (You g-g-g-g-got nothing)
You got, got nothing to lose (Well, come on mama)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah, shake your)
You got, got
You got, you got, you got nothing to lose

[Verse 2]
So now I've got a baby
And we've tried every way
You know she wants to do it
And she does anyway, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby please don't refuse
You know you got nothing to lose

[Chorus]
(You got nothing to lose)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah, baby)
You got, got nothing to lose (Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah)
You got, got nothing to lose (Ah, you feel so good)
You got, got nothing to lose (Well, come on, mama)
You got, got nothing to lose (Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch yeah)
You got, got nothing to lose (Well, come on)
You got, got
You got, you got, you got nothing to lose

[Chorus]
You got, got nothing to lose
You got, got nothing to lose (Ooh, baby)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah)
You got, got nothing to lose (Oh yeah)
You got, got nothing to lose (Oh, you g-g-got, baby)
You got, got nothing to lose (Whoo, shake it, honey)
You got, got nothing to lose (Oh, you know you're a sweet thing, ha ha)
You got, got nothing to lose (Alright, mama)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah, you really can move it)
You got, got nothing to lose (Oh, you g-g-got nothing)
You got, got nothing to lose (Yeah, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
You got, got nothing to lose
You got, got nothing to lose
