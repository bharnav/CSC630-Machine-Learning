[Verse 1]
Ooh, livin' as you do and I'm watching you, oh, oh
And you don't really know just what to do, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
You don't really know
You don't really know
What to do

[Verse 2]
Ooh, and I'm standing here not quite aware
And I'm trying, baby, trying not to stare

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watching you

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watching us
