With love I tried to warm that heart
Looking back we were lost from the start
All locked up in your own mind
It's no surprise your tongue was tied
We did bad things when we were young
You'd smile and torture me just for fun
When the sun went down, I replayed the part
I knew every scene went by so fast

When I have the strength enough to fight
When the fire that burns goes out inside
A cry for desire to change your mind
What's left to play is your hardest role

Give it up, give it up for me
You make your move, get out the rain
Give it up, it doesn't have to be
So hard

Twenty-four floors above the ground
We shared the cities silver sounds
A glass of goose, a magnetic stare
Behind those eyes, there was nothing there
Strange little girl, what did you do?
I could always see straight through you
It's so pretty on the other side
Your reflection will fool us all in time

When I have the strength enough to fight
When the fire that burns goes out inside
A cry for desire to change your mind
What's left to play is your hardest role

Give it up, give it up for me
You make your move, get out the rain
Give it up, it doesn't have to be
So hard

And I know it won't be long
'Til I give up
And the roles reverse
And I give you another chance
And I'd love to try again
Try again to warm that heart

Give it up, give it up for me
You make your move, get out the rain
Give it up, it doesn't have to be
So hard
