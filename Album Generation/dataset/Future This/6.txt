Jump music, you play it
The silence has faded
Jump music, you play it
Stick together and we'll make it

Out on the streets with all the people you meet
Fighting for your corner, use anthems as our armor

Jump music, drip taste it
No riffs are wasted
Jump music, my lover
Inhale sweet vapors

Out on the streets with all the people you meet
Fighting for your corner, use anthems as our armor

I move in slow emotion, move in slow emotion
So fast, we move in slow emotion
Slow emotion, move in slow emotion
Silence is torture

Jump music, hold me in your arms
Forbidden love and secret charms
Jump music, a memory
Of love, a brief history

Out on the streets with all the people you meet
Fighting for your corner, use anthems as our armor

I move in slow emotion, move in slow emotion
So fast, you move in slow emotion
Slow emotion, move in slow emotion
Silence is torture

We, we won't die wondering
'Cause we, we dance to our own beat

I move in slow emotion, move in slow emotion
So fast, you move in slow emotion
Slow emotion, move in slow emotion
Silence is torture

Love me for who I am
A pleasure for the damned
