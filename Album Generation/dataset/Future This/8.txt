[Intro]
Believe in love
Call it off
The time will come
To give all we lost

[Verse 1]
Future this, extend your range
Stand up and then change your name
Choose your fix when attraction's gone
Make your mark when water's run
Hidden ants in a vocal sun
Girls in soft explosion
Head out in the gold crush
Feel the warmth and you'll know it's us

[Pre-Chorus]
Time will come
To give all we lost

[Chorus]
I see now what you’ve always known
All hearts break when the light is faded
Love runs faster than time
I see now what you’ve always known
All you wanted was what I needed
Love runs faster than time

[Verse 2]
Voices play out the Queen
22 eyes stare back at me
Luminate an astroplane
Send us back from where we came
Buttons float in front of me
Like purple leaves on golden trees
Bend this and look the through the frame
In a crooked hook in a concrete wave

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe in love
Call it off
Time will come
To give all we lost

[Chorus]
I see now what you’ve always known
All hearts break when the light is faded
Love runs faster than time
I see now what you’ve always known
All you wanted was what I needed
Love runs faster than time
