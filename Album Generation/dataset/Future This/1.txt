[Verse 1]
Flying high at speed of sound
On the night bus, heading out
I'll call you now
We'll meet on the streets, and we'll run around
Leave everyone behind
The name-droppers and the unkinds
And we'll meet our friends
Blue plastic bags, full of cans

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand
But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, I don't wanna hit the ground

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no

[Verse 2]
Feel my guilt when the light pulls in fast
Hopes for the days are gone, and the hour's passed
Not a fighting chance
Comic ideas of the future
How to jump home now, with a single bounce
And we'll laugh out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand
But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, I don't wanna hit the ground

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no

[Bridge]
I don't ever wanna stop
You could not have made it up
Who will catch me when I drop?
And stop me falling
Is this ever gonna stop?
Can you catch me when I drop?
I know there'll never be no Superman

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand
But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, I don't wanna hit the ground

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh, Superman
Oh, Superman, oh no
