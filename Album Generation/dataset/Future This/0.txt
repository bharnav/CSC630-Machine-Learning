A time to laugh, a time to cry
And beat the darkness into light
We'll write our names across the town
Up is up and so is down

Forgive your lovers, but don't forget their names
And let their spirit remain
Stay gold (gold)
You shine the light for us to follow (gold)

The stains on our fingers just won't go
Chrome letters, outlines, arrows flow
The words drip off, we watch them fall
Disorder of our mind is now written on the wall

Forgive your lovers, but don't forget their names
And let their spirit remain
Stay gold (gold)
You shine the light for us to follow (gold)

How vast the darkness
We disappear into the light
Follow the dots we made
In the end, we're all made of gold
And now I know, I will not be saved
Unless I follow
And now I know, I will not be saved
Unless I follow

Stay gold (gold)
You shine the light for us to follow (gold)

If you lead, I will follow
