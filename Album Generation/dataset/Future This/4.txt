Convey your thoughts, translate them well
Say those words on baited breath
(I'd asked to go, I'd asked to go)
Obey the form, choose it well
Cross the line to a personal hell
(I'd asked to go, I'd asked to go)

To a man like me, to a man like me
Words are far too kind
To a man like me, to a man like me
There's something missing

I will stop at nothing
I will be loved or die trying
I've been waking up just to sleep again, to sleep again

Cry those tears and hide them well
Say those words on a sharpened breath
(I'd asked to go, I'd asked to go)
All my friends don't care at all
After all these years they're dead and gone
(I'd asked to go, I'd asked to go)

To men like us, to men like us
Words are far too kind
To men like us, to men like us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

I will stop at nothing
I will be loved or die trying
I've been waking up just to sleep again, to sleep again
