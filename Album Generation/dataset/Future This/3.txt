Every day, just like living in fiction
Swimming in this endless ocean
Keeps us floating here, in this crystal vision
Faces of joy are captured on Polaroid
Faded proofs in the morning

Tell it like isn't, all across the golden globe
Give it space to grow and get so hard it glows

Still in bed sleeping in, and I'm pushing on with
The current of your body, still find it shocking
Living life how I want to
Candy coated everything, breathe heavy as it's dripping in
It's a waterfall, it is pure as fall
It won't wash away
The palace we made to rule in
So high we burn and die

Tell it like isn't, all across the golden globe
Give it space to grow and get so hard it glows

(More than you know)
This palace we made to rule in
So high we burn and die

Tell it like isn't, all across the golden globe
Give it space to grow and get so hard it glows
