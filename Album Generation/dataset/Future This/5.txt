Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Didn't notice you had vanished, I was busy rubbernecking

Breakdown, looking back, breaking up again
A cycle I better get used to
The circle in a heart is broken
Words so clear when softly spoken
And I'll say her name, but every time
By accident
Ghost visions and sympathy
I'm still busy rubbernecking

Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Didn't notice you had vanished, I was busy rubbernecking

Smart eyes and hair like her feet
Bright colors in a wild history
Jealousy it creeps through my veins
Tell myself inside out and back again
Fake a smile 'cause it's gonna
Take a while
Grin and bear every second
I'm still busy rubbernecking

Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Didn't notice you had vanished, I was busy rubbernecking
Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Oh whirlwind - heat and flash, I was busy rubbernecking

If you don't belong, then please don't be long
If you slip away, then I'll look forward to seeing you after youâ€™re dead

Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Didn't notice you had vanished, I was busy rubbernecking
Maybe my house was burning, maybe my pulse is dead
Oh whirlwind - heat and flash, I was busy rubbernecking
