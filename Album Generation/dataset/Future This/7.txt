I owe it to me, now yesterday's gone
Doing it on my own
I know I'm unique, wear my scars with pride
Doing it all alone
I wanna be great, I wanna be adored
Doing it on my own
Chameleons change, our true colors are too strong
Doing it all alone

The tall world is falling down, now there's nothing lost
I know what I've got, my lights aren't crossed
Naked before I
Lose your mind, doing it for the love
Lose your mind, doing it on my own
The future's mine, doing it all alone
Lose your mind, doing it for the love

I had a taste, now what I want is more
Doing it on my own
I wanna leave an impression when I'm gone
Doing it all alone

In the back rooms, in the basements
The love or hate is wasted
Over water, the four quarters
Naked before I
Lose your mind, doing it for the love
Lose your mind, doing it on my own
The future's mine, doing it all alone
Lose your mind, doing it for the love

I owe it to me, now yesterday's gone
Doing it on my own
I know I'm unique, I'll wear these scars with pride
Doing it all alone
Doing it on my own
Doing it all alone
Doing it on my own
Doing it on my own
