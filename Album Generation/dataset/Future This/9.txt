I know you will
Find a place to run
I know you will
Become a distant one
When you disappear
Please leave your shadow here
To fill this empty room
For one last dance when you feel I'm ready

77 ways to say no

You are my hero
My brother and my good friend
Now I've been bleeding
For three and a half years
You left such an impression on me
Left on the debris
Now I'm all fucked up
And sometimes I forget I miss you

I wish I had, I wish I had
