[Verse 1]
Look at you sittin' on that tailgate
All barefoot, beautiful & brown-eyed
Just watchin' you breathin's blowin' me away
All I can think about tonight

[Chorus]
Somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot
I know what I've got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here, right now in this Tennessee dirt
No long white dress, no little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old t-shirt
Somebody find me a preacher

[Verse 2]
Baby I can't wait another minute
With you on my lap and your back against the wheel
I ain't got no diamond here to give ya
But if this is how lovin' you feels

[Chorus]
Somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot
I know what I've got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here, right now in this Tennessee dirt
No long white dress, no little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old t-shirt
Somebody find me a preacher

[Bridge]
'Cause I want to spend
The rest of my life
Makin' you feel
The way I feel tonight

[Chorus]
Somebody find, somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot
I know what I've got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here, right now in this Tennessee Dirt
No long white dress, no little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old t-shirt
Somebody find me a preacher

[Outro]
Find me a preacher tonight
Find me a preacher
