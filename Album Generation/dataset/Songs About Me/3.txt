[Verse 1]
Momma put a Bible in my glovebox
And a hot homemade apple pie on the passenger seat
She said you'll always be my baby
And she planted a kiss and a couple of tears on my cheek
Dad slipped me some travelin' cash
Threw a map with a highlighted route on the dash
And I realized, as I looked back, that

[Chorus]
They weren't just sayin' goodbye
They weren't just seein' me off
They were just makin' sure that I
Don't forget where I'm from
Go out there and do your family proud son
Momma loved and Daddy worked
And lived their lives just to make sure I know
My way back home

[Verse 2]
I can still smell Momma's kitchen
And feel every single prayer she says for me
I can point these wheels towards that sunset
Without a fear, without a doubt, Daddy says, "Go for that dream"
I left behind a pie-crumb trail
Just in case I get lost, fall flat, or fail
And if the wind should leave my sail

[Chorus]
They weren't just sayin' goodbye
They weren't just seein' me off
They were just makin' sure that I
Don't forget where I'm from
Go out there and do your family proud son
Momma loved and Daddy worked
And lived their lives just to make sure I know
My way back home

[Bridge]
To that door that's always open
And that light that's always on
To the love that's always waiting
After bein' gone too long

[Chorus]
They weren't just sayin' goodbye
They weren't just seein' me off
They were just makin' sure that I
Don't forget where I'm from
Go out there and do your family proud son
Momma loved and Daddy worked
And lived their lives just to make sure I know
I always know
I always know my way back home

[Outro]
My way back home
My way back home
