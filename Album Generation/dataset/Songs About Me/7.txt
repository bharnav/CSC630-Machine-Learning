[Verse 1]
Down the street, up the drive
Park the car, step outside
Across the lawn, up the stairs
On the porch, I'm gettin' there

[Verse 2]
Key in the lock, through the door
Down the hall I've walked so many times before
I'm dog-tired, but I don't care
Bedroom door, I'm gettin' there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got a hundred candles burnin'
She's got next-to-nothin' on, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm home
I've been away way too long
I've been waitin', I've been workin'
Wantin' you so bad it's hurtin'
Now I'm back where I belong
Baby I'm home

[Verse 3]
My arms around you, your lips to mine
Feel our hearts beat-beatin' in time
Hands in your hair, everywhere
I hear you whisper, I'm gettin' there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's got a hundred candles burnin'
They'll be burnin' all night long, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm home
I've been away way too long
I've been waitin', I've been workin'
Wantin' you so bad it's hurtin'
Now I'm back where I belong
Baby I'm home

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Every night without you, I've been dreamin' 'bout tonight
Missin' everything about you, girl there's no place like

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm home
I've been away way too long
Baby, I'm home
I've been away way too long
I've been waitin', I've been workin'
Wantin' you so bad it's hurtin'
Now I'm back where I belong
Baby I'm home

[Outro]
Yeah baby I'm home
Oh, I couldn't wait to get here
Yeah baby I'm home
Let me lock the doors, close the curtains
That's what I been missin' right there
Yeah, it looks like it's gonna be a long night
I miss you
