[Verse 1]
Well they finally put that red light up in the heart of town
Took the stop sign down, it was shot up anyhow
One night I ran right through it, in my Chevrolet
Both police cars came, but I got away

[Chorus]
It was a boomtown back in '62
Till the coal ran out and a drought came through
And they dammed the river, that we all used to fish
Population 405 and I made it 404 one night
And left the city limit sign layin' in the ditch
Run plumb over it, leavin' Metropolis

[Verse 2]
Well, I found myself in a big high-rise with a concrete yard
It ain't safe after dark, guess this ol' boy drove too far
Met a girl, fell in love, got married and she's due in May
Says we're gonna need more space, I said I know just the place
We can walk down to the country store
And we won't even have to lock our door
We can still get air and water there for free
She said that sounds good to me

[Chorus]
It was a boomtown back in '62
Till the coal ran out and a drought came through
And they dammed the river, that we all used to fish
Population 404 and when we pull in it'll be 3 more
And there's a city limit sign layin' in the ditch
That I need to fix, back in Metropolis

[Outro]
I'm almost in Metropolis
I'm back in Metropolis
