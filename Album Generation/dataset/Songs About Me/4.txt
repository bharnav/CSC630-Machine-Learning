[Verse 1]
A car goes by and I see a face, a stranger's face in the window
And I wish it was you
I'm in a room, it's a crowded room, a friend walks up to say hello
And I wish it was you
'Cause every memory that haunts my mind
Is just another reason why

[Chorus]
(I wish it was you)
The phone ring in the middle of the night
The doorbell in the broad daylight
A letter in the mail that I come home to
(I wish it was you)
When I see two people on the street
Touchin' like they don't care who sees
Laughin' the way we used to do

[Post-Chorus]
I wish it was you
And I wish it was you
I wish it was you
And I wish it was you

[Verse 2]
I'll meet someone who could be the one, but somethin' always happens
Before the night is through
There's that certain look and that certain smile, there's that old familiar pattern
And I wish it was you
Tellin' me that you'll be back someday
And I don't have to feel this way

[Chorus]
(I wish it was you)
The phone ring in the middle of the night
The doorbell in the broad daylight
A letter in the mail that I come home to
(I wish it was you)
When I see two people on the street
Touchin' like they don't care who sees
Laughin' the way we used to do

[Post-Chorus]
I wish it was you
And I wish it was you
I wish it was me
And I wish it was you

[Chorus]
(I wish it was you)
The phone ring in the middle of the night
The doorbell in the broad daylight
A letter in the mail that I come home to
(I wish it was you)
When I see two people on the street
Laughin' like they don't care who sees
Touchin' the way we used to do

[Post-Chorus]
I wish it was me
And I wish it was you
I wish it was me
And I wish it was you

[Outro]
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
Oh, I wish it was you
