[Verse 1]
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

[Chorus]
'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Verse 2]
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those

[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Bridge]
So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole

[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me
