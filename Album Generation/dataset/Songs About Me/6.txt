[Verse 1]
Everybody has their own idea of heaven
What kind of paradise they'll see
Pearly gates, streets of gold
No gettin' sick, or growin' old
Sounds like a beautiful place to be
But as for me

[Chorus 1]
My heaven is a wood frame house with a great big porch goin' all the way around
Sittin' on the swing listenin' to the sound of the birds singin'
My heaven is a warm summer day in the backyard, while the kids all play
Flies and mosquitoes stay away, while we're eatin' watermelon

[Post-Chorus]
That's my heaven

[Verse 2]
You're always gonna find a few non-believers
Those who stay lost in the dark
But I believe there is a place, full of light 'n love and grace
And I don't believe that it's all that far, in my heart

[Chorus 2]
My heaven is a cell phone ring
While I'm at work, and the only thing, that you have to say
Is you miss me and get home in a hurry
My heaven is the very worst day that I spent with you
When you were so mad but I still knew
Nobody would leave 'cause that don't happen

[Chorus 3]
My heaven is where I am now on the front porch of the wood frame house
Swingin' with you just lookin' around at all I've been given, and this life I'm livin'

[Post-Chorus]
It's my heaven

[Outro]
My heaven
My heaven
