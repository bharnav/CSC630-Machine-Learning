[Verse 1]
Oh damn your chest-beating, just you stop your screaming
It's splitting through my head and swinging from the ceiling
Move it over, tarzan, can't you see I'm bleeding?
I've called you by your first name, good lord it's me-jane!

[Chorus 1]
And I'm rolling
Split head
And I'm moving
I'm me-jane
Me-jane

[CVerse 2]
Oh damn your chest-beating, just you stop your screaming!
All the time you're hunting swimming fishing breathing (? )
Don't you ever stop and give me time to breathe in?
I've called you by your first name, good lord it's me-jane

[Chorus 1]
And I'm running
Split head
And I'm moving
I'm me-jane
And I'm trying
To make sense
You're screaming

[Chorus 2]
Don't load it on me
Don't load it on me
Don't load it all on me

[Verse]
Tarzan, I'm pleading, stop your fucking screaming!
You've got me many walls around here, but no ceiling
Oh, move it over tarzan! can't you see I'm bleeding?
Good lord you never stop!

[Chorus 2]

[Outro][5x]
Don't load it on me-jane
