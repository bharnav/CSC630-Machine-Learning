[Verse 1]
Hey there Luna
I'd like to, tell ya
How sad am I
So love sick I could die
Needing water
My neck's stiff, my head hurts
Been lookin' up all night
Been looking up moon, she's so bright
She's so white
She's so clean
I'm telling you
She's everything
I'd give it all
My sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized

[Chorus 1]
Yeah I wish I was a Yuri G
(Yea)
It's just the things that she does to me
(Yea)
Yeah I wish I was Yuri G
(Yea)
Bring back my memory

[Verse 2]
Told by a doctor
You make a figure
Needles stick in her
She'll be your Luna

[Chorus 2]
I stuck 'em in real clean
I stuck 'em in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized

[Chorus]
Yeah I wish I was a Yuri G
(Yea)
It's just the things that she does to me
(Yea)
Yeah I thought I was Yuri G
(Yea)
Bring back my memory

[Chorus 2]
I stuck them in a mile
I stuck them in real clean
I stuck them in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized

[Chorus 1][2x]
Yeah I wish I was a Yuri G
(Yea)
It's just the things that she does to me
(Yea)
Yeah I thought I was Yuri G
(Yea)
Bring back my memory

[Outro][3x]
Bring back my memory
