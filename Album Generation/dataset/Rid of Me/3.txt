Speak I'm listening
Baby, I'm your sweet thing
Believe, what I'm saying
God's truth, I'm not lying
I....
Lie Steady
Rest your head on me
I'll smooth it nicely
Rub it better, 'til it bleeds
I....
And you believed me
Caught out again
I'm calling you weak
Getting even
Oh.. I was joking
Sweet babe, Let me stroke it
Take.. I'm giving
God's truth I'm not lying
I......
And you'll believe me
I.I.. I'm calling you weak
I..I..I'll make it better
And rub 'til it bleeds
I'll rub it
Oh til it
I'll rub it
Oh til it
Oh!
I'll rub it
Oh til it
I'll rub it
Oh til it
I'll rub it
Oh til it
Oh!
I'll rub it
Oh til it
I'll rub it
Oh til it
I'll rub it
Oh til it
