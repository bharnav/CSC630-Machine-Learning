[Verse 1]
I was blind
I was lame
I was nothing
'Till you came
You said Babe
Make you sing
Make you feel
Like some queen

[Chorus]
Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line

[Verse 2]
And rode in fucking mad
With a halo of deep black
'Til my love made me gag
Call him Daddy, take my hand

[Chorus]
Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line

[Bridge]
I'm hooked
Oh higher
Oh beautful
Oh higher
Oh beautiful
Oh higher

[Verse 3]
Now I'm blind and I'm lame
Left with nothing but his stain
"Daddy your maid, she can't sing
She can't feel, she's no queen!"

[Chorus]
Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

[Chorus]
Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good lord he hooked me
'Leen out of time
