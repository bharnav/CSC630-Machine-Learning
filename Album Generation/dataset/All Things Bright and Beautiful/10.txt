[Intro]
(Da da da da da da da)[x2]

[Verse 1]
My rock candy passion is bittersweet
And armed to the teeth
'Cause she would rather fall in chocolate
Than fall in love
Especially with me
I stood under the waterfall
With a kiwi-pineapple parasol
As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball
And made a concrete cavern
A caterpillar concert hall

[Chorus: Adam Young (Lights)]
I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

[Verse 2: Adam Young (Lights)]
I would rather go swimming
With great white sharks
Than wade in romance
'Cause I can never find the courage
To ask her to dinner
Or even to dance
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
Don't sweat under your overcoat
'Cause my heart can harbor this paddle boat
You'll hit the bottom of the highest note
And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna
Leave your throat

[Chorus: Adam Young (Lights)]
I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

[Bridge]
Da da da da, da da da da[x4]

[Verse 3: Adam Young (Lights)]
(Let go of the world you know
And plug in the party lights)
Soak your cares in the solar flares
That light up these island nights
(Orange eclipse I can taste your lips
In the citrus afternoon)
If you can fly don't stop at the sky
'Cause there's footprints on the moon
(It was you)

[Chorus: Adam Young (Lights)]
I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

(Let's dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club
