[Verse 1]
Met a girl in the parking lot
And all I did was say "Hello"
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home

[Pre-Chorus]
But I guess that's the way it goes

[Chorus]
Tell me again, was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well, smile because you're a deer in the headlights

[Verse 2]
Met a girl with a graceful charm
But when beauty met the beast, he froze
Got the sense I was not her type
By black eye and bloody nose

[Pre-Chorus]
But I guess that's the way it goes

[Chorus]
Tell me again, was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well, smile because you're a deer in the headlights

[Bridge]
It's suffocating to say
But the female mystique takes my breath away
So give me a smile or give me a sneer
Because I'm trying to guess here

[Chorus]
Tell me again, was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried (deer in the headlights)

[Chorus 2]
Tell me again, was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
If life was a game, you would never play nice
If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights

[Outro]
You're the deer in the headlights
You're the deer in the headlights
