[Hook]
I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on a balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet

[Verse 1]
And you blushed as they scooped you up
On sugar maple wings
To gaze down on the city below
Ablaze with wondrous things

[Chorus]
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't wanna live there
I wouldn't wanna live there

[Verse 2]
Weighed down by heavy lids
And lunar lullabies
I knew you were wide awake
'Cause you smile with your eyes

[Chorus]
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't wanna live there

[Verse 2]
From the green belt balcony
The wildfires look so pretty
Ponderosa canopy
I’d never leave if it were up to me
To the ruby redwood tree
And to the velvet climbing ivy
Painted all mahogany
I’d never leave if it were up to me
(If it were up to me)

[Bridge]
With a starry brush
Paint the dusk venetian blue
'Cause in the evening hush
You’ll never believe the view
And when the leaves return
And their whisperings fill the night
They’ll freeze and burn
Where fire and ice collide
Where fire and ice collide

[Chorus]
Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace
Will the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't wanna live there
I wouldn't wanna live there

[Hook]
I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on a balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet
