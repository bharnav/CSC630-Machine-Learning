[Verse 1]
I survived a dreadful accident
In the car crash of the century
My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement
But in the back of the ambulance, I'd never felt so content

[Chorus]
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency

[Verse 2]
I tossed and turned in sterile apathy
Until the violets arrived for me
The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room
And the place got smaller as they grew taller
And taught me to bloom

[Chorus]
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency

[Bridge]
The curtains decayed, the daylight poured in
I was never afraid of the darkness again
My burns were third-degree, but I'd been set free
'Cause grace had finally found its way to me

[Chorus]
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency
Through a grave emergency
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency
