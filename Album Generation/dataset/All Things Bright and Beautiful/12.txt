[Chorus]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go

[Verse 1: Shawn Crystopher]
Uh uh, that's not a plane, that's me
I'm sitting where I'm supposed to
Floating on the cloud, can't nobody come close to
The concrete and the sky switch places
So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces
Firecracker to the moon, keep your eyes shut
Blasting off like a rocket from the ground up
Heh, I used to catch a cab on the Monday
Now the taxi's selling lights on the runway, fly high
Condo on the milky way
A house on the cloud and God's my landlord
And for my rent, all I pay is my drive
Got that, so if you need me, you can find me in the alligator sky

[Chorus]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go

[Bridge]
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
Imagination's taking me away
Reverie whispered in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
Imagination's taking me away

[Verse 2: Shawn Chrystopher]
Uh, now I'mma dance like I never danced
Sing like I never sing, dream like I've never dreamed
Or-or tried to, because we've been lied to
That the sun is something that we can't fly to
Well, I sit on my star and see street lights
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
Imagination is high and if you got it you can meet me
When you see me in the alligator sky

[Chorus: Adam Young and Shawn Chrystopher]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go
Owl City
Where was I when the rockets came to life (boom)
And carried you away into the alligator sky? (like a rocket from the ground up)
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead (never know)
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go

[Outro: Adam Young and Shawn Chrystopher]
Never letting go
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
In the alligator sky
