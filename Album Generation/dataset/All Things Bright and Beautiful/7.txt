[Intro]
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)

[Verse 1]
Call back the cap com, tick off the time bomb
Let felicity fly
Armor the airlock, blanket the bedrock
And kiss the planet goodbye (Through the galaxies...)

[Chorus]
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed and the sun went dark
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da... (Through the galaxies...)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da

(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)

[Verse 2]
Fight back the flight deck, bring on the breakneck
Cue the solar eclipse (Sun went dark!)
Summit the sunset, dovetail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits (Through the galaxies...)

[Chorus]
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed and the sun went dark (Sun went dark!)
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far

[Bridge]
Oh telescope, keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need
For he is the saving grace of the galaxies (Galaxies...)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies (Galaxies...)

[Chorus]
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed and the sun went dark (Sun went dark!)
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far!

[Outro]
I would follow this far!
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
(Through the galaxies, through the galaxies...)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
