Ladies and Gentlemen
Today is a day for mourning and remembering
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths and they had that special grace
That special spirit that says "Give me a challenge
And I'll meet it with joy"
The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives
We will never forget them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God
