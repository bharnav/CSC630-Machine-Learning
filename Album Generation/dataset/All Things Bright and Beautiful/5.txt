[Verse 1]
The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red
And explosions never make a sound

[Chorus 1]
(Oh, comet come down)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(Oh, comet come down)

[Verse 2]
My captain on the snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
(Is coming back to take me home)
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force
Because I'm not afraid to die alone

[Chorus 1][x2]

Oh, comet come
(Oh, comet come down)
(down)

[Chorus 2]
(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you want to go)
With an eagle eye

[Chorus 2]
(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in, bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you want to go)
With an eagle eye
(Eagle eye)[x10]
