You're just into looking after #1
Only thing you worry 'bout is having your fun
First sign of trouble and it's understood
You'll get going while the going's still good
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a secret agent got a hidden agenda
Got me in your sights, think I'm a real big spender
Stick around baby pretty soon you'll see
I ain't got no money but my love's for free
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a gun for hire when a war breaks out
Loving on the front line 'til the money runs out
Finger on the trigger, baby pull it and see
If your mercenary tactic's gonna work on me

You're a gun for hire when a war breaks out
Loving on the front line 'til the money runs out
Your finger's on the trigger, baby pull it and see
If your mercenary tactic's gonna work on me

You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
So very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
