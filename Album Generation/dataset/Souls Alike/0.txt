That was then and this is now
Found my way back here somehow
Knew you'd planned to let me go
Told you once I told you so

Take me down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But I know where I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken

I will not be someone other than who I am
I will fight to make my stand
What is living if I can't' be free
What is freedom if I can't be me

Take me down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But I know where I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken

I won't let you near it
'I will let my spirit fly
Highhh, highhh

Take me down
Take Me Down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But we both know I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken
I will not be broken
Noooooo nooooo baby
