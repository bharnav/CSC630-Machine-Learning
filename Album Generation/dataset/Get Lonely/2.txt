[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away
Try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine
Focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means

[Chorus]
Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead

[Verse 2]
Took my spot at the window, looked out at the road
Dots and dashes of traffic, like a message in code
And whole boxes of memories wrapped up at the curb
I sang songs to myself, didn't have any words

[Chorus]
Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead

[Verse 3]
Stole out to the backyard late last night
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight
Rising like giants from the cold earth
What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?

[Chorus]
Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead
