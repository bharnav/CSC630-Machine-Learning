[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
No one washed behind my ears
High in the trees alone for years
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons
Watching them go where they will go

[Verse 2]
Face in the leaves, song in my throat
Fall through the air, hoping to float
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy
Too heavy to carry
Watching them go where they will go
