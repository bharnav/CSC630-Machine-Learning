[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
The day I turned my back on all you people
I felt an itching in my thumbs
The salt air like a broadcast from the distant, dark beyond
When my transformation comes

[Verse 2]
I went down to the warm, warm water
Saw a pelican fly past
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me
I went wading through the grass

[Verse 3]
And no one was gonna come and get me
There wasn't anybody gonna know
Even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake
Every single place I go

[Verse 4]
And it was cool, and it was quiet
In the humid marsh down there
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water
Felt it gumming up my hair

[Verse 5]
The sun was sinking into the Atlantic
The last time that I turned my back on you
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under
It was the best that I could do

[Verse 6]
And I said
"Let them all fare better than your servant"
The reeds all pricking at my skin
"Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you"
All that water rushing in
