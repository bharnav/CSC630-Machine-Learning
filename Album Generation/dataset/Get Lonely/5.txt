[Verse 1]
I went down to the gas station for no particular reason
Heard the screams from the high school, it's football season
Empty lot the station faces will probably be there forever
I climbed over the four foot fence; I was trying to sever the tether
Moon in the sky, cold as a stone
Spend each night in your arms, always wake up alone

[Verse 2]
I lay down in the weeds, it was a real cold night
I was happy 'til the overnight attendant
Switched on the floodlight
Walking home I was talking to you under my breath
Saying things I would never say directly
I heard a siren on the road highway up ahead
Kinda wish they'd come and get me
Frost on the sidewalk, white as a bone
Tried to get close to you again, always wake up alone

[Bridge]
And as I was crossing our doorstep
I hesitated just a moment there
Remembered the day we moved into our small house
'til the vision got too vivid to bear

[Verse 3]
You were almost asleep, halfway undressed
I lay right down next to you
Held your head against my chest
And a guy with any kind of courage
Would maybe stop to think the matter through
Maybe hold you still and raise the question
Instead of blindly holding on to you
But we crank up the heat
And you giggle and moan
Spend all night in the company of ghosts, always wake up alone
