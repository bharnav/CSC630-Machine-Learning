[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
I will rise up early and dress myself up nice
And I will leave the house and check the deadlock twice
And I will find a crowd and blend in for a minute
And I will try to find a little comfort in it
And I will get lonely and gasp for air
And send your name up from my lips like a signal flare

[Verse 2]
And I will go downtown, stand in the shadows of the buildings
And button up my coat, trying to stay strong, spirit willing
And I will come back home, maybe call some friends
Maybe paint some pictures
It all depends
And I will get lonely and gasp for air
And look up at the high windows, and see your face up there
