[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees
Sometime after midnight, the ground is gonna freeze
Birds in the frosty air, what are they doing there?

[Verse 2]
Greenhouse full of butcher's broom, breezes at my back
Some time before the sun comes up, the earth is gonna crack
I look down at my hands, like they were mirrors

[Verse 3]
Fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips against the cup
Been waiting such a long time now, my number's finally coming up
All the neighbors come on out to their front porches, waving torches
