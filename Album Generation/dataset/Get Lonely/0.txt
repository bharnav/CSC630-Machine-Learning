[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail
And I steal down to Business 15-501
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail
And somebody stops to pick me up
But he drops me off just down the block
And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe
Wild sage growing in the weeds

[Verse 2]
Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps
Heading vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands, breaking my fall
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies
And then I think I hear angels in my ears
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror
And along the highway, where unlucky stray dogs bleed
Wild sage growing in the weeds

[Bridge]
And some days I don't miss my family
And some days I do
And some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder
Most days I know it's not true

[Verse 3]
I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand
'Til it doesn't sting so much
And until the blood's dried
And when somebodyone asks if I'm ok, I don't know what to say
And along the highway, from cast-off, innumerable seeds
Wild sage growing in the weeds
