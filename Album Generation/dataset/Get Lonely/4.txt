[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
A bad dream shook me in my sleep and I woke up sweating
Ran through the dark to the shower
Already forgetting
Tried to think good thoughts
Trying to find my way clear
Let the room fill with steam
Traced pictures on the mirror

[Chorus]
Ghosts and clouds and nameless things
Squint your eyes and hope real hard
Maybe sprout wings

[Verse 2]
I clawed my way to the living room window
Stood there in the cold
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance
Hard to hold
I thought of old friends
The ones who'd gone missing
Said all their names three times
Phantoms in the early dark
Canaries in the mines

[Chorus]
