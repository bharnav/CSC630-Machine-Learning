[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
Sun just clearing the treeline when my day begins
Slippery ice on the bridges, northeastern wind coming in
You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel
Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel
Dream at night
Girl with a cobra tattoo on her arm
Its head flaring out like a parachute

[Verse 2]
Prisms in the dew drops in the underbrush
Skatecase sailor's purses floating down in the black needlerush
Higher than the stars I will set my throne
God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones
Dream at night
Girl with a cobra tattoo
And try to hear the garbled transmissions come through
