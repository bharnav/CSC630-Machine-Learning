[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I felt free, and I felt lonely, and I felt scared
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
Not being used to being the only person there
Hmmmm

[Verse 2]
The first time I made coffee for just myself
I made too much of it, but I drank it all
Just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
And I wandered through the house, like a little boy lost at the mall
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space

[Chorus]
And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?

[Verse 3]
On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I was cold, so I put on a sweater
And I turned up the heat
And the walls began to close in
And I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room out into the street
And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

[Chorus]
And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?
