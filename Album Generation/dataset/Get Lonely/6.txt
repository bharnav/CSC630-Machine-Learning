[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
Autumn came around like a drifter to an onramp
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain
Took to walking barefoot around town
Melodies from grade school, kicking in my brain
Saw you on the crosstown bus today
You were reading a magazine
I turned my face away and I shut my eyes tight
And dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light on dark hillsides
In the hidden places

[Verse 2]
The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house
And I got off at the corner
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands
And I wished I was someone else
And I wished it was warmer
And when I got home, I thought about you
Like a desperate policeman, searching for clues
And I almost passed out, just then
And I shut my eyes again
Headed for the dark hillsides
In the hidden places
