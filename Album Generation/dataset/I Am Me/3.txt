[Intro]
I'm talking' bout love

[Verse 1]
All my girls stand in a circle and clap your hands
This is for you
Up's and downs, highs and lows
And no matter what you see me through
My boyfriend, he don't answer on the telephone
I don't even know where the hell he goes
But all my girls, we're in a circle
And nobody's gonna break through

[Chorus]
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O

[Post-Chorus]
Say you'll be my girls for life
Girls for life

[Verse 2]
Oh hold up, I need another one
I think you, you do too
Grab my bag, got my own money
Don't need any man in this room
My boyfriend, he'll be calling me now anytime
I need all my girls to keep him off my mind
So hold up, we need another one
What we got is all good

[Chorus]
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
Oh, did you hear me say?
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout
L-O-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E
L-O-L-O-L-O
I'm talking' bout love

[Post-Chorus]
Say you'll be my girls for life
Girls for life

[Bridge]
Love is an energy
Love is a mystery
Love is meant to be true
Love is a part of me
Love is the heart of me
Love is the best thing we do

[Breakdown]
