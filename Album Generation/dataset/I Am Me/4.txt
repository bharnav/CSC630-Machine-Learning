[Verse 1]
Sunday morning blues, always about you
I wake up alone in a big room
Got myself to blame for all my bad moods
And I really wish that I didn't feel this way
I want to break the circle but the circle won't break

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Woah, all I know, you keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Ooh, don't let go, just keep me coming back for more

[Post-Chorus]
You keep me coming coming coming coming back

[Verse 2]
Two weeks and three whole days, and I give in
I was doing so good, but you always win
And I really wish sometimes that we would just move on
But, what would I be doing if you were gone?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Woah, all I know, you keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Ooh, don't let go, just keep me coming back for more

[Bridge]
You always find a way to make me want to stay
You'll never get away from me, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Woah, all I know, you keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Ooh, don't let go, just keep me coming back for more

[Outro]
You keep me coming coming coming coming back for more
Coming back for more
You keep me coming coming coming coming back for more
Just keep me coming back for more
