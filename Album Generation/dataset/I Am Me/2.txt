[Verse 1]
It seems like yesterday that my world fell from the sky
It seems like yesterday I didn't know how hard I could cry
It feels like tomorrow, I may not get by
But I will try, I will try
Wipe the tears from my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm beautifully broken and I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken and I don't care if I show it

[Verse 2]
Everyday is a new day, I'm reminded of my past
Everytime there's another storm, I know that it won't last
Every moment I'm filled with hope
Cause I get another chance
But I will try, I will try
Got nothin' left to hide

[Chorus]
I'm beautifully broken and I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken and I don't care if I show it

[Bridge]
Without the highs and the lows
Where will we go?
Where will we go?

[Chorus]
I'm beautifully broken and I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken and I don't care if I show it
I'm, I am beautifully broken
I am beautifully broken
I'm, beautifully broken and I don't care if I show it
