[Verse 1]
I could hear her breathing
No one believed me, no one believed me
I could hear those voices
So deceiving, so deceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen with my eyes wide open?
And do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken with my eyes wide open?
I know your secret

[Verse 2]
I can feel you calling
I know that you're there, I know that you're there
Tell me all your memories
I'll keep them alive, I'll keep them alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen with my eyes wide open?
And do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken with my eyes wide open?
I know your secret

[Bridge]
I heard you, I felt you
I know, so what do you want from me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face
Cool wind on my face

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feels to be afraid
Lying there frozen with my eyes wide open?
And do you know how it feels to find a trace
Of words unspoken with my eyes wide open?
I know your secret
I know your secret
I know, I know, your secret
