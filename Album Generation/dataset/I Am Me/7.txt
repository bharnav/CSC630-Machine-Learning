[Verse 1]
Is anybody out there?
Does anybody see
That when the lights are off something's killing me?
I know it seems like people care
Cause they're always around me
But when the day is done and everybody runs

[Chorus]
Who will be the one to save me from myself?
Who will be the one who's there?
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

[Verse 2]
When the show is over
And it's empty everywhere
It's so hard to face going back alone
So I walk around the city
Anything, anything to clear my head
I've got nowhere to go nowhere but home

[Chorus]
Who will be the one to save me from myself?
Who will be the one who's there?
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

[Verse 3]
It may seem I have everything
But everything means nothing
When the ride that you've been on
That you're coming off
Leaves you feeling lost

[Bridge]
Is anybody out there?
Does anybody see
That sometimes loneliness is just a part of me?

[Chorus]
Who will be the one to save me from myself?
Who will be the one who's there?
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
