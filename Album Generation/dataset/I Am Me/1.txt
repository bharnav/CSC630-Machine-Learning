[Verse 1]
Do you love me, oh, do you love me?
I say so
Do you need me, oh, do you need me?
God, I hope

[Pre-Chorus]
I get this feeling deep inside
That somewhere, somehow you passed me by
I can't put my finger on it, but
The more that I see you, the more that I know

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life, you must've been mine, oh

[Verse 2]
You make me feel so
You make me feel so
Beautiful
It doesn't matter
No, it never matters if we're out or home

[Pre-Chorus]
We can make hours into years
Wherever you go you're always here
It's like I've known you from before
But, I'm just so happy you walked through my door

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life, you must've been mine

[Bridge]
I'm breathing you in
I'm breathing you out
You're all around me
No matter what we do
I wanna spend my life with you
Only you
Do you love me, oh, do you love me?
Say you love me, oh, say you love me

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life, you must've been mine
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life, you must've been mine

[Outro]
Do you love me?
Oh, say you love me
