[Verse 1]
Nobody's gonna hold me back
It's Friday night, I feel alright
Nobody's gonna bring me down
It's my life, and I'm doing fine
Don't you know I wanna play?
So take me on a holiday

[Chorus]
So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and go
So many faces it's no use
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

[Verse 2]
Nobody's gonna break my heart
And hurt me like they did before
No one can even get the part
Not until I know it's deep
Can't you come and take me away
Take me to another place

[Chorus]
So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and go
So many faces it's no use
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

[Bridge]
Can you hurry up?
Can you feel my love?
I'm burning up
I'm so hot
I'm so hot
I'm so hot
Dancing alone
Dreaming alone

[Chorus]
So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and go
So many faces it's no use
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

[Outro]
Like heaven
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
The one worth waiting for
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
