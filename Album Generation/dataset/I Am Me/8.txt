[Verse 1]
What's she got that I don't have?
Does she fill those spaces that I left you?
When you wake up every night
Does the scent of regret ever haunt you?

[Chorus]
Put this under your skin
Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone
Me, and I won't change for anyone
For anyone like you

[Verse 2]
Does the weight of consequence
Drag you down until it pulls you under? (pull you under)
Does she lend an eager hand to save you
From the future of being with her?
Are you with her?

[Chorus]
Put this under your skin
Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone
Me, and I won't change for anyone
For anyone like you

[Bridge]
Why would I, why would I change?
Why would I change?

[Chorus]
Put this under your skin
Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone
Me, and I won't change, I won't change
What's she got that I don't have?
What's she got that I don't have?

[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
