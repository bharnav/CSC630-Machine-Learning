Now Constance George has got a voice like a tonic
Mix it with gin and its got a kick to it
Don't care for novellas, prune juice or flans
Shes makin' up for time stolen by her old man
Shes walks with a goose step
And cooks like it's a can can
Falls to bed like ice in a tumbler
Shes makin' up for time stolen by her old man
She's got soul

Now she's as strong as the family have been for years
'Cos she wears her hair down to fight the disease
Living a life that ain't been scripted before
Hard hat cravings outside the front door
She walks with a goose step
And cooks like it's a can can
Falls to bed like ice in a tumbler
She's makin' up for time stolen by her old man
She's got soul
She's got soul

Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

She walks with a goose step
And cooks like it's a can can
Falls to bed like ice in a tumbler
She's makin' up for time stolen by her old man
She's got soul
