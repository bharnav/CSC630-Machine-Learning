Each summer we'd slumber in caravans
While our folks would drink casks and curse the sand
I noticed him staring at the ceiling like Gene Vincent
Singing to a crowd

For a girl of 14 I thought I knew I would meet
Someone with a thought that was free of TV
Leering and affected just like Gene Vincent
Singin' to a crowd
Like he was barely allowed

I give you the last thing truly mine
But your secrets are safe with me
You can ignore now just what you swore
Your secrets are safe with me
So I'll keep my love buried, but breathing
Your secrets are safe with
Ahh, they're safe with me

Behind the tunes he looked in my eye
But did I want him to
Trusting his mistrust, but I was just another voice in the crowd
I'm hardly getting over it now

I give you the last thing that's truly mine
But your secrets are safe with me
You can ignore now just what you swore
Your secrets are safe with me
So I'll keep my love buried, but breathing
Your secrets are safe with
Ahh, they're safe with me

You told me I felt like you own me
Now I care for nothing at all
What I gave you wasn't a favour
Now I care for nothing at all

Didn't trust nothing that much
Now I care for nothing at all
Now I care for, now I care for
Now I care for nothing at all
