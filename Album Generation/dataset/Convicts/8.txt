Ya know my three best friends were drummers yeah when i still had a face just like a pizza slice I knew my zildjians from my paradiddle plug straight into the stereo watch the damn thing blow

Yeh orchy bottle bongs and rocket fuel, while leaves gather in the corner of the pool but now my words theyre drownin in the amber again its like explainin cricket to americans just tryin to get a hold the whole damn thing oh oh oh ooo

Weekend experimentation (now you need laxidation) where did we all get the need for the daily medication? now my words theyre drownin in the liquor again its like explaining cricket to americans just tryin to get a hold of the whole damn thing oh oh oh oh ooo

Oh i this cos we never had a clue, damn our cynicism and the truth but now my words theyre drownin in the amber again its like explaning cricket to americans i'm just tryin to get a hold the whole thing really...
