I'm a mess
And it's losing its spark
Used to have a value
Now I'm alone in the dark

And I know
I ain't no sketch-a-graph baby
And these jowls, scowls and watermouths (?)
They ain't genetically related

So if you want to take it steady
Cantcha see that I'm not ready
The certified, full-stop, pressure-drop cut-up
Are you sure you wanna spend some time with me?

Yeah, I'm a mess
Yeah and I'm battin' way up my league
For all the arm-swings and pretty things that I sing
I'm a fuckin' disease

And you're a jewel
A drop from some of heaven's gene pool
And when you turn your head yeah
You can hear the stairs all droop

So if you want a little vocation
Me and your ma can read "a place in the sun"
I'm a certified full-stop pressure-drop cut-up

Are you sure you wanna spend some time with…
Are you sure you wanna spend the night with…
Ah, come on, could you spend a second with me?

Oh, well I'm a mess
Oh hell, I know that it's a crappy excuse
Gotta get myself a spring-clean
Just to soak in the juice

If you wanna take it slowly
Lord help me if I'm not only
A certified full-stop pressure-drop cut-up
Are you sure you wanna spend some time with...
Are you sure you wanna spend a minute with...
Oh come on babe, couldja spend a second with me?
