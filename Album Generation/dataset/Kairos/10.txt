Forget the mistakes
And inspire the will
A thought can conceive
Make destinies choice
Embrace the storm
Live or die
Embrace the storm
The change is vital
To keep up the growth
Unbinding secrets
Submitting to chance
Embrace the storm
Live or die
Embrace the storm
Can't deny, won't define me
Can't define, can't deny me
Embrace the storm
Live or die
Embrace the storm
