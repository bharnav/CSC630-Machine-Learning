Our root, our seed
Our cause born strong
From the cradle
We were brought up into this world
In the middle of chaos
Since our first breath of life
We are what we are
With love and power to change
With courage facing all threats
Our bloodline is alive
No doubts in our life
We are what we are
No pain, no fear
Our root, our seed
Our cause, born strong
All the strength in our mind
Looking deep in our eyes
Our tribe has written our laws
Respect to be respected
Be true to yourself
All the gold in the world
Will not get us sold
We trust the values we've learned
No doubts in our words
We are true to ourselves
No pain, no fear
Don't you know I'm strong?
Don't you know you're wrong?
Our root, our seed
Our cause, born strong
