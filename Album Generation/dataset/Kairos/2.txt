I'm relentless - I want vengeance
I'm relentless - I want vengeance

Forward
Can't stop to pace my steps
Onward
Never stood for second best

I'm relentless, I am always
I won't let this die

No words - Is not the life which I have led

I'm relentless - I want vengeance
I'm relentless - I want vengeance

Slow burn - Only got what I have done
Progress - To under take the task at hand

I'm relentless, I am always
I won't let this die

Timeless - Unscathed with attitude

I'm relentless - I want vengeance
I'm relentless - I want vengeance
