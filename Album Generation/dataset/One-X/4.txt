[Verse 1]
I walk alone, think of home
Memories of long ago
No one knows I lost my soul long ago

[Bridge]
Lied too much, she said that she's had enough
Am I too much? She said that she's had enough

[Hook]
Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home

[Verse 2]
I need to run far away
Can't go back to that place
Like she told me, I'm just a big disgrace

[Bridge]
Lied too much, she said that she’s had enough
Am I too much? She said that she’s had enough

[Hook]

So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own

[Bridge]

[Hook]
