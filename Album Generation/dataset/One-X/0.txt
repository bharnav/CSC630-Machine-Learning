[Verse 1]
Your bottle's almost empty
You know this can't go on
Because of you my mind is always racing
The needle's breaking your skin
The scar is sinking in
And now your trip begins

[Chorus]
But it's all over for, it's all over for you, for you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you, for you
When you're on the edge and falling off and It's all over

[Verse 2]
I know what runs through your blood
You do this all in vain
Because of you my mind is always racing
And it gets under my skin
To see you giving in
And now your trip begins

[Chorus]
But it's all over for, it's all over for you, for you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you, for you
When you're on the edge and falling off and It's all over

[Bridge]
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
(It's all over)
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
(It's all over)

[Outro]
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
And now you're dead inside (for you)
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
And now you're dead inside (for you)
Still you wonder why
(It's all over)
