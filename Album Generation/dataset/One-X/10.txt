[Verse 1]

Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years
I still can't believe you're gone
So I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me
With a story of our life

[Hook]

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever

[Verse 2]

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night
Get drunk and fuck and fight
Until the morning comes
I'll forget about our life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see
That I'm gone forever

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

[Hook]
