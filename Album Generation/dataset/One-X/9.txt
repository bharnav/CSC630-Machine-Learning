[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
On the ground I lay, motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep? Is this all a dream?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

[Chorus 1]
I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

[Verse 2]
On this bed I lay, losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much? Or just not enough?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

[Chorus 1]
I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

[Chorus 2]
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
