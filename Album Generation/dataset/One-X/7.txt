[Verse 1 - Three Days Grace]
We had fire in our eyes, in the beginning
I never felt so alive, in the beginning
You, you blame me but

[Bridge - Three Days Grace]
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't wanna hear it anymore

[Hook - Three Days Grace]
I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

[Verse 2 - Three Days Grace]
We had time on our side in the beginning
We, we had nothing to hide in the beginning
You, you blame me but

[Hook - Three Days Grace]
I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

[Bridge 2 - Three Days Grace]
You say that I didn't try
You say that I didn't try

[Hook - Three Days Grace]
I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore
