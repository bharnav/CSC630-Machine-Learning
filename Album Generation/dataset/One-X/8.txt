[Verse 1]
I feel it every day, it's all the same
It brings me down but I'm the one to blame
I've tried everything to get away
So here I go again, chasing you down again
Why do I do this?

[Hook]
Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to

[Verse 2]
Feels like every day stays the same
It's dragging me down and I can't pull away
So here I go again, chasing you down again
Why do I do this?

[Hook]
Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to

Over and over, over and over
You make me fall for you
Over and over, over and over
You don't even try

[Verse 3]
So many thoughts that I can't get out of my head
I try to live without you
Every time I do I feel dead
I know what's best for me but I want you instead
I'll keep on wasting all my time

[Hook]
Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to

Over and over, over and over
You make me fall for you
Over and over, over and over
You don't even try to
