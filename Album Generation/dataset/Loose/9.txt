[Intro: Timbaland]
Hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
In the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all
You either got it, or you don't
You either stand, or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)
But you got what it takes to set me free (hey, oh, oh, hey)
Oh, you could mean everything to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado]
I can't say that I'm not
Lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't
Love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't
Know that I am alive
And all of what I feel
I could show you tonight, you tonight

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)
But you got what it takes to set me free (hey, oh, oh, hey)
Oh, you could mean everything to me (hey, oh, oh, hey)

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body, I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?
(Three, four)

[Outro: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
