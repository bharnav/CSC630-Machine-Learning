[Verse 1]
Everybody look at me, me
I walk in the door you start screaming
Come on everybody what you here for?
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I want to see you all on your knees, knees
You either want to be with me, or be me!

[Hook]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall, real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all!

[Verse 2]
And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it
Even if you never ever seen it
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because, she said she love you, love you long time!

[Hook]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall, real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all!

[Chants]

[Hook]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall, real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all!

[Outro]
Never ever met her at all!
You wish you never ever met her at all!
You wish you never ever met her at all!
You wish you never ever met her at all!
You wish you never ever met her at all!
