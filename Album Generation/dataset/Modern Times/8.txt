[Intro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Everybody saying this is a day only the Lord could make

[Verse 1]
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
I got to the river and I threw my clothes away

I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
They can't take me back, not unless I want them to

[Verse 2]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take

I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
Riches and salvation can be waiting
Behind the next bend in the road

[Verse 3]
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
You say you want me to quit ya, I told you no, not just yet

I look in your eyes, I see nobody else but me
I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me
I see all that I am and all I hope to be

[Verse 4]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people don't know which road to take

When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
Without you there's no meaning in anything I do

[Verse 5]
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones

Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
A few more years of hard work
Then there'll be a thousand years of happiness

[Verse 6]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
I tried to get you to love me, but I won't repeat that mistake

If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Plenty of cheap stuff out there still around that you take

[Verse 7]
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I ain't got enough room to even raise my head

Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Don't be a stranger without a brain or heart

[Outro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some people still sleeping', some people are wide awake
