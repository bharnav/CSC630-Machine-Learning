[Verse 1]
I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
I don't care where you go or how long you stay
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any more

[Verse 2]
Well you take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with nothing but self doubt
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

[Verse 3]
When I was young, driving was my grave
You drive me so hard, almost to the grave
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

[Verse 4]
I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
I keep recycling the same old thoughts
Someday baby you are not going to worry Po' me anymore

[Verse 5]
So many good things in life that I overlooked
I don't know what to do now, you got me so hooked
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

[Verse 6]
Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm going to ring your neck
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you are not going to worry Po' me any more

[Verse 7]
You can take your clothes put him in a sack
You gain' down the road, baby and you can't come back
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

[Verse 8]
I try to be friendly, I try to be kind
Now I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

[Verse 9]
Living this way is not a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any more
