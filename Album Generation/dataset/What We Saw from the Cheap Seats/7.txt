[Intro]
A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our carefully laid plans

[Verse 1]
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're going to make 'em scream someday
You're going to make it big

[Verse 2]
You love so deep, so tender
Your people and your land
You love them until they can't recall
Who they are again

[Verse 3]
Work it, work it baby
Work your way around that room
You're going to make it big some day
You're going to make a boom

[Verse 4]
But I am
But I am
But I am not a number, not a name
But I am
But I am
But I am a carefully laid plan

[Verse 5]
Shake what your mama gave you
You know that it won't last
You're going to taste the ground real soon
You're going to taste the grass

[Verse 6]
A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our world under command

[Verse 7]
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're going to make us scream someday
You're going to make us weep

[Outro]
You're going to make us scream someday
You're going to make it big
