[Verse 1]
Oh, Marcello
How I wonder
La Madonna she tell the truth, no
She's been saying I'll have a baby
When he grow up he become a killer

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood

[Verse 2]
Oh, Marcello
Never thought I'd really love you but I do so
My headwaiter's head on your platter
Just say the word and
Salome can kiss my gutters

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood

Una mille, una mille, una mille, una mille
Una mille, una mille, una mille, una mille

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood

[Verse 3]
Oh, Marcello
How I wonder
La Madonna when she speak she tell the truth, no?
She's been saying I'll have a baby
When he grow up he'll become a killer and kill everybody

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood

[Outro]
Oh, Marcello!
Oh, Marcello!
