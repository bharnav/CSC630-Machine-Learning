[Verse 1]
I am down the road and up the hill
I wait for you still
Wires 'round my fingers

[Pre-Hook]
Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

[Hook]
Open
Open

[Verse 2]
I am through the woods and past the trains
I wait here in vain
Scrubbing out the stains again

[Pre-Hook]
Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

[Hook]
Open
Open

[Bridge]
In the night, the snow starts falling
And everybody stares
Through their windows at the streetlights
Too beautiful to see

[Verse 3]
I am in a room I've built myself
Four straight walls
One floor, one ceiling
And day after day I wake up feeling
Day after day I wake up feeling, feeling

[Pre-Hook]
Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

[Hook]
Open
Open
Open

[Outro]
Open up your eyes
And then
