[Verse 1]
Down on Bowery they lose their
Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the streets they say
Sir, do you got a light?
And if you do then you're my friend
And if you don't then you're my foe
And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go

[Chorus]
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas

[Verse 2]
And down on Lexington they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet
And close their eyes and open
And don't recognize the aging street
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?

[Chorus]
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas

[Verse 3]
Down in Bronxy-Bronx the kids go
Sledding down snow-covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow
And yes, they know that it'll melt
And yes, they know New York will thaw
But if you are a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold!

[Chorus]
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas

I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain

I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain

[Outro]
Oh I love, I love, in the rain
Oh I love, I love, in the rain
Oh I love, I love, in the rain
