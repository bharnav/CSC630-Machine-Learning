[Verse 1]
How can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
There is a time and place
For one more sweet embrace
And there's a time, ooh
When it all, ooh
Went wrong

[Chorus]
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh baby
How can I begin again?
How can I try to love someone new?
Someone who isn't you
How can our love be true?
When I'm not, ooh
I'm not over you

[Chorus]
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow

[Verse 3]
Time can come and take away the pain
But I just want my memories to remain
To hear your voice
To see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now

[Verse 4]
So baby
How can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
How can I ever know why some stay, others go?
When I don't, ooh
I don't want you to go

[Chorus]
I guess I know by now
That we will meet again somehow

[Verse 5]
Time can come and wash away the pain
But I just want my mind to stay the same
To hear your voice
To see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now

[Outro]
So baby
How can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
