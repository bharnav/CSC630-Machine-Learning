Standing in the doorway of forgiveness
Just like a sinner in the sun
Like the sky abover her, she's a hard lover
But she don't know which way to run

We're only here
We're only here
We're only here on borrowed time

We're only here
We're only here
We're only here on borrowed time

If i took too much for granted
The dark must come before the light
Like the years that follow
They leave me hollow
God knows i need you by my side

We're only here
We're only here

We're only here on borrowed time

We're only here
We're only here
We're only here on borrowed time

I know my days with you are numbered
But when the dust around has cleared
Then you'll discover i'm a hard lover
And you've got nothing left to fear

We're only here
We're only here
We're only here on borrowed time

We're only here
We're only here
We're only here on borrowed time
