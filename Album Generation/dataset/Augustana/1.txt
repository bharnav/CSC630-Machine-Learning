I'm hanging on I'm hurting
I'm backing down, you're starting over
You and I we've had enough
The wrong side of love

Even if my heart was burning
It wouldn't stop the world from turning over
We've had a lot, I've had enough

Chorus
The wrong side of
Keep running baby, don't look back
Keep running down a one way track
You'll be the one to break my heart in two
I'll be the one to take the hit for you

Oh oh oh x4

If I had a chance I'd take it
If I had a heart, I'd break it open
You and I, we've had enough

Repeat Chorus x1

You can't walk away from what your heart knows
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
I'm holding on til you let me go

And all the dreams I had
They lost along the way
And all the words you said
That you never meant to say

Well no one else is gonna love you like I do
Come a little closer, honey
I can't live without you
No one else is gonna love you like I do
No one else, No one else

Oh Oh Oh

You can't walk away from what your heart knows
You can't trade today for tomorrow
I'm holding on til you let me go

Oh oh oh

Til you let me go, til you let me go, let me go
