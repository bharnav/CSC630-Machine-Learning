You need a reason for the things I do
I need a miracle to see me through
I give you everything I've got inside
If you just stay here tonight

My hands are tired and I'm rolling the dice
My legs are broken, I ain't up for a fight
I make it rain from an empty sky
If you just stay here tonight

You'll be the last one picking up the pieces
You'll be the last one standing up strong
You'll be the last one making all the right things wrong

You need a lover in the first degree
I need a woman who believes in me
I shine the way through the darkest light
If you just stay here tonight

My heart is aching and I'm down on the ?
My will is weak and I'm falling again
I get back up and try to make things right
If you just stay here tonight

You'll be the last one picking up the pieces
You'll be the last one standing up strong
You'll be the last one making all the right things wrong
As the days go by, the days go by, the days go by

We'll be the last ones picking up the pieces
We'll be the last ones standing up strong
We'll be the last ones making all the right things wrong
As the days go by, the days go by, the days go by
