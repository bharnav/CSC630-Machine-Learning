Well meet me at the water
Let all your dreams come true
Tell your sisters and your brothers
We'll all be waiting for you

When all of this is over
And all your silver turns to gold
Say a prayer for each other
Someday I'm gonna steal your heart

I'm gonna steal your heart
I'm gonna steal your heart away
I'm gonna steal your heart
I'm gonna steal your heart away

My love is like an ocean
I'll take you down to the depths
I'm taking you with me
Taking every step to steal your heart

I'm gonna steal your heart away
I'm gonna steal your heart
I'm gonna steal your heart away

Well life is like a shadow
It never stays in one place
Well I'm standing here anyway
However long it takes to steal your heart

I'm gonna steal your heart away
I'm gonna steal your heart
I'm gonna steal your heart away
I'm gonna steal your heart
I'm gonna steal your heart away
