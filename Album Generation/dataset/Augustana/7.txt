Down on Third Avenue
The singer's singin the blues
And I got nothin to lose
I'm just comin back for you

Well life is a sign of the times
And faith is a sight for the blind
And love is a riddle and rhyme
And time goes quickly by

Like hell on high wire
I'm caught in a wildfire
Lights are blinding
The river's winding
Heaven's rain fell
On fallen angels
Never minding the silver lining

Well you can only pray, when you're
Waiting out the hurricane
Waiting out the hurricane

Well sinners sin with the saints
And givers give what they take
Come on and lovers, love what you hate
Man I know it's never too late

Like hell on high wire

I'm caught in a wildfire
Lights are blinding
The river's winding
Heaven's rain fell
On fallen angels
Never minding the silver lining

Well you can only pray, when you're
Waiting out the hurricane

The riders out on the run
The valley leads to the sun
All colors bleed into one...

Like hell on high wire
I'm caught in a wildfire
Lights are blinding
The river's winding
Heaven's rain fell
On fallen angels
Never minding the silver lining

Well you can only pray, when you're
Waiting out the hurricane
Waiting out the hurricane
