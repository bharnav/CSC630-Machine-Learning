Face the day and face the night
Hold you close and hold you tight
Did I keep you satisfied?
Or did I let you down?

Bullet trains and aeroplanes
Blow in from the south
Well you're someone's baby now

Fields of green and oceans blue
Sweeter things and bitter fruits
Only make me think of you
Waiting in the sky

Hurricanes and fire flames
Never brought you down
Well you're someone's baby now

When you're looking in the mirror
See my shadows on the wall
Now you see things a little clearer
And you're feeling two-foot tall

Heaven, Hell, and in between

Yellow roses at your feet
Far from all em city streets
Shattering the night

Well golden years will slip away
Buried in the ground
Come on and hold yourself up to the light
And do not make a sound
You know your mama taught you what to love
But she never taught you how
Well you're somebody's baby now

When you're looking in the mirror
You see my shadows on the wall
Well can you hear me babe?
I need you near me
I'm someone's baby now

You can't, can't let go
You know when you can't, can't let go
