It doesn't make the rain fall down
It doesn't make the world go 'round
It doesn't make the loudest sound
It doesn't mean I'm sorrow bound

It doesn't make the wrong things right
It doesn't keep you warm at night
It doesn't help you learn how to fight
It doesn't show the dark from the light

It doesn't take a sign to see
The best things never come for free
And even if it's made to bleed
You know that you can count on me

It doesn't make your plans fall through

It doesn't make your dreams come true
It doesn't make your old ways new
It only means I love you

It doesn't make the river flow
It doesn't make your flowers grow
It doesn't make you feel alone
It doesn't tell you where to go

And it doesn't make a blind man see
It doesn't make a lost man free
It doesn't fix your broken wings
It means that you were made for me...
