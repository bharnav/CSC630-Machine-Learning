Everything has a reason
Everything has a start
Anything that ever
Burned had a spark
Anything I ever wanted
Anyone I ever needed
Always seemed to leave me standing in the dark

Suddenly I'm caught in your light
Opened the door, and you stepped inside
And I'm watching the hours
Looking for reasons
Find that I'm missing every beat of your heart
'til you're back in my arms
I'll be waiting up counting the stars
Counting the stars

Nothing could ever touch us
Nothing gonna shake my faith
Nothing in this big, bad world will ever take you away
Like a rolling hurricane
Nothing's standing in our way
Full of life, full of grace, in a perfect place

Suddenly I'm caught in your light
Opened the door, and you stepped inside
And I'm watching the hours

Looking for reasons
Find that I'm missing every beat of your heart
'til you're back in my arms
I'll be waiting up counting the stars
Counting the stars

Like a rolling hurricane
Nothing's standing in our way
Full of life, full of grace, in a perfect place

Suddenly I'm caught in your light
Opened the door, and you stepped inside
And I'm watching the hours
Looking for reasons
Find that I'm missing every beat of your heart
'til you're back in my arms
I'll be waiting up counting the stars

Counting the stars
Counting the stars
I'll be waiting 'til you're back in my arms
I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting up
Counting the stars
