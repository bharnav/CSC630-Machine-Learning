Well, no one was too upset
You know we were married in the war
And I went with him to Pennsylvania and California
But then he went out to the Pacific
And I went back to Chicago to work on the railroad

[Olga Sarantos and Eleanor Friedberger]
And we wrote letters every day
Which were later thrown away
And God knows what we wrote or what they said
But this is probably how they read

[Olga Sarantos]
I left the letters behind
In the basement of the apartment building when we moved
For the mice to nibble on
I wonder how long they lasted

[Olga Sarantos and Eleanor Friedberger]
And we wrote letters every day
Which were later thrown away
And God knows what we wrote and what they said
But this is probably how they read

[Olga Sarantos]
Now, at my wedding, my husband didn't have his close family there as I indicated
He came from a family of priests
At least, there were lots of priests in his family
And so, eight priests presided over our wedding
Eight priests, it looked impressive
But it didn't sound very good

[Eleanor Friedberger]
A gaggle of priests
Or they were like crows around an overly ornate park bench up there
They all had fine voices
But, and I mean this respectfully
They didn't match pitch

[Olga Sarantos]
Thinking that each one of them was the one in the right
So they made some strange note choices
