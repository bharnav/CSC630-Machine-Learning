[Olga Sarantos]
Faster, hammers
Faster, hammers
Churn and turn into my late train to my lost love
Ring away today, stick, bruise into my felt, or so I felt
I found a skeleton tooth in the junk drawer
And I mean to open the folding green and white door
And take a late train to my lost love
Faster, hammers!
Faster, hammers!

[Chorus: Eleanor Friedberger]
Listen to those dead pianos, pins stuck in their hearts
Clang tap bell pedal down dead wood chipped and dull dark steel
Rattling and chattering and chilly on a damp November afternoon
On tracks one and two
And twelve and thirteen
On that ribbon spinning and computer colors
Tick tacks on round wire
Spun steel spark on three rail thin lines

[Olga Sarantos]
See a minor, a little girl
Ask if she would like for instance some fudge
But I didn't budge, and said I didn't care
I wanted to sit, and I wanted to stare
Spin steel, tick tack on three little strings made three little rails made one note clunk
Three rails squeaking and sputtering down the west side
I found a skeleton tooth in the junk drawer and I mean to open the folding green and white door
And take a late train to my lost love
Faster, hammers!
Faster, hammers!
Chatter down the tracks, you thumb tack smiley skull teeth
Ticking five dollar throwaway pianos past
A late train to my lost love

[Chorus: Eleanor Friedberger]
Listen to those dead pianos, pins stuck in their hearts
Clang tap bell pedal down dead wood chipped and dull dark steel
Rattling and chattering and chilly on a damp November afternoon
On tracks one and two
And twelve and thirteen
On that ribbon spinning and computer colors
Tick tacks on round wire
Spun steel spark on three rail thin lines

[Olga Sarantos]
Late, by act of Congress and blue all the way to Forest Park
And this ribbon spinning and computer color
Into a public transport for everyone to hear and get on track
And back to my lost love
Faster, hammers!
Faster, hammers!
We're almost there

Faster, hammers!
We're almost there

I'd like to tell you a story, kids
But instead I'll change the subject
Listen to this tune, it sounds like a condolence card
Bought at the last minute for someone you can't stand
For someone you never liked
And isn't it cute

La la la...

Listen to this tune I'm playing now, kids
Does it seem sad
Does it remind you of when
