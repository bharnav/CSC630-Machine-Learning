[Verse 1]
Young and bright
But now just a dim light
Off in the distance
A falling stone
Following the path
Of least resistance

[Pre-Chorus]
If I still fight, it's just that I'm
Afraid I'll slide under that spell again

[Chorus]
Taken for a fool
Yes, I was because I was a fool
Tell me what you do
I lost my way in shades of neither school

[Verse 2]
So many times
Caught up in my head at night
With a leash and a label
If I can learn
Anything from this, then I'd be like
The fox in the fable of light

[Pre-Chorus]
If I still fight, it's just that I'm
Afraid I'll slide under that spell again

[Bridge]
The way we used to carry on
Is stuck in my head like a terrible song

[Chorus 2]
Taken for a fool
Yes I was, and I was a fool
Following their rules
Guess I was a very honest tune

[Outro]
Taken for a fool (taken for a fool)
Yes I was, because I was a fool
(Taken for a fool)
