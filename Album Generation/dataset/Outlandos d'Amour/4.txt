[Verse 1]
It's all a game
You're not the same
Your famous name
The price of fame

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, try to liberate me
I said oh no, stay and irritate me
I said oh no, try to elevate me
I said oh no, just a fallen hero

[Chorus]
Don't wanna hear about the drugs you're taking
Don't wanna read about the love you're making
Don't wanna hear about the life you're faking
Don't wanna read about the muck they're raking

[Verse 2]
You sang your song
For much too long
There's something wrong
Your brain has gone

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x4]

Peanuts
Peanuts
Peanuts
