[Verse 1]
I can't stand it for another day
When you live so many miles away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay
(you) took me over, let me find a way
I sold my house
I sold my motor, too
All I want is to be next to you
I'd rob a bank
Maybe steal a plane
You took me over
Think I'm going insane

[Chorus]
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you

[Verse 2]
I've had a thousand girls or maybe more
But I've never felt like this before
But I just don't know what's come over me
You took me over, take a look at me

[Chorus]
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you

[Bridge]
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you

{Guitar solo}

[Verse 3]
So many times I used to give a sign
Got this feeling, gonna lose my mind
When all it is is just a love affair
You took me over baby, take me there

[Chorus]
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you

[Outro]
All I want is to be next to you...
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
