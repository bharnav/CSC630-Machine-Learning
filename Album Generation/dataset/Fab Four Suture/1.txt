Express [?] reality was spurning those
Who may cuss, take it for what it's not
Different languages full of riches
To reveal what's real and concrete

His connection
His true life, the spirit
Beware the swamp
Takes our will to create

Reality has been diverted
Unscrupulously manipulated
Unbridled exercise of power
The fascist urge to control all
On what we think, to our intimacy
Our bodies turn to commodities

Hypocrisy of our time
So in love with freedom
Who really wants it dead

Yes, I object to be made an object
No site for your deflection of power

Hypocrisy of our time
So in love with freedom
Who really wants it dead

We treat our bodies like machines
Fascism winning
We treat our bodies like machines
Fascism within
