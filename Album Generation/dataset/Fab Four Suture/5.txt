When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

I'm afraid of the ghost
When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared on bandits

When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

And why am I irrational?
There are things I cannot control

When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

I'm not oppressive
I'm afraid the ghost
(I'm afraid of the war)
I'm afraid of the war
(I'm afraid of the ghost)
I'm afraid the ghost
I'm afraid of them both
