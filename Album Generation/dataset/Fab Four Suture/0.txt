The desert is growing
The wars are threatening
Where's the place in your face?
Where's the place on your plate?
Consumorphic morality
Privatize, desensitize
Hey big fish in the lake
Hey all the small ones now "explain"
Hey big fish in the lake
Hey all the small ones now "explain"
Hey big fish in the lake
What good is all this knowledge we've acquired
In the face of deep realism
After this affront isn't what we choose
Regression into Spartan rule
We can learn to respect each other
And nature govern "all it widest can"
Where's the place in your face?
Such a dim conformity
Where's the place on your plate?
Consumorphic morality
The desert is growing
The wars are threatening
Hey big fish in the lake
