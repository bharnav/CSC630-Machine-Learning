"Lover, lover" of the aquatic slime
"Lover, lover", love, love the plastic mile
Who wants to be into fact
Come and play into the hatch
How much wind? No idea
How long have "we sung the hymn"?
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some... to sleepiness
Who wants to be into fact
"Commitment", kick through the hatch
How much wind? No idea
How long have we "sung the hymn"
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some...to sleepiness
And when I woke up
At the dawn
Had to close my eyes
In my window
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some end up to sleepiness
And when I woke up
At the dawn
Had to close my eyes
In my window
Living passive and in my own trap
