(...)
Building up the cage
That I find necessary
One does not know how
To deal with the real
Not even with its reflection
Scared of the void
Can't hear oneself
"this very" (whispering?) void must stay empty
To allow the space in which
One can vibrate
Leave it empty
Accept this place
So not to die alone
Connect and radiate
