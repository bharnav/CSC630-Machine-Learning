Riding after recognition
Instant gratification
Silky cradle of illusion
Immediate satisfaction
(pleasure...)
I want to build a castle
(pleasure...)
It's too much of a hassle
Desperate polemic
To feel more happy
It's a funny dictatorship
The one by which one must have pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure all of the time
In "love" before this angry life/life
(pleasure...)
Try to make it work in disguise
(pleasure...)
Doesn't exist, I realize
His false and artificial means
(pleasure...)
Isn't my reality
(pleasure...)
Enforces a state of...
Desperate polemic
To feel more happy
Their hole" is...
Our freedom is endless
....
