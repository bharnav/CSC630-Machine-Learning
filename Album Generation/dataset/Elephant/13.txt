[Chorus: Jack White & Holly Golightly]
Well it's true that we love one another

[Holly]
I love Jack White like a little brother

[Jack]
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

[Verse 1: Holly]
Jack give me some money to pay my bills

[Jack]
All the dough I give you Holly you've been using on pain pills

[Holly]
Jack will you call me if you're able?

[Jack]
I got your phone number written in the back of my Bible

[Verse 2: Holly]
Jack I think you're pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg do you think Jack really loves me?

[Meg White]
You know I don't care cause Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?

[Holly]
Well I would, but Meg, I really just don't know how

[Verse 3: Meg]
Just say, “Jack , do you adore me?”

[Jack]
Well I would Holly, but love really bores me

[Holly & Jack]
Then I guess we should just be friends

[Jack]
I'm just kidding Holly, you know that I'll love you 'til the end

[Chorus: Jack & Holly]
Well it's true that we love one another

[Holly]
I love Jack White like a little brother

[Jack]
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

[Verse 4: Jack]
Holly give me some of your English lovin'

[Holly]
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and love yourself?

[Jack]
If I did that Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else

[Holly]
Jack it's too bad about the way that you look

[Jack]
You know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot

[Meg]
Will the two of you cut it out?
And tell 'em what it's really all about

[Chorus: Jack & Holly]
Well it's true that we love one another

[Holly]
I love Jack White like a little brother

[Jack]
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

[Spoken Outtro: Holly (Jack)]
That was good (Jolly good)
Was that jolly good? (Yeah, very nice)
Jolly good, cup of tea then, Bruce
Let's celebrate
