You walk on higher ground
Like the holy ghost I haven't found
The mighty words you speak
They bounce off the strong but are heard by the weak
Their pennies just keep on comin' in
Their spirits are still soakin' in their sins
Some say they're even born again
See what you can find at the end of the line
There's no end in time at the end of the line
There's no peace of mind at the end of the line
The time has finally come
To relinquish the throne that doesn't belong
For only you can tell
If the pardon will come or will you burn in hell
You tried to recover dirty stones
From love filthy games played on the road
Now it is you who stands alone
See what you can find at the end of the line
There's no end in time at the end of the line
There's no peace of mind at the end of the line
You can run, you can't hide at the end of the line
Their pennies just keep on comin' in
The spirits still soaking in his sins
Some say they're even born again
See what you can find at the end of the line
There's no end in time at the end of the line
There's no peace of mind at the end of the line
You can run, you can't hide at the end of the line
And there's no peace of mind at the end of the line
Oh, no, no, no
At the end of the line
At the end of the line
At the end of the line
At the end of the line
