Might fill spoons full of diamonds
Might fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul

You're a lyin' about it
Go around and cry about it
Everything's a lyin' about
Everything's a-fightin' about, about the spoonful, spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful
Spoonful, yeah


Might fill spoons full of coffee
Fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

You're a-lyin' about it
Go around and cry about it
Fight and die about a spoon
Everything's a-lyin' about a spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful yeah
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful yeah

Might fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands, yes
What a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man

Baby, you're a lyin'
Go around a-cryin'
Everything's a-lyin'
Everything's a-fightin' about the
The spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Spoonful, spoonful, yeah
Everything's a-lyin' about the spoonful, yeah!
