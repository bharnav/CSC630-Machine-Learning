[Verse 1]
No map looking for the one I love
'Cause the one I love is here
And no map looking for the one who stands
'Cause he's arming me from fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He got tuned into, to the other side
Lives spent digging holes to the, to the ones you hide

[Chorus]
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes

[Verse 2]
More cuts taken for the one in silence
Now he sits between my ears
His moves in madness, how I love the rush
'Cause you wipe away these tears

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we got taken in by, by a rush of blood
My train's leaving now, how I wish I could

[Chorus]
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
