[Chorus]
Shoot a runner
Shoot, shoot a runner
I'm a king and she's my queen

Shoot the runner
Shoot, shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen

[Verse 1]
Dream
Dream again in your way
Always knew that you would
Lose yourself to the scene
Am I only a dream?

[Chorus]
Shoot a runner
Shoot, shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch

[Verse 2]
Bang
Bang away with my Chang (my Chang)
Always know that I can
Get you onto the floor
Absinthe makes you a whore

[Chorus]
Shoot a runner
Shoot, shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen

Shoot a runner
Shoot, shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch

[Verse 3]
Kings
Kings may come and then go
By this sword you must know
All things will come and then pass
Live your days like the last

Ahh ...
You're my queen, I said
Shoot shoot the runner
'Cause i'm a king yeah, and you're my queen, bitch
