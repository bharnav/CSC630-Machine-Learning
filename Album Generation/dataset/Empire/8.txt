Seek and destroy
All you have
Cos I know
Throw through your fears
In my tears
Cos you know

And all I have now
Is being here with you

Seek and destroy
All you have
Cos I know
(Cos I know, alright now)
There'll never be (Can't be a fear) to fear
To what we know

And all I have now
Is being here with you

(can't be a fear, it's all you now)
(can't be a fear, it's all me now)

And all I have now
Is being here with you
And all I have now
Is being here with you
