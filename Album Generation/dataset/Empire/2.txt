I don't sit alone cos I've got you, makin' tracks through these woods I'm gonna get my blues
Just holdin' snacks dropping beats, tabs the heroes comes
Ah
This is the last trip, just want to get you on your own
Said, this is the last trip, just want to get you on your own
Drag the system down
Now, I don't see no lights I don't taste no spit. Silent flash, hear the bang I'm gonna get my blues
Just feel it
No going back
Just kill it
Of holding hands
Just feel it
With you, the circus comes
Just feel it
Easy
This feelin'
Easy
Just feel it
Just feel it
This is the last trip, just want to get you on your own
Said, ths is the last trip, just want to get you on your own
Sees that smite
Just feel it
This feelin'
Just feel it
This feelin'
Just feel it
This feelin'
Just feel it
This feelin'
