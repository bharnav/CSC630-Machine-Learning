[Verse 1]
Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You'll never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
The truth is

[Chorus]
They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

[Verse 2]
This beat on London's sky
Whiskey's almost dry
I smile 'cause I've already escaped
Just like to see how far I can take it

[Chorus]
They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

[Chorus]
They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

[Outro]
Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You'll never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
