You were always the good one
And now you are the lonely one, and so am I
You dig your heel
If walls could feel, it'd hit like thunder

You suffered in silence
Two thoughts; it was the sound of one, but not enough
Inside your heart
Can't fake a part

No more silence in me
We're not the lucky ones
We'll never be the lucky ones

What you found was a way out
Not much, but it's the thought that counts, and so I try
To make a start
To fake a part
