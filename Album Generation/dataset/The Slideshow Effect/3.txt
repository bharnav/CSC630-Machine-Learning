It's not enough to live your past, through photographs
Uncovered
One falling breath you've held in time, encased in light
Now fading

I can't feel you in these scenes
An absence leaves this incomplete

Kept you alive, but it's unclear, what holds you here
Unaging
Echoes of life embrace these walls, 'til they dissolve
Cascading

I've been searching for you in these frames
By face or name, your eyes...

Where's the fight you are feeling?
When life takes away each fleeting part of what we are inside
