Our bodies lie on the water
On the water, we drew breath
Before we suffocate, 'felt the glow of better days
Heart is beating, memories creasing

The self revealed in folding paper
It's just vapour, we're just vapour
The plans we made, the names we'd break
I felt a home there, I hid my own there

I can't see you behind all these waves
The more I look the more you fade
I can't see your face amongst these waves
The more I look the more you fade

And I'd hoped that we could go out and see it
(we'll be in a better place)
