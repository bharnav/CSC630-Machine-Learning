Between a state where years collide
And we can just lie still, waiting for the day to spill
And watch the light slowly arrive, pressed against my eyes
Tracing all your lines, slowly

Lie on the ground before the lightning strikes
Just don't drown in the flood

Been weaving threads between our names
A pact to carry on, in case this all goes wrong
When we were sleeping through the years
The days all seemed far off, until the sky swelled up
Slowly

Can we survive without measured time?
