Go to sleep, nothing's changing
I'll be right here by your side
Break the teens, colours fading
In the stillness of the night

You're thick-skinned, but it seems
You're hiding in daydreams
Can't find our way to the light
And when this routine ends, through nights and weekends
We'll see daylight through the blinds

Drifting in a cold state, the glowing cracks of old days
Bodies slack and pressed beneath the hour in your eyes
Fingernails and cold skin, your parent's bed we lay in
Arms outstretched to emptiness; the space you've left behind

Go to sleep, nothing's changing
I'll be right here by your side
Tear the seams, we're not aging
Beneath these trembling star-lit skies

You're thick-skinned, but you know
It's beyond our control
Shadows gleaming in our eyes
Been living a past dear, be free from those dull years
And we'll see daylight through the blinds
