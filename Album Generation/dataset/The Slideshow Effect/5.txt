It's getting late, 'think I'll turn in
The moon is out and it's much too cold to swim
I left your photo in this pool
With all the thoughts I weave, in order to recall you

Out in the pale grey mothlight sky
I see my breath like ghosts too fragile to take flight
I held the photo to the light, and traced the symmetries our fingerprints divide

And I'll keep moving westward, along these streets at once ascending
Shift beneath the floorboards of our bed as you lie sleeping
And I will bring you fire to dissolve the memory of
All our wonder, unavenged
In silence, keep repeating
It's the same
