Softly held the light beneath your skin
Never drew a breath between our names
As you come aware that something's left
Everybody knows that you are dead

I can feel this place becoming what it never was
Do we embrace the hours, as if we never lost
One lonely resignation; tethered to your thoughts
I'm dreaming through these motions, in hopes that it will last

And I won't follow you back home
