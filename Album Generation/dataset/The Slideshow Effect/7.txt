It started when we were younger
Beneath the lead eyes of the city skyline
We gave ourselves to the current
A surface unswayed in our wake

I rest my head on your shoulder
And dreamt we were gone, but our names remained
Felt the pulse of the water
And left behind all my old ways

This life could be graced with symmetry
Walk with me, do you walk with me?
I can't forget the place this started
Walk with me, will you walk with me?
