A clock face ticking on empty dial
I only want what I know is mine
Sound the bells
â€˜Cause here's the good new

Here's the one you been waiting for
Your time has come
Ain't gonna wait no more
Can I get a piece for me

You know when something's up
When it hits you hard
You feel like starting over
Straight back for yards
When everything is everything
And everything you see
Sees us doing all the things
That we want to be

Millions march back on their feet
Still no sign from, a, those who preach
Teach me not
They don't represent me

Here's the one you been waiting for
Don't waste time
Ain't gonna wait no more
Can I get a shout for me

You know when something's up
When it hits you hard
You feel like starting over
Straight back for yards
When everything is everything
And everything you see
Sees us doing all the things
That we want to be

Nothing's new and nothing gained
When all is lost and nothing claimed
Except the parts
They keep for theirselves

Here's the one you been waiting for
Don't waste time
Ain't gonna wait no more
Can I get a shout for me
Can I get a little piece for me
For me
Oh, for me
For me
