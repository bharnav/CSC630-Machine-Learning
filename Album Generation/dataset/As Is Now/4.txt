Hold tight angel
Morning will soon be here
Washing your pillow
In swathes of gold and red
Our time is waiting
In the wings of uncertainty
Our love is waking
You're born to be with me

I know it takes
To the start of forever
That's a long time
Such a long time
To be waiting
In the sun
In the sun

Your soul so peaceful
How could I have been so mean
Feel I've been sleeping
Might have looked but I've never seen

Your beauty takes
To the start of forever
That's a long time
Such a long time
To be waiting
In the sun

Feel I've been sleeping
I'm born to be with you

To the start of forever
It's the start
It's a long time
Such a long time
To be waiting
In the sun
In the sun
In the sun
In the sun
