Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Just fly, just fly

You give the world to me
When you start to breathe
You give the world a dream
When you start to live
So fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly
Fly little bird
When you fly

Help the world to see
When you start to dream
You give the world to me
When you start to breathe
So, fly little bird
When you fly
Fly
Fly in the sky
So, fly little bird
When you fly
Fly (repeat over)

Give the world to feel
You help the world to heal
You give the world to live
When you start to live
So, fly little bird
When you fly

This world we need to leave
We're following your lead
You said the world was love
The love is what we need
So, fly little bird
When you fly

Fly, fly little bird when you
Fly, fly little bird when you
Fly, high in the sky when you
Fly, fly little bird when you
Fly (repeat)
