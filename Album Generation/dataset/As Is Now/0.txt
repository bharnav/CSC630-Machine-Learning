Can nobody love you
Like I love you, yeah
Can nobody need you
Like I need you, yeah

While you got your head in the clouds
And talking so loud
Can't you see past the stages
It's only when you finally arrive
That you recognise
You been going through changes

Oh changes

Can nobody kiss you
Like I miss you, yeah
Can nobody tame you
Ain't no chains to hold you

While you got your head in the clouds
And talking so loud
Can't you read past the pages
It's only when you finally arrive
That you recognise
You been going through changes

Oh changes
Ah changes
Oh changes
Ah changes

While you got your head in the clouds
And talking so loud
Can't you see past the stages
It's only when you finally arrive
That you recognise
You been going through changes

Oh changes
Ah changes
Oh changes
Oh

Blink! And you just might miss it
Blink! And you just might miss it
Blink! And you just might miss it
Blink! And you just might miss it
