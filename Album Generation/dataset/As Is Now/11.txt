Roll along summer
Wispering through my window pane
Wake me up and whole again
With a sway
Skate upon-something
Get me up and out of bed
Put a volt right through my head
To beyond

You been down and out and blue
Take no notice of the moon - shame
Ol' man river's after you
Said you ain't done what you said you would
It's a shame
Shame

Roll along summer
Breathing life into the world
Creating space that wasn't there
Before

Forever in your shadow
It's darkness I can face
(I'm) proud to feel I can find a place
Somewhere behind

You been down and out and blue
Take no notice of the moon - shame
Ol' man river's after you
Said you ain't done what you said you would
It's a shame - shame
Shame on you

Roll along, beautiful lover
Show me things I've never seen
Lighting up an ancient beam - for me to see
