You're savages, he knows you are..
Do you not think that god is looking down?
On you savages.. the children run, to mothers
You put bullets in their backs
Ah cowards, can you not see
Do you not think that love is coming down?

You have no gods, they have all disowned you
You have no love, so you take it out on
People's lives in progress
That's what keeps you going when you're savages

Savages, you can dress it up
Give it a name and a fancy uniform
And a flag to fly to hide behind
Can you not see the truth that's on the ground

You have no love
It has all gone cold on you
You never have, so you take it out on
Those whose love is growing
That's what you hate most, when you're savages

Do you not see the love is coming down?
