I wanna make it alright
Alright between us two
I wanna put things right on this ground
Before our time is through

I wanna be the kind
You want to come home too
I wanna be the one who gets to
Make it with you with
Try to love you better than
I ever done before

I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it alright

I wanna stand up and say
I'll always love you this way
I don't want you feeling blue
At the end of the day

Try to put some goodness back
Before this good thing goes
I wanna make it with you
I wanna make it with you

Straight back like a slave to sorrow
Soon we'll come away
Get back like a stoned tomorrow
Cutting through the day
Ah soon, let's fly away
Only to find no need
I'm getting itchy feet

I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it alright

And try to love you better than
I ever done before

I wanna make it alright
Alright between us two
I wanna put things right on this ground
Before our time is through

I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it with you
