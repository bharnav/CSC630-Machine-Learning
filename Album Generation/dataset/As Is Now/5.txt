He is not the God of creation
But he is the Lord
Of the morning light
And with his song
That floats on up
Through the daybreak
It is he that
Will stay daylong

Through the dawns early mists
That rise with the river
Through the sound of the world
Once more awake
You can feel
His presence strong
As forever as once more
The ice of night time melts

Give way the day
Give way the day
As we start again

Is he not the God of creation
Is he not the God of creation
Is he not the God of creation
