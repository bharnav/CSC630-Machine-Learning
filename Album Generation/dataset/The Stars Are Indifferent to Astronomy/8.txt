There's no snow on the mountain
There's no river to cross
We'd gone past it and we counted
Now we're drinking our dust

There's no snow on the mountain
There's no water to drink
We sat back and we just counted
We didn't think

It's crazy cause it shouldn't be that hard
To take care of everyone we don't need petty guards
The only crimes left to be ones of love
And when those eyes go dark you know it's bad enough
We signed up for extinction anyway
Threw out our thinking caps and gave our minds away

There's no snow on the mountain
There's no river to cross
We'd gone past it and we counted
Now we're drinking our dust

But how many dreams do we hold on to?
You've had so many you left with so few
But it's really all you ever did
You piled up the shares since you were a kid
So many pictures of things to do
What you were just thinking now you see right through

Baby, I've only got summer tires
But we're driving deep in your snow
Baby, I can't reach your wires
Let it go, let it go, let it go

There's no snow on the mountain
There's no water to drink
We got past it and we counted
We didn't think

Baby, I've only got summer tires
But we're driving deep in your snow
Baby, I can't redo your wires
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go

There on every broadway, the liar, the friend, the curious, the cold of heart
We did it our way, we used, we burned, we lobbed, we shipped, we scarred
There on every broadway, the liar, the friend, the curious, the cold of heart
We did it our way, we used, we burned, we lobbed, we shipped, we scarred

We chose the scepter, we played the emperor card
We chose the scepter, we played the emperor card
