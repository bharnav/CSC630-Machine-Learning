Hardcover books and silver frames
Because they're gone we drink your parents' bar
3 A.M. not many cars
We go walking down the avenue
Doing anything that makes us laugh
Do it though it's a stupid thing to do

I won't argue
Let the fight do the fighting
Let the right do the righting now
I can't have you
Even as an enemy
Not everything is allowed

You're gonna wish that it was done
You're gonna wish that you were young again
You're gonna wish that it was fun
You're gonna want to have someone again
See what lambs we have become
Flatter horizons every day

I won't argue
Let the fight do the fighting
Let the right do the righting now
I can't have you
Even as an enemy
Not everything is allowed

I won't argue
Let the fight to the fighting
Let the right do the righting now
I can't have you
Even as an enemy
Not everything is allowed

I won't argue
Let the fight do the fighting
Let the right do the righting now
I can't have you
Even as an enemy
Not everything is allowed
