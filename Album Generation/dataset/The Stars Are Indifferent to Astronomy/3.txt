The speed at which you move
It's weird how you never lose
What can I do when I'm next to you?

I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep
I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep

You gape and lose sight
Even under the northern lights
Under the midnight sun well my thoughts still run

I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep
I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep

Never felt such a pull before
I'm hypnotized I'm destabilized
I am Jules and Jim I'm me and him
I am all three I am Katharine

The speed at which you move
It's weird how you never lose
What can I do when I'm next to you?

I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep
I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep

Never felt such a pull before
I'm hypnotized I'm -
Never felt such a pull before
I'm paralyzed I'm destabilized
I am Jules and Jim I'm me and him
I am all three I am Catherine
I am all three I am Catherine
I am all three I am Catherine
