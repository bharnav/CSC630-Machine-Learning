Calm down now
Gotta trust the mind
Take as common sense
In the good of time

Can't talk much just a little bit
The truth is a tree if you start shaking it

Sometimes I ask the wrong questions
But I get the right answers
Moved to a tear by
The subway breakdancer

It's never too late for teenage dreams
It's never too late
It's never too late for teenage dreams
Teenage dreams

Wind is blowing
Did you mark that speed
In between the days
When the tremor seats

And the overstock of these easy times
Has the warnings of birds in coal mines

Sometimes I ask the wrong questions
But I get the right answers
Moved to a tear by
The subway breakdancer

It's never too late for teenage dreams

You'll get through the days when you're way too late
And the clouds lift the top off of the empire state
Even those days

You have the feeling
Someone's listening
Through everyone's overtalking
We sit we wait and we empty our plates
Let's prove that this year something's coming

Sometimes I ask the wrong questions
But I get the right answers
Moved to a tear by
The subway breakdancer

It's never too late for teenage dreams
It's never too late
It's never too late for teenage dreams
Teenage dreams

Sometimes I ask the wrong questions
But I get the right answers
Moved to a tear by
The subway breakdancer
The subway breakdancer
(teenage dreams)
The subway breakdancer
(teenage dreams)
The subway breakdancer
