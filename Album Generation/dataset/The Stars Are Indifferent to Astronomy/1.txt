Oh my my
Who's that child?
Where is he going to?
Why is he so wild?
What is he staring at?
Why is he so taken?
Seems like he's choosing to believe
Even when he's faking

It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting
It always feels like I'm waiting for something

Elusive energy
Hard to hold
I'm looking for it now and will be when I'm old
Whoever put that fist in the square must have been a good friend to the mayor
Driving by Spanish roundabout art it's gotta be who you know

It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting
It always feels like I'm waiting for something

Have I known you for ten thousand days?
Is there no other way to go?

It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting
It always feels like I'm waiting for something

This new piece I can feel it now
Well once in awhile now
It better grow

It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
It always feels like I'm waiting
It always feels like I'm waiting for something
