I'm not really here I -
I'm just looking through
I am watching your life
You're watching mine too

Can I join you for a -
Circle on the ride
They say you die of shame
Not cold in the wild

Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?

Move away from memory
Move to the core
Didn't notice anything
No frame to the door

Every birthday candle
That ever got blown out
Is one more year of someone trying
To figure it all out

Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?

But still the same
I shall turn the same way to my name

Don't say you need trouble
To run from, to run
We see lines of symmetry
Sometimes when there are none

I really like it quiet
But I really like it loud
Always changing but never changing
Never can slow down

Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Is it true? Is it done?
Is it over?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing? Are you dancing at all?

You better start dancing
Are you dancing at all?
You better start dancing
Are you dancing at all?

Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing at all?
Are you dancing at all?
