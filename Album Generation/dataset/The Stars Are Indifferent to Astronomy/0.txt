You're gonna miss the word
Everyone left the world
Take what you can carry
Find a road and follow

Of course I'm supposed to work I
Come from the hills I
Find any food I
Try to protect I

Of course I like to laugh I
Look at the sky
Look in your eye

I feel its transition
When do we get home?
I feel its transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

You're gonna miss the wood
I come from the fen I
I left the den

The wind blows no good it
Tells of a change that
Might rearrange

You can't see the ground it's
Not where it was

I feel its transition
When do we get home?
I feel its transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know

I feel its transition
When do we get home?
I feel its transition
Now to be alone
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

No one wants to live this fiction
Where didn't we go wrong?
With a clear eye but a clouded mind

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know

The stars are indifferent to astronomy
And all that we think we know
Mars will salute your autonomy
But he doesn't need to know
