[Intro]
What I am supposed to do, uh oh
When she's so damn cold, like twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a bitch
But I tell myself I can handle it

[Verse 1]
You know I don't frequent the L.B.C
'Cause I'm a bit too pale to run that scene
But the So Cal sun has grown on me
And that girl (That girl)
That girl (That girl)

Started with a bottle of cheap champagne
Now she's got me hooked on it like good cocaine
She's so numb, Miss Novocaine
That girl (That girl)
That girl (That girl)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, "No, kid, not tonight
You're not that good, and I'm not that type"
She's beautiful but she's cold as ice
And that keeps me hanging on

[Chorus]
So what I am supposed to do, uh, oh
When she's so damn cold, like twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a bitch
I tell myself I can handle it

But where am I supposed to go, uh oh
When she throws me out and it's twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a trick
But I can't lie, I'm in love with it

That girl, oh-oh
That girl, oh-oh
That girl, oh-oh
That girl, that girl

[Verse 2]
Now she won't buy my sex appeal
Just an East Coast kid with a record deal
I play her song, she plays the field
That girl (That girl)
That girl (That girl)

Left me on the street in the middle of winter
My frostbite heart says, "Try to forget her"
Miss that kiss, but I'll always remember
That girl (That girl)
That girl (That girl)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, "No, kid, not tonight
You're not that cool, and you're not my type"
She's beautiful but she's cold as ice
And I'm still hanging on

[Chorus]
So what I am supposed to do, uh, oh
When she's so damn cold, like twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a bitch
I tell myself I can handle it

But where am I supposed to go, uh oh
When she throws me out and it's twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a trick
But I can't lie, I'm in love with it

That girl, oh-oh
That girl, oh-oh
That girl, oh-oh
That girl, that girl

[Bridge]
Sit around waiting for the spark to fade
You can add another face to your pity parade
I can't believe it
I've never felt so cheated
Knock me down, it was all pretend
You set me back up just to do it again
You say love's overrated
I say it's complicated

[Chorus]
So what I am supposed to do, uh, oh
When she's so damn cold, like twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a bitch
I tell myself I can handle it

But where am I supposed to go, uh oh
When she throws me out and it's twenty below?
That girl, that girl, she's such a trick
But I can't lie, I'm in love with it

That girl, oh-oh
That girl
That girl, oh-oh
That girl, that girl
That girl
