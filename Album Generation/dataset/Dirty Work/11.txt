[Verse 1]
Not gonna miss you when you're dead and gone
Not gonna talk about you over and over and over
Not gonna file you under latest nostalgia
Or happily ever after
Not gonna listen to your played-out songs
Don't wanna think about you over and over and over
Not gonna read about the latest fads on your trendy blog
I want nothing to do with that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've made a mess of everything
(And I'm not listening)

[Chorus]
You're not a hero, you're a liar
You're not a savior, you're a vampire
Sucking the life out of all the friends you've ever known
You're just a train wreck, not a winner
Up on your soapbox, preaching down to the sinners
The saints without a cause
We're not listening
We're not listening

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start a revolution
Of convoluted disillusion
(Start a revolution)
I'll lead a war with no conclusion
And in my final hour, I'll be a confident coward

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if we stand for nothing, we'll fall for anything

[Chorus]
You're not a hero, you're a liar
You're not a savior, you're a vampire
Sucking the life out of all the friends you've ever known
You're just a train wreck, not a winner
Up on your soapbox, preaching down to the sinners
The saints without a cause
We're not listening
We're not listening

[Bridge]
Yes, this is moving in the same direction
But I'm a little too spent to care
'Cause it's a battlefield till it blows over
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
We're throwing stones though we live in glass houses
We talk shit like it's a cross to bear
You're only relevant until you get older
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, enemies closer

They're gonna miss me when I'm dead and gone
They're gonna talk about me over and over and over
They're gonna file me under latest nostalgia
Happily ever after

[Outro]
But not a hero, I'm a liar
I'm not a savior, I'm a vampire
Sucking the life out of all the friends I've ever known
We're a train wreck, not winners
On a soapbox, preaching down to the sinners
Saints without a cause
We're not listening
We're not listening
We're not listening
We're not listening
