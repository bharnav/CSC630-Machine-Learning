[Verse 1]
Oh no, look what you've done
That's me, the victim of a hit and run
Picked up and let down
You were never as you led on
You said just friends and no strings
But that leaves loose ends for old flings
Get back to old days and old flames
You never let burn out
Won't you let me know?

[Chorus]
How do I get away
When you're begging me to stay?
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary
What do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor

[Verse 2]
Did you forget what I said
Trainwreck, here we, here we go again
Derailed, did I fail to mention
I put it on the line
Whether you and me could ever be
We'll never see, no
'Cause you keep the lights off
We only do it in the dark
Won't you let me know?

[Chorus]
How do I get away
When you're begging me to stay?
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary
What do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor

[Bridge]
Are you gonna throw it all away?
(Return-turn-turn the favor)
Are we gonna do this all again?
(Ah!)
I mean it's all pretend
And the game should end
I guess nobody wins
(Won't you let me know?)

[Chorus]
How do I get away
When you're begging me to stay?
What do you need me to say?
You're anything but ordinary
What do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor

How do I get away
When you're begging me to stay?
(Are you gonna throw it all away?)
What do you need me to say
(Are we gonna do this all again?)
You're anything but ordinary
(I'm gonna throw it all away)
What do you want me to do?
I've given it all to you
I wish you would return the favor
