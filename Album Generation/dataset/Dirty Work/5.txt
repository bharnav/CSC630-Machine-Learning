[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you like me just the way I'm not (Hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Can I pick you up for
Another night on the north shore?
Do you even want to see my face again?
I'm a waste of chances
Full of bad romances
Your favorite enemy
And your most hated friend

[Pre-Chorus]
When it hurts, it hurts
You wonder if it's worth it
But when it works, it works
And when it's broke, it's perfect

[Chorus]
Woah oh!
Never seem to please you, no
Don't you ever let me go
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut
And don't you know
Nothing's gonna change us, oh
All because I like you just the way you aren't
And you like me just the way I'm not
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you like me just the way I'm not (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
You're a classic case of
Foolish, young and in love
But you don't even know what love could do to us
We are brash and reckless
Made of glass and careless
We break apart the moment we both feel too much

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when it hurts, it hurts
You wonder if it's worth it
But when it works, it works
And when it's broke, it's perfect

[Chorus]
Woah oh!
Never seem to please you, no
Don't you ever let me go
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut
And don't you know
Nothing's gonna change us, oh
All because I like you just the way you aren't
And you like me just the way I'm not
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you like me just the way I'm (Hey!)

[Bridge]
Opposites distract
We fall between the cracks
Forget about each other 'til we get each other back
Opposites distract
We fall between the cracks
Forget about each other 'til we get each other back
And opposites distract
We fall between the cracks
Forget about each other 'til we get each other back

Go!
Never seem to please you, no
Don't you ever let me go
I know your heart is shu...

[Chorus]
Woah oh!
Never seem to please you, no
Don't you ever let me go
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut
And don't you know
Nothing's gonna change us, oh
All because I like you just the way you aren't
And you like me just the way I'm not
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
