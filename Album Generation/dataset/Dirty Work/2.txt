[Verse 1]
You are a hand full of roses
Thorns and a cheap bouquet
True, I'm a walking disaster
They told you to stay away
Seems like I'm making
A deal with the devil
Who's whispering softly to me
"Are you sure that she's the one?"

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
Was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it

[Verse 2]
You are a shining example
Of why I don't sleep at all
T-t-t-too many sheep on the brain
To make sense of a late night call
Talking in circles and chasing a tale of
Love-drawn distant memory
Am I sure that she's the one?

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
Was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it
(I gotta know, was it real?)

[Bridge]
You know... There are some days when I really feel like this could work; like you and I are finally gonna get it right. Then there are days like today, when you make me wanna tear my fucking hair out

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
(I gotta know) was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it
I feel just like a bad joke
Woah, gotta know
Was it real?
Waking up from a bad dream
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it
So just forget about it
So just forget!
