[Intro]
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

[Verse 1]
She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound
She's trouble in a tank-top, pretty little time-bomb
Blowin' up - take you down
Livin' in the radio, lost in the stereo's sound

[Chorus]
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

[Verse 2]
Shake-down on a Saturday
Sit back, gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her, know she's gonna take it back somehow
Tattoos and a switch-blade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubble-gum smile
Sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial

[Chorus]
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

[Bridge]
And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

[Verse 3]
She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound

[Chorus]
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
