[Verse 1]
Shooting for the stars
Desperately reaching
For something in the dark
Pictures of memories
Buried in my heart
Lie awake and dream of
The endless possibilities
Catch my breath and go for it

[Pre-Chorus]
Take apart everything that's holding me down
Make a point to pick a new direction
To make a new connection

[Chorus]
Is this what it feels like?
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything

[Verse 2]
Bold enough to fall
Flat on my face
But I walk as they crawl
Slowing down
It's such a waste of
Time to let go
Tapping my fingers
To the rhythm of a metronome
Counting opportunities

[Pre-Chorus]
Take apart the gravity that's holding me down
Make a point to find a resolution
To be my own solution

[Chorus]
Is this what it feels like?
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything

[Bridge: Alex Gaskarth & Maja Ivarsson]
Go down, let me go
Let me go down alone
Let me go down
Just let me go down
If I'm gonna go down
Then just let me go
Let me go down
Let me go down
Just let me go
Let me go!

[Chorus]
It feels like
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything
