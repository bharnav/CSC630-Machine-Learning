[Verse 1]
They told me I was lucky
To have my chance with you
Now last year's summer romance
Is this year's winter blues
I treated you so nicely
To jewelry and champagne
But you left me empty handed
Yeah, you left me feeling played

[Chorus]
Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, you ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song, hope that you sing along
And it goes, "Merry Christmas, kiss my ass!"

[Verse 2]
They say I'm losing my mind
I thought that for a while
I tear down decorations
They remind me of your smile
I hate that mistletoe
It makes me think of our first kiss
You bit my lip, you pulled me close
And then you taught me how to quit

[Chorus]
Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, you ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song, hope that you sing along
And it goes, "Merry Christmas, kiss my ass!"

[Verse 3]
So sick of calling
You won't telephone me
No, fuck you, girl, I'm going out
I gave you my all
But our love hit a wall, now
I'm jingle belling
And everyone's yelling
We'll drink 'til the bars shut us down
Ain't that just what Christmas is all about?

[Chorus]
And I hope, hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing, (not laughing)
Don't you think it's so damn trashy
What you did this holiday? (So trashy)
I gave you my heart, (heart)
You ripped it apart
Like the wrapping paper trash (wrapping paper trash)
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along
Here it goes
"Merry Christmas, (bitch), kiss my ass."

[Outro]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass, kiss his ass, kiss your ass. Happy Hanukkah
