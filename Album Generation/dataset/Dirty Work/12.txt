[Verse 1]
I've been played a fool four, three, too many times and
When did lust for you become an organized crime?
I tried to keep you honest, babe, but I was just a pawn
You played the part so well, it hurts to know you're gone

[Chorus]
Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal

[Verse 2]
Let me count the ways; I six, seven, ate my words
Right from your silver plate, we checked in, checked out, checkmate
I couldn't keep you honest, babe
'Cause I was just a card you played
The draw so well, it hurts to know you're gone, you're gone, you're gone

[Chorus]
Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal

Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
(I couldn't keep you honest, babe)
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
('Cause I was just a pawn you played)
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
(I couldn't keep you honest, babe)
Like you planned it, you're a bandit
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal
