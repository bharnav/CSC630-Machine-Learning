[Verse 1]
Shawty said she wants to run away
Says I look like a boy she used to date (Ha!)
Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs
(I’m NOT interested, girl)

[Verse 2]
Put her tongue all up in my ear, (Gross!)
Almost made me spill my beer, (Oh Shit!)
She’s up and ready to go, but I don’t care
(Pssh, whatever!)
'Cause I’m in the zone
Turned off my phone, I've got my own agenda

[Chorus]
I feel like dancing tonight
I’m gonna party like it’s my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn’t matter where, I don’t care if people stare, (Woah!)
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight

[Verse 3]
Everybody getting kind of crunk
I think some dude just grabbed my junk, (Woah!)
Now I know how Ke$ha must be feelin’
(Like, what if we're the aliens?)
Bros try to turn me upside down
I put a keg tap to my mouth (No, wait, wait!)
But that’s okay, I’m dancin’ on the ceiling
'Cause I’ve got the groove
I’ll bust a move, just try and stop me

[Chorus]
I feel like dancing tonight
I’m gonna party like it’s my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn’t matter where, I don’t care if people stare, (Woah!)
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight

[Bridge]
Somebody call the police, (Woo-oooh!)
I think they’re coming to get me
They say: “You’ve got the right to remain on the dance floor”
So show us what you've got 'cause you know that you've got more

[Chorus]
I feel like dancing tonight
I came to party like it’s my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn’t matter where, I don’t care if people stare, (Woah!)
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
Oh, one more time!
I feel like dancing tonight
I’m gonna party like it’s my civil right
It doesn’t matter where, I don’t care if people stare, (Woah!)
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
I feel like dancing tonight
