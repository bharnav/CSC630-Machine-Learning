[Verse 1]
Paint yourself a picture, something perfectly obscure
To hide away the messes behind your manicure
And all of my obsessing to find the perfect words
Sick of second guessing, I didn't mean to make you hurt
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt hurt

[Chorus]
What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one
That's all I know, you're all I know

[Verse 2]
Break another mirror to keep away the stares
Of another guilty reflex, a reflection left in tears
And all of my obsessing, tell me what was it worth?
Guess I should have learned my lesson, I didn't mean to make you hurt
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt, hurt

[Chorus]
What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one
That's all I know, you're all I know

[Bridge]
Wake me, early I've been dreaming
Dreaming that I'm only, only good enough for me and no one else
So wake me, early I've been dreaming
Dreaming that I'm only, only good enough for me and no one else

[Chorus]
What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one
That's all I know, you're all I know
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one
That's all I know, you're all I know
