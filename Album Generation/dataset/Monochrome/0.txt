Hanging out with all these dicks
Still collecting tokens
Knock 'em back you're making no sense
You live in the moment
Wonder you're not morning sick making conversation
This dull arithmetic
All these stock exchanges

Swallowing everything
Sinker, hook, and line
Paralyzed, anesthetized
Wasted
One more time

Swarming now in duplicate
Self-esteem consultants
They are fit yet unequipped
They cannot be insulted

Swallowing everything
Sinker, hook, and line
Paralyzed, anesthetized
Wasted
One more time
