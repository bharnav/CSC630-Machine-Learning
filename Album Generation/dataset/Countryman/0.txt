[Verse]
I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
And the first to say be happy if you can
But you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
But do you mind too much if I don't understand

[Bridge]
Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
And my heart and me we'd made so many plans
But that's all over now there's nothing left to do
But do you mind too much if I don't understand

[Outro]
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
