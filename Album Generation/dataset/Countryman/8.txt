[Verse]
The sun just went behind the cloud:
There's darkness all around me now
I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
I broke her heart so many times:
Now at last I've broken mine
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in

[Chorus][x2]
What made me think that i could go on hurting her?
I should have known there had to be an end
(Had to be an end)
The fools in love are taught by faith
We never learn till it's too late
I've just destroyed the world I'm living in

[Outro]
I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
