[Intro: Toots]
Worried man
I'm a weary worried man
Hungry babies don't understand papa is a worried man

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
The place I used to draw my pay closed the door on me today
And told me just to stay away and don't come back again

[Verse 2: Toots Hibbert]
I told my Mama baby don't you cry
I'll get a job up before the day go by
I don't know where and that is why
I'm a worried man

[Chorus: Willie & Toots]
Worried man worried man
I'm a very worried man
Hungry babies don't understand
That Papa is a worried man

[Bridge: Toots]
Papa is a worried man

[Verse 3: Willie]
There is no way that I can see that I can feed my family
Cause I don't own no money tree
I don't own no land

[Verse 4: Toots]
I've got muscle and I've got brains
I don't mind the sun an' the rain
I gotta make a little change
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh

[Chorus: Willie & Toots]

[Bridge: Toots]

[Outro]
Worried man worried man
Worried man worried man
Papa is a worried man
