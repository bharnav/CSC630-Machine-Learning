[Verse]
You're wondering just what I'll do
Now that it's over and done
Well that's something to think about
And I've already begun
I suppose that I'll find a way people usually do
But it's something to think about I'll be lost without you

[Chorus]
One thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have any sweetheart you choose
Here is something to think about
I'll still be thinking of you

One thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have any sweetheart you choose
Here is something to think about
I'll still be thinking of you
