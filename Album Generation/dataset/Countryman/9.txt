[Verse 1]
You tell me today that you're leaving
But just think a while
I'm sure that you must know

[Chorus]
Today might be the day that you walk away
But you left me a long, long time ago

[Verse 2]
Today's just the day that ends it all
Except the usual memories
That always linger on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I stood with helpless hands and watched me lose your love
A little more each day then it was gone
And I kept wondering
Just how long until this day would come
Just how long could your pride keep hanging on

[Bridge]
So please don't say you're sorry
Don't say anything
Don't try to say why you must leave, just go

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You left me a long, long time ago
