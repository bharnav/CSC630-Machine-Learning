[Verse]
If you can truthfully say that
You've been true just one day
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row
And if you can look into my eyes
One time without telling lies
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Chorus]
Why do I keep loving you
After all the things you do
And just one time come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms
That will make one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

Why do I keep loving you
After all the things you do
And just one time come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms
That will make one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Outro]
One in a row, one in a row
