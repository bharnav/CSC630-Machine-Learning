The voice of loss is sighing
Through the rain
And as I turn around
Nothing is to be found
For hours now upon
This endless road
Is it taking me
Where I long to be?

Alone
Alone

A soaring hope is
Reeling in my head
I can't remember this
But it must be what I miss
Suddenly I find
I'm standing still
Staring at the ground
Waiting for your sound

Again
Again
