You thrust the knife into my side
With words you say you realize
That I came to speak of what I see
No matter what you do to me

I stand
No compromise
I feel
Prepared to die

Falling
Our lives were led astray
When we fell from grace
Calling
Your life won't be denied
When washed with blood and flames

You thrust the knife into my side
With words you say you realize

I stand
No compromise
I feel
Prepared to die

My life for yours
This raging war
As I stand in the
Midst of darkness
Screaming

Falling
Our lives were led astray
When we fell from grace
Calling
Your life won't be denied
When washed with blood and flames

My life for yours
This raging war
As I stand in the
Midst of darkness
Screaming
We know our roots
We know the truth
The strength of our foundations

I stand
No compromise
I feel
Prepared to die

Falling
Our lives were led astray
When we fell from grace
Calling
Your life won't be denied
When washed with blood and flames

Falling
Our lives were led astray
When we fell from grace
Calling
Your life won't be denied
When washed with blood and flames

My life for yours
This raging war
As I stand in the
Midst of darkness
Screaming
We know our roots
We know the truth
The strength of our foundations
