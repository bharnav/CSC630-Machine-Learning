Children carry out your voice--it really matters
Carry on about your fight and who it shattered
The bled are strewn around
And they will kick a man when he's down
Children carry out your voice it really matters

We are never right
We are forever wrong
And I believe
As you ran inside
We are good enough to be true

Children rise from this with forty words and forty fists
Carry on around their hopes before they're broken
If the people live in doubt
And scream no way out, way out, way out, way out!
Simply carry out your voice that's all that matters

We are never right
We are forever wrong
And I believe
As you ran inside
We are good enough to be true

And we don't want to know everything
We want to know one thing
Only tell us where the blood is;
We will clean it up

We are never right
We are never wrong
And I believe
As you ran inside
We are good enough to be true
