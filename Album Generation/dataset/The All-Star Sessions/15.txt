I was electrified by your eyes as they froze
Inviting me inside of your life to grow

Everlasting setting sun
You're my angel
You're the only one
No one close and nothing compares in the end
We will be together again

I'm so mesmerized by the light you expose
Igniting a fire deep inside of my soul

Everlasting setting sun
You're my angel
You're the only one
No one close and nothing compares in the end
We will be together again

Darkness shall fall with the strength of us all
Darkness shall fall
Darkness shall fall with the strength of us all
It shall fall

I raise my white flag
It's the last flag I'll ever raise
Don't stay away
Staring at you and all you are
I believe
Yeah I believe

(so much sadness what happened to happiness
So much sadness what happened to happiness
So much sadness what happened to happiness
Sadness, Sadness, NOOOO!)

Everlasting setting sun
You're my angel
You're the only one
No one close and nothing compares in the end
You're my angel
You're the only one

We will be together again
