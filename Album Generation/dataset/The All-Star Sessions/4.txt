[Verse 1]
Just when you thought it was over
The sky turned black and we all fell to Earth
Dead in our tracks
We were frozen in fact
Choking to breathe
Then came the seas
Wash away impurities
Wash away all that couldn't be

[Hook]
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near

[Verse 2]
Standing at the end of our world
Breathing in the chaos behold
None will be found
It's all toppling down
Cities will seethe
None could believe
Wash away impurities
Wash away all that couldn't be

[Hook]
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near

[Bridge]
Save me
Save me from what will
Engulf this world
Save us
Save us from the end
Save us from ourselves
Save me
Save me from what will
Engulf this world

[Refrain]
Just when you thought it was over
The sky turned black and
We all fell to Earth

[Hook/]
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near

[Outro]
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
