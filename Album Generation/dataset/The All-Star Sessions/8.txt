(Intro is snippets from news stations about the war)


Somehow, I think I'm going home
Even though my friends can't reach me
I don't know how I ended up alone
All I know is you can't save me

They only asked us to believe
They only wanted us to follow
I think, I'm old enough to see
I think, I'm going home tomorrow

I believe in
Sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand

Killers and maniacs
Dying in the desert for a rich man
Sinners and hypocrites
Gather us together for the master plan

I didn't bother with my faith
How will my family recognize it
Somehow, I think I'm goin' home
But I still can't comprehend it

I know, I don't want to die
But I know dying will not end it

I believe in
Sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand

Killers and maniacs
Dying in the desert for a rich man
Sinners and hypocrites
Gather us together for the bastards

I know the truth is all a lie
My skin is cracking on my lips
I don't pretend that I can understand
Why we are doing this

My heart has bled a thousand times
How will I live with what we've done
The only comfort is the knowledge
That I'm not the only one

Why am I here
What did I do
Why, why, why, why
Why, why, why
