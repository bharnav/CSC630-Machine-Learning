Confess Witch

I see the moon outside
With its evil grin
Watching the priest tonight
Accusing me of sin

Help me
No
You're gonna die
Help me
No
Just say goodbye

In the fire
On blackened wings I fly
In the fire
To Hell
And then I die
It's still the same
Can you tell me why
Witches then are Witches today

Confess Witch

A thousand years of pain
Between here and then
Did we all die in vain
Oh it's just insane

Help me
No
You're gonna die
Help me
No
Just say goodbye

In the fire
On blackened wings I fly
In the fire
To Hell
And then I die
Oh it's still the same
Can you tell me why
Witches then are Witches today

Die Witch
Now go to Hell

In the fire
On blackened wings I fly
In the fire
To Hell
And then I die
It's still the same
Can you tell me why
Witches then are Witches today
