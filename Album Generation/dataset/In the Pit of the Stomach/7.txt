I buried my head in the sand
There's no use in us making plans
If there's breath in my lungs
I'm keeping myself to myself
Still gathering dust on that shelf
It was breath my lungs
And there's war to be won
..
And this doesn't matter to me
As long as I know I'll still breath
If there's breath in my lungs
Then there's wars to be won
I'm buried my neck in the sand
There's no use in us making plans
If there's breath in my lungs
Been keeping myself to myself
Still gathering dust on that shelf
Because I'll still be that boy
The boy in the backseat
..
And this doesn't matter to me
As long as I know I'll still breath
If there's breath in my lungs
Are you happy?
Are you back at your home?
...
.. all I control
