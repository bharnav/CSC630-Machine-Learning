I've torn through the pages of the years I have wasted
And I've stolen all my stories, that I've copied and pasted
Is this about me now? Still about me now
I fought in an army that only fights boredom
And I've called up my allies who're only there in peacetime
Is this about me now? Still about me now
I've ignored all the warnings and the constant reminders
And I've read the instructions, well I'll never guess
Is this about me now? Still about me now

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times
Bring me back to life
Too stupid and stubborn to put up a fight

I've torn through the pages of the years I have wasted
And I've stolen all my stories and I've ran out of patience
Is this about me now? Still about me now
Give me my medicine my spoon and my bottle
And you can't blame a chancer so beat me to an anvil
So let me sleep it off, let me sleep it off

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times
Bring me back to life
Too stupid and stubborn to put up a fight

I can't resist, I'm a little out of practice
I'm carved in cement, to hold off the darkness
The thoughts to think illuminate my brain

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times
Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times

Waitin' for the fight, I'll gamble my spine
I'm ready for the fight, to toughen up my spine
