It's one for the will
I'm already laughing give me what's mine and I'll go
I've covered the course to my only funeral its back to the drawing board. And I'll run
I have soared higher than eagles
But nothing compares to the feeling of being unstable
I've climbed onto pieces of dead green
I have always clung on to the things I have closest around me
I have stumbled through the hills, and now I'm in trouble...
It's one for the will
I'm already thinking give me what's mine and I'll go
I've covered the course to my only funeral its back to the drawing board
It's one for the world
I'm already laughing now...
Through the dirt and the gravel in the ground...
In the wild and ever...
I stumble in the ashes of winter
And they'll piece us together again
They'll stammer and stumble our way
It'll always be better to go
Then always be making amends
And they'll piece us together again
They'll stammer and stumble our way
I'll always be making amends
It's one for the will
I'm already thinking give me what's mine and I'll go
I've covered the course to my only funeral its back to the drawing board
It's one for the world
I'm already laughing now...
Through the dirt and the gravel in the ground..
