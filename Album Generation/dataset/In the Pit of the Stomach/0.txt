[Chorus]
I've been walking in circles and squares and circles again
Kept chasing my tail, it would help if I knew where it ends

[Verse 1]
Life in a coma could be quite fun
And I could play architect, and nobody's son

[Refrain]
Where are we going? It's still warm outside
I'll open those curtains; straighten my spine

[Chorus]
And I've been walking in circles and squares and circles again
Kept chasing my tail, it would help if I knew where it ends

[Verse 2]
I followed that dark horse to see where he'd go
Straight through the forest and out, onto the roads

[Refrain]
And where are we going? It's still warm outside
I crept through the front door and into the night
Where are we going? It's still warm outside
I'll open those curtains; straighten my spine

[Bridge]
It's a far cry when you're always staying inside
It's a tough life when you're always staying inside

[Outro]
So why'd you stand there laughing, holding your microscope?
If you can't see there problem, then I guess there's nowhere to go
Holding your telescope
If you can't see my problem, then I don't where I'll go
Why'd you stand there laughing, holding your microscope?
If you can't see our problem, then I don't know how to cope
Why'd you stand there laughing, holding your microscope?
If you can't see the problem, then I guess there's nowhere to go
Why'd you stand there laughing, holding your telescope?
If you can't see my problem, then I guess there's nowhere to go
Why'd you stand there laughing, holding your microscope?
If you can't see our problem, then I don't know how to cope
