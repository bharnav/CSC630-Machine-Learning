[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
He died alone
He died on impact
And all this talk of death
Has really brightened up my week
And the smell of sweat
Really helps me sleep

[Verse 2]
We act alone
We act on impulse
And all this talk of death
Has really brightened up my week
And the smell of sweat
Really helps me sleep

[Bridge]
He died alone

[Outro]
We act alone
We act on impulse
We act alone
We act on impulse
We act alone
