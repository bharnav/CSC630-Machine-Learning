With her elbows on her table
And her eyes lowered in her battle
Should we carry on when you’re tired of your old thing?
The one you see every morning
And I’ll keep on yearning
You can’t work and whine
Your love is a mirror
It’s hard to remember a colder November
Sink my teeth in to frustration
If you’ve got boards why don’t you use some?
Get up early pound those pavements
You should carry on when you’re tired of your old face
The one you see every morning
And I’ll keep on yearning ‘cause I’m always right
Your love is a mirror
It’s hard to remember a colder November
It’s hard to remember a colder November
I led all my lambs, I led all my lambs to the slaughter
They were gasping for air, for life, for death, or some water
I now lead my lambs, I leave my lambs to the reaper
I’ll bait them myself of it means I’d be left with my guilt
I’ve cover my tracks well
I’m safe for just now
I’ve covered my tracks well
With attention to detail
I’m safe for just now
But there’s always some doubt
I’ve covered my tracks well
