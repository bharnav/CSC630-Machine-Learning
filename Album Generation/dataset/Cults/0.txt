[Verse 1: Madeline Follin]
I knew right then that I'd been abducted
I knew right then that he would be taking my heart
I knew right then no one was above him
I knew right then that he would be breaking my heart

[Chorus]
He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out

[Verse 2: Brian Oblivion]
I knew right then that she'd been abducted
I knew right then that I would be taking her heart
I knew right then that I'd never love her
No reasons to hope, no dream was bliss from the start

[Chorus]
He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
