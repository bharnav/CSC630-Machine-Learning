[Intro]
"But to me, death is not… death is not a fearful thing, it's living that's treacherous…"

[Verse 1]
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and make it light all day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and not care where you lay

[Bridge]
Well, I know what's good
Exactly cause I have been there before
Yeah, I know what's good
Exactly those things night cannot behold

[Verse 2]
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I think it's good to go out
'Cause if you don't you'll never make a memory that will stay
I, I think that we should break up
I think I want to live my life and you're just in my way
