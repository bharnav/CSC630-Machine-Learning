[Verse 1]
Oh my God
I'm stuck inside the same position
I'm so tired of sitting around here with my boring life
Wishing I could find another name to go by
Late at night I'm dreaming about a time
Where I could change my side

[Hook]
Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired of all these honest decisions
Oh my God
I never wanted a single thing for my life
All I wanted was to know that I have never wasted my time

[Hook]
Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming

[Bridge]
Oh my God
I'm stuck in the same ancient tradition
I'm so tired of thinking about the things that I have been missing
I never wanted a single thing for my life
All I wanted was to know that I have never wasted my time

[Hook]
Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming
