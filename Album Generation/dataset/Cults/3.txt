[Verse 1]
Up late at night all alone
Can't you see I'm trying?
Trying so hard to hold on
To the things I know

[Chorus]
But in the evening I will have to go
What I most want is bad for me I know

[Verse 2]
Out in the dark, shaking hands
In the street, I'm drifting
Drifting away from my family
Towards my foes

[Chorus]
My mother told me "you'll reap what you sow"
"What you want most is bad for you, you know"

[Verse 3]
Back in my home late at night
All alone, I'm flying
Flying above all my troubles
My mind's a gull

[Chorus]
When I am happy my heart starts to slow
What I most want is bad for me I know

[Verse 4]
Late in the morning I wake
All alone, I'm crying
Crying for all of the people
Who love me so

[Chorus]
But when we get sad we know where to go
What we most want is bad for us we know

[Outro]
"Fornication, drug use and adultery"
