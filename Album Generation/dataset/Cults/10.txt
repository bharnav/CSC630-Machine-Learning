[Verse 1]
On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok

[Chorus]
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

[Verse 2]
In a class where you got an A
Feel your lover's lips on your favorite day
In your mother's arms when you blast away
I'll pass if that's ok
On a stage where you love to play
On your knees, look for words to say
Thank God every single day
I'll pass if that's ok

[Chorus]
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

[Bridge]
On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok

[Chorus]
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on
