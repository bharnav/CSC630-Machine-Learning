When no one can be trusted
And all insanities are threatening

Trapped in this world of grey
Brutal friction that I saw everyday
Merciless like a venomous snake
Attacking all who disagree
Burned in the flame of hate
Too much wasted blood, too much wasted tears
Confrontation is a bloodshed

This is phatetic! Now I am forced to see
You are phatetic!

High on fire
Hit the enemies 'til it's done
Brothers against Brothers
They fighting like maniacs
War of principles, war of power
In this land of fears

Tons of hatred for taking the crown
The more I see, the less I want
This never ending conflict of perception

How many lives you need?
Nothing has changed... Nothing has changed
How many victims you need?
How many lives you need?
That's never enough... Never enough
I wasn't rised to shut my mouth
In the age of versus...

Tons of hatred for taking the crown
The more I see, the less I want
This never ending war... This never ending war
Tons of madness I will never forget
The more I care, the more I hate
This never ending conflict of perception

This is phatetic! I'm fucking sick of it!
