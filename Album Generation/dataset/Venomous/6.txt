Face to face, pump up your energies
Show your guts, we gotta fight back
This is our chances to revenge
Show no mercy and destroy your enemy
Pick your battles, we deserve to win
This is our war... This is our war!

Live for something or die for nothing
The time has come... This is our time to arise
Crush the enemies, one by one
Revenge doesn't matter to whom
As long as it's one of them
And raise our flag to the highest sky

We never give it... Never once thought of surrender
We never give it... Never going down without a fight

We are built to blast! Take control and exterminate
We are here to blast! Through the best or worst
Together, forever...

Show no mercy and destroy your enemy
Pick your battles, we deserve to win
This is our faith... This is our faith!

For our victory!

We conquer as one...
We are built to blast! Take control and exterminate
We are here to blast! Face to face, no turning black
We are built to blast! Through the best or worst
Together, forever, and ever...

Explode!
