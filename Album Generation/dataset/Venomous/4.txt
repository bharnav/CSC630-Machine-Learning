You're house of greed
Fake smilese surround me all day
Selfish lies you're set out to prove
Now you pretend to care
You pretend to feel what I feel
The whole things just a pack of lies
This constant bullshit overloading
Fuck your selfisness I fuck your greed!

Your time seems to be wasted
No one will trust you... No one will pick you up
Yo have no shame! You have no shame!
Anger, hatred, the more I see the more I hate
In this raging war...

You offered the truth
You're acting like I'm a dead and blind
You just care about your self
What do you expect from me?
I'm not your fucking path to chose
You can't change me, you never dare

How hard you'll try to broke my faith and seize my soul
I'll never give it, don't you ever try it
As I close my eyes, I can't see it now
There's no one will follow you down

My heart bleed a thousand times
I will not let you tak our blood
I will destroy anything you've got

Too much crap and bad drama that we see from your side
My blood, my flesh, my dignity
Give me strength to force you out

You're the house of greed, fuck you!

How hard you'll try to broke my faith and seize my soul
I'll never give it, don't you ever try it
As I close my eyes, I can't see it now
There's no one will follow you down

You're the house of greed
