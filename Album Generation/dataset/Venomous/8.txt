Wake up! Get up! We need to step up!
Your presence is required
A long hard road through millions of ingested pain
There's nothing easy to escape

Our fate's in motion...

Push that door, destroy the wall
Together we're looking for a direction
Set a fire, feel the flame of our desire

We're never desperate for guidance
Our heart screams inside with pride... It's now or never!

It's our chance to lead the way, we're all fired up, fired up...
We won't be their fucking slaves
And we have to save our selves

Our fate's in motion...

Stand on and grip to what we believe
They are to weak to tell us how to live
Their words will never hold us down
We'll kill them without a sound
Determination is the only solution
Side by side... Dare we stay until the end
Pursuing a dream of glory
And making a places in our own history

I know there's nothing perfect in this world
And our futures are still digging for the comfort zone
It's now or never!

It's our chance to lead the way, We're all fired up, fired up...
We won't be their fucking slaves
And we have to save our selves
Yeah I'm never gonna stop and we never gonna drop
Fight to see a better day... Let them know, let them know...

Only the strong... We are venomous!
