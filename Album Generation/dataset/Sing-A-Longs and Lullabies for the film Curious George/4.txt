[Verse 1]
I want to be where the talk of the town
Is about last night when the sun went down
Yeah, and the trees all dance
And the warm wind blows in that same old sound

[Pre-Chorus]
And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

[Chorus]
The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

[Verse 2]
And the trouble I find is that the trouble finds me
It's a part of my mind, it begins with a dream
And a feeling I get when I look and I see
That this world is a puzzle, I'll find all of the pieces

And put it all together and then I'll rearrange it
I'll follow it forever
Always be as strange as it seems, hmm hmm
Nobody ever told me not to try, not to try
Oh, let's try, oh, let's try

[Pre-Chorus]
And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

[Chorus]
The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm I sing oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
