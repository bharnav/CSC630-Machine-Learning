[Verse 1]
When you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

[Verse 2]
And if you are waiting, waiting for me
Know I'll be home soon darling I guarantee
I'll be home Sunday just in one week
Dry up your tears if you start to weep

[Pre-Chorus]
And sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

[Chorus]
Lullaby, I'm not nearby
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Don't you cry, no don't you cry
Sing this lullaby to yourself

[Verse 3]
'Cause when I arrive dear it won't be that long
No it won't seem like anytime that I've been gone
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last
Won't you remember these words to help the time pass?

So when you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

[Chorus]
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby, sing this lullaby
Sing this lullaby to yourself
