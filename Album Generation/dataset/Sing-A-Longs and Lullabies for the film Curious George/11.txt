[Verse 1]
Questions, I've got some questions
I want to know you
But what if I could ask you only one thing
Only this one time, what would you tell me?

Well, maybe you could give me a suggestion
So I could know you, what would you tell me?
Maybe you could tell me what to ask you
Because then I'd know you, what would you tell me?
Please tell me that there's time

[Chorus]
To make this work for all intents and purposes
And what are your intentions, will you try, will you try?

[Verse 2]
Impressions, you've made impressions
They're going nowhere
They're just going to wait here if you let them
Please don't let them, I want to know you
And if they're going to haunt me

Please collect them, please just collect them
And now I'm begging
I'm begging you to ask me just one question
One simple question
Because then you'd know me, I'll tell you that there's time

[Chorus]
To make this work for all intents and purposes
At least for my own

[Outro]
What is a heart worth if it's just left all alone?
If you leave it long enough and watch it turn into stone
Must we all always be untrue
Be untrue, be untrue, be untrue
