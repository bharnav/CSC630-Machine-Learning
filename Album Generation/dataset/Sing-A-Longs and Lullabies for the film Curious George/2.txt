[Chorus 1: Jack Johnson]
Well, I'm just people watching
The other people watching me
And we're all people watching
The other people watching we

[Chorus 2: Jack Johnson]
And we're as lonely as we wanted to be
We're all as lonely as we wanted to be
Just as lonely as we wanted to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

[Verse 1: Jack Johnson]
Well, there really ain't no use in stopping
What nobody never told me not to do
So I'll keep people watching, watching me now
Finding my way back to you

[Chorus 2: Jack Johnson]
And we're as lonely as we wanted to be
We're all as lonely as we wanted to be
Just as lonely as we wanted to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

[Verse 2: Jack Johnson]
I see so many feet going so many ways
People passing by, they got nothing to say
All on our own, just watching and confused
And nobody told me what to do
I can't stop breaking all the rules

[Chorus 1: Jack Johnson]
Now, I'm just people watching
The other people watching me
And we're all people watching
The other people watching we

[Chorus 2: Jack Johnson]
And we're as lonely as we wanted to be
We're not so lonely as we wanted to be
Am just as lonely as I wanted to be
Not so lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely lonely
