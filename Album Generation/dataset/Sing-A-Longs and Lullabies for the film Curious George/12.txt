[Verse 1]
Maybe it's up with the stars
Maybe it's under the sea
Maybe it's not very far

[Chorus]
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's trapped in a jar
Something we've already seen
Maybe it's nowhere at all

[Chorus]
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

[Bridge]
Looking forward as we rewind
Looking back is a trap sometimes
Being here is so easy to do

[Outro]
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to...
