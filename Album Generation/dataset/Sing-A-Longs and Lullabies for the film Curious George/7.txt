[Chorus]
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone

[Verse]
If you have two
Give one to your friend
If you have three
Give one to your friend and me

It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone

If you have one
Here is something you can learn
You can still share
Just by taking turns

If you've got a ball
Bounce it to the gang
If there is a new kid
Invite him out to hang

If you've got one sandwich
Cut that thing in half
If you know a secret joke
Tell it and share a laugh

If you've got one drumstick
Give one to your friend
Make one beautiful rhythm
Share a beat that never ends

And if you're feeling lonely
Share time with your mom
Share some milk and cookies
And sing the sharing song

[Chorus]
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
