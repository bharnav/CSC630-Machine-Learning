Your scream it your scream: it makes me sick, and I refuse to bow down to it
Yes, I refuse to bow down to it
Yes, I refuse

I have given up my word; have given up it all
The worst has won, just let me go
You will never know the worst, just giving up with all
My time is done, just let me go
All the days I've wasted on you
I'm moving forward
I am saved, am saved

I'll walk away, and I never plan on looking back
I'm safe, I've won, I've lived your life, and now I want mine back

Your scream it... your scream: it makes me sick
I won't back down

I have given up my word; have given up it all
The worst has won, just let me go
You will never know the worst, just giving up with all
My time is done, just let me go
All the days I've wasted on you
I'm moving forward
I am saved, am saved

Every single word you say: take them back and shove them down your throat
If you're looking for reasons to run then run back home

Is there something I can do to make me new?
Is there something, anything I can say?
Life is here to say

You told me what are we waiting for?
That you were there, and that you'd never regret
