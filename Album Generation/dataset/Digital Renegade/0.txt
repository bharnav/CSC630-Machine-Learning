Burn, every bridge, you ever built
How do you live with yourself?
X2
Burn, every bridge, you ever built
How do you live?

You look down on me
Now we're rising up, you will fall to your grave
You'll never, ever fuck with me

I can see the bitterness in your confident smile
This choice was yours, x2
And I can feel that everything, everything, is about to change

We'll tear this place to the ground
Yeah, I know you're talking of me
Right now, right now
I won't let you get away
Step up, right now

Right now
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer
And your enemies closer

We all know our future
We wage a war on fame and fortune, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh!
I can feel that everything, everything, is about to change

Burn every bridge, you ever built
How do you live with your selfish ways?
Burn every bridge, you ever built
How do you live with yourself? x2
Fuck! x3

We all know our future
We wage a war on fame and fortune
X2
