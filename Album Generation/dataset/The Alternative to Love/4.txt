Well, I'll be loyal to you in every way
There's nothing I wouldn't do or I wouldn't say
I hate to think where I'd be without you
Do you know how I feel about you?
Do you?
I didn't sign up for anything like this
I always wind up screwed without a kiss
And every single minute that goes by
I'm getting deeper in it all the time
Oh nay, hey
Okay, hey
I wouldn't have it any other way

And I promise to always love you
And never put anybody else above you
Well I'm hopelessly dedicated
And somehow it's still understated
I'm sure I was born to love you
I'm so lucky, I really don't deserve you
It was my one and only ambition
I made it my life long mission
I never thought it could be as good as this
I finally found a new sense of purpose
And every single second that goes by
I think of yet another reason why
Oh nay, hey
Okay, hey
I don't want it any other way

I never signed up for anything like this
I always wind up screwed without a kiss
And every single minute that goes by
I'm getting deeper in it all the time
Oh nay, hey
Okay, hey
I wouldn't have it any other way
I don't want it any other way
