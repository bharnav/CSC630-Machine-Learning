Maybe if I lay real still
It will go away, maybe it will
Maybe this time I won't budge
Maybe I just need a little nudge
Maybe this time I won't flinch
Maybe this time it might be a sinch
Maybe this time I won't run
Maybe I'll own up to what I've done
What have I done?
What have I done?

Maybe I'm just damaged goods
And, baby, you're a babe in the woods
And me, I'm just a little lost lamb
But you love me wherever I am
And maybe I've been caught red handed
Making off like a lucky bandit
And this wasn't how I planned it

Maybe this time I could stay
And let myself get carried away
Maybe this time it's too late
We could make a move or we could wait
Maybe she will understand
And not expect too much from one man
Maybe she can

Or maybe she can't

Maybe when I've changed my tune
I'll come out of my solitude
And start to live my life anew
And spend the rest of my days pleasing you
And on the path to righteousness
I'll swept the dust
Whatever it takes to gain your trust
I'll do what I must
I'll do what I must (I'll do what I must)
I'll do what I must (I'll do what I must)
I'll do what I must

Maybe I'm just damaged goods
And, baby, you're a babe in the woods
And me, I'm just a little lost lamb
But you love me wherever I am
And maybe I've been caught red handed
Making off like a lucky bandit
And now I walk this planet

Forever in search of, the alternative to love
Forever in search of, the alternative to love
