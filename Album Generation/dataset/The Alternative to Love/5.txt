I heard you're back on your feet
I'm really glad to hear it
You're in the driver's seat
And you can barely steer it
When you slammed on the brakes
I never thought you'd pull through
Well, if that's what it takes
Then more power to you
Here's to you

What can you show me
That I haven't already seen before
You can't really know me
When one foot's in and one foot's out the door
What can you say now
That I haven't heard a million times before
What can you play now
That'll have me in tears and screaming for more

And isn't this the life
It's everything you wanted
Forget the struggle and the strife
You got it, why not flaunt it?
Even when you were a kid
They always said you'd go far
They loved everything you did
You shined like a star
And a star is what you are

Taking your time
You won't be rushed, you'll move at your own pace
And all of the time that you were crushed
Your heart was in the right place
And when you look back on this
You'll think about what a good time it was
You make me happy
When lately it seems nothing ever does

What can you show me
That I haven't already seen before
You can't really know me
When one foot's in and one foot's out the door
What can you say now
That I haven't heard a trillion times before
What can you play now
That'll move me to tears and leave me wanting more
