Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
And everything will be okay
Oh no, not again
Why does it always happen?
It seems like every other day

You're too quiet, I'm too loud
Now we've rid a storm cloud
I'll see you on the other side
Old habits, young ways
Maybe we're just a phase
But we can say we really try

And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only see it this far
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us

All talk, no action
So what's the big attraction?
And don't tell me it's "just because"
All work, no play
Don't wanna go on this way
I wanna go back to the way it was

And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only take it this far
Well then we've got to end it before it's too late
The love that is left turns quickly to hate

Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
