Well you love me and I love you
So what's the problem?
Can't you see that I'm sinking fast
And I'm near the bottom?

Whenever you feel me slipping away
Then that's when you should hold me tight
If you sense that there's something wrong
Then why not make it right?
Make it right
Maybe we'll get it together
Maybe it will last forever

Well you can't hide what's inside
I can see right through you
And I know every reason behind
Everything that you do

Whenever you feel me slipping away
Then that's when you should hold me tight
If you sense that there's something wrong
Then why not make it right?
Make it right
Maybe we'll get back together
Maybe it we'll make it last forever
And maybe this way things are better
Things are better

Girl, you could say that I'm hard to please
And maybe it's so
But look at you, your life's a breeze
