You'll be sorry the next time you see me
You'll eat your hat, I promise you that
I'll say, "I told you so", and you'll nod your head
I'll feel so powerful when your face goes red

Because hard luck is all that I had
And I felt stuck in the mud
I was a sad and sorry case
But I turned about face and I feel great

I'm gonna run and I won't brake
For nothing, no one, just wait
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again

Where were you then, my fair weather friend
I was a mess but you couldn't care less
Now that I'm over it, no thanks to you
You'll say you're owed for it but you know that isn't true

Because hard luck is all that I had
And I felt stuck in the mud
I was a sad and sorry case
But I turned about face and I feel great

I'm gonna run and I won't brake
For nothing, no one, just wait
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again

I will forget, gonna make you regret
The day you were born, I'll leave forlorn
You beg and you pray for me to forgive
But you won't get your way as long as I live

'Cause hard luck is all that I had
And I felt stuck in the mud
I was a sad and sorry case
But I turned about face and I feel great

I'm gonna run and I won't brake
For nothing, no one, just wait
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again

'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again
'Til I feel like myself again
