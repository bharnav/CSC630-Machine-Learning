Somedays I'm content to stay at home
But other days I get restless
I can't stand to be alone
Okay, I've been known to cry in my sleep
But dreams often show what you don't want to know
When you're awake you're not so deep

Could be a bad habit I need to break
Or some kind of sentiment
That I could learn to fake
Maybe it's the devil in my ear
Averting his eyes and whispering lies
So that no one can hear
There isn't anything between us

Many times I listened to the things that people say
But many times I disagree
And I see it a different way
Could say that it looks and tastes so real
But I wouldn't mind if I went blind
Maybe then I'd learn to feel

Yes man, I'm so glad to be alive
It's a beautiful day and my girl is okay
So we go out for a drive
Yes sir, I haven't felt my right in my head
There's no getting dressed when I get depressed
I don't want to leave my bed
