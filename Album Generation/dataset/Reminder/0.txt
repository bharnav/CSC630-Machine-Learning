[Intro: NuyoRiquena]
Oh, this is our home
Home

[Jerome Chance]
We can’t do this all alone
But if you help us through, then for sure we got your back
When the Reapers come for you
Remember that bid I did for you on the side?
Well now I’m caching favours, need your help, time to ride
Please don’t hold against me my infractions or my errors
All I hope is for reactions from my path to be a Paragon
Fallacies gleaned from the absence of morality
Haven’t we seen that the lack of solidarity
Glaringly sees to the focus in the hopelessness
Notice it’s massively effecting us drastically
And we gon' get wrecked if we proceed passively
But now our time is here
Shepard in your next of kin and set aside your fears
I know we can’t please everyone, but still need your support
So set aside your differences and help us hold the fort

[Hook: NuyoRiquena]
Oh, this is our home
And we will defend her to the end
Oh, this is our home
United we can’t be overthrown

[Nerdsworth]
I can’t forget the day the sky opened, I hesitated
As nothing but a man, but left a Husk, indoctrinated
Horizons burn, it’s like a dream, I wanna be sedated
Expose the threat, don’t miss a step, protect, we must erase it
This could be where lives end, enemies convert to friends
United grand stand, no master plan
Bangarang through hope we band
U.S., Britain, Japan
India, Sudan, Iran
Synthetic sin of purge began to end our span, the fall of man
An apocalypse it calls for a hero, artifacts and Element Zero
Massively effective prospect eso
Teric tact much like first contact
Biotic Vanguards move by EEZO
Offensive, defend all our people
We bleed the creed of human beings
We fight so kids can see tomorrow
E Pluribus Unum, in Shepard we trust
Humanity’s nightmare the dirge, Cerberus
Seasons do not fear the Reaper and neither will we
We’ll go down kicking, screaming, biting and refuse to retreat

[Hook]

[Outro: Jerome Chance]
You don't let no one just roll up in your
You don't let no on drop bombs up in your

[Nerdsworth]
And I'll never abandon the place that I call
This is where my heart is and I am
