[Verse 1]
Saw her walking into the bar
And then we locked eyes from afar
With her Thigh highs on and her little Corset
She was on me faster than Tony Dorsett

No interest in what you wear
I want to stare into your eyes while Im messing up your hair
Wrapped up in little buns like princess Leia
Like in the lair of Jabba the hut

This girl’s prepared for the job of a slut
Ah Always had a good conscience
8 days ago this would have been nonsense
Im bout to tap that ass

You bout to catch me ATLUS unless my conscience acts fast
She Fell into my lap completely unprovoked
Yeah she even liked that I smoked
She called it love at first sight yeah but only for tonight

Ass in the air mushed the pillow to her face
Told me to continue theres no time to waste
And when we’re done hook you up with my friend
An alibi, to hide my sins

Uh she's gonna kill me
Doesn’t matter who, either K or C

Im no Shaggy, No Mr lover lover
All the time with you, Im thinking of her
But now its over cause when she finds out
We are through man I know her

[Bridge]
Vinny wake up man move stupid climb
Yo ass is gone drop you don’t make it in time
If you die in yo dreams you gone die in real life
That’s what yo ass get for living life trife

That’s right it may be a dream still
Better get  to the top fore you run out of steam
Man wake up or the blocks will collapse
Push pull shove just watch out for traps

And other sheep too but its you or them
Let em know the ledge like Eric B and Rakim
Whack a flock of sheep and send them off bleating
Or land hard in the paint of your own blood bleeding

Vinny wake UP can't run from your fears
But I can't blame you just don’t let them get near
Don’t Get forked or fisted by babies with rabies
Dude wake up man your bed got scabies

Psyche Im just faking but you if you gonna stay asleep
Talk to other sheep and use their technics
You ain't here to set records you need to beat feet
Like a fiend for a crack rock stack blocks neat

Cause if you stack sloppily theres no more go
Like using half the board in a game of monopoly
Vinny Wake UP somethings wrong with your hearing
You’d probably move faster with a bottle of Kirin

Adapt and overcome or get a four leaf clover
Next time don’t let no crazy broads come over

[Verse 2]
The air around you is like beautiful music
Whoa why in the hell did I abuse it
You didn’t need a doctor or actor
You just didn't want a slacker

A man is but a child of a larger growth
You had to be adult for you and I both


I know I,  I should have always been honest
I shaped your reactions I should have been on it
That’s what she said and now its all gone its
Aww, should have passed along
I lost for a buck what I got from a fawn

I don’t sleep around I want things to stay the same
I Should have just married you given you my name
Its like Im on Elm street
With nightmares every time I go to sleep

Fidelity was sure from me
But your guess was truer than my certainty

I can explain why my phone has all these messages
The texting sexting please forgive me cause I guess I just
Oh now I understand
This was on the jukebox that’s why you're not a fan


You don’t know this womans worth you'll have to face the womans wrath
If you don’t always put her first she’ll take your Heartache to the max

Well last I ever checked
I never meant to do you wrong I never meant to make a wreck
Out of what we had
I brought a cancer to our life like that dude from breaking bad

Yeah the big C
But Katherine with a K you complete me
