[Verse 1]
I wanna be your Hollywood
I could be your movie star
You misunderstood
Who you really think you are
I want to be your dollar bills
I could be your shopping mall
I’ll be your diet pills
I won’t stand to watch you fall

[Hook]
Resign
Resign those wandering eyes
And wake up to my love tonight

[Verse 2]
Don’t wanna be your plastic doll
I feel like I caught up in a race
You can’t break the fall
I won’t let you go to waste
You want to be designer clothes
It’s a vain conspiracy
Your routine overdose
Doesn’t mean a thing to me

[Hook]
Resign
Resign those wandering eyes
And wake up to my love
Resign
(Won’t she resign?)
Resign those wandering eyes
And wake up to my love tonight
Resign
(Won’t you resign?)
Resign those wandering eyes
(Won’t you resign?)
And wake up to my love
Resign
(Won’t you resign?)
Resign those wandering eyes
(Won’t you resign?)
And wake up to my love
Resign
(Won’t you resign?)
Resign those wandering eyes
(Won’t you resign?)
And wake up to my love tonight
