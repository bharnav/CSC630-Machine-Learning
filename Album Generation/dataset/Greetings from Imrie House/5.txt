[Verse 1]
When I saw her, she looked my way
And I knew that I was over my head
Ruby lips on a smile so sweet
With a rude attitude that could knock me dead (suddenly)
I heard a voice when she called my name (suddenly)
I knew my life was gonna change

[Chorus]
Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Yeah you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me

[Verse 2]
All my friends say you lucky guy
Everyone wants to stand in your place
And so I give it another try
I'm not sure how much more my poor heart can take (suddenly)
I feel the blood pumpin' round my brain (suddenly)
I grab my bat and I'm back in the game

[Chorus]
Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Yeah you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me

[Verse 3]
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to say
'Cause no one knows what she puts me through anyway
I don't know where's the master
I don't know who's the corner
The reason why and I try but I can't get a-
Someone's in all the faster
Someone all of the first
And the reason why and I try but I can't get a-
I awake in disaster
I can't seem to get past her
The reason why and I try but I can't get away
No, I can't get away
Oh, and I can't get away, yeah

[Chorus]
She's an angel to you
She's a devil to me
She's an angel to you
She's a devil to me
It's not easy to see

Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Yeah you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see

[Chorus]
Well she's hotter than hell
And she's cool as they come
And she's smart and she's wild
All rolled into one
Yeah you say I'm the guy that you wish you could be
It's not easy to see
That she's an angel to you
But she's a devil to me
But she's a devil to me
But she's a devil to me
But she's a devil to me
