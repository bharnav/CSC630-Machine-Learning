[Verse 1]
You told me you love me
So I don't understand
Why promises are snapped in two
And words are made to burn
The bigger the better
Some stolen from Japan
Collected from around the world
They'll catch you if they can

[Hook]
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Do I have to catch you out
To know what's on your mind?
Well, Cleopatra died for Egypt
What a waste of time
The white ones, the red ones
And some you can't disguise
A twisted twos that have the news
Can't hide it in your eyes

[Hook]
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah

[Bridge]
Oh you know I know
You say you'll try harder
But I think it's just too late
Well, the car is reeving in the drive
And I'm not the sort to wait
The bigger, the better
So make them all Saigon
Collected from around the world
Love lies on and on and on and on and on

[Hook]
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
(They're gonna get you)
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
(They won't forget you)
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
(Oh they're gonna get you)
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Oh you know I know
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
Lies, lies, lies
Yeah
