[Verse 1]
You and I
We never had it easy, baby
We had to work so hard
And everytime it feels like we're gonna make it
That's when it falls apart, but

[Hook]
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you

[Verse 2]
Every night I think about the mistakes I've made
I try to change my ways (Nothing's gonna change my ways)
And I don't mind all the little games we play
And all the foolish things you say, 'cause

[Hook]
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you

[Verse 3]
Love's what you make it
So give it one more try
'Cause I get so down when you're not around (It's easy)
I just can't change it, oh
You and I
We never had it easy baby
We've both been hurt before
(Both been hurt before)
And only time will tell us if we're gonna make it
There's no way to be sure, but

[Hook]
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you
You know it's true
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Oooooooohoo
Baby I'll take my chances
I'll take my chances
With you
