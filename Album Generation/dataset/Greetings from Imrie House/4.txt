[Verse 1]
Manic Mondays singing you to sleep
You could use some time to breathe
Wake up please
A lonely weekend isn't what you need
You won't feel so guilty cause you love the crime on

[Chorus]
Friday night
Baby, are you sleeping?
Friday night
My heart is still beating
It's alright
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

[Verse 2]
Wearing night clothes never felt so cold
Wish we were a little older
Restless souls
I can't hold this ladder for too long
Won't you open up your window?
Come outside on

[Chorus 2]
Friday night
Baby, are you sleeping?
Friday night
My heart is still beating
It's alright
Curfew's gunna break my heart
So come and meet me in the dark
Friday night
You're under the covers
Friday night
We could be lovers
It's alright
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

[Bridge]
Baby it's no surprise
The price is right
I'm bob barker
Hold on to the prize
'Cause it's Friday night, Friday night come alive

[Chorus 2]
Friday night
Baby, are you sleeping?
Friday night
My heart is still beating
It's alright
Curfew's gunna break my heart
So come and meet me in the dark
Friday night
You're under the covers
Friday night
We could be lovers
It's alright
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

[Outro]
Yeah
Come alive, come alive on Friday night
Oh
Come alive, come alive
