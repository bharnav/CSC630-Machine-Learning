[Verse 1]
I woke up early in my hotel room
Wait for my alarm to go
I think about the things I’ve got to do
Damn my mind is going to blow

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m freaking out about what’s ahead
Maybe I’ll just stay in bed
Cause it’s no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

[Chorus]
You’re looking for something you can find
If you give it up you’ll lose your mind
There’s always something in your way
But what can you say
You’re gonna have a good day

[Verse 2]
I quit my job about a week ago
Told them that I need some time
Now I’m going strong
I’ll make it through
Doctor says I’m doing fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m freaking out about what’s ahead
Maybe I’ll just stay in bed
Cause it’s no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself again

[Chorus]
You’re looking for something you can find
If you give it up you’ll lose your mind
There’s always something in your way
But what can you say
You’re gonna have a good day

[Verse 3]
Just when I thought I couldn’t lose
I realized it’s the only thing I knew
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m freaking out about what’s ahead
Maybe I’ll just stay in bed
Cause it’s no fun to be the one
Going out of my head
So I tell it to myself
Tell it to myself
Tell it to myself again

[Bridge]
You’re looking for something you can find
If you give it up you’ll lose your mind
There’s always something in the way
You’re looking for something you can find
If you give it up you’ll lose your mind
There’s always something in your way
But what can you say

[Chorus]
You’re looking for something you can find
If you give it up you’ll lose your mind
There’s always something in your way
But what can you say
You’re gonna have a good day
You’re gonna have a good day
You’re gonna have a good day
