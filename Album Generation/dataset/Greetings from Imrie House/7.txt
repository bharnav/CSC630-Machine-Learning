[Verse 1]
I lost myself at your show last night
Looking at the sparkling eyes
In the middle of a fresher crowd
You keep living like you're a movie star
But tell me who you really are when the lights go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're a glitter doll (on the radio)
I dissolve (in the stereo)
You've got me, you've got me coming back for more

[Chorus]
Pop princess, hold my hand
Pop princess, I'm a fan
Pop princess, I need you now
Freak me out, turn me inside-out
Pop princess, make me smile
Pop princess, drive me wild
Pop princess, I need you now
So baby, turn your love up loud

[Verse 2]
You were hiding in a darkened stall
Waiting on your curtain call
Getting your piece of mind
But I was looking past the glossy stare
I knew who was really there
And I'd like to spend some time

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're a glitter doll (on the radio)
I dissolve (in the stereo)
You've got me, you've got me coming back for more

[Chorus]
Pop princess, hold my hand
Pop princess, I'm a fan
Pop princess, I need you now
Freak me out, turn me inside-out
Pop princess, make me smile
Pop princess, drive me wild
Pop princess, I need you now
So baby, turn your love up

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I think you're radical
But you're a star and I'm fanatical
Can we start something new
Just between me and you?

[Chorus]
Pop princess, hold my hand
Pop princess, I'm a fan
Pop princess, I need you now
Freak me out, turn me inside-out
Pop princess, make me smile
Pop princess, drive me wild
Pop princess, I need you now
So baby, turn your love up loud

[Outro]
(Pop princess, pop princess) Baby, turn your love up loud
(Pop princess, pop princess) Baby, turn your love up loud
(Pop princess, pop princess) Baby, turn your love up loud
(Pop princess, pop princess) Baby, turn your love up loud
