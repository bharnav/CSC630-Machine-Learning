[Verse 1]
Our separation has its faults
But I don't wanna leave it all
So write the letters in teary ink
I just need some time to think
And I just need some time to breathe

[Chorus]
Baby, just say goodnight
I'll be gone tomorrow
Baby, just close your eyes
I can't take the sorrow
Baby, just walk away
You know I can't stay
There's no easy way to say goodbye
So baby, just say goodnight

[Verse 2]
We're in a spell that never ends
The empty hourglass wore me thin
So let the phone do its work
Your voice is heaven
But it hurts
Your words are memories
But they burn

[Chorus]
Baby, just say goodnight
I'll be gone tomorrow
Baby, just close your eyes
I can't take the sorrow
Baby, just walk away
You know I can't stay
There's no easy way to say goodbye
So baby, just say goodnight
Baby, don't say goodbye
Baby, just close your eyes
And dream
Tomorrow's on its way
So just walk away
Baby, just say goodnight
I'll be gone tomorrow
Baby, just close your eyes
I can't take the sorrow
Baby, just walk away
You know I can't stay
There's no easy way to say goodbye
So baby, just say goodnight
Baby, just say goodnight
Baby, just say goodnight
