[Verse 1]
Oh what mess
You’ve got the best of my heart
It broke and now it’s just a joke
Cause you’re moving right along
I’m still here and you’re gone
Oh what shame
You know I didn’t mean for the winds to change
Won’t ever be the same
Cause the kisses that you blew
Could never ever move

[Chorus]
I think I need some time by myself
Without anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
I need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
I just need to unwind
In my time machine

[Verse 2]
Hey you
Yeah, I’m talking to you
You lost the love in bed
And now it’s just dead
‘Cause it didn’t mean a thing
Waiting for a ring
Hey it’s a game
And isn’t it a shame that it’s just a show
I thought that this was love
But I can’t be fooled again
I’m crying out
But I can’t give in

[Chorus]
I think you need some time by yourself
Without anybody else
You just need to unwind
In your time machine
You need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
You just need to unwind
In your time machine

[Bridge]
All the things that we could change
(Things that we could change)
Now we’ll never be the same

[Chorus]
I think I need some time by myself
Without anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
I need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
By myself
I don’t need anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
In my time machine
