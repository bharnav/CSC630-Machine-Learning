And even when you show me your teeth, dear
Like any animal in the world
Or running on your very own feet now
Ever since you knew that you could

And you could, you could, you could, you could

And breathing through a polymer filter
It never seem to do you no good
'Cause even with the filters they kill you
Kill you, huh baby? So mature

In the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar
In the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar
In the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar
In the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar, in the sharp briar
