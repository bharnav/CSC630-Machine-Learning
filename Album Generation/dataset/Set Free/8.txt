There's something in the arm of your record player
That's giving me the chills what you're giving him away for
Staring at your hands, Carie-Anne you wait for
Save it for your man, you get what you pay for

'Cause the first to fake is last in line, the first to fake is last in line
The first to fake is last in line, the first of four

There's something in the arm of your record player
That's giving me the chills what you're giving him away for

'Cause the first to fake is last in line, the first to fake is last in line
The first to fake is last in line, the first of four
The first of four, the first of four, the first of four
