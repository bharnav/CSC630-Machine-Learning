It hurts where you rule me, girl you've to only whisper to me
"In this whole world the beat in my heart is your feet when you're walking"
But he's always waiting, so we never argue, no never, do we?
'Cause maybe you want him like you want me only truly

I'll make it easy either you want him or you want me
Oh leave me, believe me, Holly and Roger, Markus and Julie
It's love in the movies seeing what you see quiet and ruly
But it hurts where you rule me and the whole world can see through me

And you want him, and you want him
And you want him, and you want him
