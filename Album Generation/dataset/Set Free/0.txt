[Verse 1: Andrew Kenny]
So you're born on the cusp
Or it's a run of bad luck
But it's bigger than us
It's bigger than love

And it's underhanded
You never feel it
You never look back (x2)

[Verse 2]
What's in the cart?
A CD-R
You never look back (x2)

And it's bigger than us
It's bigger than love
Oh it must be I know
Cause it always wins
And it always wins
It always wins (x3)
