And you don't know what you're doing
When you turn and act tough
You don't know what it's like to be me when your eyes light up
And you don't know what you're doing
You can only play hurt so much
When you're calling me all about him and I can't hang up

And you don't know what you're doing
'Cause he can't be enough
But I could even believe that he loves you like me 'cause
It's hard when your heart's all cracked up

Oh for you, oh for you, no, don't know, don't know for you

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-oooh... Oh-oooh
