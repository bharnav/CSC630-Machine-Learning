Hands where you wanna go
Study at the dock where the schoolgirls flirt
Not sure what you're losing, though
Right through the crest on the breast of your school shirt

And now that you wanna know
Why it hurts worse than it did first hurt
'Cause it never lets you go
It's through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
