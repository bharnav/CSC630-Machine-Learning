Do what your dad don't say you should
Do what good girls don't do good

Say you're aching, please don't stop
'Cause leaving it out break your heart

Play your neighbour, play your part
Saved on paper, it makes for art

Do what your dad don't say you should
Do what good girls don't do good
Do what your dad don't say you should
Do what good girls don't do good
