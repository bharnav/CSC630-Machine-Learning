The cooler kids will keep together
The quiet ones are sure to never
The cooler kids will keep together
The cooler kids will argue whether
Money matters 'cause we're friends forever
The cooler kids keep together
The cooler kids keep together

The boys are in a band together
The girls will fucking stand together
The cooler kids will keep together
The cooler kids will kick the leather
The cooler kids will kick the teather
The cooler kids will keep together
Cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
The cooler kids will live forever
