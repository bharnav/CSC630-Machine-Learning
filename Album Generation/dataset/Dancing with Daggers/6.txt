I'm sorry that I lied
I always thought I could run and hide
Always thought if you learn to fall in love my dear
I could learn to be sincere
And I could learn to stay put here

We're all addicted to pain and fame
We walk and we search for space and gain
And I told them I could do it all, my dear, without luck
Cause this ambition made me tough
Crazy always being tough

I'm sorry that I lied
I always thought I could run and hide
Always thought if you learn to fall in love my dear
I could learn to stay right here
But I don't want to stay right here
So come with me

La da da
La da da da da
