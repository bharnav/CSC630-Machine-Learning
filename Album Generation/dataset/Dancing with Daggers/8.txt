What did you do?
I fought myself
Just like us all
Under the spell
But knowing my face
Kept me in place
My temper embraced
I'm feeling ready for change
I had to change my childish ways
Cause those surprises
Will make them selves up
What did I gain? what did I gain?

I see new plans my love
My guilty heart and guilty smile
Loved dancing in the dark
So please don't you
Comme back tomorrow
The beauty I got doesn't change
Now I need sometime to figure out
Just how much
I've rearranged

What did you find?
What did I find?
Pieces of gold came
With pieces of ice
Where are my clues
Now I'm defined now I'm defined I'm...
Fine, a handle on things
It suddenly hits
You're pulling on strings
The seasons they'll change
Someone rethinks, praticing words
Accepting the stings...

I see new plans my love
My guilty heart and guilty smile
Loved dancing in the dark
So please don't you
Comme back tomorrow
The beauty I got doesn't change
Now I need sometime to figure out
Just how much
I've rearranged

I see new plans my love
My guilty heart and guilty smile
Loved dancing in the dark
So please don't you
Comme back tomorrow
The beauty I got doesn't change
Now I need sometime to figure out
Just how much
I've rearranged

Oooh oooh oooh
