Kill the plaintiff's marching band
Has conjured up the devil's hand
The parade is now a masacre
Of fools and jugglers
And constant lovers...

Don't you believe in what you see
Don't you believe in me he...

He followed me
He is the end of the world
Don't you know him by name?

The defendant appeared a hunted witch
Thrown by the oracle over a bridge
Pride yourself in love you lost
Pride is better
Don't get caught...

Don't you believe in what you see
Don't you believe in me he...

He followed me
He is the end of the world
Don't you know him by name?
Yeah

Burn!
