You came way to soon
That ego confused your girl
She thought she had the best of you

Look I've never broken plates
Always cared that they
Never treated life like a damn game
So this haunts me haunts me haunts me haunts me

Never understood
Why I was always good
People rearrange, switch and turn their place
Everybody falls now darling
But I'll stay the same for you

Hey

My voice is complaint
I'm safer I've been protecting myself
From the one who crawls

Look I've never broken plates
Always cared that they
Never treated life like a damn game
So this haunts me haunts me haunts me haunts me

Never understood
Why I was always good
People rearrange, switch and turn their place
Everyone falls now darling
But i'll stay the same for you

And I never understood
Hey why I was always good
People rearrange, switch and turn their place
Everybody falls now darling
But I'll stay the same for you

Hey
