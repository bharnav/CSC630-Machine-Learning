She's got questions to ask
So many questions to ask
She doesn't want to compromise
What she's felling now
She's got whispers to fight
Broken bones there tonight
Will you forgive me if fate changes my fickle mind

Tell me how will we know
Though our hearts made a go
Promises don't guarantee
Our future actions in this place
Secrets aren't so bad
We're too young to feel safe
I don't deserve all this now
Don't want to feel I've made mistakes

I want to tell you everything
I want to tell you everything
But if I tell you everything
What we can build won't mean a thing
So please don't tell me everything
So won't have to tell you everything
And in a way I won't have to feel so bad

Da da da da da da da da da da da da
La da da da da

Tell me how will we know
Though our hearts made a go
Promise don't guarantee
My future actions in this place
Secrets aren't so bad
I'm too young to feel safe
I don't deserve all this now
Don't want to feel I've stole my place

I want to tell you everything
I want to tell you everything
But if I tell you everything
What I can build won't mean a thing
So please don't tell me everything
So won't have to tell you everything
And in a way I won't have to feel so bad

Da da da da da da da da da da da da
La da da da da
Hey!
