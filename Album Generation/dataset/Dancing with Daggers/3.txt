All your years of treasure
Hunting for thruth and love
Are stealing all your youth 22
22 is when you said you would improve
But you all had to loose
Cause you already used 22
22 is when they said
They would improve...

You keep scratching yourself
With the roses that he left on your bed
Don't forget they won't make you pretty
Imprints on your pillow case of history
Branded on that face
Your not suppose to be touchin
All them strangers my love

Don't you feel betrayed?
You thought you had it made
You shined once in the sun
Now your days as the pearl are done
22 22, is when you said
You would improve
Haven't they told you my love
Youre six years past due?

Ladadadada...
