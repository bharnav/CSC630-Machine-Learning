Change
Always is so nice
Didn't even notice
Just as long as I was right

Hearts
Though they sometimes care
Our minds remain the rebels
And the dream was never there

Save myself again
Save myself again
Oh I save myself again
Oh yes I save myself again
Yah

Time
Handles everything
Waiting is a talent
At the end it all begins

Our hearts
Though they sometimes care
My mind remained the rebel
And the love was never there

Save myself again
Save myself again
Oh I save myself again
Oh yes I save myself again
Save myself again
Oh I save myself again
Oh yes I save myself again
Yes I save myself again
