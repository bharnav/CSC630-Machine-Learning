[Verse 1]
A baby moonlight hits the spotlight
I'm on my flight to take you away
I'm feeling so free
You're making me crazy
That's what you do, that's what you do
Let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit
As she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Verse 2]
Like the first kiss with a sweet list
Of some love songs, oh yeah
(So sexy, life is sassy, sassy, sassy)
And with this melody falling over me
It makes me weak, so damn weak
So, let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit
As she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Interlude]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la
(Oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la
So, let's go now

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Outro]
(Whiplash....)
