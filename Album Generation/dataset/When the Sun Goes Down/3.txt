[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Is it alright if I'm with you for the night?
Hope you don't mind if you stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chorus: Selena Gomez + Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
It's all a blur
It's getting late, but I donâ€™t care
I don't know where we'll end up and that's okay

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chorus: Selena Gomez + Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)

[Bridge: Selena Gomez + Pixie Lott]
Nothing lasts forever
Let's live it up when we're together
Nothing lasts forever
So let's live it up, just do whatever
(Do whatever, do whatever, do whatever)

[Breakdown: Selena Gomez + Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night!

[Chorus: Selena Gomez + Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh...)
