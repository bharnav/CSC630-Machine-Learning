[Verse 1]
Been a long day
Waitin' for the night to come
I check my iPhone
Let me see what's going on, going on, going on
Help me, DJ
Play my favorite song
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now, everybody wants to sing along, sing along

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is having a good time
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say...

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pushing my hands up
I'm feeling good now
On the dance floor
We can turn it inside out, inside out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is having a good time with my friends
That's real
You can always hear us say...

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Down, down, down
The sun is going down, down, down
When the moon appears, you can always here us say
When the stars come out, you can always here us say...

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
When the sun goes down (Ho!)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
(When the sun goes down)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
When the sun goes down (Ho!)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
