[Verse 1]
You left me spinning like a disco
Trying, but I don't know if I can stand straight
You took me left when you knew I was right
And now I got to fight just to make it through the day

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up, baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 2]
You left me broken like a record, baby
I'm, baby, I'm hurt and I don't want to play anymore
Missed every sign, believed every lie
Whoa whoa
And I was waiting for more

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up, baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Bridge]
You took my heart off my sleeve
But now I'm taking it back, back
Baby, here I come
You took advantage of me
I don't appreciate that, that
You son of a gun

[Breakdown]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
