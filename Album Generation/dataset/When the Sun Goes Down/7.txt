[Verse 1]
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'Cause you're never gonna take me there

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors, but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

[Bridge]
Oh, I could live without you
Your smile, your eyes, the way you make me feel inside
I could live without you
But I don't wanna, I don't wanna, oh
Oh, you make me so upset sometimes
(Here's my dilemma, oh oh)

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head (can't get you outta my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

[Outro]
(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you
My-my-my dilemma
