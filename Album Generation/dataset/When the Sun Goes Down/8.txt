[Verse 1]
When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed and I've got the upper hand
You come running, I've got you eating out of my hand

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

[Verse 2]
When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I talked to you, you were never listening
But tables turn and it's great to be on top
Got you trained to appreciate the good that you've got

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

[Bridge]
I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere
And I want diamonds
I'm ready for my massage right now
Oh, right now

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)
