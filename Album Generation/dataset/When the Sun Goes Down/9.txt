[Verse 1]
You've been riding this horse a long time
Why can't you find what you've been looking for?
Always greener on the other side
Always believing there must be something more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
In your rear-view mirror

[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Verse 2]
Your reputation's getting out of control
I can't believe she believes one word you said
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
I've got to warn her about the price on your head

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
But you get nowhere

[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Bridge]
I'm from the Lone Star State
I'm ready to bring you in, oh
I'm going to seal your fate
Make you pay for all of your sins
Oh, oh oh
You've been riding this horse a long time
I've had my eye on you all night
I'm going to find a way to make you mind
I know, even though

[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Outro]
Stop running
