When I heard you, I could have sworn a dog was panting
When I heard you, I could have sworn a dog was panting
Down at the bottom of the stairs

You said there's something that I need to tell you
Something that I need to tell you
When I first found you in this gift shop garbage can
I never thought you would be here this long
I never thought

We would hack into the dried spilt milk in our living room
And form a little cavern, form a little yellow cavern
And watch it weaken and collapse
While all along we could have just simmered it in a sauce pan
So that we could push the skin of our words
Yes we would paw at them like some sleeping thing

The last I heard, the last I heard on the corner
The last I heard, the last I heard I was yelling, "Be three years old I dare you."
To call out this balled up gray garment for what it is
And shout out all the names that we know
And hope that one of them lands correctly

When I heard you, I could have sworn a dog was panting
When I heard you, I could have sworn a dog was panting
But there was almost no one there

You said, "There's something that I need to tell you
Something that I need to tell you
I'm not sure if I ever really ever cared and
That I never should have been here this long
I never should have."

All our kissing resembled eating horses in the biggest rooms in the smallest houses
And on and on and on and on
All our kissing resembled eating horses in the biggest rooms in the smallest houses
All our kissing resembled eating horses in the biggest rooms in the smallest houses
All our kissing resembled eating horses in the biggest rooms in the smallest houses
On and on and on and on

Be three years old I dare you
To call out this balled up gray garment for what it is
And shout out all the names that we know
And hope that one of them lands correctly
