When the fever passes at the bottom of the cotton
In the background in the background of the flood
Dry among the
Dry among the wet and the rotten

When the fever passes next to the brimming well
The worst is more than over and anyone can tell
When the fever passes and we're all back in our nests
We'll be extravagant hosts instead of imposing guests

And all that you know of this is what you have heard
I'm not sure even the best of us
I'm not sure even the best of us
And all that you know of this is what you have heard
I'm not sure even the best of us
I'm not sure even the best of us
Can care all the time

When the fever passes when we don't know what to do
We'll buy twice as many comforts just like we used to do
When the fever passes, oh when the fever clears
Oh, we'll look back on these quietly like they're someone else's years

When the fever passes at the bottom of the cotton
In the background in the background of the flood
Dry among the
Dry among the wet and the rotten

When the fever passes next to the brimming well
The worst is more than over and anyone can tell
When the fever passes and we're all back in our nests
Oh, we'll be extravagant hosts instead of imposing guests

And all that you know of this is what you have heard
I'm not sure even the best of us
I'm not sure even the best of us
And all that you know of this is what you have heard
I'm not sure even the best of us
I'm not sure even the best of us
Can care all the time
