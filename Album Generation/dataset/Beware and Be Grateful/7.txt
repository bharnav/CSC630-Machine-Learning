If I said that we were bugs would you say I was taking the easy way out
If I promised that we weren't would you continue to scream and shout

Tell me what does it matter to you
The feeling and the meaning the feeling
And the meaning and the meaning and the feeling
And the feeling and the meaning of right now

Scratching at newer enamel in the season of bait waiting actually all the time for an older even more important accidental way of telling what is yours from mine
If I'm not mistaken you were mentioning a taste for an enterprising type of climb let me show you over here to the new enamel
Waiting actually all the time
