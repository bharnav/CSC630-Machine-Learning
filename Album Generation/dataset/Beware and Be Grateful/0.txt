The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in
The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in

I've got a drawer full of your notes
And word games that we played on planes
And five pages at least of you practicing signing your
First with my last name

Somewhere there's an orange on the table
Somewhere there's a robe on the floor
And our writing on the wall is under three coats of paint
In an apartment we don't live in anymore

The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in
The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in

Laying eggs or even birth at all
A shoebox full of photographs from before the fall
Your dirty feet laid bricks below my hands

Somewhere there's an orange on the table
Somewhere there's a robe on the floor
And our writing on the wall is under three coats of paint
In an apartment we don't live in anymore

The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in
The further from the edges, the further from the trim
The fewer the coats the less you put in

I want to say you belong here
I want to pretend that we both belong
But tell me how you thought that they would react
To your parrot-colored song

When you are old & gray
When you are old & gray
I hope that someone holds you
I hope that someone holds you
The way that I would

When you are old & gray
When you are old & gray
I hope that someone holds you
I hope that someone holds you
The way that I would
The way that I would
