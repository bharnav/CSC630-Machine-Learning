We've been rubbing glossy arrow bows with no luck
You're here and they wouldn't even think to look
You are all dried wood
You are all dried wood, she said

And I don't know what the context is
For what you're trying to say
And I don't know if the vampires in this town
Just expect us to lay down and roll over

No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over

And all the clouds that looked like cars now just look like clouds
And they're building circle camps near your cities and small towns
You are all dried wood
You are all dried wood
You are all dried wood
You are all dried wood

The sounds you have put your faith in will only let you down
The sounds you have put your faith in will only let you down
The sounds you have put your faith in will only let you down
The sounds you have put your faith in will only let you down
Let you down

They'll let you down
They'll let you down
They'll let you down

And I don't know what the context is
For what you're trying to say
And I don't know if the vampires in this town
Just expect us to lay down and roll over

No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over

No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over
No, we won't roll over
