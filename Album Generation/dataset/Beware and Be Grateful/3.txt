I couldn't help but notice that near the corner of your mouth
There was a piece of food escaping it was trying to stay out
I started thinking about myself like I always seem to do
I couldn't stop myself from saying what might seem theatrical to you

It's just that I don't want anymore
Remote and dark years no more remote and dark years

It's like there were these bottles near the end of my street
They were escaping into the sewer near my feet
So I picked them up and I flattened them and I pushed them through the grates
I know it seems unrelated but I'm trying to relate to you

That I don't want anymore remote and dark years no more remote and dark years
