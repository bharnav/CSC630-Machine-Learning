In the beginning of the old ash
That helmet night of many openings
You wore your sharpened pistol mask
I don't know why you wore that useless thing

I didn't know you let them call you that
The crudest terms are all encompassing
But I know why you didn't fight back
We're both afraid of public things

We're both afraid of public things
We're both afraid of public things

Just because all the rocks are overturned
And the worms are all baking
Doesn't mean all the animals are gone
There's a new breed in the making

Just because all the rocks are overturned
And the worms are all baking
Doesn't mean all the animals are gone
There's a new breed in the making

In the beginning of the old ash
That helmet night of many openings
You wore your sharpened pistol mask
I don't know why you wore that useless thing

I didn't know you let them call you that
The crudest terms are all encompassing
But I know why you didn't fight back
We're both afraid of public things

We're both afraid of public things
We're both afraid of public things

Just because all the rocks are overturned
And the worms are all baking
Doesn't mean all the animals are gone
There's a new breed in the making

Just because all the rocks are overturned
And the worms are all baking
Doesn't mean all the animals are gone
There's a new breed in the making
