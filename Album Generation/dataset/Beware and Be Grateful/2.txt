Winter, oh, oh
Oh, oh, how can I?
Oh, oh, why would you
Would you still watch me?

In the democratic construction of snow
We didn't need a planner to finish our town

I thought I saw an aura in this void
I thought there was an era in your voice

Winter, oh, oh
Oh, oh, how can I?
Oh, oh, why would you
Would you still watch me?

And the salt on your shoes and the salt on your coat
They say exactly what I thought that it would leave
From the salt on your shoes and the salt on your coat
Just when I thought I had then I was back

Winter
Would you still watch me?
Would you still watch me?

Under
Underneath the black and white
I'm still searching for life signs
In the arrangement of spent lights
And I'm really not sure, I might even know
I'm really not sure, I wanna think that there's some record of us

I thought I saw an aura in this void
I thought there was an era in your voice
Winter
Would you still watch me?

I thought I saw an aura in this void
I thought there was an era in your voice

Winter
Oh, oh, how can I
Oh, oh, would you
Would you still watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me

And the salt on your shoes and the salt on your coat
They say exactly what I thought that it would leave
From the salt on your shoes and the salt on your coat
Just when I thought I had then I was back

Winter, would you still watch me?
Winter, would you still watch me?
Oh winter, would you still watch me?
Winter, would you still watch me?
Would you still watch me?
