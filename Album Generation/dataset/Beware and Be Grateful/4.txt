Know not to show your silver self
During columns of the year
Who move slow past the bowls in your kitchen shelf
When they know that you are near

I think I'd like to employ your help
But my memory's not so clear
Where was it that you hid your wealth
Above your eye or behind your ear?

Know not to show your silver self
During columns of the year
Who move slow past the bowls in your kitchen shelf
When they know that you are near

I think I'd like to employ your help
But my memory's not so clear
Where was it that you hid your wealth
Above your eye or behind your ear?

No, I won't be certain
No, I won't be certain
No, I won't be certain
As long as I'm alive

Learn not to show your silver self
During columns of the year
Who move slow like your reckless teenage self
Just learning how to steer

I think I'd like to employ your help
But my memory's not so clear
Where was it that you hid your wealth
Above your eye or behind your ear?

No, I won't be certain
No, I won't be certain
No, I won't be certain
As long as I'm alive
