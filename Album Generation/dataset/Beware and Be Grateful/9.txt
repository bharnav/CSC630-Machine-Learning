It is very important for you to know
What I was listening to
And it is very important for you to know
That I was thinking of you

With all the things I said out of the corner of my mouth
And all the things you said out of the corner of your mouth
None were meant to hurt at all
If it hurts at all

Just think of the times when
We sat together quietly smiling
Those were the times when
I said all the things I had to say
At least I'd like to think of it that way

And it is very important for you to know
What I was listening to
And it is very important for you to know
That I was thinking of you

In those last sounds
In those last sounds

And when the curtain closes you'll find all you're looking for
You will make love to everything you know
And when the curtain closes you'll find all you're looking for
All you're looking for
All you're looking for
All you're looking for
All you're looking for
