[Verse 1]
They wonder what you really think of me
You're just not letting go of anything
You told me to find a new reality
So I got lost
Somewhere there's someone that you're looking for
To give you what you need forevermore
I'll be okay, just like I was before
So run along

[Chorus]
Time divided us, what you decided was
You were always too good for me
I was always so good to you
Tried to take it, but I got so tired
Bit a bullet but you're never gonna fire it again
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Two years gone by, I haven't heard a thing
And I can't lie, I hope it's everything
You thought it was when you walked out on me
'Cause I'm just fine

[Chorus]
Time divided us, what you decided was
Time divided us, but you decided
You were always too good for me
I was always so good to you
Tried to take it, but I got so tired
Bit a bullet, but you're never gonna fire it again
Woah-oh-oh
Never gonna fire it again
Woah-oh-oh
I bit a bullet for you

[Chorus]
You were always too good for me
I was always so good to you
You were always too good for me
I was always so good to you
Tried to take it, but I got so tired
Bit a bullet, but you're never gonna fire it again
Woah-oh-oh
Never gonna fire it again
Woah-oh-oh
Never gonna fire it again
