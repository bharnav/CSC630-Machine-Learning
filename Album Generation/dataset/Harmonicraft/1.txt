Lights on
In the kingdom
Useless dream
Of the dead ones
Kicking

My bow
Shoots the arrow
Into deep
Crack the marrow
Kicking

Sailing on the sea
Changing our beliefs
Onward for the stone
Laying out alone
Alone

Begging for supplies
Season now gone by
For now

Learning to pass this by
We'll believe our own lie
Exposing only you
We own the room and you
And you

Lights off
In the kingdom
Kicking
