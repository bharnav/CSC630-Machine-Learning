[Verse 1]
Sleep like a pillow, no one there
Where she won't care anywhere
Soft as a pillow, touch her there
Where she won't dare somewhere

[Verse 2]
Sweet and mellow softer there
Feel like you grew stronger
Speak your trouble, she's not square
Soft like her silk everywhere

[Verse 3]
Sleep as a pillow, comfort there
Where she won't dare anywhere
Look in a mirror, she's not there
Where she won't care somewhere
