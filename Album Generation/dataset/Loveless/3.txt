[Verse 1]
Kiss, your fear
Your red button falls from my mouth
Slip, your dress
Over your head, itâ€™s been so long

[Refrain]
Come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come

[Verse 2]
Move, on top
Because that way you touch her too
Turn, your head
Come back again to here knows when

[Refrain]
Come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come
