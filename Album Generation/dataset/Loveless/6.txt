[Verse 1]
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide
Why I don't need to believe
What you see to look up and around
You were gone, words came out to a sound

[Verse 2]
Feel, I'm alive
You will see why I'm alive
Felt like crying over her
I will go to the wall
(Ohh)
Run from some
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide
