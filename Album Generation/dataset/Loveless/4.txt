[Verse 1]
When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll see you tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away

[Verse 2]
When you say "I do"
Oh, I don't believe in you
I can't forget it, ooh
When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
And you turn your long blonde hair

[Verse 1]
When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll see you tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away
