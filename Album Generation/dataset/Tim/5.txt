[Verse 1]
Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, I need help here with this feather

[Chorus]
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line

[Verse 2]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around
Never learn how to swim, now
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then, I need help here with this feather

[Chorus]
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
At the swingin' party, down the line

[Verse 3]
Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then, I need help here with this feather

[Chorus]
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
Everything in time
At the swingin' party, down the line
Catchin' time
At the swingin' party, down the line
