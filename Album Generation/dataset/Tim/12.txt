[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
She don't wear no pants and she don't wear no tie
Always on the ball, she's always on strike
Struttin' up the aisle
Big deal, you get to fly

[Hook]
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky

[Verse 2]
Paid my fare, don't wanna complain
You get to me, you're always outta champagne
Treat me like a bum, don't wear no tie

[Hook]
'Cause you ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky

[Bridge]
And the sign says, 'Thank you very much for not smoking'
My own sign says, 'I'm sorry, I'm smoking'
Don't treat me special, oh, don't kiss my ass
Treat me like the way they treat 'em up in first class

[Verse 3]
Sanitation expert and a maintenance engineer
Garbage man, a janitor and you, my dear
A reunion flight attendant, my oh my

[Hook]
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
