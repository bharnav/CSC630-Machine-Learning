[Intro]
1, 2...

[Verse 1]
Got a big switchblade, drop drop bill a tease
There's a deal goin' down, it don't go down without me

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumors keep on spreadin' all over town

[Chorus]
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down

[Verse 2]
Skinny as a rail and you think you got what it takes
The only exercise you ever get is the shakes

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumors a-keep on spreadin' all over town

[Chorus]
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down

[Verse 3]
Get back to the hills, get back to, back to where you belong
Finally found out which way the wind blows

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumors keep on spreadin' all over town

[Chorus]
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down
