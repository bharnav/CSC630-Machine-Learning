[Verse 1]
Cruisin' in the sunshine
Ain't yet been to bed
And I could hear the motor whistlin', something's awful wrong again
Hey, give my regards to Broadway
Tell 'em I got change to spare
One big buck, gonna have to suck up here

[Chorus]
Anything you want, dear, is fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about some pictures
Now, wouldn't that be a scream?
Well, movies are for retards like me and Maybelline
Hey, give my regards to Boston
Ask 'em who'll buy the beer?
Don't wanna get pop, find yourself a rockin' chair

[Chorus]
Anything you want, dear, is fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy

[Verse 3]
We ever get passed the dice, dear, goddamnit, I'm gonna roll
The people there pick your nose clean, so what we owe, owe, owe?
Hey, give my regards to Broadway
Tell 'em I don't even care
If you want a good joke, why split?
You'll go broke right here

[Chorus]
Anything you want, dear, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy
And anything you want, dear, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, I'll buy
