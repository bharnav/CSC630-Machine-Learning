[Verse 1]
Well, well, well
I bought it
Down on all fours
Let me crawl
If I want I could die
Oh by my hand

[Refrain]
Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

[Pre-Chorus]
Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

[Chorus]
And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it

[Verse 2]
Well, well, well
Anyone could tell
Classic awe
A lucky shot
Ooo-leh-do
Hate 'em
Someday soon
Face 'em

[Refrain]
Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

[Pre-Chorus]
Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

[Chorus]
And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it

Just my, just my, just my

[Refrain]
We might crack up in the sun
But we'll lose it in the shade

[Pre-Chorus]
Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

[Chorus]
And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Hold my life, baby
Hold my life

[Outro]
Hold my
Hold my
Hold my
Hold my
Hold
