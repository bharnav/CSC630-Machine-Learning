Sugar Valley is just two miles up the road
And I'm told
You can walk there if it's not too cold

Used to be a desert
Then the whole world changed
Came the mountains
All the grassy plains
Buffalo ghost, hang around here
Buffalo ghost, hang around here

Summer days
The water's crystal clear
So blue you can see right through
The fishes disappear
When you throw a stone, walk alone
And the sun will shine so bright
It brings tears to your eyes
Buffalo ghost, hang around here
Buffalo ghost, hang around here

I used to live in this house years ago
I used to walk down that road with the ghost
Buffalo ghost, hang around here
Buffalo ghost, hang around here

Every night
Stars fall like rain
So bright through the pale moonlight
It almost cause you pain
Like a beautiful dream
That you keep in your heart
A beautiful dream
Asleep in your heart

I used to live in this house years ago
I used to walk down that road with the ghost
Buffalo ghost, hang around here
Buffalo ghost, hang around here
