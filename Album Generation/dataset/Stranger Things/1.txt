You came in flashing like a ruby ring
And you were acting like you knew everything
And we were dancing on the kitchen floor
Taking chances we don't make no more
Oh, oh, my soul
Oh, oh, my soul

And you were tending bar in Birmingham
You poured it on me like nobody can
I made you feel just like a real man
We did it once and we can do it again
Oh, oh, my soul
Oh, oh, my soul

When every day
I believe could be our last
Far away
To be free from what has passed

When I was flirting like a wild man
You came a hurtin' and uncertainty reigns
A skinny child in the open door
I need you now more than I did before
Oh, oh, my soul
Oh, oh, my soul

When every day
I believe could be our last
Far away
To be free from what has passed

Oh, oh, my soul
Oh, oh, my soul
