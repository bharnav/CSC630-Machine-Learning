I went out for a while
When I come back everything was changed
Or only for a while
When I come back everything was changed

My clothes were on the floor
Spilling out the drawer, someone had been here
My heart began to race
Nothing in its place, suddenly my fear

Oh, take the money, take the TV
Take my clothes
Please not my guitar, empty corner
It was gone

How could you still prove us
We're on the same boat in this part of town
Wheels in the suburb track this side of the track
Police are in town

Oh, take the money, take the jewelry
Take my clothes
Please leave my guitar, empty corner
It was gone

My Spanish style guitar
I wonder where you are, so far from your home
My Spanish style guitar
I want you in my arms, back where you belong

Oh, take the money, take the TV
Take my phones
Please leave my guitar, not my guitar
It was gone
