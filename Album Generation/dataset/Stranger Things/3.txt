No dinero, on Saturday morning
We spent it all Friday night at the disco
No dinero, on Saturday evenin'
We can't go out so we'll just have to stay at home
Cash our check and with all of our money
We fill our pockets and go hear the band play
We sing and dance through the night every Friday
No dinero, left for the weekend

No dinero, on Saturday morning
We spent it all Friday night at the disco
No dinero, on Saturday evenin'
We can't go out so we'll just have to stay at home
And turn on the boom box down low
Cause he'll call the cops if we don't
And I wish it was Friday night

Hey why don't you pay your phone bill
Right now can't but you know that I soon will
Hey you owe me two months rent
I'd give it to you but my money is spent
They will come to repossess your car
That's why I hide it I know where you are

No dinero, on Saturday morning
We spent it all Friday night at the disco
No dinero, on Saturday evenin'
We can't go out so we'll just have to stay at home
And turn on the boom box down low
Cause he'll call the cops if we don't

Cash our check and with all of our money
Fill our pockets we go hear the band play
Sing and dance through the night every Friday
Oh, forget our debt and sing and dance and laugh as we go crazy

No dinero, oh
No dinero, oh
