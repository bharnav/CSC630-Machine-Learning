I shook the sand out of my shoes
I went to work on the windows
When he came in from out of the blue
All I could say is hello

I nearly fell off of my ladder
My heart filled with laughter
A funny thing happened to me today

As the horses were having the hay
Cat licked a bowl clean
I was being carried away
By the one who loves me

A funny thing happened to me today
A funny thing happened to me today

Ooooh, oooh
La la la

I believe I was born for the boy
No doubt in my dream
No doubt in my dream

I nearly fell off of my ladder
My heart filled with laughter
A funny thing happened to me today
A funny thing happened to me today

A strange miracle thing
