Unafraid of the dangers around
We snuck out without making a sound
Through the window and into the night
To the street with the soft yellow light

And I waited in hope that you would
Take my hand and tell me something good
When a shiver went all through the trees
And a feeling went all over me

It was the early morning wake up
It was the rise and fall of us
You were the only boy in my heart
The one I love

And those guys in the car slowing down
Looked at us and we looked at the ground
Freaking out, we took off up the bluff
We were running and laughing so hard

It was the early morning wake up
It was the rise and fall of us
You were the only boy in my heart
The one I love

Finding it hard to stay apart
I'm determined to try
Finding it hard to say goodbye

It was the early morning wake up
It was the rise and fall of us
It was the world the way forever?
It was the night and we were young
You were the only boy in my heart
The one I love
