Lover take me to a quiet place
Where the shadows will not hide your face
It's so noisy and so crowded here
They won't notice if we disappear

Lover take me past the velvet ropes
To the moonlight with a ray of hope
There is something
You can do for me
You and only, you exclusively

There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
Those times are gone

Lover take me to a quiet place
Where the shadows will not hide your face
Lover take me in you arms again
Show and tell me how we're more than friends

There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
Those times are gone

There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
There was a time I was alone
I wanted to be free
Those times are gone
All gone

I saw right into you
I swear that I knew
What was going to be

I saw right into you
I swear that I knew
What was going to be
