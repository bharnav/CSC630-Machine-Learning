Here we go again
You're making hell and then you pull everybody in
And I wanna tell you

Look here where we been
Does everything have to be like it was back then
I'm going to help you

One last time my heart goes out to you
One last time my heart goes out to you

I am never sure
If it's love or if it's hate I see in your eyes
It don't make a difference

One last time my heart goes out to you
One last time my heart goes out to you

Will you ever change
Will you ever seem as anything but strange
Hopeless and helpless

One last time my heart goes out to you
One last time my heart goes out to you
One last time my heart goes out to you
One last time my heart goes out to you
