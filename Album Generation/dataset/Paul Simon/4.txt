[Chorus 1]
On Armistice Day

[Verse 1]
The Philharmonic will play
But the songs that we sing
Will be sad
Shuffling brown tunes
Hanging around
No long drawn blown out excuses
Were made
When I needed a friend she was there
Just like an easy chair

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Verse 2]
That's all I really wanted to say
Oh I'm weary from wailing
In Washington D.C
I'm coming to see my Congressman
But he's avoiding me
Weary from waiting down in Washington D.C

[Chorus 2]
Oh Congresswoman
Won't you tell that Congressman

[Bridge]
I've waited such a long time
I've about waited all I can

[Chorus 2]
