[Verse 1]
I got some so-called friends
They'll smile right to my face
But, when my back Is turned
They'd like to stick it to me
Yes they would

[Chorus]
Oh no no, oh no no
There's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on

[Verse 2]
I fly into J.F.K
My heart goes boom boom boom
I know that customs man
He's going to take me
To that little room

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got the paranoia blues
From knocking around In New York City
Where they roll you for a nickel
And they stick you for the extra dime
Anyway you choose
You're bound to lose in New York City
Oh I just got out in the nick of time
Well I just got out in the nick of time

[Verse 4]
Once I was down in Chinatown
I was eating some Lin's Chow Fon
I happened to turn around
And when I looked I see
My Chow Fon's gone

[Chorus]
