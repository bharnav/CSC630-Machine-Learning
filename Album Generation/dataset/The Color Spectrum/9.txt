I'm standing still staring at the sun
Fashioning ends of oblivion
But it's just a common misconception

I'm screaming in but I'm silent out
My best to suss what I'm all about
Leaving breadcrumbs back to central station

[Chorus]
Stuck on a wire, and out on a fence
Putting it up to second chance
Suffering through the common sense
Losing it all to gain it back

I'm coming in, but I'm leaving out
Everything you get on about
Speak in tongues, seducing fabrication

I'm throwing curse like I'm throwing stones
And checking sins that I can't atone
But I'm here demanding satisfaction

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
