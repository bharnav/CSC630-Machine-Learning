[Verse 1]
The crow and cackle of persistent innocence
Elated in argument, I'm empty and wondering
If you're only saying what I wanted you to say
'Cause you're only saying what I wanted you to say

[Chorus]
So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

Cause I'm only saying what you wanted me to say

[Verse 2]
The slow and steady sound of silence hunts us down
I'm empty and wondering what you sent me, what you're offering
'Cause you're only saying what I wanted you to say
Yeah, you're only saying what I wanted you to say

[Chorus]
So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

[Chorus]
So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

Cause I'm only saying what you wanted me to say
