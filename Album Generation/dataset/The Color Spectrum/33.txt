[Verse 1]
We all become memories after having gone
Dancing in the light flickering behind their eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hoping it's showing
My heart never stopped growing
I'll take comfort in knowing
This melody has never been sung with these words

[Chorus]
We come and then we go, goodbye
Our hopes will tend to fall and flee awry

[Verse 2]
Try to make the most, even after we all know
We're giving up the ghost, a final glow before we burn

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hoping it's showing
My heart never stopped growing
I'll take comfort in knowing
This melody has never been sung with these words

[Chorus]
We come and then we go, goodbye
Our hopes will tend to fall and flee awry

Oooh, goodnight
Oooh, goodbye
Oooh, goodbye

[Outro]
I'm hoping it's showing
My heart never stopped growing
I'll take comfort in knowing...
