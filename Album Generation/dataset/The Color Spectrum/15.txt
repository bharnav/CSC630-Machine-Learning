[Verse 1]
Hey girl, let's lose ourselves today
We can go anywhere we need to get away
So say the word and we'll turn
Around, and leave this place behind

[Chorus]
So come on, you're never gonna need him
That's why you're in my room tonight
So go on, you know you need it
That's why you're in my room tonight

[Verse 2]
I knew you'd be coming back to me
I never thought that you'd have the courage to ever leave
And you are better off
Sticking right where you are

[Chorus]
So come on, you're never gonna need him
That's why you're in my room tonight
So go on, you know you need it
That's why you're in my room tonight
[x2]

Ohh, ohh, ohh...

[Chorus]
Come on, you're never gonna need him
That's why you're in my room tonight
So go on, you know you need it
That's why you're in my room...
