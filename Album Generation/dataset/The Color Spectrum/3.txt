I'm struggling on strange extremities
To run after a light that keeps on dimming
But these bones will only brittle and decay
While the space between my body and my mind keeps caving in

Oh my god [x2]

This body's not a temple, it's a prison, yeah
And every wall inside here is on fire, yeah

I've been stirred by something wretched, something weary
But the sentiment is starting to seduce

Oh my god [x2]

This body's not a temple, it's a prison, yeah
And every wall inside here is on fire, yeah
But I can't say that I mind my body burning, yeah
Cause this body's not a temple it's a prison, yeah

(Somewhere I went wrong and gave into this holy terrible mess
In an attempt to do what I thought was right)

This body's not a temple, it's a prison, yeah [x2]
This body's not a temple, it's a prison [x4]
