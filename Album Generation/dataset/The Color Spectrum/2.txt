[Verse 1]
Torn away from the one thing I can rely on
Beaten down to the core
Just as long as there's enough to go around

[Chorus]
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
[x2]

[Verse 2]
You give and you give and you give
'Til there's nothing left to give
Just a hole and the sin of the charitable
I've been around long enough to remember
Why I don't give anymore

[Chorus]
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
[x2]

[Bridge]
Now wave goodbye
And pray for peace of mind
[x2]

[Chorus]
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
Take more than you need
Take enough to hollow me out
[x2]

[Outro]
Now wave goodbye
And pray for peace of mind
[x2]
