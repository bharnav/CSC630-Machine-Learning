[Verse 1]
Man, you've got a cold dark heart
And it burns with a guilty smoke
You tell me 'just give in,'
And 'you've got nothing to lose,'
And I guess I would never know
But I was damned from the very start
And bound by a crooked plan
Then I was left for dead with my head to the ground
And my hands tied behind my back

[Chorus]
Oh, you want to watch me crash?
You want to see me burn
Just enough to fall apart, and
Then, you want to see me crawl?
You need to watch me beg and lose it all

[Verse 2]
Is it easier to take a hit
Than it is to throw the stone?
Better blood on your face
Better blood on the ground
Well I guess that I'll never know...
Cause it's best not to give a shit
And to speak in a timid tone
Keep my tongue to my teeth;
Keep my ear to the ground
And a blind eye to everyone

[Chorus]
Oh, you want to watch me crash?
You want to see me burn
Just enough to fall apart, and
Then, you want to see me crawl?
You need to watch me beg and lose it all
