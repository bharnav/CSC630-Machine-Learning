[Verse 1]
The need to quantitate has put center stage
Regret, remorse, regard
Crazed and calm with a sinners psalm
Memories lose their art
So I circle thoughts with centered eyes
That stare without ever seeing
But it's getting dim and just before
Any reasons can be revealed

[Chorus]
I fall
And I don't want to get up
Just leave me down here, down where the truth won't go
No, I don't want to give up
Just dust me off and I swear you'd never know
Oh no
Look away, shade your eyes
Don't stop

[Verse 2]
Then there's the simple fact that I was born this way
In such a taut assimilation of mistakes
Don't you misjudge what I'm capable of
If I'm heir to a broken will

[Chorus]

Leave the pain behind, casting fear to the side
For just a moment, so things can align
And if I fall, sometimes that's just fine
As long as I get up, then things are alright

Oh no
Don't look away, don't shade your eyes
Don't stop
