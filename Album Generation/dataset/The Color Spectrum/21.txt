[Verse 1]
Every now and then I get down
But this cup of gin picks me right back up
Lately I've been drowning in this chair
Time again, I'm never here

[Hook]
Lost in my head, hand to my heart
I swear that I'll try, don't go

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been losing sleep
Heavy eyes and weary
But every now and then, I find myself
Stuck in a way I can't get out of

[Hook]
Lost in my head, hand to my heart
I swear that I'll try, don't go

[Bridge]
You say that you've heard it before
That the pitch and the tone are unsure
The weight of your words is too much
And the look in your eyes, oh, it cuts
Darling don't abandon me
Please just take a breath and you'll see
That not everything here is lost
And the profits will outweigh the cost
If the only thing that you want is love
