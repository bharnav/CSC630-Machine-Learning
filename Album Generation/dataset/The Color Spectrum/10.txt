[Verse 1]
Alarming awe rushed through my bones
Compelling me to the unknown
I took a step, one step too far
I felt no ground beneath my feet
No familiar feeling was leading me
Just hollow charm pushing me along

[Chorus]
A final breath with tongue in cheek
Crossed the sun with sullen speak
Make no mistake, it weighs on me
The choice is made, echo and ring

[Verse 2]
The walls are humming with a soft suspicious song
Suggesting that I've been mistaken all along
But the words become deformed
While the notes fall and distort

[Chorus]
