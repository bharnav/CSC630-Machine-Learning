It's a curse in a cycle of misbelief
And it keeps on happening
A tradition, a trail of deceit
I never stopped and questioned
"Why is it so damned hard
To find anyone who can get behind such a simple plot?"
Keep your eye on the prize

Think what you want
Believe what you think
Know what you believe 'cause it's all misconceived
And I asked you for nothing, nothing but "Why?"
"Because" isn't an answer, it's just a reply

It's a cure, a disciple of belief
And it keeps you here with me
And it keeps on happening
And I never meant to kill the prize
Like an unreliable fire
Anyone can get behind
"Keep your eye on the prize, on the prize"

I am cynical, I am cynical
It's a curse, it's a curse
[x2]

I am cynical
I have nothing you want
Take everything
Don't leave anything
Hollow me
Take the core
Leave nothing at all
I am cynical
Nothing left
