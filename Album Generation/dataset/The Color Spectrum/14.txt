[Verse 1]
I'm calling out your name
Can you really hear me?
And do these words still feel the same?
The timbre of your voice
Is losing its clarity
Is feigning transparency

[Chorus]
But I am struggling to keep my heart from failing
But every time I do
I find my body caving in
My mind just melts away

[Verse 2]
I guess I shouldn't blame you
For being ambiguous
I know that it's innocent
But you are keeping me from building something intimate
But I'll give in if you want me to

[Chorus]
Cause I am struggling to keep my heart from failing
But every time I do
I find my body caving in
My mind just melts away
[x2]
