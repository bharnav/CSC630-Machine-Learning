[Verse 1]
Calm down, you won't gain any ground
If you're shaking from head to toe
And if you'd wake up you'd be weary to lie
Cause discerning eyes will know
Your words carry the weight of the world
And they're waiting for that shoe to drop
So you sit down, you give in, and they get up, and they yell

[Chorus]
"Someone's got blood on their hands" [x2]
With a stone cold glare and a crooked grin
You know exactly what we're saying when we say
"Someone's got blood on their hands [x2]
Forget about truth and consequence
We've got a way to deal with this."

[Verse 2]
And if you're good maybe they'll be light on you
Long as you dance just like they want you to
Just shelter that look in your eyes
And think about staying alive
Sit down, give in, when they get up, and they yell

[Chorus x2]
