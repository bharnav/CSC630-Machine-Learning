[Verse 1]
I was spinning through the air when I thought my life was ending
But I was really on the ground, and you were lying right there next to me
I looked right into your eyes, and I found myself pretending
That we were high above the canopy but tethered to the trunk of a tree

[Chorus]
Slow down, take time
And see the forest for the leaves
I know that I should practice what I preach

[Verse 2]
I was falling to the ground when I felt my body breaking
But I had fallen in your lap, with my head tilted back
So I could see the sun eclipsed by your hair that left a halo hanging
Waiting above so when you go you don't have to wait to get your wings

[Chorus] x2
