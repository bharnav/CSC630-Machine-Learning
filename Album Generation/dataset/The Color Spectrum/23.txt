I thought that I was framed
Front and center
But I'm distant
And your depth of field is shallow

Low light
Turn to night
And all can be ignored
Blind eyes
Preoccupied
With the surface more than the core

Though my lens is cracked, right down the center I saw you
And through shattered light, your beauty remained flawless

Low light
Turn to night
And all can be ignored
Blind eyes
Preoccupied
With the surface more than the core
