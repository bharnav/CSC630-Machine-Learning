The hollow stick to arrogance that binds
But good faith and fortune rarely reward our cries
While we wait carefully and see

[Chorus]
Denied and borrowed tonight
Deny, deny it all
And it all will go away
Close your eyes and deny it all
And it all will go away

Nursing stale history and the apathy it brings
Too fascinated by the most material things
While we wait carefully and see

[Chorus]

Never took you long to pray
Either way, I spend you like I know some better way
Force of habit, now it takes a while to pray
In a way, you spit me out, you changed my name
[x2]

Deny, deny it all
And it all will go away
Close your eyes and deny it all
And it all will go away
