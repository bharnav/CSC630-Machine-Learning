[Verse 1]
Your heart is open
But your eyes stay closed enough
To keep actuality away
In such impassive motion
You cast a careless hand to the air
Give me something to hope for...

[Hook]
Oh, and the only thing that brings me back is love
Oh, and the only thing that brings me back is love

Your mind is open
But your mouth stays closed enough
To keep painful words from falling out
With every ounce of passion
I speak 'til my lungs both billow out
I'll give you something to hope for...

[Extended hook]
Oh, and the only thing that brings me back is love
Oh, yeah, the only thing that brings me back is love
Oh, yeah, the only thing that brings me back is love
Oh, yeah, the only thing that brings me back is love

[Outro]
Oh, and the only thing that brings me back is love
Oh, and the only thing that brings me back is...
