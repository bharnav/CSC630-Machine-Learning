[Verse 1]
She was stuck in pictures
While he passed time in film
Oh silly fame, why do you play
Frame by frame, day by day

With reels changing over
And dropping to the sides
Oh solemn soul see where you are
And look to the sides what you discard

[Chorus]
Press your lips to mine, breathe in deep and lie
When the cameras roll, hide away your soul
Flash your eyes, forge a smile, entertain
But don't get stuck in something you hate

[Verse 2]
Bring me the eyes of the earth
Cut off the tongue of the world
Keep the ends close in sight to the means that imply
You're not living the life that you're worth

[Modified Chorus]
Pressing your lips to mine, breathe in deep and lie
When the cameras roll, hide away your soul
Flashing your eyes to sell, lying to yourself
Dodging truth form the start, hide away your heart
Turn around, forge a smile, entertain
But don't get stuck in something painful
Something worse than nothing

[Bridge]
We could have been smart
With the plot from the start
Mistakes from the spark
We knew it wasn't love

[Partial Chorus]
Breathe in deep and lie
When the cameras roll
Hide away your soul
Flash your eyes, forge a smile, entertain
