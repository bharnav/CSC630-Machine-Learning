[Verse 1]
Starved eyes looking for something soft
Don't go astray
You were in love before tonight
And what made you change your mind?
Was it what she said?
Was it what you said?

[Chorus]
Don't spend your time
Worried about what's right
Turn around and walk away
And close your eyes
Imagine what you would say
If she treated you that way
It wouldn't feel good
But this feels better

[Verse 2]
Flushed skin, glowing from treachery
Plotting an exit
It never ends as good as it begins
And what of her?
What will she think?
And does she even need to know?

[Modified Chorus]
Don't spend your time
Worried about what's right
Turn around and walk away
And close your eyes
Imagine what you would say
If she treated you that way
It wouldn't feel good enough
To risk it all, to spoil your love
But this feels better
But this feels better
