Mouths to feed won't sleep till he arrives
So he brings his work home
Late nights waste away plotting a plan
Tracing the steps he needs to take

Till he says
My job is done
You're old enough, it's time to leave
This home and go on your own
I know it's hard, but it's not my problem anymore
Not anymore

Eyes closed children rest unaware
So he keeps their lights dim
Angels hold their tongues up above
With a scowl shaking their fists

When he says
We had our run
Now you're old enough to run down your track
So don't look back
I know it's hard but it's not my problem anymore
Not anymore
