[Verse 1]
Somewhere I was lost
Off but not all gone
Gave me
Nothing of God

{Bridge}

[Pre-Chorus]
Come here mister, take in no love
Even if it canvases so
(When) the blind eye never liked
(What) the wide eye never sees

[Chorus]
Here I lie
The same I fell at first
Give me anything but apathy
Or love and curse
Waiting for my soul to wake
And come alive again

[Verse 2]
Can I not torment this
With a canon of assisted duress?

[Chorus]
Here I lie
The same I fell at first
Give me anything but apathy
Or love and curse
Waiting for my soul to stir
And wake, rejoice, and come alive again

[Chorus]
Here I go
The same I fall at first
Give me anything but apathy
Or love and curse
Waiting for my soul to wake
And come alive again

{Outro}
