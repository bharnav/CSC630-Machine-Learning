[Verse 1]
Mr. Malum's got a secret he keeps when giving speeches
Just a whispering precision that cuts through hesitation
With a sharp and able wit to keep the dogs at bay

When the truth arrives
You won't believe your eyes
He's triumph's pessimist
But he's no less content

[Chorus]
With the world in the grip of his hands
He'll crush the air out of its lungs
Say "We don't want him to have it all"
But now it's just too late to ask

Because his hold has turned so tight...

His puppets to the left and his pawns to line the right
But every eye is front and center
A cool intoxication from the sap
That trickles down his branches to their mouths

When the truth arrives
You won't believe your eyes
A vicious champion
But he's no less content

[Chorus]

Because his hold has turned so tight
The air we're barely breathing's not enough
In this final gasp that rattles us to bed
The last thing we will see is Mr. Malum
Tighten his tie when he slips in the suit
A link to the cuff and a shine of his shoes

When the truth arrived you didn't trust your eyes

And we don't want him to have it all
But now it's just too late to ask
You had your chance, but you turned away again [x2]
You had your chance, but you turned your eyes away again
