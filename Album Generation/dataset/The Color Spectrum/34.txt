No god could teach me what my father did
No promise of heaven kept me warm
When my mother tucked me in
No hope for salvation kept me from sin
Just a small intuition not to do
What all the bad ones did

And what comes next is a mystery to me
I guess I'll have to wait and see
Cause everything I ever knew could just fall apart

I only know what I've been told
And I was told what others know
And others know what they were told
And they were told what others know

And I'll wait to tell what's wrong or right
No fear of dying keeps me alive

And all we know is what we're told
And we were told what others know
And all they know is what they're told
And they were told what others know

No way to tell what's wrong or right
No fear of dying keeps me alive
