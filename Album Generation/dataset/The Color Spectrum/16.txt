Waking up I felt that hesitation
Like I wasn't meant to wake up at all
Letting out a soft, cynical sigh
My god, it's just the answer
To the question I can't find

Marching on, it's one foot then the other
Better than one foot then none at all
Biting off way more than I can chew
Like I sometimes do
I never know just when and where to stop

Why are we here, why do we die?
Maybe we're just never meant to know why
Why are we here, why do we die?
Why, why, why?

Why are we here, why do we die?
Maybe we're just never meant to know why
Why are we here, why do we die?
Why, why, why?
