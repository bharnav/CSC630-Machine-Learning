[Verse 1]
Wide smiles bearing teeth
Can't fake what's underneath
Cause I don't want to waste any time
You've got crooked speak
Broke words from suffering
But I don't mean to make any lies

[Refrain]
I'm not waiting, no, not waiting here!
Ankles bound to cinders watch them burn!

[Verse 2]
You've got rare appeal
With conscience atrophied
Cause you don't need to waste any time
But I'm not the kind to wait
Modeled to instigate
But always end up towing the line

[Refrain]
I'm not waiting, no, not waiting here!
Ankles bound to cinders watch them burn!

[Bridge
In just a moment we can let it all decay
Or we could just step right on into the sun
Don't shutter, own it or you'll find out any moment
That you lost it all before it's begun
