Raise the dead and hope the living learn to live with it
Cutting heads demanding reparations for your kin

While some will starve

I understand that you never had enough
Cause enough for someone is not enough for you

Caving in and catering to thoughts are paper thin won't go unknown

I understand that you never had enough
Cause enough for someone is not enough for you
I understand that you never had enough
Cause enough for someone is not enough for you

I understand that you never had enough
Cause enough for someone is not enough for you
I understand that you never had enough
Cause enough for someone is not enough for you
