Somewhere there's a choice being made
For the mass by the will of a broken few
Guided by the hand of the guilty
Praised as a cure for a curse
When really this is all catastrophic
And we're tethered to the hull of a sinking ship
Scratching for a breath at the surface
Praying for the ropes to slip

[Chorus]
I always knew that the damned would inherit the earth
As soon as they learned to speak
We would be suffering
Sucking on the scraps of a wicked wealth
We were bound by need to vicious villainy

Tear it down, start again
Erasing every trace so stale scars can mend
Then we will sing
"The way things used to be" [x3]

[Chorus]
