[Verse 1]
Feeling your body burn down into your bones
Don't let it show
Watching his body fall flat into the dirt
You know it had to hurt
And he begins to stand--you're shaking again

[Pre-Chorus]
Bruising your body right down into your soul
Oh, what a hole
Busting your lip and now the blood begins to run
You never had enough
He's coming back alone, you're shaking again

[Chorus]
Wait, stay
Pick it up if you want me please
I couldn't do it alone (A dead dog should know)
I couldn't do it alone (A dead man should know)
Fake place
I knew you had it in you
Wait, stay
Just long enough that you know (A dead dog should know)
Just long enough that you know (A dead man should know)

[Pre-Chorus]
Busting your body right down into your soul
Don't let it show
Splitting your lip and now the blood begins to run
You never had enough
He's coming back alone, you're shaking again

[Chorus]
Wait, stay
Pick it up if you want me please
I couldn't do it alone (A dead dog should know)
I couldn't do it alone (A dead man should know)
Fake place
I knew you had it in you
Wait, stay
Just long enough that you know (A dead dog should know)
Just long enough that you know (A dead man should know)
