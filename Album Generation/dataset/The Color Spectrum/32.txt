[Verse 1]
With the good chance that we crash
Let's say our grace (our grace)
In your final breath
Believe you're not alone

[Chorus]
Help will come
Yeah, you can come back home
Cause help is on the way
Yeah, you can come back home
So come back home

[Verse 2]
As your eyes begin to fade
Your mind will wander (will wander)
This life is just a game we play
That we can never win
But don't give up, no, don't give up

[Chorus]
Help will come
Yeah, you can come back home
Cause help is on the way
Yeah, you can come back home
So come back home

[Bridge]
Now in the end it's coming clear, you're not alone
Cause everyone you've ever loved is waiting here for you
So don't give up, no, don't give up

[Modified Chorus]
Yeah, cause help will come
Yeah, you can come back home (you can come back home, yeah)
Cause help is on the way
Yeah, you can come back home (you can come back home)
So come back home
