Your voice arose to the top of the tones and rushed around
And I became addicted to that sound
And every other lover in this city
Has got their song to sing
But none of them ring in my ears

The clamor calmed and when you cleared your throat and spoke gracefully
My body swayed with every word you'd speak
And every other lover in this city
Has got a song to sing
But none of them ring, but none of them ring in my ears

And every other lover in this city
Has got a song to sing
But none of them ring, but none of them ring
But none of them ring...
