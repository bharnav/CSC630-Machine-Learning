[Verse 1]
Swaying back and forth
Drunk, looking for more
Pressing my tongue to my teeth, no sound
Skin begins to crawl
Stomach start to fall
Feeling my lungs quicken pace
And blood begin to run

[Chorus]
Echo a name in the night
Bodies a long battle cry
Are we in love, or did we cross the line?
Maybe we're passing time one on one

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Echo a name in the night
Bodies a long battle cry
Are we in love, or did we cross the line?
Maybe we're passing time one on one
