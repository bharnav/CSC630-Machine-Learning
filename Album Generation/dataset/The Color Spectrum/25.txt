I lost my place in the world
It left me behind
Now my soul is unbound
And my mind is free to roam around and around...

Thoughts drip down to words on a page
Scrawled in a foreign tongue
Circles tending toward the center
Lead you back to none
You can cry, you can beg, you can plead, you can pray...

You may doubt it, apathetic
But you never had control
You saw what you wanted
But the rest was terrible
Pull back the curtain
And reveal the guilty
So the veil can be lifted
And the well will overflow

You've been here before
You've seen it all
But your conscience won't recall
And your eyes are barely wide enough
To recognize what your heart keeps giving up

And someday it might win
If your mind's giving in
Just try to lose yourself
Or do your best till then
