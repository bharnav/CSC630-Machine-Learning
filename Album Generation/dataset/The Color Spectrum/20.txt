[Verse 1]
There must be something that keeps me awake
Or some kind of pill I can take
To break these bad habits
I would lie if I said that this didn't get tough
Two left feet on the floor in a waltz
At an odd tempo

[Chorus]
Am I stuck at the ankle or caught at the knee?
A curious puzzle still cursing me
To follow or lead

You gave me a heart and then taught me to hurt
I can't tell just which option is worse:
Dying pure or aware
So these feet keep on tripping in triplets to beats
Too far off for my ears to reach
Just a hint of timing

[Chorus]

And I don't know where I'm going
Cause I can't see the road, oh it's winding
Just as long as I keep breathing
I've got this uncomfortable feeling
Heavy feet, shaky hands, troubled heart
