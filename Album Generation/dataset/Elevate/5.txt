[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
I'm I'm ready to go

[Verse 1]
Jaw drop, heart stop, we eye lock
I must be dreaming, don't hit the alarm clock
Under the lights, coming alive, she "thriller" tonight

Ay ay ay

[Verse 2]
One dance, two dance is not enough
You got that glow in the dark so I'm not giving up
I'm reading your mind, you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it, hide it?

[Chorus]

I'm saying woah
Don't tell me no

Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm I'm I'm ready to go

I'm I'm ready to go

Love me love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me love me, lo-love me
I'm I'm ready to go

[Verse 3]
Can't stop, won't stop, we party rock
You got them red velvet lips sweet like Betty Crock-ER
So call a doct-OR
Cause someone needs to take your temperature, you're getting hotter

[Verse 4]
Under the lights, coming alive, she "thriller" tonight
I'm reading your mind, you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it, hide it?

[Verse 5]
When I rock, you roll
You're losing control
And if you got that feeling, throw your hands up in the air

[Chorus]

I'm saying wooah
Don't tell me nooo

Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm I'm I'm ready to go

I'm I'm ready to go

[Verse 6]
You be Juliet, I'll be Romeo
What you waiting for you know you wanna go
Don't say goodbye cause we just said hello
Say your gonna love me girl cause I need to know

Ready?

Go [x14]

Ready?

Go [x14]

Let's do this

[Chorus]

I'm saying woah
Don't tell me no

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I'm I'm I'm ready to go

I'm I'm ready to go

[Outro]
Love me, love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me, love me, lo-love me
I'm I'm ready to go
