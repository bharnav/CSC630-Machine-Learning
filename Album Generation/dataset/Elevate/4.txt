[Verse 1: Kendall]
I don't know why you always get so insecure
I wish you could see what I see
When you're looking in the mirror
And why won't you believe me when I say
That to me you get more beautiful, everyday

[Verse 2: James]
When you're looking at the magazines
And thinking that you'll never measure up
You're wrong

[Chorus: All]
Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts

It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
My cover girl
Oh, my cover girl

[Verse 3: Logan]
You walk in rain boots on a perfect summer day
Somehow you always see the dark side
When everything's okay

[Verse 4: Carlos]
And you wear baggy clothes
That camouflage your shape
Whoa, but you know that I love you
Just the way you're made

[Verse 5: James]
When you're looking at the magazines
And thinking that you're just not good enough
You're so wrong, baby

[Chorus: All]
Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts
It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
My cover girl
Oh, my cover girl

[Carlos]
Got a heart of gold
A perfect original

[James]
Wish you would stop being so hard on yourself for a while

[Carlos]
And when I see that face
I'd try a thousand ways

[James]
I would do anything to make you smile

[Chorus: All]
Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts

It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
My cover girl
Oh, my cover girl

[Outro]
Oh woah oh oh oh, my cover girl
Oh woah oh oh oh, my cover girl
Whoa oh, my cover girl
Whoa oh, my cover girl
