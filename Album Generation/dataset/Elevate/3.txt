[Verse 1: Kendall]
I'll love you, if you ain't got nobody to love
And I'll adore you, if there's no one to adore
And I'll show you, if there's no one to show
And I'll know you, if you want somebody to know

[Verse 2: James]
Every time you come around
You put a lightning bolt on my face
Baby, everytime you come around
Girl, you take my breath away

And I just wanna breathe until I take you in
Cause I want you to breathe until you take me in
But the truth is

[Chorus: All]
She has no idea, no idea
That I'm even here, I'm even here
She has no idea, no idea
I'm standing here, I'm standing here
I'm standing here

[Verse 3: Carlos]
I'll kiss you, whenever you want to be kissed
How I miss you two seconds after you leave screaming "come back to me come back to me"
Let me please you, let me see you, let me take that heart of yours
And I'll be whatever you need me to be - the good guy, bad guy, just tell me baby

[Verse 4: Logan]
Every time you come around
You put a lightning bolt on my face
Baby, everytime you come around
Girl, you take my breath away

And I just wanna breathe until I take you in
Cause I want you to breathe until you take me in
But the truth is

[Chorus: All]

[Kendall]
Please tell me you can heal me
I'm expressing my love

[James]
Won't stop till I get you
I'm not letting up

[Logan]
I'm running to your heart
Like a kid in a store

[Carlos]
Take every ounce of love
And beg you for more
And beg you for more

[Chorus: All]
