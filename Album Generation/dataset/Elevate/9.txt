[Intro]
A superstar
That you're a star, a superstar
That you're a star, a superstar
That you're a star, star, star, star, star

[Verse 1: James]
Oh no, it's on tonight
And here we go
You're looking brighter now you know
So go ahead and let it go go go... go oh

[Verse 2: Logan]
Yeah, you're shining like a star
I wanna be where you are, are
Oh no, oh no
Let's take over this club
You're shining bright in the dark, dark
You light up the night

[Chorus: All]
You wanna wile out, then wile out
All eyes on you
It's going down, down, right now
You can't lose
You wanna wile out, then wile out
That's what you do
Talk of the town now
And you already know
That you're a star (ah ah ah) a superstar
That you're a star (ah ah ah) a superstar
That you're a star (ah ah ah) a superstar
That you're a star (ah ah)
And you already know

[Verse 3: Kendall]
It's time
I love this feeling can't we rewind
To the beginning of this crazy night
So, baby, we can let it go, go, go
Hey-ey-ey

[Verse 4: Logan]
You're shining like a star
I wanna be where you are, are
Oh no, oh no
Let's take over this club
You're shining bright in the dark, dark
You light up the night

[Chorus: All]


[Verse 4: Carlos]
Forget the moon, ignore the sky
'Cause the whole world is all yours tonight
Get it girl, it's your time
Shine until the morning light, the light

[Bridge: Logan]
(A superstar) oh the light
(That you're a superstar)
A superstar

[Chorus: All]

[Outro: Kendall]
Hey, yeah, woah, hey, yeah, woah
