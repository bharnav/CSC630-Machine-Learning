[Intro: All]
Guys like me
Like girls like you
And girls like you
Like guys like me (you know?)

[Verse 1: Kendall]
I blaze the night, in harbor nights
You dressin' light. itâ€™s fittin' right
It's fitting right

I Hear The Waves
And See You Wave
I'm Stayin' Put
You Say No Way

[Verse 2]
The Track Begins
You Pull Me In
I Touch Your Skin
You Trembiling
It's In Your Eyes
Your Here To Win
So Let The Game, Game Begin

[Pre-Chorus]
(All)
I--I, I--I
Wanna See
You--you, You--you
Telling Me
That, That
That You Got What I Need
Do, Pretty Girl Don't Speak

[Chorus]
Baby Show Me
By The Way You Hold Me
Way That You Control Me
Speed Me Up Or Slow Me
Oh, When I'm Lonely
Full O Stormy Weather
Can You Make It Better
I Heard What You Told Me
So-o Oh Show Me

[Verse 3: James)
Know What You Want
My Number For
Ain't Talked Enough
Let's Talk Some More
You're Kinda Cute
Don't Hit The Mute
Just Aim And Shoot
Or Get The Boot

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus][x2]
Guys Like Me
Like Girs Like You
And Girls Like You(you)
Like Guys Like Me(me)

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]

Oh, When I'm Lonely
Full O Stormy Weather
Can You Make It Better
I Heard What You Told Me
So-o Oh Show Me
