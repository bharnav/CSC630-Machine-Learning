[Verse 1]
I'm looking at you, yeah
You're looking at me
Something about you's got me going crazy
So what should I do? What can I say?
She's beautiful, unusual, the prettiest thing in the room

[Verse 2]
No one else compares to you
Just do what you do and I will be there for you
If you take my hand (my hand), just give me the chance (the chance)
Don't worry about a thing
Just dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
Hey!
It feels right girl just give me a sign
We're gonna party all night
Have the time of our life, yeah
I can't fight how I'm feeling' inside
We can party all night
Have the time of our life, girl

[Bridge][x2]
Oh oh woah
Oh oh woah
We're gonna party all night
P-par-party all night, girl

[Verse 3]
I can't help myself, cause girl you're so fly
I knew from the minute that I looked in your eyes
That you could be the one, you're just my type
Can't let you get away, it's obvious
I'm into you
No one else compares to you
Just do what you do and I will be there for you
If you take my hand (my hand), just give me the chance (the chance)
Say don't worry about a thing
Just dance, dance, dance

(Don't worry girl)
Hey!


[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
No we don't have to leave tonight
We'll stay together on the dance floor
Turn up the sound, turn down the lights
(The lights, the lights, the lights)
(Don't wanna let go, yeah)
Let's make a night we won't forget
And living with no regrets
And no one else but us
Til the sun comes up

[Chorus]
