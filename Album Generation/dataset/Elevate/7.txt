[Verse: Kendall]
Do you ever wonder, when you listen to the thunder
And your world just feels so small

[Verse 2: Logan]
Put yourself on the line and time after time
Keep feeling inside that they don't know you're alive
Are you on the mind or just invisible

[Verse 3: Carlos]
But I won't let you fall
I'll see you, through them all
And I just wanna let you know

[Chorus: All]
Oh, when the lights go down in the city
You'll be right there shining bright
You're a star and the sky's the limit
And I'll be right by your side
Oh, you know, you're not invisible to me
(Oh, you know) you're not gonna be invisible

[Verse 4: Kendall]
Do you ever think of, what you're standing at the brink of
Feel like giving up, but you just can't walk away

[Verse 5: Logan]
Night after night, always trying to decide
Are you gonna speak out or get lost in the crowd
Do you take a chance or stay invisible?

[Verse 6: Carlos]
But I won't let you fall
I'll see you, through them all
And I just wanna let you know

[Chorus: All]

[Verse 5: Logan]
Gotta look far, I'll be where you are
[Kendall]
I wish you could see what I see
[Logan]
So don't ask why, just look inside
[Kendall]
Baby it's all you need

[Verse 6: Carlos]
And I don't understand why you won't (you won't)
Take my hand and go
Cause you're so beautiful

[Chorus: All 2x]
And every time that
