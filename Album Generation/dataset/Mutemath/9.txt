[Chorus 1]
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives

[Chorus 2]
You are mine[x16]

[Verse]
There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just can not be controlled

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
They hold high their prized possession

[Chorus 2]
