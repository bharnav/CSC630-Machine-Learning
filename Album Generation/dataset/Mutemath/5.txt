[Verse 1]
Fall out, fall through, fall apart
The endless cycle once I start
Plan B, plan C, watch it go
Crumble into broken hopes

[Pre-Chorus]
All around I fall apart and can't you see I'm
All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm
All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm
All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm

[Chorus]
Mend it all, mend it all
Mend it all, mend it all
All I've torn, all I've run
To the ground, broken down
Come mend it all

[Verse 2]
Days are slipping through my hands
I'm holding on in sinking sand
To make it worse, I've made a mess
Can you make any sense of this?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Mend it all
Go!
Can you mend it all?
I could never mend it all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Mend it all[repeat until fade]
