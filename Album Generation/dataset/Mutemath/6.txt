[Verse 1]
How, how are we off on a tangent again?
Oh, we say what we say, and the poison is breaking our skin
Blame, what's to blame? It's an argument no one can win
'Cause at best we don't know, and it's wearing us thin

[Chorus]
And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
Just a glare has become all that we'll ever see there
And we stare at the sun, but we never see anything there
All of nothing's become all that we'll ever see there

[Verse 2]
Cards, we are cards in a wheel spun around on the truth
Maybe we don't need to know any more than we have to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The sky is always wondering, what are these arguments about?
You'd think we would notice our eyes are burning out
We should have learned by now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's all that we'll ever see there[x3]
And we stare at the sun[repeat until fade]
