Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down the Highway
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's 1977
Whole country's doing a fix
It's doomsday doomsday

Riding around, riding high
Riding around with my babe
Speeding on down the skyway
Speeding on down the skyway

Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down
On my way
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's doomsday doomsday
Speeding on down the skyway
100 miles per hour
Gonna crash
Gonna die
And I don't care

Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down the skyway
Speeding on down the skyway
Rocket rocket USA
