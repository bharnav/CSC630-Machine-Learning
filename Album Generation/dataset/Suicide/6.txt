[Verse 1]
Che, Che
Well, alright
Came to say
Let's all pray
Hurray, hurray

[Verse 2]
Che, Che
He's wearing a red star
Smoking his cigar
And when he died
The whole world lied
They said he was a saint
But I know he ain't

[Verse 3]
Che, Che
Hurray, hurray
Che, Che
Che, Che
Hurray, hurray
Hurray, hurray
