[Verse 1]
Tell me why the blind man cries
Oh, he sheds a tear because he just can't hear the children singing
How he used to fantasize
Of standing next to some children who are doing singing
Ah

[Pre-Chorus]
And the shoulders get colder and colder
And his tears
And his tears fall on deaf ears
Ooh

[Chorus]
(Falling apart)
At the seams and no-one seems to care
(You can't cry forever)
Eileen wouldn't want you to, I swear

[Verse 2]
Now, he's just an empty shell
Oh, since Eileen died, the other side seems so appealing
Compared to this living hell
Oh, she haunts his sleep, his wounds too deep for any healing
Ah

[Pre-Chorus]
With his arteries starting to harden
She is gone
She is gone and it's all wrong

[Chorus]
(Falling apart)
At the seams and no-one seems to care
(You can't cry forever)
Eileen would want you to, I swear
So there
