[Verse 1]
I hail from the flatlands of East Anglia
From a town that, once, could boast prosperity
She had trekked for many moons, from a land afar
But the cruel nets had emptied the northern sea

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said
"Hoots, I cannae get back tae me hoos in bonny Scotland"

[Chorus]
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

[Verse 2]
The elements had taken their toll on her
Her face was weather beaten and her hair greasy
I had never seen a set of eyes more hazeler-er
And a tear did fall, as she looked up at me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said
"Hoots, I cannae get back tae me hoos in bonny Scotland"

[Chorus]
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

[Solo]

[Bridge]
I shall travel with thee
For to see your folks in Scotland
With their blessing, on one knee
I shall ask for your left hand

[Chorus] (x2)
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

[Bridge]
I shall travel with thee
For to see your folks in Scotland
With their blessing, on one knee
I shall ask for your left hand
