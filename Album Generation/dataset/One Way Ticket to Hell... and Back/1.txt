[Verse 1]
Oh lord, I'm so bored
Living on my own
You're devilish and dirty
They say your pushing thirty
Well, pushing thirty stone

Oh Christ, I'm enticed
I want you in my sack
You're potty-mouthed and brassy
You're anything but classy
I've just got to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a while
Since I've seen that smile
But the old magic's still there

[Chorus]
And I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I just love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh crumbs, I'm all thumbs
Lying here with you
You're beautiful and busty
But I'm a little rusty
I've forgotten what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a while
Since I've made you smile
But the old magic's still there

[Chorus]
And I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I just love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah

[Piano/Guitar solos]

[Chorus]
I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I really love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I really love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
