They checked into the hospital New Year's Eve
Nothing to be done about that
Rainbows, daffodils; she's not naive
Symbolism's all crap

There's a big picture window in their room on the ward
With a view over Parliament Hill
But the view offers more joy than they can afford
When there's this much pain to kill

You know what hope is?
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar
A cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you?
Kick it's backside
Got no place in days like these

At dusk the darkness surrenders to color
As the fireworks streak the sky
And their window gives them the prettiest picture
Their useless luck makes her wanna cry

Then it turns midnight, the shitty old year spent
Another Mom gives her some sparkling wine
And she nearly gives in to the moment
But he'll still be sick in 2009

You know what hope is?
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar
A cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you?
Kick it's backside
Got no place in days like these

Just as she's thinking of pulling the blind down
A rocket bursts in front of her eyes
The city lit up; London's given a bright crown
And she tries and fails to stop spirits rise

You know what hope is?
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar
A cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you?
Kick it's backside
Got no place in days like these

You know what hope is?
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar
A cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you?
Kick it's backside
Got no place in days like these
