We were in a park
And I could jump so far
Seems that all I'd ever done
Were smoking pot out in the car
And this fear faded in
From my deputies in my old school

He says
"Ben, we both know you're a saint
I've been running through these fields
It's such a lovely place you drink
Is it your imagination
It's been years since I've been on my feet?"

Now it's Rocky's day
And it's on it's way
Sun won't be coming out today
Now it's Rocky's day
And it's time he went away
Sun won't be coming out today

Now I recall
But I don't know who
Told me Rocky was a runner
Won a medal back in school
Now at Christmas Momma says
You go up in Rocky's room
And as we watch the sun go down
He thanks me for my dreams
He says "I know you think you are
But you're not completely free
The man who's seen the spectre of the ...
Completely free."

Now it's Rocky's day
And it's on it's way
Sun won't be coming out today
Now it's Rocky's day
And it's on it's way
Sun won't be coming out today

Then he smiled
And he turned and walked away
He said over his shoulder
"I'll be gone when you're awake."

Now it's Rocky's day
And it's on it's way
Sun won't be coming out today
Now it's Rocky's day
And it's on it's way
Sun won't be coming out today
