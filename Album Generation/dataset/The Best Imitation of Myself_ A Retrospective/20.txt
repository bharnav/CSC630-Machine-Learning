[Verse 1]
So you wanted
To take a break
Slow it down some
And have some space
Well fuck you too

[Chorus]
Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
And don't forget
To give me back my black t-shirt

[Verse 2]
I wish I hadn't
Bought you dinner
Right before you
Dumped me on your front porch

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
