[Verse 1]
What I've kept with me
And what I've thrown away
And where the hell I've ended up
On this glary, random day
Were the things I really cared about
Just left along the way
For being too pent up and proud

[Verse 2]
Woke up way too late
Feeling hungover and old
And the sun was shining bright
And I walked barefoot down the road
Started thinking 'bout my old man
It seems that all men want to get into a car and go
Anywhere

[Chorus]
Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?

[Verse 3]
Don't you know I'm numb, man
No I can't feel a thing at all
'Cause it's
All smiles and business these days
And I'm indifferent to the loss
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
That's leading me round
I wonder if she knows which way is down

[Chorus]
Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?

[Bridge]
I poured my heart out
I poured my heart out
It evaporated, see?

[Verse 4]
Blind man on a canyon's edge
Of a panoramic scene
Maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random
Dangling on a string
Or slumped over in a vacant room
Head on a stranger's knee
I'm sure back home
They think I've lost my mind

[Chorus]
Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?
