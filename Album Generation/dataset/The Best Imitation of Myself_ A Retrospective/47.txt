If you want to be free
Then I want you to be
You're not mine anymore
You're public property

You're a slave to these people who
Don't even know you
You think they adore you
They do
Then they throw you away

[Hook]
Give the people what they want
You've got to give the people what they want
Got to give the people what they want
Rock star

You can shine all alone
But you still need your friends
To remind you you're nothing
Unless you're plugged in

Cause baby the truth is
You need their approval
To tell you you're cool
Hey, but look how you pay for it

[Hook]
Give
The people what they want
You've got to give the people what they want
Got to give the people what they want
Rock star
Rock star
Rock star

Oh, is that what you are?
There must be thousands of you

So your time is encroached now
Your image is dumbed down
You're full of it now
What about when it runs out
Maybe you'll come back
Yeah, maybe I'll be here
You're already gone
So just go
Cause they're waiting for you
Yeah, you
You've got to give the people what they want
Got to give the people what they
Want

Oh, is that what you are
