[Verse 1]
Howard, the strangest things
Have happened lately when I
Take a good swing
At all my dreams
They pivot and slip
I drop my fists and they're back
Laughing, Howard
My intention's become not to lose what I've won
Ambition has given way to desperation and I
Lost the fight from my eyes

[Chorus]
Boxing's been good to me, Howard
Now I'm told, "you're growing old"
The whole time you knew
A couple of years I'd be through
Has boxing been good to you?

[Verse 2]
Howard, now I confess
I'm scared and lonely and tired
They seem to think I'm made of clay
Another day
I'm not cut out for this
I just know what to say
I say

[Chorus]
Boxing's been good to me, Howard
Now I'm told, "you're growing old"
The whole time you knew
A couple of years I'd be through
Has boxing been good to you?

[Bridge]
Well sometimes I punch myself, hard as I can
Yelling "Nobody cares!"
Hoping someone will tell me how
Wrong I am

[Chorus]
Boxing's been good to me, Howard
Now I'm told, "you're growing old"
The whole time you knew
A couple of years I'd be through
Has boxing been good to you?

[Outro]
Has boxing been good?
Has boxing been good?
