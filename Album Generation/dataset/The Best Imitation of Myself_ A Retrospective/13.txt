[Verse 1: Ben Folds]
I wanna ask you:
Do you ever sit and wonder
It's so strange that we could be together for
So long, and never know, never care
What goes on in the other one's head?
Things I've felt but I've never said
You said things that I never said
So I'll say something that I should have said long ago:

[Refrain: Ben Folds (Regina Spektor)
(You don't know me) You don't know me at all
(You don't know me) You don't know me at all (at all)

[Verse 2: Ben Folds (Regina Spektor)]
You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me (paint me anything)
Any face that you wanted me to be seen
We're damned by the existential moment where
We saw the couple in the coma and
It was we who were the cliche
But we carried on anyway
So, sure, I could just close my eyes
Yeah, sure, trace and memorize
But can you go back once you know

[Refrain] x2

[Bridge: Ben Folds (Regina Spektor)]
If I'm the person that you think I am
Clueless chump you seem to think I am
So easily led astray
An errant dog who occasionally escapes and needs a shorter leash, then
Why the fuck would you want me back?!
Maybe it's because (You don't know me at all)
(You don't know me, you don't know me)

[Verse 3: Ben Folds (Regina Spektor)]
So, what I'm trying to say is
What (What?) I'm trying to tell you
It's not gonna come out like I wanna say it
Cause I know you'll only change it
(Say it)

[Refrain] x2

[Outro: Ben Folds]
What?
