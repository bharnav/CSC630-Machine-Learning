[Verse 1]
All is quiet. His tired eyes
See figures jotted down
And clothes all strewn around the bedroom floor
Now nothing's adding up
And nothing's making sense
She's sleeping like a baby
She doesn't know he wasn't meant for this

[Chorus]
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war all night
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war all night
I'm missing the war

[Verse 2]
He drove home again, pissed and beaten
It's really no big deal
It happens all the time, it's no big deal

[Chorus]
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war

[Verse 3]
'Til beads of sunlight hit me in the morning
So much time, so little to say
Time may fly and dreams may die
The shaking voice that tells him "go"
Still thinks he might; he knows he won't

[Chorus]
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war
