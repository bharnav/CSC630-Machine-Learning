Son, look at all the people in this restaurant
What do you think they weigh?
Out the window to the parking lot
At their SUV's, taking all of the space

They give no fuck
They talk as loud as they want
They give no fuck
Just as long as there's enough, for them

Gonna get on the microphone down at Wal-Mart
Talk about some shit that's been on my mind
Talk about the state of this great nation of ours
People look to your left, yeah, look to your right

They give no fuck
They buy as much as they want
They give no fuck
Just as long as there's enough, for them

Son, look at the people lining up for plastic
Wouldn't you like to see them in the National Geographic
Squatting bare ass in the dirt eating rice from a bowl
With a towel on their head and maybe a bone in their nose

See that asshole with a peace sign on his license plate?
Giving me the finger and running me out of his lane
God made us number one 'cause he loves us the best
Well he should go bless someone else for a while and give us a rest

(They give no)
Yeah, and everyone can see
(They give no)
We've eaten all that we can eat
