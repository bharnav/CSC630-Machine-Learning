Ahh, yeah

Girl, it's been a long time
Since we had it going on that way
Feelings getting stronger
Each and every day

Ahh

Wake up, oh yeah
I can feel you but you're not there
Holding on to thin air
Cause your dreaming of somebody else

Sexed up, our toes curl
Used to have it going on, girl
Washed our worries from this hard world
Now you're dreaming of somebody else

Girl, it's been a long time
Since we had it going on that way
Feelings getting stronger
Each and every day

Girl, it's been a long time
Since we had it going on that way
Feelings getting stronger
Each and every day

And if you call me back girl
(I'll be there, I'll be there)
Yeah, I will be your man
(I'll be there, I'll be there)
Yeah, you may lie your ass off
(You were there, you were there)
Girl

(You say the longer we go
The more your friends are freakin' out
Well, you oughta know that
I wouldn't stand between you
And my deafness screams sometimes
And my heart has gravity sickness
I just don't know
Is it me or is it you?
What are you trying to do?)

Girl, it's been a long time
Since we had it going on that way
Feelings getting stronger
Each and every day

Girl, it's been a long time
Since we had it going on that way
And it's getting stronger
Each and every day
