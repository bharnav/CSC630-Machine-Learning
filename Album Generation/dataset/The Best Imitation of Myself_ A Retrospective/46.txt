My nose was hurting
And I was shouting something
We were two kids
And I was fat and grumpy
Pushed you down some stairs
I said, "Your mom smelled like old underwear"
And then you split my lip
Will you tell me what I did

Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)
Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)

Shelly was pretty
She studied Algebra
She made some cookies
For the whole math class
She would talk to me
Even though I was a bully
I always knew she'd be somebody
Now she's the editor-and-chief
Of a free magazine
(ohh ohh﻿ ohh)

Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)
Tell me
(ahh ah ahh)x2

The kids formed a circle
Just like Enter the Dragon
I was defending myself
From snowballs coming at me
I said I'll come back﻿ then
And get you one on one
Oh yay, we're no longer friends
Cause they started to run
Screaming tell me what I did
Tears in my eyes

Tell me what I did
Tell me what I did
Tell me what I did
(ohh ohhh ohh)
Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)
Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)
Tell me what I did
Tell me what I did
(ohh ohh ohh)
Oh
