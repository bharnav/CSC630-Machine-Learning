I must give the impression
That I have the answers for everything
You were so disappointed
To see me unravel so easily
It's only change
It's only everything I know
It's only change
And I'm only changing

You want something that's constant
And I only wanted to be me
But watch, even the stars above
Things that seem still are still changing
