Good morning, son
I am a bird
Wearing a brown polyester shirt
You want a Coke?
Maybe some fries?
The roast beef combo's only nine ninety five
But it's okay
You don't have to pay
I've got all the change

[Chorus]
Everybody knows
It hurts to grow up
But everybody does
It's so weird to be back here
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting...
We're still fighting it

And you're so much like me
I'm sorry

Good morning, son
Twenty years from now
Maybe we'll both sit down
And have a few beers
And I can tell
You about today
And how I picked you up
And everything changed
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

[Chorus]

You'll try and try
And one day you'll fly
Away from me

It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

[Chorus]

And you're so much like me
I'm sorry
