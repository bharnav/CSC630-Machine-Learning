System on overdrive
System on overdrive

Do
Don't you want?
Do

When I fall asleep I leave the TV on
Flashes in my head ringing strong
It doesn't mean that
We're not alone yet
This is the night when I said
We could leave there

All the computers we connect with the
Connect the MIDI, Computers can do it

I'm in love
System on overdrive

Nothing to give em'
Computers without the system on
I'm in love

I'm in love
System on overdrive

When I fall asleep I leave the TV on
Flashes in my head ringing strong
Telling me to break inside
Telling me to say goodnight

When I feall asleep I leave the TV on
Flashes in my head ringing strong
It doesn't mean that
We're not alone yet
This is the night when I said
We could leave there

You're not alone yet
I'm in love
You're telling me that
I'm in love
