Can they hear me?
Through the TV
Even though you hear it Joey
So far away
So far away

Too much MIDI
Please forgive me
Oh no, I just can't cut it
So out of line
So out of line

Please forgive me
Through the TV

I'm on the freeway
In my fairlight
They say I'm crazy
Makin' sure these cuts are right

Free, damn crazy

They say I'm crazy
Makin' sure these cuts are right

No more lo-fi
Too much freeway
Synchronize my afterlife

Call me Mr. Clutch
