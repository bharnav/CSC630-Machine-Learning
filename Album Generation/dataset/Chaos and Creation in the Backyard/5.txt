[Verse 1]
Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning
What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

[Chorus]
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

[Verse 2]
Do you know the game crochet
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning

[Chorus]
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

[Verse 3]
As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning
