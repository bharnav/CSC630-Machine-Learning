[Verse 1]
Laugh, when your eyes are burning
Smile, when your heart is filled with pain
Sigh, as you brush away your sorrow
Make a vow, that's it's not going to happen again

[Chorus 1]
It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

[Verse 2]
You, know the wheels keep turning
Why, do the tears run down your face
We, use to hide away our feelings
But for now, tell yourself it won't happen again

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
It's too much for anyone, Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Smile, when you're spinning round and round
Sigh, as you think about tomorrow
Make a vow, that you're gonna be happy again

[Chorus 1]
It's not right, in your life
No more rain

[Chorus 2]
It's too much for anyone, Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh
