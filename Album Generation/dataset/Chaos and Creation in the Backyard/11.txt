[Chorus 1]
I'm very sure, this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before

[Verse 1]
Now I see, this is the way it's supposed to be
I met you and now I see
This is the way it should be

[Chorus 2]
This is the way it should be, for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when your on your own

[Verse 2]
So come to me, now we can be what we want to be
I love you and now I see
This is the way it should be[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
I'm very sure, this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)[x2]
This never happened before
