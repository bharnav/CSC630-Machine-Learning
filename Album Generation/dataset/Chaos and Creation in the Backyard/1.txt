[Verse 1]
How kind of you to think of me
When I was out of sorts
It really meant a lot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind as you
The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night

[Chorus 1]
I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

[Verse 2]
How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listen to the referee
As I was counted out

[Chorus 2]
I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

[Outro]
How kind of you to think of me
How kind of you
