[Verse 1]
I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to leave
So I don't have to hide, I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go
I've been sliding down a slippery slope
I've been climbing up a slowly burning rope
But the flame is getting low
I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Chorus]
You never need to worry about me, I'll be fine on my own
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've spent a lot of time on my own

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting till the danger passed
I don't know how long the storm is going to to last
If we're going to carry on
I'll been waiting on the other side, till your friends are gone
So tell me what I want to know
I'll be waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide
I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Outro]
I've been waiting on the side
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to go
