[Verse 1]
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her soul away
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world and its foolish ways

[Chorus]
How we spend our days casting love aside
Losing sight of life day by day

[Verse 2]
She saw poverty breaking up her home
Wounded warriors took her song away

[Verse 3]
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways

[Chorus]
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren
