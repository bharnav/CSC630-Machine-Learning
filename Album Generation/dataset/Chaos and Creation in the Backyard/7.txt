[Chorus 1]
A certain softness, in her eyes, facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could

[Chorus 2]
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked[x2]

[Verse 1]
A kind of sadness in her smile, captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (a kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before

[Chorus 2]
A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked[X3]

[Verse 2]
If even can even find the words to tell her
I wouldn't want to anyway
Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well, I couldn't betray her

[Verse 3]
The touch of wildness, in her style, haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (a touch of wildness)
More than I ever thought I could

[Chorus 2]
A touch of wildness her style
Got me hooked[X3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
