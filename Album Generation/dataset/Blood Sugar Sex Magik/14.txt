[Verse 1]
I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat

[Hook]
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

[Verse 2]
In my room, I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just in case you never knew
I miss you Slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

[Hook]
