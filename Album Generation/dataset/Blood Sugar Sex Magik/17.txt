Little miss lover
Where have you been in this world for so long
Well, I love a lover that feels like you
Would you like to tag along?
Well I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Ah sack it to me

Would you believe babe I've been looking for a sole
That feels like you
For some time
Excuse me while i see
If the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind

Well he signals me ok
So I think it's safe to say
I'm gonna make my play
Oh yeah
See me walk towards you baby
Ah give me some
Oh get into it

Hey hey little miss lover
Well now, there's so much you and me can discover
And i think we should start, hey, we should start right now, baby
Hey little miss lover
Ah little miss lover
Yeah little miss lover
Ah baby
Ah look at me baby
Little miss lover
Hey baby
Hey!
