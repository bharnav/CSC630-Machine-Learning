[Verse 1]
I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

[Hook]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

[Verse 2]
Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

[Hook]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)
