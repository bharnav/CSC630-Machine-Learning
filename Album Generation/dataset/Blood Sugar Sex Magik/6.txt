[Verse 1]
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

[Hook 1]
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away now
Good God purple haze now
Good God the baddest of brains now
Good God anyday now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now

[Verse 2]
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

[Hook 2]
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane now
Good God rackin' my brain now
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away

[Verse 3]
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
