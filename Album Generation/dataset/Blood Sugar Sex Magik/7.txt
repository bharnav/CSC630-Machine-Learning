[Verse 1]
I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend
Dark Ages never change
I can't comprehend
Kiss me we self destruct
Can you hear me Lord
Yes I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war

[Hook]
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P - Prodigies Of Peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am playing for a better day

[Verse 2]
Holy mother earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
For she has been raped
Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion please
That is what she needs

[Hook]
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P - Prodigies Of Peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am playing for a better day

[Verse 3]
Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night
Big thunder rumble fish
Did you get it right
Headstrong battle song
Exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye my love
Where did we go wrong

[Hook]
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P - Prodigies Of Peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am playing for a better day
