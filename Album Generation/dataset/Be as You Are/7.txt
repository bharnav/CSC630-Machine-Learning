[Verse 1]
Don't really know what day it is
Been rocking nine days in a row
All I know is it's hurricane season
And any minute she's gonna blow

[Verse 2]
I need a shave and I need some rest
I know some people are worried about me
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

[Verse 3]
Went through customs and immigration
Still this feels like home
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound
With a cooler and a bong

[Verse 4]
Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

[Bridge]
Tonight I don't need to feel famous
Out here all I feel is free

[Verse 5]
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
