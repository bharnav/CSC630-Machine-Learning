[Verse 1]
There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
It sways back and forth with the help of the winds
Seems to always be there, like an old trusted friend

[Chorus]
I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

[Verse 2]
From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of Cinnamon Bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

[Chorus]
I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

[Verse 3]
That chair was my bed one New Year's Night
When I passed out from too much Cruzan and Diet
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites
I swear got them all sitting right there
In that old blue chair

[Outro]
There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
