[Verse 1]
Sherry's living in paradise
Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach
And you know she came here from LA
Southern California could not hold her dreams
She's happy now it seems

[Chorus]
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise

[Verse 2]
Sherry's living in paradise
Somehow the salty air, it soothes her soul
Says it makes her whole
She gets hit on by the tourists
But she brushes it off 'cause she's heard every line
She just takes it in stride

[Chorus]
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise

[Outro]
She's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise
