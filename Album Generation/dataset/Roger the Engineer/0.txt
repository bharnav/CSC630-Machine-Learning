[Verse 1]
Meeting people along my way
Seemingly I'm on one day
Familiarity of things
That my dreaming always brings

[Chorus 1]
Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time

[Chorus 2]
Walking in the room I see
Things that mean a lot to me
Why they do I never know
Memories don't strike me so
Memories don't strike me so

[Verse 2]
It seems to me I've been here before
The sounds I heard, and the sights I saw
Was it real, was it in my dreams
I need to know what it all means

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 1]
Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time
