[Verse]
Seen a man standin' over a dead dog
Lyin' by the highway in a ditch
He's lookin' down kinda puzzled
Pokin' that dog with a stick
Got his car door flung open he's standin' out on highway 31
Like if he stood there long enough that dog'd get up and run
Struck me kinda funny
Seemed kinda funny sir to me
Still at the end of every hard day
People find some reason to believe

Now Mary Lou loved Johnny
With a love mean and true
She said baby I'll work for you everyday
And bring my money home to you
One day he up and left her and ever since that
She waits down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny to come back
Struck me kinda funny, funny yeah indeed
How at the end of every hard earned day
People find some reason to believe

[Harmonica]

Take a baby to the river Kyle William they called him
Wash the baby in the water take away little Kyle's sin
In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away
Take the body to the graveyard and over him they pray
Lord won't you tell us
Tell us what does it mean?
At the end of every hard earned day
People find some reason to believe

Congregation gathers down by the riverside
Preacher stands with his bible
Groom stands waitin' for his bride
Congregation gone and the sun sets
Behind a weepin' willow tree
Groom stands alone and watches the river
Rush on so effortlessly
Wonderin' where can his baby be
Still at the end of every hard earned day
People find some reason to believe
