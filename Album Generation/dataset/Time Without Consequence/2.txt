First you must go walking on your own
First you must go walking on your own
First you must go walking on your own
First you must go walking on your own
First you must go walking on your own
First you must go walking on your own

Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home
Maybe then we already are home

Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Gently down the stream now
Gently down the stream
Gently down the stream now
Gently down the stream
Gently down the stream now
Gently down the stream
Gently down the stream
Gently down the stream
