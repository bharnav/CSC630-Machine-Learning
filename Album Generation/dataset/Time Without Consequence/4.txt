[Verse 1]
Pale light this morning
Woke me
Slow pain I feel
Will not let me be

[Verse 2]
So much work to do
I don't know if I can
Trying so hard
So hard
So hard
But I'm just one man

[Verse 3]
Five years old I climbed up on the wall
My mother warned me but I took no heed
Like all creatures great and small
I took a fall and found out I could bleed

[Verse 4]
These days I'm afraid of everything
Suppose 'cause everything will die
Thought it was to love what they will lose
So much easier to lie

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Actually it's more like most of the time
But every now and then when I'm sleeping
I still have a dream that I'm flying

And I wake up crying
