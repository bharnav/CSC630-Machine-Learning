[Verse 1]
I wonder why
We are the way we are
Yes I wonder why
We are the way we are
And why
We only love each from afar

[Chorus]
This is how we are fading
This is how we are fading
Time
Time

[Verse 2]
You spend your days
Watching the door
Yeah you spend your whole life waiting
But you don't know what for
You have everything you need right here
Still you want more

[Chorus]
Oh this is how we are fading
This is how we are fading
Time
Time

[Verse 3]
Well I didn't come here
Looking for a soul
And I'm tired of watching dust
Collecting on a bowl
I'm a spirit trying to be human
I'm just a spirit trying to be human

[Chorus]
But I'm thinking this is how we are fading
This is how we are fading
Time
Time

[Bridge]
You hold on to yourself
You're afraid that you might
Get left behind
And so you hide your eyes
You're afraid that the light
Will make you blind
But it's time
It's time to shine

[Outro]
Yes it's time to believe in what you know
Time to believe in what you know
Time to believe in what you know
And you don't need strength to be strong
Time to believe in what you know
No, you don't need strength to be strong
Time to believe in what you know
Time to believe in what you know
Time to believe in what you know
Time to believe in what you know
Time to believe before you go
