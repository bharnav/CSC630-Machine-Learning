[Verse 1]
In the quiet of a shadow
In the corner of a room
Darkness moves upon you
Like a cloud across the moon
You're aware in all the silence
Of a constant that will turn
Like the windmill left deserted
Or the sun forever burn

[Chorus]
So don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
Your whole life is here
No eleventh hour reprieve
So don't forget to breathe
Keep your head above water
But don't forget to breathe

[Verse 2]
And all the suffering that you've witnessed
And the hand prints on the wall
They remind you how it's endless
How endlessly you fall
Then the answer that you're seeking
For the question that you found
Drives you further to confusion
As you lose your sense of ground

[Chorus]
So don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
Your whole life is here
No eleventh hour reprieve
So don't forget to breathe
Keep your head above water
But don't forget to breathe

Breathe

[Outro]
Don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
You know you are here
But you find you want to leave
So don't forget to
Breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
