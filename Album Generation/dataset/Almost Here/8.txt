[Verse 1]
Out of the box
Out of the kitchen
Out of the world she's grown so fearful of
I don't ever want to see you again
My friend
This is the end

[Verse 2]
Out of the house
She grabs the keys
Runs for the hills and doesn't leave a letter
That way the impact will be much better
Away from the man that she's grown so fearful of
I don't ever want to see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
Why oh why, do you wear sunglasses in the home
When the sun went down about an hour ago?
Life should not be that way

[Chorus]
Always up or down
Never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm grown
I've seen marriages fall to pieces
Now that I'm grown
I've seen friendships fall to pieces
Weekend warriors
And our best friends
The writers weren't kidding about how all good things must end
Then again some things
Then again some things are far too good
Some things are far too good to go ahead and let go

[Chorus]
Always up or down
Never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace

[Bridge]
We won't forget Tony or Johnny (oh, oh)
No matter how they miss us they still wish us the best on the road
Garrett took a plane to Paris, France
Now he's cooking up entr√©es for the pretty pretty French girls
Bookends
Blue and Clarity
To The Wall and Grace
Darkside
Wish and a toast to the late Figure 8
Weekend warriors and our best friends
The writers weren't kidding
But the good things will live in our hearts

[Chorus]
Always up or down
Never down and out
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces
