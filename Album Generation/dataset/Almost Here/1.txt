[Verse 1]
Wake up
Think fast
Three weeks have passed
We are changing
No sleep
No gas
No excuses will pass these lips

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're shaping up to be all you wish you could have been
To write the hits and to turn their heads
And to open eyes to a brand new season
A brand new season

[Chorus]
So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am

[Verse 2]
Wake up
Think fast
Three weeks have passed these lips

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're shaping up to be all you wish you could have been
To write the hits and to turn heads
And to open eyes to a brand new season
A brand new season

[Chorus]
So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am

[Bridge]
You'll see what we mean
You'll notice when we're gone

[Chorus]
So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am
