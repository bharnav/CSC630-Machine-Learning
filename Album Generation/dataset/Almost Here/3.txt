[Verse 1]
My eyes can't believe what they have seen
In the corner of your room you've stockpiled millions of my memories
Oh doctor, doctor
I must have gotten this sick somehow
I'm going to ask you a series of questions
And I want them answered on the spot
Right now

"Is it serious?"
"I'm afraid it is"
"Am I gonna die?"
"Well son
Death is gonna catch up to all one day
But yours is coming quicker than ours, than ours"
Some things I may have taken for granted again and again
Well here's what was said then

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold your head high heavy heart

[Chorus]
So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big
Planning

[Verse 2]
I never tried to make the best of my time
When I thought that I had plenty of it
Is this serious
I don't know what to think
Is it all a lie
Well one thing is for sure
I'm taken back to the glory days
When we were kids without a brash or bitter thing to say
Now my life is one big make it or break it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hold your head high heavy heart
Save your strength for the morning after

[Chorus]
So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
