[Intro]
Attention, attention
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room
If only
If only for one second

[Verse 1]
This table has taken a turn for the worse
Rock bottom
And over the edge
Well
It's not like it hurts that much anyway
Upside down and inside out
When I leave here I'm going alone
Well it's not like it
Not like it hurts much anyway

[Chorus]
Attention, attention
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room
If only
If only for one second
Will you hear what I have to say?
Did I mention when I see you it stings like hell
Due to the fact that we could have something that'll never happen
Did you hear what I have to say

[Verse 2]
This balance has weighed out our heart’s desire
I’m trying to make it alone
Well it’s not like it hurts that much anyway
Upside down and inside out
When I leave here I’m going alone
But I’m dying
I’m dying to touch
And it’s not like it
Not like it hurts much anyway

[Chorus: x2]
Attention, attention
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room
If only
If only for one second
Will you hear what I have to say?
Did I mention when I see you it stings like hell
Due to the fact that we could have something that'll never happen
Did you hear what I have to say
Attention, attention
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room
If only
If only for one second
Will you hear what I have to say?
Did I mention when I see you it stings like hell
Due to the fact that we could have something that'll never happen
Did you hear what I have to say

[Outro]
Attention
Upside down and inside out
