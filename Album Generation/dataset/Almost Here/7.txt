[Verse 1]
So there you are
And here I stand
As far as I remember
You weren't half bad
Your bedroom behavior was never more then checkmarks on bedposts
The more I remember we never had

[Pre-Chorus]
Get me out of the rain
You get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that nobody knows
Get me out of the rain
Get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that no one

[Chorus]
So suck your so-called pity down
Hey
That's not so bad is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
So suck your so-called pity down
Hey
That's not so bad is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths

[Verse 2]
So don't explain
'Cause I know exactly what you're going to say
Big words
Recycled phrases
And the bittersweet taste of other boys on your lips
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all
Now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all
You wanted it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Get me out of the rain
You get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that nobody knows

[Chorus]
So suck your so-called pity down
Hey
That's not so bad is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
So suck your so-called pity down
Hey
That's not so bad is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths

[Bridge]
Do you miss looking up from the floor at my face on a stage in a crowded room?
Well it's not the same
I bet you're still a sucker for those famous faces
Downtown
Looking down
Looking over the crowd
I hope you're out there looking at me now
Well it's not the same
Just look at how we've changed

[Chorus]
So suck your so-called pity down
Hey
That's not so bad is it
So take your cold
Cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
