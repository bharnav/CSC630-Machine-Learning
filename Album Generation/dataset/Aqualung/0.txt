Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa Aqualung

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time
The only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog
And warms his feet

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and
A cup of tea
Aqualung my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze?
When the ice that
Clings on to your beard was
Screaming agony (Hey!)
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea-diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like
Madness in the spring

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet

Oh oh oh oh oh

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and
A cup of tea
Aqualung my friend
Don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Guitar solo]

Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee

Aqualung, my friend
Don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod
You see it's only me

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa Aqualung
