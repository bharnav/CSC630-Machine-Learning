I'll see you at the weighing in
When your life's sum-total's made
And you set your wealth in godly deeds
Against the sins you've laid

So place your final burden
On your hard-pressed next of kin
Send the chamber pot back down the line
To be filled up again

Take your mind off your election
And try to get it straight
And don't pretend perfection
You'll be crucified too late

And he'll say "you really should make the deal"
As he offers round the hat
Well, you'd better lick your fingers clean
I'll thank you all for that

And as you join the good ship earth
And you mingle with the dust
Be sure to leave your underpants
With someone you can trust

And the hard-headed social worker
Who bathes his hands in blood
Will welcome you with arms held high
And cover you with mud

And he'll say "you really should make the deal"
As he offers round the hat
Well, you'd better lick your fingers clean
Well, I'll thank you all for that
