[Verse 1]
I'm giving you a piece of my mind
There no charge of any kind
Try a very simple test
You should just retrace your steps

[Pre-Chorus]
And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

[Chorus]
Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?

[Verse 2]
Think about a year ago
How we lived I'll never know
Conning people for a dime
Here's another piece of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Think back, back a little bit, baby
Back, back, all right

[Chorus]
Think, think, think back, baby
Think, think back a bit, girl
Think, think, think back, baby
Tell me who's fault was that, baby?
Tell me who's fault was that, baby?

[Verse 3]
Take a look inside yourself
You're not really someone else
Still, I am the same old me
You say I lack maturity

[Pre-Chorus]
But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back, alright!

[Verse 4]
We're not children anymore
We don't need to play with toys
Take a look and you will find
You're getting old before your time

[Chorus]
Think, think, think back, baby
Think, think, I said back a bit, girl
Think, think, think back, baby
Tell me who's fault was that, baby?
Tell me who's fault was that, baby?

[Outro]
I said think - you'd better think back a little bit
I said think - what about last year and the year before?
I said think - you promised me so much
I said think - don't you remember what you said?
