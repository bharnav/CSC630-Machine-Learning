[Intro]
It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own
It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 1]
All of the things that you used to do
If they're done now, well, they're done by you
It seems a big failing in a man
To take his girl for granted if he can

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 2]
There's no place where you can call home
Got me running like a cat in a thunder storm
Just a big bed and a telephone
Like the last remnants of a stately home

[Chorus][x2]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Verse 3]
Sit here thinking with your head of fire
Go think the same thing and never tire
Imagining the glow of her long clean hair
As she goes to sit on her own high chair

[Chorus]
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard, baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

[Outro]
It's not easy - a pretty tough thing
It's not easy - well, life's pretty rough
It's not easy - it's a hard time baby
It's not easy - it's a hard time baby
It's not easy - it's pretty hard...
