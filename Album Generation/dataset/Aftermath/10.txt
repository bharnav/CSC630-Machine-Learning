[Chorus 1]
Silver train is a coming
Think I'm going to get on now, oh, yeah
Silver train is a coming
Think I want to get on now, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Silver rain is a falling

[Chorus 2]
Falling up around my house, oh, yeah
Silver rain is a falling, falling up around my house, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
And I did not know her name[x2]
But I sure love the way that she laughed and took my money
And I did not know her name[x2]
But I sure loved the way that she laughed and called me Honey
Silver rain is a falling

[Chorus 2]
Falling up around my house, oh, yeah
Silver belles is a ringing
Ringing all around my house, ding, dong, oh, yeah
And I did not know her name[x2]
But I sure loved the way that she laughed and took my money
And I did not know her name[x2]

[Verse 1]
But I sure loved the way that she laughed and called me Honey
I'm going home on a south bound train with a song in my mouth[x2]
Silver train is a running
Think I'm going to get on now, oh, yeah

[Chorus 1]
