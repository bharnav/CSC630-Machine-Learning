[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, I'm looking for my face and I got no place to go

[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, pick your own mind and don't you touch mine no more

[Verse 1]
Still waiting here for a single idea
In your clothes and your hair, I wore it last year
Oh no, don't you follow me no more

[Chorus]
I said, Oh no, don't you copy me no more
I said, Oh no, don't you copy me no more
Well, the lines around my eyes are protected by a copyright law

[Verse 2]
Well, all the clubs and the bars and the little red cars
Not knowing why, but trying to get high
Oh no, don;t you follow me no more

Don't you follow, don't you follow
