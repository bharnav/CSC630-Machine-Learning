Last night I dreamt I held you with me
Close enough to feel you breathe
When I awoke I lay here empty
Caught between the want and need

Now in the darkness I am only
Thoughtful hopes and pieces mind
These dreams are all I've ever wanted
Found behind the closing eyes

How long we've been trying to reach you
We all fall down like this sometimes
Trying to reach you
I'm trying

Last night I dreamt I held you with me
Closer still to see you leave
When I awoke the fear of lonely
Gripped my heart in conscious sleep

Now in the darkness I lay empty
Hollow beaten like a drum
Sill water cages I am hoping
In these dreams to me you'll come

How long we've been trying to reach you
We all fall down like this sometimes
Trying to reach you
I'm trying

These fields alive with fire and ashes
Inside these fields we'll find oceans of ashes
When all your dreams have died
I don't want to die

Just keeping holding my hand
Because I'm trying to reach you
I'm never letting you go
Because I'm dying to keep you

I'm walking through your fields
Of broken flowers
They fall upon my face like tears for hours
If all we are we are
If all we are we are
To wake and call your name
In the tine hours
We all fall down
