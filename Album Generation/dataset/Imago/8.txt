Hold on
Decidely and so
Where the will is strong
The weak won't dare to go
Is this the end of us?
Beginning as we crawl
Is this the end of all?
Beginning as we fall
It's just one kiss of love divine
Here to hide you're
Lonely
I'm waiting for the end to crawl
Here beside you

Always open
And all of these precious things
Watch over me
Wash over me when I sleep
To find to fault to feel
These signs of life
There's something here
Is it real?

Let go
Let go of me this time
There
Hidden down below
And further from my mind
This silence is the darkest hole
Here to hide you
Always broken

Watch over me
Only when I sleep
Wash over me

Are you real inside me?
No one will hear me scream
No signs of life
There's something here
Is it real?
To have to hold to heal
These signs of life
There's something here
Is it real?
Watch over me
There's something
Is it real?
Wash over me
Only when I sleep
