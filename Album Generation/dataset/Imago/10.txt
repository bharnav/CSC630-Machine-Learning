In a fallen star
Do we confide?
Like the passenger
Cars crash collide
If our freedom fails
The world awake
On our shoulders scarred
One soul's mistake

Is it wrong to try?
When hope is gone
Am I?
Is this where the end will be?

At the fall of days
From light's blind side
To beneath your cage
From here we shine

Is it wrong to try?
When hope is gone
Am I?
And so at the end we'll see

How many wrongs to right?
The silence the suffering
Too many wrongs to right

It's the empty heart
The next in line
And the saving grace
Bound to find
