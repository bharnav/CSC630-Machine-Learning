Soft pallet breaking
Lost in aisles of white
Corridors are shaking
And I can see the lights

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Please release me
I can barely breathe

I watch the ground beneath
No more the want to be

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Don't fall we could have had it all
Another breath you're taking
Slow rise your love is suicide
This heart is slowly breaking
