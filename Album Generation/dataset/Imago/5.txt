Were you holding father's hand?
Did your mother bleed
And understand
How your whole life slipped away?
Fading under the grade
Did the world around you fail?
And were you hiding for us all to see?
When the world around you fails
When it all came down on me

Is it dark within your mind?
Does your body ache for love sometimes?
Is it cold within your room?
Did you pray they'd come back for you?
Did the world around you fail?
When it all came down on me

The answer's
Always here
Beneath your skin

I'm not
Coming down
Does it feel like this?
Sometimes
When the world stops turning
Long before they knew
Does it feel like this?
Sometimes
When it all stops working
Now

It's alright we dont have to think about it
It's alright we dont have to talk about it now

It's all right now
