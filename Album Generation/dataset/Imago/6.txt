I've got a head full of noise
Whispers are evidently
Resounding within a void
Lost in the distance. Memory

I've got a head full of choice
Each door the same direction
When nothing more than a voice
Echoes the same reflection

I gotta get out
I gotta get out of this

Underneath these satellites
Fall like rain
When you throw your arms around me
A world of walls surround me
I'm all right hope we'll be ok

I've got a heart full of hate
These hands are powerless to change
Is it the fear of the fate?
Reliving all that could have been

Until it won't let me be now
This weakness never ending
And still it won't let me be now
Stronger my will depending (?)

I gotta get out
I gotta get out of this

Underneath these satellites
Fall like rain
When you throw your arms around me
A world of walls surround me
I'm all right hope we'll be ok
It's ok

Am I holding on in vain
And I'm praying for a change?
All the wounds set deep within
Cold the walls you set around me

Am I holding on in vain
And I'm praying for a change
That's never coming?

In a memory I have found
Falling pieces hit the ground almost running

Am I holding on in vain
And I'm praying for a change
That's never coming?

I gotta get out
I gotta get out of this

It's just a memory of all that we could have been
It's just a memory and all that we could have seen
It's just a memory I've seen
It's just a memory I'll see
