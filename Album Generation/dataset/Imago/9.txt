Hope
You let me down
Again
Turn to stone loose ground
Cry
When you feel no more
Trust
You've been longing for

You let me down
Once again
You let me down
Once again
Again

It's a crime
That you blame me for
When we lie
Are they closing doors?
Are you slowly giving up?
Are you you slowly giving up?

Everybody runs
Hope
You let me down
Again
Turn to stone loose ground
Cry
When you feel no more
Trust
You've been longing for

You let me down
Once again
Everybody runs

It's a crime
That you blame me for
When we lie
Are they closing doors?
Are you slowly giving up?
Are you slowly giving up?

Everybody runs
