Soft Parrlet breaking
Lost in aisles of white
Corridors are shaking
And I can see the Light

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Please release me
I can barley breathe
I watch the ground beneath me
No more the want to be

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Waiting for something
Waiting for someone

Don't fall we could have had it all
Another breath you're taking
Slow rise your love is suicide
This heart is slowly breaking

Waiting for something

Waiting for someone to arrive
Waiting for something
Waiting for this day to arrive

Your hands upon me never give away
Temptaition haunts you
Your hand upon me never give away
Its walks besides me always
Besides me always
Besides me always

They're calling you from heaven
To walk towards the light

Hey, wait this time it's not too late
To stop this ship from sinking
Don't go so much you didn't know
It's never what you're thinking

I've waited for something
Waited for someone to arrive
I've wiated for something
Waited for this day to arrive

Your hands upon me never give away
Temptation haunts you
Your hands upon me never give away
I've waited for something...
