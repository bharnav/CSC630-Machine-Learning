Love, oh I hate to see you go
In the winter of our reason
Our hearts are drifting
Snow, pure as the flakes that hit the ground
Softly falling from the heavens
And the name on my lips is this song

I kept these pictures of you
And kept tellin' myself i will be fine
But these walls were built to keep us in
I never learned to fly
I tried so hard to find
In these arms you will be safe
But in this moment my love
You're all that lights my way
Home

It's the loneliest time of year
And it's the only thing I fear
And in my heart you're always here
It's the loneliest time of year

I call your name in the darkness
And only emptiness returns
On the broken roads we walk along
And as all we've know is burned
I tried so hard to find
In these arms you will be safe
But in this moment my love
You're all that lights my way
Home

It's the loneliest time of year
And it's the only thing I fear
And in my heart you're always here
It's the loneliest time of

Get out, get out, get out
Get away from here
The war is over and
Your way home almost clear
The only thing I fear
Is the loneliest time of...

It's the loneliest time of year
The loneliest time of year
