Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Sat In Vicky Park…

Let it all out, to a bottle, on a bench
He said this city, is a criminal, a highway man, a thief
Stole my perseverance
It made off with my mental health
It dumped me off at tower bridge with concrete on my feet and I’m struggling
Oh and I’m struggling
I’m looking for some guidance
Can you spare an ounce of strength?
So I can take this fucking sorry arse of mine back home to bed

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

And the bottle it said…
Everybody makes decisions they regret sometimes
Everyone makes certain judgements based on plans that never seem to find their way to a conclusion
They change tact, they double back on promises they’ve made to themselves
But you won’t find the answers at the bottom of a bottle
Cheap cider never paved the way for any kind of progress to be made
But for what it’s worth, it’s one thing that I know
You’ve got to let some parts die to let other parts grow

Oh

You’ll always make mistakes, you’ll always fuck shit up
You will sometimes make bad choices and blame that shit on bad luck
You will often face decisions that you do not want to make
And you’ll find yourselves on paths that you did not mean to take

There is always an answer
There is always a lesson
A lining of silver around every situation
And asking for help is not the same thing as failing
