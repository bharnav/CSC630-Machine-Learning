[Chorus]
"Is everybody coming undone?"
She asks me with a straight face
Sometimes its hard to tell the truth
When all I know all I know
Is we're all trying to stay afloat
That's the way it is, that's just the way it is

It feels like I've got to get away
Like there's got to be a better way
Because when you've got to get out
You've got to get out
And promises where I swear that I am fine
Are getting harder to keep
They're getting harder to believe

I should be old enough by now
To stop pulling at my hair
And tearing up my skin
Cause we're so young
It feels like we're so young

[Chorus]
"Is everybody coming undone?"
She asks me with a straight face
Sometimes its hard to tell the truth
When all I know all I know
Is we're all trying to stay afloat
That's the way it is, that's just the way it is

The cranes hang quietly tonight
As if to remind us that this is home
And that this is how we live now
With no back-up plan or way out
And from here I can see it all
Every false step that I made
And how I let it chip away
At the foundations that I am set upon
As I stood by again

But we are nothing without resilience
Cause we are all tied up in our own ways
Worst come to worst, failing everything
We pick up the broken pieces
And put them all back together again

[Chorus]
"Is everybody coming undone?"
She asks me with a straight face
Sometimes its hard to tell the truth
When all I know all I know
Is we're all trying to stay afloat
Stay afloat, stay afloat
