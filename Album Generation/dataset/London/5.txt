If this whole thing should fall apart, you know I'll still be here. And the city may sleep sound tonight but our hearts are pounding loud and clear. Yearning for that feeling, to know that we're not standing down, no we're not kneeling. Just you and I in this cold bitter air, I can't think of anything more sincere. This could be any day, this could be anywhere. I wish it was any day, I wish we were anywhere but here. And I can feel it all, heavy, simplicity slipping away. And they bury me, one by one, the problems that we keep letting in again. We danced with them until the sound of laughter ended. This could be any day, this could be anywhere. I wish it was any day, I wish we were anywhere but here
