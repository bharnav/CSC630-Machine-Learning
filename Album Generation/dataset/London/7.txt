I can hear it all from outside
The choked up sounds of another night
I'm breathing deep through clenched teeth
Watching my steps carefully
These concrete slabs and kurb cuts
Are looking more familiar by now
And the words escape me
I can't drag them up to say: "I'm sorry"
There's no excuses
We had such high hopes
We had such high hopes
But it's always difficult to keep everything balanced
To not leave anything behind
It's so hard to fall apart
When there's nowhere you'd rather land
So this is it: the choices that we made
Like not giving up just yet
I'm not giving up
Sometimes what it takes is to listen to what you say
And try to hear it
To try to feel it
