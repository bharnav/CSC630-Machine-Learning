[Verse 1:]
This could have been avoided
It could have been kept at bay
But tables turn and lessons
Some can only be learned through punishments for past mistakes

[Verse 2:]
Back on level ground
Will we ever find ourselves again?
Past thoughts of giving up
Once bottled till they erupt
Once buried and covered
Hidden and smothered are gone just like the

[Bridge:]
Past few years in a city
That magnified our fears
And made it far to easy
To blame London
Than it was to fault myself
A weak man beaten sat at bus stops freezing

[Refrain:]
On the way home, 26 to Cassland Road
But she doesn't want to get off there
No she doesn't to stop there
She doesn't want to go
Where tired lines repeat themselves
I love you's don't mean shit right now
Shutting down
Fuck you, London. I'm out

[Verse 3:]
Well I still act blind
I still have violent thoughts at times
I still tend to oversimplify
Certain situations like the time
She told me that she fucked him and I thought:

[Verse 4:]
I can't believe this
Did she not know that I loved her?
I'm going to smash this bitches face in
Find the cunt and stab the fucker
Someone's going to die tonight

[Bridge:]
But you know that it's not right
To punish her when you couldn't
Ever say that you never did play your part
You never did shit that you shouldn't
That you never did things that you said that you wouldn't
You never said shit that you wish that you hadn't now

[Refrain]
