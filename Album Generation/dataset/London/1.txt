Give me East London summer
Give me under the radar and I'm done
My name is no longer low level worker I'm gone
I'm gone where bank accounts have no weight
Where the 26 takes me all the way past landlords and managers
Where I only move in straight lines forward now
I only move in straight lines forward now
Give me East London summer
Give me under the radar and I'm done
My name is no longer low level worker I'm gone
And I'm taking this lesson with me
The worst mistake to make is to be afraid to make mistakes
And I can't believe this took so long to learn
It should be so obvious
Like a man cannot be measured by the number of people he's f*cked
Like numbers on a payslip are no indication of worth
My relationship with reality
It comes and goes
And we rarely see eye to eye
Give me East London summer
Give me under the radar and I'm done
My name is no longer low level worker I'm gone
I only move in straight lines forward now
