To draw a line under it
All the bitterness
Means letting go
And forever forgetting it

Because I spent all my nights awake
Stuck in the same place
Finding out in the hardest way
That nothing worthwhile comes easily

This ain't the easiest way to do anything
To pull up roots that are buried deep
But it'd be alright
Be alright as long as the slate's clean
And I can't blame problems on concrete
Failings on the buildings around me
So I'll take it all to the city

Yeah we all have bad habits
And we all act as addicts
When there's something we want
And we don't stop until we have it

Yeah I get mad at shit when it doesn't go my way
But I'm finally learning
You can't always do things the easy way

This ain't the easiest way to do anything
To pull up roots that are buried deep
But it'd be alright
Be alright as long as the slate's clean
And I can't blame problems on concrete
Failings on the buildings around me
So I'll take it all to the city
