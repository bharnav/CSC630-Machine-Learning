If you need it, I can bear the weight a while, I can carry you. We can take the worst part, tear it down and cut it up, bury the pieces and mark the spot; I will carry you to a destination far from there. And if thats what it takes, my shoulders and my legs to break, my back to bend and my hands to shake, I will carry you. When memories of past events get tangled up inside your head with certain thoughts that you can't suppress, I will carry you to a destination far from there. Long gone
