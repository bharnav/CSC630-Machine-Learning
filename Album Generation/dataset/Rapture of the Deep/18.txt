[Verse 1]
Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown

And cold
Cold spirits of ice
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known

And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers

[Verse 2]
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see

The voice of ages in your mind
Is aching with the dead of the night
Precious life (your tears are lost in falling rain)

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers
