[Verse 1]
Everybody has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Anyone in this place can tell you to your face
Why you shouldn't try to love someone

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows it never works
Everybody knows and me
I know that door that shuts just before
You get to the dream you see

[Verse 3]
I know all too well how to turn, how to run
How to hide behind a bitter wall of blue
But you die inside if you choose to hide
So I guess instead I'll love you
