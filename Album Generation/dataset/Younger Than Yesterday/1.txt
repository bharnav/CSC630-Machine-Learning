[Verse 1]
Have you seen her face?
Her eyes reflect the colors in the sky
A warm familiar place
To be swept into whenever she's close by
Makes me wonder why

[Chorus]
Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

[Verse 2]
Must be the way she walks
A style made up to capture all she needs
No time spent on loose talk
If your luck runs right, she might see you tonight
Everything in sight

[Chorus]
Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

[Verse 3]
You'll find you're locked in her spell
All the sights and sounds, your senses will be found
And only time will tell
How much love can be to wait so patiently
Wait and see

[Chorus]
Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye
