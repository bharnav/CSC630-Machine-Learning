[Chorus]
I think that maybe I'm dreaming

[Verse 1]
I smell cinnamon and spices
I hear music everywhere
All around kaleidoscope of color

[Chorus]
I think that maybe I'm dreaming

[Verse 2]
Maids pass gracefully in laughter
Wine-colored flowers in their hair
Last call from lands I've never been to

[Chorus]
I think that maybe I'm dreaming

[Verse 3]
Suns flash on a sort of prism
Bright jewels on the ladies flashing
Eyes catch on a shiny prism

[Verse 4]
Hear ye the crying of the vendors
Fruit for sale, wax candles for to burn
Fires flare, soon it will be night fall

[Chorus]
I think that maybe I'm dreaming
I think that maybe I'm dreaming
I think that maybe I'm dreaming
