[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me, don't say you care
You're so far away
Telephone communication, only a three minute elation
When I hear your voice

[Chorus]
Through love and trust, it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between you and me
You and me

[Verse 2]
All the days have turned to years, only emphasize my fears
Since you said goodbye
I can hear your voice at night, I can read the words you write
It's only love

[Chorus]
Through love and trust, it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between you and me
You and me

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Through love and trust, it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between you and me
You and me
You and me
