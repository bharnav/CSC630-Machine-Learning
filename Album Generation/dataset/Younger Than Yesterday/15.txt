Here it comes again
It's going to happen to me
Here it comes
I should have learned to duck
She's going to say
She's going away

And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes
It looks just like the last wave I drowned in
Here it comes
And I'm so far from shore

She's going to go
And take her trinkets

And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes again
The night is going to fall
Here it comes
She's going to say good-bye
She's going to go
And leave only me

And I will have to live without her and survive
