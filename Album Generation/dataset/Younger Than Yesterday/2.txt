[Verse 1]
C.T.A.-102
Year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you're there
We can hear them loud and clear

[Verse 2]
We just want to let you know
That we're ready for to go
Out into the universe
We don't care who's been there first

[Verse 3]
On our radio telescopes
Science tells us that there's hope
Life on other planets might exist

[Verse 1]
C.T.A.-102
Year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you're there
We can hear them loud and clear

[Outro]
[Alien dialogue]
