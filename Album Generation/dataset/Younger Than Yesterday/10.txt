[Verse 1]
You keep saying no to her
Since she was a baby
You keep saying no to her
Not even maybe

[Chorus]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 2]
You say there's a limit there
She can't go past that
She don't believe you
She don't think that's where it's at

[Chorus]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 3]
You say she can't change that
It's the way you've always done it
She don't care about that
She thinks you've just begun it

[Chorus]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 4]
You say it's a dead old world
Dull and unforgiving
I don't know where you live
But you're not living

[Chorus]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 1]
You keep saying no to her
Since she was a baby
You keep saying no to her
Not even maybe

[Chorus]
Why?
Why?
