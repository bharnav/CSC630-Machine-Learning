[Verse 1]
Crimson flames tied through my years
Flowing high and mighty trapped
Countless fire and flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges soon", said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

[Verse 2]
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate", I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

[Verse 3]
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

[Solo]

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

[Verse 4]
My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
