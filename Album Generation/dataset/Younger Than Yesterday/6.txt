[Verse 1]
One day you came into my mind
And everything looked as though it was all mine
Loveliness to gaze upon
To feel your magic pulling me away

[Chorus]
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
Then I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do

[Verse 2]
Often think of times when all your thoughts and words
Come close to making me lose my mind
Moment now recalling all the time-involving minutes
That we spent alone

[Chorus]
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
Then I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do

[Verse 1]
One day you came into my mind
And everything looked as though it was all mine
Loveliness to gaze upon
To feel your magic pulling me away

[Chorus]
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
Then I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do
