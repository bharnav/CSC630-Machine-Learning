[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been down, but never this down
I've been lost, but never this lost

[Chorus]
This is my confession
I need your heart
In this depression
I need your heart

[Verse 2]
Baby, I've been low, but never this low
Iâ€™ve had my faith shaken but never hopeless

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I haven't always been strong, but never felt so weak
All of my prayers, gone for nothing
I've been without love, but never forsaken
Now the morning sun, the morning sun is breaking

[Chorus][x3]
