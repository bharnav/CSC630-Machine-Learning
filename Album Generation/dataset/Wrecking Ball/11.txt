[Verse 1]
I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea
With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me
I come upon strange earth and a great black cave
I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave

[Chorus]
We've been swallowed up[x2]
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up

[Verse 2]
The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east
Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast
A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup
You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We trusted our skills and our good sails
Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail

[Chorus][x2]
