[Verse 1]
Gray morning light spits through the shade
Another day older, closer to the grave
Closer to the grave and come the dawn
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Chorus]
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock son, carry it on
I’m trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Verse 2]
I always loved the feel of sweat on my shirt
Stand back son and let a man work
Let a man work, is that so wrong?
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Chorus]
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock son, carry it on
What's a poor boy to do in a world gone wrong?
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Verse 3]
Freedom son’s a dirty shirt
The sun on my face and my shovel in the dirt
A shovel in the dirt keeps the devil gone
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Chorus]
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock son, carry it on
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song?
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Verse 4]
Gambling man rolls the dice, workingman pays the bill
It’s still fat and easy up on banker’s hill
Up on banker’s hill, the party’s going strong...
Down here below we’re shackled and drawn

[Chorus]
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock son, carry it on
I’m trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock son, carry it on
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song?
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn

[Outro: Cindy Mizelle]
I want everybody to stand up
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
You know we got to pray together
I want you to stand up
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
