[Verse 1]
No one ever found it
Ain’t no school ever taught it
No one ever made it
Ain’t no one ever bought it

[Chorus]
But baby, you’ve got it
Baby, you’ve got it
C’mon and give it to me

[Verse 2]
Ain’t no one can break it
Ain’t no one can steal it
Ain’t no one can fake it
You just know it when you feel it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can’t read it in a book
You can’t even dream it
Honey, it ain’t got a name
You just know it when you see it

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, now, listen up my reckless love
It’s precious so don’t waste it
Can’t tell you what God made it of
But I know it when I taste it

[Chorus 2]
Baby you’ve got it
Baby you’ve got it

[Verse 5]
You got it in your bones and blood
Yeah, you’re realer than real ever was

[Chorus]
