[Intro: Alan Lomax]
I'm a soldier... soldier...

[Chorus: Michelle Moore]
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

[Verse 1: Bruce Springsteen]
Rise up, shepherd, rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hill
The stars have faded, the sky is still
The angels are shouting “Glory hallelujah”

[Chorus: Moore]
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground

[Verse 2: Springsteen]
Forty days and nights of rain washed this land
Jesus said the money changers in this temple will not stand
Find your flock, get them to higher ground
The floodwater’s rising, we’re Canaan bound

[Chorus: Moore and (Lomax)]
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
(I'm a soldier...)

[Verse 3: Springsteen]
Tend to your flock or they will stray
We’ll be called for our service come judgment day
Before we cross that river wide
The blood on our hands will come back on us twice

(I'm a soldier...)
[Verse 4]

[Springsteen]
Rise up, shepherd, rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hill
Stars have faded the sky is still
Sun's in the heavens and a new day's rising
[Moore]
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
[Bridge: Moore]
You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best
That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest
You raise your children and you teach them to walk straight and sure
You pray that hard times, hard times come no more
You try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom’s dropping out
Where you once had faith, now there’s only doubt
You pray for guidance, only silence now meets your prayers
The morning breaks, you awake, but no one’s there
No one's there....

[Outro]

[Springsteen, Lomax]
 
There's a new day coming
 
I'm a soldier
 
Oh, a new day's coming
 
I'm a soldier
 
Oh, a new day's coming
 
I'm a soldier
 
There's a new day coming
[Victorious Gospel Choir]
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
We've been traveling over
Rocky ground, rocky ground
[Coda: Moore]
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
We’ve been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground
