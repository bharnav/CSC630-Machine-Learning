[Verse 1]
Never mind the face that you put on in front of me
And never mind the pain you've put me through
'Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
It makes me doubt all of this
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well, it's not me
Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

[Verse 2]
Forget about the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Never mind the lies that you told my tears
'Cause every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
You made me doubt all of this
Is that what you're waiting for?

[Chorus]
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well, it's not me
Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well, it's not me
Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

[Bridge]
I don't know how I can face this pain
I'll keep it inside so you can't see
I don't think I can go on this way
'Cause it's not me
