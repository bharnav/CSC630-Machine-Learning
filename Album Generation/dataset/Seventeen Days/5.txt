[Verse 1]
I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and left those fears inside
And I wanted to be anyone else
Only to find that there was no one there but me

[Chorus]
But I woke up to the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me

[Verse 2]
I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could've screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say

[Chorus]
But I woke up to the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me

[Bridge]
That's out there somewhere
And it can't be that far away
That's where I'll find myself
And I'll find my way out
That's where I'll find out

[Chorus]
But I woke up to the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me
