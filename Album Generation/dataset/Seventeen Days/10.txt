[Verse 1]
You're stuck on a chain
And your toeing a lie
Seems like every time that you catch up
You only fall behind
And you're trapped inside this world you made yourself

[Chorus]
But that's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
That's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me

[Verse 2]
There is always someone to blame
For the things you do yourself
You think that everything that's going wrong
Is because of someone else
And you're trapped inside this world you made yourself

[Chorus]
And that's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
That's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
And it's bigger than me
(Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah)

[Interlude]
'Cause I'm on the outside and I'm looking in

[Chorus]
And that's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
That's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
'Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
