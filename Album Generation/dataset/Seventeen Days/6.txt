[Verse 1]
You said "I got something to say"
Then you got that look in your eye
"There is something you've got to know"
And you said it as you started to cry
"I've been down the wrong road tonight
And I swear I'll never go there again"
I've seen this face once before
And I don't think I can do this again

[Chorus]
There's something I can't see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

[Verse 2]
As you turned to walk away
I saw another look in your eye
And even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be your goodbye
You say that you're sorry
And you say now that it hurts you the same
Is there something here to believe
Or is it just another part of the game?

[Chorus]
There's something I can't see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Behind those eyes you lie
Behind those eyes you hide

[Chorus]
There's something I can't see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

[Outro]
There's nothing I can say
That's ever gonna make you change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide
Behind those eyes you hide
