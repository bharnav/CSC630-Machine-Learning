[Verse 1]
Lay me down
Wash this blood off my hands for me while I cry out
Don't let me die before I go to sleep
And I can't keep going
But I cannot start again

[Chorus]
This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen
But never will I break

[Verse 2]
These walls I make
They could hold me in and hold me back today
Oh but tomorrow's new
Then I'll walk right out and walk right over you
If you hear me screaming
Please don't let me fall again

[Chorus]
This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen
But never will I break

[Interlude]
My time is on its way
I'll fall but I won't break

[Chorus]
This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen
But never will I break
