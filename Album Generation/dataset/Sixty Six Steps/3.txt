When the stars up in the sky
When the lights along the street
When the TVs in the mo-tel shine

When the fingertips are fro-zen
When the empty wind starts closing
If they've got one they're all going, home

We're just sitting here, all by myself
You and me, nobody else but me
Sometimes shadows are the only light we see

Every night somebody's cryin'

Down the alley, on the cold, cold, ground
Someone's running, but they'll never, never, think

There's a shadow underneath the trees
Someone running, someone no one needs
Sometimes darkness is the only light we see

There's a shadow underneath the tree
Someone running, someone no one needs
Sometimes darkness is the only light we see
