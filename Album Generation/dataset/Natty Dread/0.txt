[Verse 1]
You are going to lively up yourself, and don't be no drag
You got to lively up yourself, oh, Reggae is another bag
You are going to lively up yourself and don't say no
You got to lively up yourself, because I said so

[Chorus]
You rock so, you rock so
Like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so
Dip through my door
You come so, you come so
Oh yeah! (like I do adore)
You skank so, you skank so, be alive today

[Verse 2]
You are going to lively up yourself and don't say no
You lively up yourself, big daddy says so
You lively up yourself, don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, because reggae is another bag

What you got that I don't know
I'm trying to wonder, wonder, wonder
Why you wonder, wonder why you act so
Did you hear what the man said
Lively up your woman in the morning time, you all
Keep lively up your woman when the evening come
And take her, take you, take you, take you

[Chorus]
You rock so, you rock so
Like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so
Dip through my door
You come so, you come so
Oh yeah! (like I do adore)
You skank so, you skank so, be alive today

[Outro]
What you got in that bag you got banging there?
What you say you got?
I don't believe you!
