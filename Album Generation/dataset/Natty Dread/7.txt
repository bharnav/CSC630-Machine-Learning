[Intro]
Yeah! Oh, yeah! Now!

[Chorus 1]
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too (doo-oo-oo-oo-oo!)
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too, Yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'm saying, Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Talking blues (talking blues), talking blues (talking blues)
Your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been down on the rock for so long (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)
I've been down on the rock for so long (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)

But I, I'm going to stare in the sun
Let the rays shine in my eyes
I, I'm a going to take a just-a one step more
Because I feel like bombing a church
Now, now that you know that the preacher is lying
So who's going to stay at home
When, when the freedom fighters are fighting

[Chorus 2]
Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Talking blues (talking blues), keep on talking blues (talking blues)

They say, you hear what they say
Didn't you hear

[Chorus 1]
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock stone rock stone was my pillow (doo-oo-oo-oo-oo!)
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too, Yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'm saying, Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
I seem to wear a permanent screw
Talking blues (talking blues), talking blues (talking blues)
Your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)
