[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way (way)
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As if it was log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge]
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
So woman don't cry
No, woman
(No woman, no cry)
Oh my little sister, don't shed no tears
(No Woman, no cry)
Yeah

[Guitar breakdown]

[Verse 3]
I  said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As if it was log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage, yah
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge 2]
No woman, no cry
I said: no woman, no cry
Ooh sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Woman no cry, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry

[Chorus]
Little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
