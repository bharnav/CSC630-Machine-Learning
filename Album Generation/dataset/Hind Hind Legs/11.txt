Jane has no love
(Jane has no love)
Jenna Jenna's got not love
(She's got no love)
She sits down listening to her tapes
(Even me i don't have any love)
She takes a taste but doesn't take

When it's wrong it's right and it's wrong tonight

The lion eats the wildebeast
(chop chop)
The lion eats the wildebeast in spain
The lion eats the wildebeast
(chop chop)
The lion eats the wildebeast in spain

Jane
She wants to run away
Away from the pirhanas
Away from the pirhanas

Jane
She wants to run away
Away from the pirhanas
Away from the pirhanas

Jane has no love
Jenna Jenna's got no love
She sits down listening to her tapes
Her ticker ticker ticker tape

When it's wrong it's right and it's wrong tonight

The lion eats the wildebeast
(chop chop)
The lion eats the wildebeast in spain
The lion eats the wildebeast
(chop chop)
The lion eats the wildebeast in spain

Jane
She wants to run away
Away from the pirhanas
Away from the pirhanas

Jane
She wants to run away
Away from the pirhanas
Away from the pirhanas

Jane
She wants to run away
Away from the pirhanas
Away from the pirhanas

Jane has no love
Jenna Jenna's got no love
She sits down listening to her tapes
Her ticker ticker ticker tape

When it's wrong it's right and it's wrong tonight
