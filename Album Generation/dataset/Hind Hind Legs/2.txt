I need some dignity
Ohhhhh

Im sorry
Im sorry
Im sorry

Well alexandra wrote the botubs
She waited for the aftershow
Well alexandra climbed the fences
To get somewhere she already knows she don't wanna go

The girl is wild
She'll wear puppy doggy pattern pijamas underneath all of her clothes
She likes to feel comfy
She feels this moowey might help her do so
Hope for the last she can't be comfortable all the time

You know shes always confronted
And something and stumped with
The gaises of others
The gaises of others
The gaises of others

You can always take your car
And go to work
Oh baby, don't over drive
Because

I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you

Hey there johnny
Flactonic tactonic talk to
Say, some think i'm okay
Safe to the light of living

Mr. fleece
Your talking to the guy with the penis
Don't smile don't you shake
You've lost your break
And its fake fake absolutly fake fake fake absolutly fake and

I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you
I really really really really really like you
