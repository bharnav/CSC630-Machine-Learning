I know I've been destructively anxious
But I have some beauty within me now
I know my personalitys not perfectly cultish
But you can help it if (?) your sattire
It came from me and my brain
Call it soul
It came from me and my brain
Butterflys should crawl
My legs (?)
But if I crawl over the ledge
The ledge the ledge took me in
But if your ledge, if just a fire
Then let the fire stain my clothes
But if my clothes are glued to my skin
Then take some (?) and rub it in

And I'm so ugly in the morning again
And I'm so mildly decorated
Yeah I'm so lonely when I brush my teeth
And I'm so mildly decorated

I know my fingers are veiny and stricking
But they protect the beauty thats in me now
I know I'm not comfortable with you and your friends and the large scale situations that you create
They tend to make me anxious, and these days I'm trying to avoid that

They came from me and my brain
Call it soul
They came from me and my brain

I like the chapped skin above your eyes
I like the chapped skin above your eyes
Even when you complain about my hives
I like the chapped skin above your eyes

Kittens kittens cardio cardio
Where do you wanna go?
Swordfish and the wedding dish and Everyone knows its a go
Kittens kittens cardio cardio
I dont wanna find the way
They found this place and it was called (?)

Cause I'm so ugly in the morning again
And I'm so mildly decorated
Yeah I'm so lonely when i brush my teeth
And I'm so mildly decorated

Over the mountian
Under your pill
I will pave it down
Slide through the latch key
Rub me with a cold drink
We will grow on the hill
We will grow with the hill
