Frantic no more i could use
In the comforts and it comforts
Useless no more i could choose
And when we're depressed we try hard not to remember all of the sap that the trees they did deliver
Im Not Coming Down!
Lovely you think you're lovely?
Well you ain't lovely any more
I am just a tin man
A veritable tin man
