Ooh you shocked me
We were makeshift lovers
And nobody knew ever again
Ever again
We were makeshift lovers
Encroaching environmental legislation
We didn't win win win
Ag ra va tion
Ag ra va tion
Who has a heart?
I have a heart
Who has a heart?
I have a heart
We were makeshift lovers
And nobody knew
And no one really wanted to, ever again
We were makeshift lovers
And she didn't know ever again
Ever again never again
Bruce come sit in my lap
Bruce come sit in my lap
Bruce come to my lap
Ooh you shocked me
Ooh you shocked me
You shocked me good
Ooh you shocked me
Ooh you shocked me
You shocked me good
I wish i could find a fluke in the bag of love
I wish i could find a fluke in the bag of love
