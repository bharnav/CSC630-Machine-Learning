Lovers, they meet guided by master planners
Mines name is lauren, and she needs a manacure
Oh when we've taken in all of those lovey-doveys
We'd laugh if we were younger x4

Photocorners frame your co-operation
Enjoy the cross streets, sorry for the ruffle carpets
Oh when you've gotten in, you'll spare those lovey-doveys
We'd laugh if we were younger x4

Used store bow-ties bring breath a little closer
( ? ), and i fumbled the invatation
Oh how i'd like to say "How was your day, oh sweet lovey-dovey?"
We'd laugh if we were younger x4

All aboard for town{?}
I'm tasteing all the sounds{?}
I'd guess if i was allowed{?}
( ? )
