You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice

Oh no, tears to drown us in
Oh no, falter down to it
Oh no, feels I better hop to it

Oh my knives
Your brain's on fire
Your growth not going to survive
I was a virgin at Indiana
You were supposed my ship again
I was alone
Now I'm in love
All alone on a countryside
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
What am I doing on a countryside?

You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice

Oh no, tears to drown us in
Oh no, falter down to it
Oh no, found out that you found me in

Oh my knives
Your brain's on fire
Your bones are not going to survive
I was a virgin at Indiana
You were supposed my ship again
I was alone
Now I'm in love
All alone on a countryside
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
What am I doing on a countryside?

You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice
You made the wrong choice

Oh no, tears to drown us in
Oh no, falter down to it
Oh no, the color I love I love lock me in

Oh my knives
Your bones on fire
Your growth is not going to survive
I was a virgin at Indiana
You were supposed my ship again
I was alone
Now I'm alone
All alone on a countryside
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
What am I doing on the countryside?
