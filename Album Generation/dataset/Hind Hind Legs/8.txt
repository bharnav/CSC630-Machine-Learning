You're my lion
You're my echintauh huh huh
Am i a tender thing trapped deep in a faulty shade
Am i a creature?
Can i be your creature?
Am i your last dance
For prom or graduation yea?

Oh beat down
She said shell always be my
You're my science queen
Am i a ship wreck?
Am i faltering?
Do you think i have faltered
Oh beats down
She said shell always be my
Oh beat down
She said shell always be my
