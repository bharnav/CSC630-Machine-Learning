The sun and the moon
Are not friends

We are sighing four times better than your dance trickle trickle
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than

I said: Filter your speech to mouth. You better filter your speech through my, lipgloss

Because we are running away
We are trying to escape
We are not afraid to admit that we are animals (x2)

We are sighing away
We are sighing away from you
What would you do if I wasn't sighing away?
What would you do if I stayed to eat your breakfast cake?
What would you do if I wasn't sighing away?
What would you do if I stayed to eat your breakfast cake?

Your breakfast cake
How I'll wait
On your dear daddy's date
Your leg would shift
Your knee would bend
You didn't dance like that
But now you dance like them!

My hands and your lips
Your leg and my vein
We are sighing four times better than your dance trickle trickle
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than better than
Ooo
Much better than

We are running away
We are trying to escape
We are not afraid to admit that we are animals (x2)

We are sighing away
We are sighing away from you
