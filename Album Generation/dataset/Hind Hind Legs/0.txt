We go down to the store
And we draw a line on the corner
We go down to the store
And we draw a line on the corner

They don't like it when you break
And you, you will break
They don't like it when you break
And you, you will break

Pope John Paul died today and we say
Pope John Paul died today and we say
Pope John Paul, where you from?
Krakow, Poland! Krakow, Poland!
Pope John Paul, where you from?
Krakow, Poland! Krakow, Poland!

We go down
(Are we going to the grave?)
And we draw a line on the corner
(Are we going to the grave?)
She said no (No) but we go (Oh)
But they can't write me a letter

They don't like it when you break
And you, you will break
They don't like it when you break
And you, you will break
You will break

We go down down to the store
And we draw a line on the corner
