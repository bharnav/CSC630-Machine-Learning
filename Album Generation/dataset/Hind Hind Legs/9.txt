She had a mannequin on the front porch in july
She sold him coffees and cookies and a tea called time
And the mannequin smiles, and the mannequin smiles
And she don't know what to say
And everythings ok
And it's fine to be plain

Chorus:
If its just my body you want, my body you want; then come on and tell me
If you want me for my body, for my body, for my body
If it's just my body you want then come on and tell me, come on and tell me
If you want me for my body, for my body, for my body

Now, now, now lamentations, lamentations, what am i trying to say?
Now, now, now complications, reputations, mannequins need some fame
And the mannequins denial , the mannequins denial
And she don't know what to crave
She don't know what to praise
As the mannequins say

Chorus

Bridge:
(background) Ok, positions lasts forever
It's going to be hard to pretend
(background) Ok, we'll always be together
Its always so hard to be a mannequin
(background) Ok
Ok
I love you forever

(solo)

If its just my body you want, my body you want; then come on and tell me
If you want me for my body, for my body, for my body
If its just my body you want then come on and tell me, i would believe you
Cuz your just so damn vain but fuck i'm still tryin to impress you
