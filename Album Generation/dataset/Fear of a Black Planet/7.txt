Drop it!
When I'm talkin' rhyme time
It's blow your mind time some say
It's nothing worse than a verse
To hear some nigga curse
They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
Claimin' I boast and smoke
And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal
From the power some got
To get a nigga shot
The null and void I avoid
I test the paranoid
Never had to be bad
My mama raised me mad
So what I got is hot
I love my life a lot
I'm never sad just glad
That's why I thank my dad
Once they never gave a fuck about
What I said
Now they listen and they want clock my head

This is what I mean a anti-nigga machine

Instead of peace the police
Just wanna wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigga
And they started to search
And so I headed West
Went to Cali a rally
Was for a brothers death
It was the fuzz who shot him
And not the blood or cuzz
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mic
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was quick
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz...

[Outro â€“ Flavor Flav (Big Daddy Kane)]
What man, what? What is it, man?
(It's Kane, G)
Yeah, boy! What's up, G?
(Yo man, me and Ice Cube got this movie in effect you with it?)
Yeah man! Yo Chuck, man, check this out man, Kane and Ice Cube wanna fall, they wanna go to the movies man, you with it? C'mon man get your ass out the shower, let's go, man!
