Strike a match so I can see
If I've been down here before
Where is the floor?
What is it for?

Strike a pose
Imagining love and estatic applause
Suckling big parts
You are on task

Strike a vein so we can see
If it leaves some kind of mark
No, its too dark
It's dark

Strike a tone for shadowing
Things that were meant to come true
Darker than blue
Older than you

Strike a match so I can see
If I've been down here before
Where is the floor?
What is it for?
