The spark in your eyes sets my soul on fire
Your voice is like a heaven above
The touch of your hand drives me insane
But baby, I wants to be loved

I'm crazy about every little thing you do
I cherish the way that you hug
Your kiss is so sweet, honey, it can't be beat
But baby, I wants to be loved

Every time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all, or you're mighty late
I ask you to dance; take a little spin
You say "Wait a minute Ma'am, bang bang...here come my friends"

I love the way you walk when you pass me by
Even when you try to shrug
You kill me, honey darling when you give me the eye
But baby, I wants to be loved
