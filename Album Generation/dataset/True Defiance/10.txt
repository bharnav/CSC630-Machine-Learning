[Verse 1]
I feel ashamed
With abandon in my heart and on my face
I suffered the blame
I would show to you this way but I'm too late

[Pre-Hook]
When the sorrow, it breaks them
I will replace them
For you

[Hook]
Dead flowers for the torn apart
Laid at the grave to heal a broken heart
Let it rain until it floods
Let the sun breathe life once more
Reborn

[Verse 2]
Wish you the same
To walk beside and carry on this flame
To see you again
With a radiance of pure and holy name

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook] [x3]

Dead flowers for the torn apart... [x6]
