[Verse 1]
A figure for the closing of time: the antagonist, divine
Void of vacant word, one final answer to be heard
I will carry my decree into a storm of lead
This is total war, my want for tolerance is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
(To my last breath)
I am someone to hate (I am someone to hate)
I will spit upon the idol for which you stand
I will carry the weight (I will carry the weight)
I will bury your deception with a wrathful hand

[Chorus]
Heart is cold, and my weapons are washed in blood
I avow to the call on high
My resolve in the blessed above
In this ever-consuming divide

[Verse 2]
A figure for the closing of time: the antithesis, defined
Threat to faith untrue, I am the enemy of you
All you advocates of Hell, you corruptors of free will
The culling is nigh, better get your fill

[Pre-Chorus]
(To my last breath)
I am someone to hate (I am someone to hate)
I will spit upon the idol for which you stand
I will carry the weight (I will carry the weight)
I will bury your deception with a wrathful hand

[Chorus]
Heart is cold, and my weapons are washed in blood
I avow to the call on high
My resolve in the blessed above
In this ever-consuming divide
I am the cry for the falling of time

[Bridge]
Born into the lust within our eyes
Taught to write the scriptures for our lives
(We inherit the lies)

[Chorus]
Heart is cold, and my weapons are washed in blood
I avow to the call on high
My resolve in the blessed above
In this ever-consuming divide
