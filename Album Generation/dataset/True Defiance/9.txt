Conviction was your shelter
Boarded up, rejected, left behind
To lower life where aimless spirits die
Suffer your indifference
Tie that troubled stone around your neck
Exalt your fall and hear your mother's cry

Colder now
Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now
Throw your blackened heart into

Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
(Your time will not outlive your debt to pay)
Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
Defiance on this day

This plague is not your Savior
Turn the barrel's eyes upon this strife
The truth, it will reveal that fading line

Colder now
Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now
Throw your blackened heart into

Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
(Your time will not outlive your debt to pay)
Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
Defiance on this day

There is a kingdom beyond your eyes
Whole of redemption, defining will
The path of self is wrought with fatal lies
Send them back to Hell

Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
(Your time will not outlive your debt to pay)
Resistance
(You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
Defiance on this day

Send them back to Hell
