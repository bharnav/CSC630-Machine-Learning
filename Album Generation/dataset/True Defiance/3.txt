Lay your fear on the line and wake up

[Instrumentation]

Now solitude of will has held you still against that wall
Dividing soul from self, you cannot help but to dissolve
Back down

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t come crying for help when the fire surrounds you
When desperation calls you will obey
Don’t you follow the mass to an endless grave
You’ve cut that vital main, now...

[Chorus]
Lay your fear on the line and wake up
Lifeless years, unholy tears
Throw your panic aside and let go
Pain will bring to light your fears

The gravity of death is on your breath, it dwells inside
Hold fast to your distraction, feed ambivalence your time
Back down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Hold your breath, retain your silence
I don’t buy your self-reliant soul

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
