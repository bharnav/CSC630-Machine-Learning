[Verse 1]
I cast my heart unto the beast
Unto my sin
I would never find my faith in this belief unseen again
The solitude of youth
My conscience wearing thin
I will suffer my infliction as a desecrated man

[Pre-Chorus]
But the fear, the blood, the sweat and sound
They brought me here to wait for the will to appear

[Chorus]
We were blinded by the sacred light
They carried us away
Like a razor through the dark that night
My destiny

[Verse 2]
Now the weight of living word
Come calling true
And my heart will drink the blood of death my soul forever knew
On the reverence of a voice
My clarity of you
The King of whom I never was has run my spirit through

[Pre-Chorus]
But the fear, the blood, the sweat and sound
They brought me here to wait for the will to appear

[Chorus x2]
We were blinded by the sacred light
They carried us away
Like a razor through the dark that night
My destiny

[Instrumentation]
We will carry that flame

[Solo]
To wait for the will to appear

[Chorus x2]
We were blinded by the sacred light
They carried us away
Like a razor through the dark that night
My destiny

[Outro]
The fire is in our name
We will carry that flame
The fire is in our name
We will carry that flame
