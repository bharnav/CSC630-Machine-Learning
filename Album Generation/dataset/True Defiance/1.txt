[Verse 1]
So my dissent was a shallow defense I made
To lay waste through the powers of fame?
When all the blame I carried around my neck
A dead cycle of pain (that I chase to find my way)

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sovereign comes to me
(I eclipse in the shadow's veil)
Killing all I seek to be
(For the passing vain inhale)

[Chorus]
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken

[Verse 2]
With every turn I fail to learn my path
And it's wearing down my days
To be the voice of a half-dead suffering age
A never-ending seek (that I chase to find my way)

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sovereign comes to me
(I eclipse in the shadow's veil)
Killing all I seek to be
(For the passing vain inhale)

[Chorus]
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken

[Bridge]
Now the grave is all I see

[Chorus]
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again
I'm God forsaken
