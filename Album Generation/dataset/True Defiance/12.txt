[Verse 1]
It's hard to say that I'm back on a straight line
You see, my path is in fact just a fault line
It's in my blood, it's in my lungs and it won't die
I fight these words, I bite my tongue so I don't lie

Though it's me to blame
There is no more shame in me, in me
I just feel the same
Immune to all this pain and the scars don't write a song for me at all

[Chorus]
I am a stone, unaffected
Rain hell down unto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be

[Verse 2]
I tried to see and believe in the short sight
Accept the burn of a vain and a half-life
And how you rest your faith in these for a lifetime
The hollow lie against my hope that I won't buy

Though it's me to blame
There is no more shame in me, in me
I just feel the same
Immune to all you say and the scars don't write a song for me at all
No, your tears won't line a path for me to crawl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The waters rise above my eyes
I will breathe it in and go out with the tide
And when you think this is the end
You will find me there where I have always been

[Chorus]
