[Verse 1]
This is the end of everything
A degenerate culture's elegy
Now the reaper is waiting at the door
Drunk on our blood and craving more

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the sound of a thousand holy feet
Treading on a soon-forgotten grave
This is a life-long declaration of war
No sacrifice in vain
(Let them remember the name)

[Chorus]
Feels like we've run out of air
They tear the breath out from our lungs
And we don't care
Feels like we've run out of air
Damnation passed down to our sons
And we don't care

[Verse 2]
Witness the end of apathy
We have embraced our suffering
Will the pain illuminate our fall
Or will we see the blame at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the sound of a thousand holy feet
Treading on a soon-forgotten grave
This is a life-long declaration of war
No sacrifice in vain
(Let them remember the name)

[Chorus]
Feels like we've run out of air
They tear the breath out from our lungs
And we don't care
Feels like we've run out of air
Damnation passed down to our sons
And we don't care

[Bridge]
No compromise to end
We'll wash the blood off from our hands
And fight again

[Chorus]
Feels like we've run out of air
They tear the breath out from our lungs
And we don't care
Feels like we've run out of air
Damnation passed down to our sons
And we don't care

Remember the name!
