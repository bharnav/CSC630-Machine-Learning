[Verse 1]
Is there nothing I can say
When you turn around and carry on this way?
Have you lost the path we made
When that feeling pulled you far away from grace?

[Pre-Chorus]
See you're fading out again
All your promises are taken with the wind

[Chorus]
And if tomorrow never comes
For all the cold and bitter ones
We can breathe
And if tomorrow never comes
For all the cold and bitter ones
Let us sleep

[Verse 2]
Did they steal your beating heart?
Did they take your words and tear them all apart?
'Cause it killed to let it go
I hope it follows you and breaks your frail bones

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Here we are
One final time
To go and leave
Your soul behind

[Chorus]
