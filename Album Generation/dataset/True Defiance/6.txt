[Verse 1]
Let my soul be a silent storm
Conceived in the fire of war
I am the ruthless bane of a wicked world
And I prey on the killing floor

[Pre-Chorus]
When I carve my name across this place it is
To defile its vain and vile ways
With every breath like a threat for tomorrow’s embrace

[Chorus]
And the battle is my way
I will go this path alone
I will take unto my prey
This I know

All others will fall

[Verse 2]
Let my will be a violent path
To tear apart what’s left
All Hell falls down around my feet when I speak with a word of wrath

[Pre-Chorus]
When I carve my name across this place it is
To defile its vain and vile ways
With every breath like a threat for tomorrow’s embrace

[Chorus]
And the battle is my way
I will go this path alone
I will take unto my prey
This I know
All my life will sing the pain
My suffering will show
In the fight I find my name
This I know

[Bridge]
The blade of my call
One name above all
All others will fall

[Chorus]
And the battle is my way
I will go this path alone
I will take unto my prey
This I know
All my life will sing the pain
My suffering will show
In the fight I find my name
This I know

[Bridge]
The blade of my call
One name above all
All others will fall
