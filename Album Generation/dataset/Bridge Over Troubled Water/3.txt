[Verse 1]
Gee, but it’s great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I’ve been on the road so long, my friend
And if you came along
I know you couldn’t disagree

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s the same old story, yeah
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible

[Chorus]
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

[Verse 2]
Deputy Sheriff said to me
“Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You’re in trouble, boy
And now you’re heading into more”

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible

[Chorus]
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
And it’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible

[Chorus]
And I’m so tired
I’m oh, so tired
But I’m trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
