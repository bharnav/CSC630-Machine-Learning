[Verse 1]
Tom, get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

[Verse 2]
I get the news I need on the weather report
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

[Bridge]
Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where
And we don't know where
Here I am...

Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where
And we don't know where

[Verse 3]
Tom, get your plane right on time
I know that you've been eager to fly now
Hey, let your honesty shine, shine, shine now
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York

[Outro]
Here I am...
Here I am...
