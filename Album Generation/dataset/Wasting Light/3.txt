[Verse 1]
I’ll take it out of the wishing well
I'm thinkin' I have a plan
Go on with your bad self
What do you see in yourself?
You think you’re losin, it's time to stop accusin'
You’re never gonna take a hit on the head
Now, if you don’t care
Take a ride somewhere

[Chorus]
Hey! It has somethin' you want to try and buy yourself
Hey! It has somethin', it goes 'round and 'round again
Go! Go! You should've never waste your lung
Go! Go! An' the ride was shared

[Post-Chorus]
Go, Limo!
Go, Limo!

[Verse 2]
I guess you're stuck in the Habitrail
You gotta love this shit
Way out on a back shelf
You’ll never know what you did
Look what you’re doin', now mama said it's ruined
You had a mollusk in the palm of you hand
So, it's a bad smell
Your ass won't win

[Chorus]
Hey! It has somethin' you wanna try and buy yourself
Hey! It has somethin', it goes 'round and 'round and round again
Go! Go! You never have been away so long
Go! Go! And the ride was shared
Go! Go! Whatever happened to DayGlo thongs?
Go! Go! And the ride was shared

[Post-Chorus]
Go, Limo!
Go, Limo!

[Bridge]
Yeah
All right!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Whoa!
