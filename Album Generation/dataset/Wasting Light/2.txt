[Verse 1: Dave Grohl]
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
I couldn't grow just a'livin' in the shadow
Where do you go when no one's followin' you?
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Shall I go on
And on
And on
And on
And on
And on again?

[Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Rosemary, you're a part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're a part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me

[Post-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

[Bridge: Dave Grohl]
Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary

[Verse 2: Dave Grohl]
You got away, got away, got away with things
You got away, got away, got away with things
False starts, young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces comin' down around you
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Can I go on
And on
And on
And on
And on
And on again?

[Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Rosemary, you're a part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're a part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me

[Post-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

[Bridge: Dave Grohl & (Bob Mould)]
This was no ordinary life (This was no ordinary life)
This was no ordinary life (This was no ordinary life)
I'm here from now on
But once I'm gone
I'm gone

[Post-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & (Bob Mould)]
Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
You're a part of me (You're a part of me)
Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
Please pardon me (Please pardon me)
Dear Rosemary

[Outro: Dave Grohl]
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
