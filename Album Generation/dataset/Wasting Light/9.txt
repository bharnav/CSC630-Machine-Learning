[Verse 1]
I should have known that it would end this way
I should have known there was no other way
Didn't hear your warning, damn my heart gone deaf
I should have known, look at the shape you're in
I should have known, but I dove right in
One thing is for certain, as I'm standin' here
I should have known

[Chorus]
Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt

[Verse 2]
I should have known, I was inside of you
I should have known there was that side of you
Came without a warning, caught me unaware
I should have known, I've been here before
I should have known, don't want it anymore
One thing is for certain, I'm still standin' here
I should have known

[Chorus]
Lay your hands in mine
Feel me one last time
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
I should have known

[Bridge]
Maybe you was right, didn't wanna fight
I should have known!
Couldn't read the signs, couldn't see the light
I should have known!

[Chorus]
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave us all in debt
I should have known
