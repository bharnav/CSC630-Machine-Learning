[Verse 1]
One of these days
The ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days
Your heart will stop and play its final beat
One of these days
The clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing
One of these days
Their bombs will drop and silence everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet
One of these days
One of these days

[Verse 2]
One of these days
Your eyes will close and pain will disappear
One of these days
You will forget to hope and learn to fear

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet
One of these days
One of these days

[Bridge]
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright

[Verse 3]
One of these days
Your heart will stop and play its final beat

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
