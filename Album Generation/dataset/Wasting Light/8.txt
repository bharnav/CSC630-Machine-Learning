[Verse 1]
If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing
Never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me
Comin' down on you
Like a cold sky rainin'
Under a burnin' moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Been waitin' all your life, your wish is comin' true
Bless your heart for beatin', me right out of you

[Chorus]
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again

[Post-Chorus]
Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Get in and let's go, go

[Verse 2]
What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me, but
Sure would look good on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Been waitin' all your life, your wish is comin' true
Bless your heart for beatin', me right out of you

[Chorus]
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again

[Post-Chorus]
Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Get in and let's go, go

[Bridge]
Miss the misery
Give me reason for a change
Miss the misery
Give me reason to refrain
Miss your misery today
Miss your misery today
Come on and turn it on for me!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Don't change your mind
You're wasting light
Don't make this right
Don't make this right
Get in and let's go
Go, oh, oh, oh
