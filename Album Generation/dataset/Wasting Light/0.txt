[Intro]
These are my famous last words!
My number's up, bridges well-burned!

[Verse 1]
Oh, won't you let me twist your faith
It's gettin' kinda' late and I don't wanna wait no more
Oh, may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace
Passed your test of faith
Another time, another place
Another line upon your face
Another in your way
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances
Comes the king of second chances
Now, throw him in the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now

[Verse 2]
Oh, let me put you in your place
Love it when you say
I'm givin' everything away
Tell me what's in it for me
Tell me, now, what's in it for me
No one's gettin' this for free
So, tell me, now, what's in it for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside

[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now

[Bridge]
Gather in the ashes
Everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes
Scatter as they blow away
Gather in the ashes
Everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down
It's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round
They're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now (Gather in the ashes)
They're all comin' down (Everything's thrown away)
It's all comin' 'round (Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away)
You're burnin' them down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all comin' 'round (Everything's thrown away)
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away)
Your bridges are burnin' now
