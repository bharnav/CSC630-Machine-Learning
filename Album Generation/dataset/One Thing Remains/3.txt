We've fallen out of grace again could be the beginning of the end we stuck by and watched the other walk
Away could not stay i can't belive we'd give up so easy

Don't you miss the way we were? don't you wish we made that turn?

What we said was sometimes mean't wasn't worth the breath that we spent even though that i don't know how
Much we tried or even why for all it's worth it's not what we deserve and

Don't you miss the way we were? don't you wish we made that turn?

The best times are far gone
All that's left is to forget
Still i seem to hang on
But indeed it's not over

Don't you miss the way we were? don't you wish we made that turn?
Don't you miss the way we were? don't you miss the way we were?
