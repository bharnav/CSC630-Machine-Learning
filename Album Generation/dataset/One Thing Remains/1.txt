Please don't talk about it just leave it alone
What you need is too much for me you can't squeeze blood from a stone but there you go

I can't win with or without you i don't know why, i don't know why
I can't win with or without you but still i try, still i try

What were you before me how was i to know
When you take you always break
And i won't give no more
So there you go

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why, i don't know why
I can't win with or without you but still i try, still i try

Maybe i'm wrong, maybe i'm way out of line. i lie to myself all the time. i should have been gone, so long
Ago. would anyone else of known

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why, i don't know why
I can't win with or without you but still i try, still i

I can't win with or without you don't know why, i don't know why
I can't win or without you but still i try, still i try
