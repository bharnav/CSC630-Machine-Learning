As if the weight was not enough
And one can only take so much

You broke into pieces
Seems hopeless now but at least you know
The tables can turn around
And time will repair you

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go?
So all is forgiven

You're on your knees reaching out
Reaching for someone
To lift you up right off the ground
Is anyone out there?

You can't breathe
You're choking
You'll make it through just keep holding on
I know that it won't be long
'till somebody saves you

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go?
So all is forgiven

When the clouds burn away
All is forgiven
When the night turns to day
So all is forgiven

Don't stop the rain from pouring down
Let it wash the pain
Where it can't be found

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go?
So all is forgiven

When the clouds burn away
All is forgiven
When the night turns to day
So all is forgiven

Oh... all is forgiven
Oh... all is forgiven...
