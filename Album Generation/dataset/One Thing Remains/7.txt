You don't know it all
I've got you figured out
So proud, walking tall
Is what you're all about

What you are is what you make
Don't know how to give and take
Blame it all on someone else
Everyone except yourself

One step forward
Never seems to get you nowhere
Sinking faster
In you go

You want to save they day
So you grab on the reins and run in circles
You're going to crash and drag the world down with you
Only one thing remains

Hey man be aware
Better watch yourself today
I know he don't care
About you anyway

You can run but you can't hide
From the guilt you built inside
All the lies they won't forget
Never will get over it

Thinking backwards
How the hell did this get started
Drowning faster
Down you go

You want to save they day
So you grab on the reins and run in circles
You're going to crash and drag the world down with you
Only one thing remains
