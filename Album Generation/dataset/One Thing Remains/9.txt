You're guilty
I see you looking at me
Do you want to see the aftershow?
And I'm dying
To get inside of you
If I only knew where this would go

My head is screaming
Hate, shame
God hope I get out of this alive
I pray
God help me get out of this

I'm guilty
I blame the shitload of drinks
That fooled me to think I'd get away
You're dying
I bet that you never thought
The line that you bought would end this way

My head is screaming
Hate, shame
God hope I get out of this alive
Lust, crave
God hope I get out of this alive
Fault, blame
God hope I get out of this alive
I pray
God help me get out of this
