I whisper in your ear
The words you want to hear
You feel the wind and it reminds you
It happens everytime you stop and close your eyes
You can't deny what lives inside you
Well, I know it's hard to see what is meant to be
When yesterday is so far behind you

Deep inside your soul know
I'm always there

You made me believe the day you surrendered to me
The memory will never die
The love that you gave
I'll never throw it away
The memory will never die

The tides take a turn
Another lesson learned
I'm right here but still you wonder
Would you say that you need more
And it's not what it was before
You're on your own and going under

Deep inside your soul know
I'm always there

You made me believe the day you surrendered to me
The memory will never die
The love that you gave
I'll never throw it away
The memory will never die

Whenever you wake up
Whenever you gave up all that you had for nothing at all
The bed that you lay in remember you made it
And nobody's there to catch you when you fall

You made me believe the day you surrendered to me
The memory will never die
The love that you gave
I'll never throw it away
The memory will never die

You made me believe the day you surrendered to me
The memory will never die
The love that you gave
I'll never throw it away
The memory will never die
