It's 7 'o clock
The moon is turning
The streets are burning
And all roads lead to nowhere

Hear talk in the back room getting louder
Don't know when I found her
You'll know it when I get there

Don't fall through the cracks
There's no turning back
Once you've fallen in it became

Whoa, the day's unwinding
The moon is rising
I'll be hiding from the sun
Light is blinding
You can find me
I'll be hiding from the sun

Back out in the morning
Are you with me?
Will you ever forgive me
When I tell you it's time to leave

Was this way too much
Twice ain't good enough
This is who I am once again

Whoa, the day's unwinding
The moon is rising
I'll be hiding from the sun
Light is blinding
You can find me
I'll be hiding from the sun

Whoa, the day's unwinding
The moon is rising
I'll be hiding from the sun
Light is blinding
You can find me
I'll be hiding from the sun
I'll be hiding from the sun
I'll be hiding from the sun
