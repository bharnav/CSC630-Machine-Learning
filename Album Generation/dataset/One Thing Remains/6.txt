There you go creepin' in
You're in my head once again
It's a rush, head to toe
It's never enough, don't you know

Come tomorrow
See your sorrow
A taste of heaven
All your livin'

There's a thousand reasons to leave
But there's just one reason to stay

My beautiful flower, you've got the power
I tried holding on, you keep pulling me in
My beautiful flower, My darkest hour
Think I'm givin' up 'til I see you again

Where's my fate taking me?
My mistakes breaking me
Here I come chasing you
In a room without a view

Do I belong here?
It feels so wrong here

Like a cloud that's following you
The sun can never find its way through

My beautiful flower, you've got the power
I tried holding on, you keep pulling me in
My beautiful flower, My darkest hour
Think I'm givin' up 'til I see you again

Do I belong here?
It feels so wrong here

Like a cloud that's following you
The sun can never find its way through

My beautiful flower, you've got the power
I tried holding on, you keep pulling me in
My beautiful flower, My darkest hour
Think I'm givin' up 'til I see you again

My beautiful flower, you've got the power
I tried holding on, you keep pulling me in
My beautiful flower, My darkest hour
Think I'm givin' up 'til I see you again
