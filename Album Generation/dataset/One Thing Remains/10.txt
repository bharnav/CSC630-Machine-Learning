Did I do something wrong?
Your feeling way too cold
For reasons I don't know
Don't seem to get along

But I'll follow you back home
Not worth it to be alone

It's hard to forget where or who we are
And i can't find where we were

You know you're dragging me down
One day I won't be around
Who will follow you now?
If I could I would find my way out

I wish I could rewind
To the times where you would say
It would never be this way
Now what's on your mind

Do you want me to go or stay?
I'd take black or white over gray

It's hard to forget where or who we are
And i can't find where we were

You know you're dragging me down
One day I won't be around
Who will follow you now?
If I could I would find my way out

You know you're dragging me down
One day I won't be around
Who will follow you now?
Now that I won't be around
What will you do on the ground
Now that I've finally found
Found my way out
