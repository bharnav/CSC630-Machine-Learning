I. Lawned (Consciousness Causes Collapse):

It's nothing but a ghost town now
It's like someone put it on standby
But I know there's just got to be more
Than watching days and weeks as they go by

I hope someone will take it on
Show us what it's really all about
We need a guide to take us along
Someone who's been there, learned the lines

Who knows the song
Who'll never get it wrong
Someone who's known the secret all along
Someone to lead the way
To burn the fog away
Someone to wake us up before we simply fade away

Entropy is mayor now
Inertia's pointing all around
It's nothing but a ghost town now
Muted colours, muffled sounds

II. A Hoof to the Head

I've been in every phase but never all in one
I am as old as life but my time has just begun
I'm here to steal your heart, add measures to your fear
To make you so confused that everything becomes clear

I'm the whirlwind that you reap
Having sown the wind I'll wake you from your sleep
I am chaos I combust
To leave your pure enlightened mind fucked in the dust

Though it may look a lot like what you need to see
It'll never be just what you thought it would be
There is no point of view that licenses your view
That'll shake the world like your proud method should

I'm the whirlwind that you reap
Having sown the wind I'll wake you from your sleep
I am chaos I combust
To leave your pure enlightened mind fucked in the dust

The center of the universe just shifted all the way
And as your cosmic wheel just rolls on through the
Memory
So inscrutible and zenlike it appears
Translucent not clouded it's simply crystal clear

III. Hallucifuge (Hyperrealistically Speaking...)

Never bigger or smaller
Closer to falling over
Never more proud never more terrified
Amazed by the wonder
That's ripping my whole world asunder
Just hopelessly awestruck and mesmerised

There is no denying my mind is unravelling
Hey man just watch me go!

Falling out of the sky
Diving into the eye
I must roar as I'm shattered just hanging on
The centre can't hold
Forces twirl and unfold
Tearing loose from the axis to splinter off

Into quarks into atoms
Beyond what I could hope to fathom in a billion years

This put me back together
I'm as light as a feather
All heavy headed and blown away
The veil has been lifted
The focus has shifted
