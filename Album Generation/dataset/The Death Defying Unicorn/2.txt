This life..
Unfulfilled for so many

The reflection of automobiles
Like the slowly expanding mercury of a thermometer
Crossed sideways from the tinted sunglasses
Of a large, bearded man on a streetcorner

Staring blankly off into the distance
The remains of his half-eaten icecream stick drips slowly
Drop by mouthing drop
Parachutes on to his white tennis shoes

An illuminous sphere of light grows stronger from behind the hilltop

Standing in the shower with plugged ears
Letting the water hit the base of the spine
Then up and finally over the top of the head
The sound of a car passing

But there just ain't no insurance policy for a life wasted

A woman goes deep into the forest
Squats down above the leaves and pineneedles
And pees on her fingers
Causing sparks to fly and ricochet

Illuminating the shadows stowed in the heart

The ones we secretly prize (appraise?)
But never admit to
Not even to ourselves
That special moment

When we set aside our indulgences and excesses
It's then and only then
Lifes mysterious, and seemingly unconnected coincidences
Begin to take shape in a meaningful way
