I know
My life's not going to change
And I'll live
Through all these wasted days
Never thought
That i'd end up this way
And I know
It's going to stay the same

I thought
I would
Be more
Than this

I know
I'm losing all my time
Doesnâ€™t seem
Like it was ever mine
Feeling sick
But I don't know why
Getting tired
Of living 'til I die
