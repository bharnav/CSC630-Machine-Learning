Did he say he loves you
Chances are it's true
Up until the moment he walks out on you
He's got the kind of loving that comes and goes so fast
You're not the first to think you'll be the last
Did he say forever
Just you wait and see
You'll wind up without him standing here with me
Just like all the others a victim of the past
You're not the first to think you'll be the last
You haven't heard a single word I've said
You're thinking with your heart and not your head
Whatever I say
You'll go your own way
Proving the fool instead
You'll wake up one morning
Thinking life is free
No two ways about it you'll be next in line
It's just the same old story but with a different cast
You're not the first to think you'll be the last
