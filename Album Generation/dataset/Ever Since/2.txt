Do you think it's too late
Is it getting too late for getting up
Do you think it's too much
Is it getting too much for letting to
Do you think it's too loud
Is it getting too loud for being heard
Do you think it's too high
Is it getting too high for coming down
Are you sure
That the light you see is the light you need
Don't ask
How it's going well it's going
It's gone
Do you think it's too bright
Is it getting to bright for being seen
Do you think it's too cold
Is it getting too cold for getting warm
Are you sure
That the light you see is the light you need
Don't ask
How it's going well it's going
It gone
