Sometimes I wonder where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
Make believein' is hard alone
Out here on my own
We're always provin' who we are
Always reachin'
For that risin' star
To guide me far
And shine me home
Out here on my own
When I'm down and feelin' blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh, baby be strong for me;
Baby belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you
Until the morning sun appears
Making light
Of all my fears
I dry the tears
I've never shown
Out here on my own
But when I'm down and feelin' blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh, baby be strong for me;
Baby, belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you
Sometimes I wonder where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
I may not win
But I can't be thrown
Out here on my own
Out here on my own
