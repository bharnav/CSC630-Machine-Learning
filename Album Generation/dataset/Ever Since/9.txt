We went so high
As if we had no weight
As if we thought we both could fly
We went so high
We knew it wouldn't last
We flew too high we flew too fast
And whenyou think you're safe and sound
Anywhere you go from there is down
We went so high
We left it all below
We found another place to go
We went so high
We'll never come so near
We'll never see it quite so clear
'Cause when you think you're safe and sound
Anywhere you go from there is down
We went so high
So high
