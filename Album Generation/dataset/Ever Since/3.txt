Someday I'm going to get where I'm going
Someday
Someday
Somewhere past the blindness of my faith
I keep my eye on the plans I've made
And someday I'll get there
Someday
Past the smiles that crack like frozen lakes
Under children's figure skates
I'm going
Past all of my own mistakes
A thousand more I've yet to make
But I'm going
I'm gonig
I'm going to get there
I know it
I do not care how long it takes
I do not care what stands in my way
I don't care what anybody has to say
I know myself
I know myself and I am not afraid
And someday
I'll get there
I'm gong to get there
I know it
