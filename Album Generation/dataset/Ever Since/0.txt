I dreamt you
I drew you
Long before I thought that I might never find you
I chased you
I traced you
And held your picture up into the light
All the weight of nights and days to long to list
All the parties I've been to you were missed
I've waited ever since
I met you
Tried to forget you
Even though I felt somehow someone had sent you here
To me
And as if you knew me
We picked up where we left off in another life
At times I've tried to settle out for so much less than this
Saved only by the hope in every eyelash wish
I've waited ever since
All the weight of nights and days too long to list
All the parties I've been to you were missed
I'ved waited ever since
I met you
