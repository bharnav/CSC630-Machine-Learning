You think it'll rain
I'm gonna be late
Look at the time fly
Wish I could stay
Words we don't say
Words we don't say
Trying to hide night after night
Drifting away
Something to keep
Between you and me
Look at the bright side
Wish I could stay
Words we don't say
Words we don't say
Trying to hide night after night
Drifting away on words we don't say
