There's a cool web of silence winds us in
Words melt us down and we spin again
The less we speak the less we cry
You and I
There's a hotbed of anger just ahead
We are fighting to be led from the fire
To the l clouds where the cool cool silence
Winds us in
Maybe
You should have told me that you were awake
I should have said I'm afraid
There's the comfort of strangers every night
I'm aware of how I hide isn't right
Here I go to the cool cool silence
Maybe
You should have told me that you were awake
I should have said I'm afraid
There's a cool web of silence winds us in
Words melt us down and we spin again
The less we speak the less we cry
You and I
