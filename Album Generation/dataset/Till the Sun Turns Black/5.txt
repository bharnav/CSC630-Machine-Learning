My eyes have dried, my hands are tied
Nothing I can say
If you feel the need to go
I won't stand in your way

Sit and think
Drown in drink
Sing this sad, sad song
You can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and gone

Fate has played his hand so cruel
There ain't nothing I can do
You say you lost your love for me
Me my love for you

Sit and cry
And say goodbye
And sing this sad, sad song
You can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and gone

So when you're lying in his arms
Think of me and know
The choice you made it free and clear
It cost me a heavy toll

Sit and think
Drown in drink
And sing this sad, sad song
You can bring me flowers, baby
When I'm dead and gone
