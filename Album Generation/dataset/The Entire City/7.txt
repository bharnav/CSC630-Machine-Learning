Deep beneath for so long
I see it grow in living roots
We live in caution in your arms
(Ahhhh)

Lifting up so far it scares me cold
It typifies
It highlights all our lies
(Ahhhh)

Like an automatic living force within us
Waging war upon war
With our fires burning
Obelisk

Waking up from a deep sleep
We don't know what's ours until it's gone
We live in caution in your eyes
(Eyes)
When we give up
We won't feel the destruction
Living was hard enough with our fallen minds

We'll call
To you we shall
To your arms
Your open arms
(Arms)

Like an automatic living force within us
Waging war upon war
With our fires burning

(Your Open Arms) x4
