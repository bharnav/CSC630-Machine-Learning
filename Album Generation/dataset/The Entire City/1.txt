When all has turned to dust
Our city is a ghost
The Concrete Mother stands alone
A hidden world
The colours will all fade
Flooded forests and undergrowth
But she'll still be there when it's done
She'll be our home
I'll live ashore
I'll wait under her neon heart so long
And she'll teach me love subconsciously
For everything that now, cannot be
For she is stone
She is stone
She'll teach me love subconsciously
For everything that now, cannot be
She'll teach me love
She'll teach me love
She'll teach me love
For everything that now, cannot be
For she is stone
