Beyond the sun there is so much
Soon it will stop shining back on everything, us
After all is said and done
We are living
When time catches up will we still misunderstand?
Its icy touch, amazing how we're still alive!
We will fly, we will fly
The universe our nest
We will fly
When it's too late
When life is sink or swim
Will we stop then, will we ever learn?
You take your time and you will easily break
Its icy touch, amazing how we're still alive!
We will fly, we will fly
The universe our nest
We will fly
