[Verse 1]
She's got all my dreams
I've got these broken things
And they always disagree
But if there's one real thing
You would choose to believe
Just don't lose your faith in me

[Chorus]
She's got broken things
Where her heart should be
And I keep rolling them over in my head
Make my voice brand new
I'll give it all to you
And I'll never speak again

[Verse 2]
Lord, I've been trading places with the ghost in me
And it's starting to make me sick
But if there's one real thing I could choose to believe
Just a little hope would do the trick

[Chorus]
She's got broken things
Where her heart should be
But I can tell there are moments
When I'm really getting through
Make my voice brand new
I'll give it all to you
And I'll never speak again

[Verse 3]
She'll be in magazines
With all her fancy things
And all the boys will dream
If you think this was easy you're wrong

[Bridge]
Ohhhh... and now it's time
Ohhhh... let me see you smile
Ohhhh... let me see it
Ohhhh...

[Chorus]
She's got broken things
Where her heart should be
And I keep rolling it over in my head (rolling it over in my head)
If your heart is true then I'll be with you (be with you)
Cause it's you that I adore
And we both know I loved you more
