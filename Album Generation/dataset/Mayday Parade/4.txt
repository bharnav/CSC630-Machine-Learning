[Verse 1]
She makes me high the way I want to feel in photographs
Oh every picture I'm gonna burn
Where every smile was a lesson learned

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna say
Breakdown, all on me
I'm gonna figure this out but I don't know how
Breakdown, all on me
I'm only running til I get out

[Chorus]
You'll be the reason I'll be uneven
You've got me on the edge to jump for you
You'll be my fire, call me a liar
We'll make mistakes the way we always do
We always do

[Verse 2]
And now I'm starting ever sentence with an apology
Oh what's your reason for leaving now?
Is it too late to follow you out?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna say
Breakdown, all on me
I'm gonna figure this out but I don't know how
Breakdown, all on me
I don't wanna be selfish
But would it kill you to be a little more precise
And more polite when you speak

[Chorus]
You'll be the reason I'll be uneven
You've got me on the edge to jump for you
You'll be my fire, call me a liar
We'll make mistakes the way we always do

[Bridge]
When we both need each other, these moments are priceless
And I'm starting to gather up my confidence, just for you

[Chorus]
You'll be the reason I'll be uneven
Covered in glass and lying on the floor
You'll be the brightest, star in the sky
Sing me a song and tell me who it's for
You'll be the reason I'll be uneven
You've got me on the edge to jump for you
You'll be the brightest, star in the sky
We'll make mistakes the way we always do
