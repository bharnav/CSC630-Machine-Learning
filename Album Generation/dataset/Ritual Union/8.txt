The coldest wind
Hit me so hard
I raise my fist
I slip apart

Ooooh, Ooooh

Nothing compares
Nothing at all
Just like my tears
I let them fall

Ooooh, Ooooh

It's in my blood
This dizzy vein
It never cared
Of all my pain

Ooooh, Ooooh

So lead me on
Into your web
It's just a ride
That's in my head

Ooooh, Ooooh

Kind of driven and kind of triggered on
I watch the woods trying to find those inner gods
Hold it back just to try to hold it in
Just like the devil that stayed ready to win
No competition still I'm acting on a race
Watching angels dancing in the slowest of ways

Got to let it go
But I can't
Got to let it go
But I

Ooooh, Ooooh
Ooooh, Ooooh
