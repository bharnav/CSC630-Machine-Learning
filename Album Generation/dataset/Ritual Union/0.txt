[Hook]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand

[Verse 1]
Love is sinking in the sand
Petals falling on demand
My feet are running like the wind
I'm sorry, boy that we sinned
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
It drowns my feelings in the sea
I dried out over on the beach

[Hook]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand

[Verse 2]
Mother, tell me how it is
I know you've been through all of this
You ran away so many times
Your kids, your heart, a couple of dimes
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
It drowns my feelings in the sea
I dried up over on the beach

[Hook]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand

[Hook]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand
