With your clover
You're picking cherries
Taking pills
And running with the steam
Loves all make believe
Swinging branches
By your mansion
And by the pool she's posing leopard skin
Got you dancing in

Please, pull the string now
Turn the winds all round and round
Oh the diamonds don't lift up
Oh the color shift and cut

Staring down at wondering faces who want your place
But on the papers you can shine and fly
Smiling in their eyes
Over land and over space
You take me to that unreal place
That I had never known
Don't you cry

Please, pull the string now
Turn the winds all round and round
Oh the diamonds don't lift up
Oh the color shift and cut

Please!
Turn!
Oh!
Please!
Turn!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
