[Verse 1]
Ten times more than the sweetest sound
Wouldn't want to change if it brings me down
Every seven years, it's on expire
Driven by a fear and a sweep of fire
Higher than the heavens soar
Tempted by your hands and lettin' go
Every now and then to fall behind
Leanin' on a stranger, turnin' time

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you

[Verse 2]
Ten times more than the sweetest sound
I wouldn't change if it brings you down
Every seven years, this song expires
Driven by a fear and a sweep of fire

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you
Because all I want, a second or two
And all we got are seconds to lose
And all I am is tempted by you
