When I go out
I let my armour fall
And when they shout
I walk through the door

The sea's blooming
I need to be gone
Through the tunnel
Kids are grown
Hair's not long

Who took the heat
Took the light
From me and my shadow

Through the tunnel
Kids are grown
Hair's not long

Who took the heat
Took the light
From me and my shadow

When I go out
I let my armour fall
And when they shout
I walk through the door

The sea's blooming
I need to be gone
