[Verse 1]
You grew high, taller than the middle class
Boy, cash running in your pockets
You skate high, gold on your finger tips
They try to make people nervous

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why when

[Chorus]
Green dollar bills slip your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly

[Verse 2]
Castle, house, cars and the ladies
Blues, no doubt, got you feeling empty
Your bank's packed to edge, and still you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why when

[Chorus]
Green dollar bills slip your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly
