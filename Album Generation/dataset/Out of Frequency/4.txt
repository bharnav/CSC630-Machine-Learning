Occupation, a classified infiltration
A secret little occupation to always keep an eye on you
Information I know that I can fool the right nation
So easy got your information
Gotta take you out on cue
I get high so high till the break of the morning
Nobody see me in the night, alright, alright
And omehow it feels like a warning
As I'm watching the rain I got nothing but piece of mind
Get ready for the killing tonight
Undercover with shades and wig
I am your lover
Devoted to be undercover you will never get my bluff
I don't bother to live my life
As if I'm another
To blow your mind I really don't bother
Glad you got my life shaked up
I get high so high till the break of the morning
Nobody see me in the night, alright, alright
And omehow it feels like a warning
As I'm watching the rain I got nothing but piece of mind
Getting ready for the killing tonight
Uhh cloak and dagger
Uhh cloak and dagger
Uhh cloak and dagger
