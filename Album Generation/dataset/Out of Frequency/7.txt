I turn my own baby talk to me
And when I gave my in my slave
When you meet me up to me
And when you treat me like I'm freak
Are you I go to me
Like it always
The one and I can the one I can debate
Turn me up take control
Got 'em down to the
Swear I wanna go, swear I wanna go
I'll be this to my goal
I'll be my good no take control
Yeah I'm hangin by the
You're hangin by the

Wish you're ghost in my head
You're a ghost in my head
You're such a ghost in my head
A ghost in my head
Hey

When the law you're my
Going freak like me
Then I wait my
And when you ride it put it
I'm the back see
Take take take me so far
And don't say who you are
When you walk, when you call
When we drown in every mall
I know it see the fun

And know when see the
Share upon the wall
Not the share on the wall
Not the footstep down the hall
Let's do have a ball
Still we have a ball

You're ghost in my head
You're a ghost in my head
You're such a ghost in my head
A ghost in my head

All this time I stand seat what my
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

All this time
Eyes can't see what my uhh

What if you.i didn't care
I don't care if you're not there
I don't care you're in my head
A little and walked the stare
I do my hit and look

And I can bring you everywhere

You're ghost in my head
You're a ghost in my head
You're such a ghost in my head
A ghost in my head
