Suburban space Invader
They suck your soul
They'll be messing with your brain
Suburban space invader
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same

Part A:
Hey little girl, look at you
Sitting alone at a table for two
Just can't wait, to get away
Get away, every day
See your self, on the silver screen
Dancing queen, just seventeen
You could do pretty fine _______
Life could be divine

We would do, we would do, we would do for you
We would do for you over night
Say aha hey
Aha hey

Fill your lungs
Have no fear
Ask yourself
Why you're here
Time's running, they say
Time's running, ooho

Hurry up
Don't ever stop
No thinking about tomorrow
Now hold it, hoooold it
(Upbeat:) Open up your eyes!

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader
They suck your soul
They'll be messing with your brain
Suburban space invader
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same

Intermezzo

Part B:
Hey little boy
Where you're at?
Money and fame
Got none of that
Can't really run
But you've got a car
It won't get you there
But it'll take you far
Surf the grid, without a map
Serious fun turns into crap
Silly boy
Dry your eyes
Don't take up the fight
It'll do, It'll do, It'll do for you
It'll do you for tonight
Let you freak out
Don't freak out

Hey little boy
This is it
___ hats
And laser kits
Push it up, they say
Push it up, ooho
Get it on
'till you break him down
Cuz' when you stop pretenden
And you lose it
Lose it
(Upbeat:) Singing one more time:

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader
They suck your soul
They'll be messing with your brain
Suburban space invader
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader
They suck your soul
They'll be messing with your brain
Suburban space invader
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same
