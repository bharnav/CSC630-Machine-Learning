Now I got you on my mind
Cause I know, now you're leaving town
I just wanted you to say
"Why don't you come
Or should I stay?"

You're going away
I said it's okay
Why don't I ask you
Not to come, and stay?
Come and stay...

****Chorus****
Wait'in every day
Till my mind go mad
Will you ever come back?
Stick around till the sky turn black
And I hear you say
"I'm on my way."
Got me under your thumb
What a big fun
Come around be my moon and the sun
Till the day that we're done
****Chorus****

Am I blinded by the dark?
I feel strange now that we're apart
I can't seem to find the time
For any joy or any though of light

Are you okay?
Tell me are you okay?
I'm afraid your
Way won't ever
Cross my way
Cross my way

****Chorus****
Wait'in every day
Till my mind go mad
Will you ever come back?
Stick around till the sky turn black
And I hear you say
"I'm on my way."
Got me under your thumb
What a big fun
Come around be my moon and the sun
Till the day that we're done
****Chorus****

Now I heard you're coming home
I won't take or pick up the phone
I will meet you in the street
Suddenly, out of frequency
I've been okay
Yeah, I've been okay

Why don't you
Knock my door and
Come and stay
Come and stay

****Chorus****
Wait'in every day
Till my mind go mad
Will you ever come back?
Stick around till the sky turn black
And I hear you say
"I'm on my way."
Got me under your thumb
What a big fun
Come around be my moon and the sun
Till the day that we're done
****Chorus****

Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
Waitin' every day
