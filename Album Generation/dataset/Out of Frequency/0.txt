Take a trip, start walkin'
Goggle up your face!
Everybody stop talking, jamming up your space
Got the wrong destination, but it's your faith
It's a ride on the flipside, again and again and again

Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night

It's insane
Fame!
It's insane
Fame!

Come back to the future, to late to change!
So afraid to be a loser, you're walking without shame
A bag full of tight money, spending it all today
It's suppose to be funny, people know your name

Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night
Dollars in the night

It's insane
Fame!
Whose to blame?
Fame!
It's insane
Fame!
What's her name?
Fame!
