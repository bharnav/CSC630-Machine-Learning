Days turning up when it comes to us
He is come and get you when you had enough
You soon gonna drop when it comes to us
But we do it again

Gold on your jobs when it comes to us
Alienated in the way we dress
Believe or not when it comes to us we will do it again

Love eating heart in things how we do
Is making it Blue
Is making it thrill
But I will die die die die die die
For no one else

Faith or insight when it comes to us
It's illustrated but it's such a rush
Not if things turning right when it comes to us
But we do it again

Wait for a sign when it comes to us
Is still we facing what we had is lost
Burn until we die when it comes to us
Let's do it again

Love eating heart it came in one way
We came here to stay

Yeah I might cry
But I will die die die I will die
For no one else
