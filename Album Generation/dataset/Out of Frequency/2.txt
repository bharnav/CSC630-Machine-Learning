[Verse 1]
I'll do twenty-two states and half a mile
Just to see your face before I die
And I don't care if all the lights are red
I've got a wild horse running right through my head
Well jeez, Louise, now don't you stop
'Cause I'm at half way through of having enough
You and me until we drop
We're gonna hip shake, escape
Come on take me to the top

[Chorus]
You've got me head over heels on gasoline
You know how it feels like nicotine
Head over heels go raise your flag
Come on bang bang bang give me heart attack
Heart attack

[Bridge]
Burning down the wheels tonight
Hey! Are you ready
Burning down the wheels tonight
Hey! Are you ready
Burning down the wheels tonight
Hey! Hey! Are you ready
Burning down the wheels tonight

[Verse 2]
My man knows what it's all about
He will shoot me first then ask me out
It was meant to be right from the start
Yeah he carved his name into my heart
Well jeez, Louise, a love roulette
Yeah we got good times rolling in a red Corvette
You and me in silhouette
We're gonna hip shake, escape
Do the things we never did

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]

[Chorus x2]
