Yeah, I like it a lot
Cause it feels like the real thing
No, I won't give it up
Cause it feels like the real thing!
One hell of a drug and it feels like the real thing
Like some kind of bug
Yeah, it feels like a real good thing!

I'll be your fantasy friend forever
I'll be your fantasy friend forever
We'll be surfing the skies together
I'll be your fantasy friend forever, and ever! (AY!)

Don't you do it for fun
When it feels like a good thing?
Don't you leave it undone
When it feels like a good thing?
Yeah, I like it a lot
Cause it feels like a good thing
Yeah, I might never run
And it feels like a real good thing!

I'll be your fantasy friend forever
I'll be your fantasy friend forever
We'll be surfing the skies together
I'll be your fantasy friend forever, and ever!

You can save my soul (x9)

I'll be your fantasy friend forever
I'll be your fantasy friend forever
We'll be surfing the skies together
I'll be your fantasy friend forever, and ever!
