Riding away, I feel free to convey my duty
_________________________________, to say this is beauty

Free your mind, you got a sweet soul
This is what you find if you reach the goal
No one here, no one there, only you in your atmosphere

Hurry up!

Riding away, I feel free to convey my duty

You can hang a little while, by our side
Never figure out how we go high
We been waiting for the smoke all our life
Now we're taking of, now wave good bye

Free your mind, you got a sweet soul
This is what you find if you reach the goal
No one here, no one there, only you and your atmosphere
