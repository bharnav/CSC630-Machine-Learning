Looking at my watch, it's almost two
Called me and said to get ready, you comin' through
Want your girl to spend a little time wit you
Boy, you must be buggin' cause now you got me rushin'

You roll up in my drive way, you beeped twice
Got me lookin' at you sideways, you lookin' right
But you actin' kinda funny what's on you mind
Damn, I left my wallet at the house, we gotta go back

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

We pulled up to your crib and you walked in
Said, you'd only be a minute but it's been 10
Your motioning for me to come on in
You done lit the candles expecting red light special

I know just what you're thinking, you wantin' me
But I'm two seconds from telling you I wanna leave
You put your arms around my, my body
And I don't know what to do, baby, now I want you too

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

It's a catch 22, will I stay or will I go?
Cause your kissin' on me and I don't know what to do
My body saying yes, but my mind is saying no
Oooh, oooh, oooh, what I'm gon' do, do, do?
About you, you, you, I'm so confused, fused, oooh

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

Oooh, oooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating, I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready, baby, I don't think I'm ready, baby

Oooh, oooh, oooh, what I'm gon' do, do, do?
About you, you, you, I'm so confused, fused, oooh
