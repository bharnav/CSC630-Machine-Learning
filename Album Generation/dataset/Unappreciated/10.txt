[Verse 1:]
No More Of These words (Baby I'm sorry won't you just came back to me, baby)
I can't deal with your lies (I didn't cheat Baby, She just kissed me)
I look right down when I continue to let you back in
So don't get pissed off when you see me with another man

[Chorus:]
Cause I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more

[Verse 2:]
I found all of these things (Love letters, receipts of jewelry I've never seen)
So now I am taking (I'm taking my love, my respect, and my dignity)
Remember the night that I've spent all alone (You Remember that? 'Cause I do)
When You were out with your new chick I was home See IIIIII...

[Chorus:]
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more

[Verse 3:]
Now I'm through with you
Done with you
So damn fed up with you, over you, I can't believe that I fell
For you There's no words you can say to get me to stay
It's over and done I'm leavin you

[Chorus:]
Cause I won't be no fool for you no more
Won't be no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
