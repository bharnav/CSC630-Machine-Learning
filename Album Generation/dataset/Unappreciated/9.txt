[Verse 1]
No need for conversation
Oh our time is wasting
Guess what I'm gonna do
When you step in my room
Oh baby I've been waiting
It's been enough dating
Doing all that bragging
So I've got to have it
So ohhhhh

[B-Section]
I'll give in, if you promise there will be
No talking when you come over
I won't say no tonight
Wanna work it out with you boy

[Chorus]
So baby are you down for a little show and tell
Want you to show me that you want it like you're fresh outta jail
We can get it cracking
Boy don't be acting
Like you don't know what to do when I'm in front of you
So baby are you down for a little show and tell
Want you to show me that you want it like you're fresh outta jail
We can get it cracking
Boy don't be acting
Like you don't know what to do when I'm in front of you

[Verse 2]
More than infatuation
An Usher imitation
So won't you do it to me like you never did it before
Stay on top of your game
Work it like you're glad you came
There's no turning back now
So baby turn me out. So baby

[B-Section]

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge]
I want you to make me feel so good. (So good so o o good)
Act like you know, know just what to do. (What to do you know just what to do)
Ooh baby
Come on over and take control of me

[Chorus]
