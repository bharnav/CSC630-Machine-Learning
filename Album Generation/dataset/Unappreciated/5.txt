[Verse 1]
When I first met you I could tell you were trouble right from the start
I walked past you turned your head
While your girlfriend was standing there
Gave you my number just cuz I was in a hurry, that's when it all began
Damn how'd you become my man
What am I to do
You telling everybody that I'm your boo
Ooh that ain't cool
Why can't see I'm not felling you
Even if I threw a hint you
Know girls just like attention
But they don't like when you keep calling and calling and calling

[Chorus]
I can't take what you doing to me
Boy why is it so hard for you to see
If you keep calling trying to holla
There's no need
To keep calling me, so stop calling me
You be calling 3 and 4 times in a row
If you can't reach me on my cell
You call my home
How many times do I have to let you know, to stop calling me
Boy quit calling me, quit calling me

[Verse 2]
Now it's getting ridiculous and I'm about to lose my mind
Cuz when I changed my number
You called and got it from my Mama
Ooh now you tripping boo
Why hold on when I don't want you
You find another girl who'll love to put up with you
What am I to do
You telling everybody that I'm your boo
Ooh that ain't cool
Why can't you see I'm not felling you
It was not your swagger
Not your game that doesn't bother me
But it does when you keep calling me, calling me

[Chorus]
