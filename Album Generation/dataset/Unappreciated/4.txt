Uh huh uh huh - Uh huh uh huh
Uh huh uh huh - Uh huh uh huh
Uh huh uh huh - Uh huh uh huh
Uh huh uh huh - Uh huh uh huh

(Verse 1)
Hey bad boy it's nice to meet you
Got a couple things I would like to teach you
Rumors going round about you baby
Boy you know you want it don't be acting crazy

(B-Section)
Let me take you home and let me show you things
You'll be buying me clothes and all the finer things
You'll keep me iced out with diamond necklaces
Lets make the best of it - ask no questions

(Chorus)
I know your taken but all right
Anticipation's making me hot
You're looking sexy and you're looking fly
Boy I know you got a girl but it's on tonight
I know you're taken but that's all right
Infatuation's making me hot
You're looking sexy and you're looking fly
Yo you know I got a man but it's on tonight

(Verse 2)
Temperatures rising it's getting crazy
Now I got you telling your friends I'm your baby
Why you trying to fight your feelings for me
I got you asking me to be your lady

(B-Section)

(Chorus)
Oh oh oh oh you know you want me so let's go
Oh oh oh oh no time to waste so here we go
Oh oh oh oh i'll have you feening that's for sho
So what you waiting for now

Oh oh oh oh you know you want me so let's go
Oh oh oh oh no time to waste so here we go
Oh oh oh oh i'll have you feening that's for sho
So what you waiting for now

(Chorus 2x)
