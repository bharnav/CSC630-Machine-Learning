Ooh, baby... like a melody ride
Baby it's time, it's fun, fun time

Just take your time, to free your mind
It's bonafide, to move your body
Natural high, can you feel the vibe
Get on the rise, move your hips from side to side

Let's enjoy, life's reward
We can soar, through heaven's door
Touch the sun, let's become one rhythm
Cause the way your energy is affecting me, yeah

Ooh, I wanna party with you (I wanna boogie down)
Diggin' on the way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do baby)

Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do baby)

Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down

Girl the mood is right
For me to be with you tonight
So let's get intertwined, let's fly

Love is in the air
Baby nothin' else is better
Cause we're the perfect pair

We're one of millions of lovers
And feelin' love is sent from above

(Dance) Show me if you feel it, dance
(Dance) Come on do it with me, dance
(Dance) Make romance, let's dance
(Love's dance) ooh, ooh (love's dance)

Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' on the way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do baby)

Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you

Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down
Gone get, get, get, get on down

Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you

Ooh, I wanna party with you
(I wanna party down) The way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you

Get on, get on come on, come on
Get on, get on come on, come on
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you

I sure do baby, I sure do
I sure do baby, I sure do
I sure do baby
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
