[Intro]
Kenny G say it like this

[Saxophone Solo]

[Hook]×2
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I like the way, I like the way

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance on the top
Make it fine (you're so fine)
Blow my mind (you're so fine)
Ooh, yeah (out of my mind)
Out of my mind (out of my mind)
If I could I'd just
I would be with you, baby
Cause you likely, you excitedly
And you know, gotta leave, ooh

[Hook]×2

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
You know your love life is my life
I love the way you make me feel, it's alright
Your kiss will always shine like the light
I like the way you show me, I like the way

[Hook]×2

[Outro]
Show off back the way you move
Like the way you move
Like the way you move
