Dont let love, pass you by
Pass you by
Dont let her pass you by
Dont let love pass you by

Theres been many of days, and many of nights, ive wanted to play in
Your garden of love
To love you, dont let love...
See, but I almost let you slip away
But something tapped me on my shoulder to make me stay (sun godess)
To love you, dont let love, please dont, dont let it pass you by

Chorus

There ain't much good in any goodbye
Especially when, youve fallen in love
Youve fallen in love
Well, and the simpel things, made you feel this may
And simpler things caused those feelings to change
Years from now, youll reach for her, and shell be gone

Chorus

I find her in a warm place
Destined love should not be chased
Give her the utmost respect
Tell her shes your superstar

No good ones are hard to find
Less good hardly starts in mind
The one who always has tryed to be by your side on cold days
She loves you and cares that you will be forever and ever happy

Chorus to fade
