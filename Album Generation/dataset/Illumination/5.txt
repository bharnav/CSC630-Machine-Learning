We gonn' work it out
We gonn' turn this round
We gonn' show you how to make it

We gonn' work it out
Let me show you how
We gonn' work it out, yeah

I know somethings
And you should listen to me
Young brothas' never listen to what the grown folks say

But you know, better
Look around the streets
Ain't nothin' but liquor stores, funerals, and check cashing places

We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work this out)
We gonn' turn this round
(We gonn' turn this round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head

We gonn' work it out
Let me show you how
Get on ya feet and stand up for where you lay

(Can't give) Can't give watcha never had
(Show them) Show them love, good or bad
They'll hate your better state
Try to keep you down from flyin'

Let's get, to a better bay
Love flows, how crazy
Conditions at the moment
Our mission set us straight (ooh, yeah)

We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work it out)
We gonn' turn this round
(We gonn' turn this round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head

We gonn' work it out (work it out)
Let me show you how (show you how)
Gonn' live the life that life was meant to be

Get up off them corners right now yall
Let's slang a revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're an institution

We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work it out)
We gonn' turn this round
(We gonn' turn this round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head

We gonn' work it out (work it out)
Let me show you how (show you how)
Gonn' live the life that life was meant to be

Get up off them corners right now yall
Let's slang some revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're an institution

Get up off them corners right now yall
Let's slang a revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're an institution

Work it out, let's work it out...
Let's work it out, let's work it out...

We gonn' work it out
We gonn' turn this round
Gonn' work it out...
