Walk in the Light
That shines so bright
Let your soul feel right
Love is pure gold, yeah

Won't you wake up, wake up walk in the Light
Won't you wake up, wake up bring substance in your life
Won't you wake up, wake up walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, yeah

[Verse 1:]
Where's your heart, where's your pride
Has it all been pushed aside
Life is dreams living high
Yet no substance in your life
It's a hard world, I know
But don't give into the lies
You have always been a star
Everything you need's inside your heart

[Chorus:]
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your precious life's in your soul
Truth and life were pleasure, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold

[Verse 2:]
Many hearts, many lives have been touched when you realize
That you are worthy, you're the prize
But you have to heal inside
It's a hard world, I know
But don't give in to the lies
You have always been a star
Everything you need's inside

[Pre-Chorus:]
(Say 'ya) always on the ground (but cha), need some peace of mind (won't cha)
Slow down, take your time, there's a million ways to shine, yeah (when 'ya)
Let the whirly thing (got cha) control your destiny
('Ya gotta) break or make a change (and then you'll find your stars will align)

[Chorus:]
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your precious life's in your soul
Truth and life were pleasure, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold

[Chorus:]
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your precious life's in your soul
Truth and life were pleasure, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold

Won't you wake up, wake up walk in the Light
Won't you wake up, wake up bring substance in your life
Won't you wake up, wake up walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, yeah

[Chorus:]
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your precious life's in your soul
Truth and life were pleasure, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold

Hey, your love will help you find your treasure, have mercy... yeah
As you live from day to day
'Cause only true love makes things better... yeah
'Cause true love never fades away
