[Verse]
Flying high on blackened wings
Vengeance in my eyes
Colder than steel instantly real
A new power flows through me

[Pre-Chorus]
Reaching out for something
Knowing that it's there, somewhere

[Chorus]
All I had was
All I gave
Was it not enough?
You took
You take
Never giving anything back

[Verse]
Bridges that I thought I crossed
Got to cross them all again
These parts that lead to nowhere
Mocked me all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Reaching out for something
Knowing that it's there, somewhere

[Chorus]
All I had was
All I gave
Was it not enough?
You took
You take
Never giving anything back

Make a change
Break the chain
Make a change
End this game

Vengeance in my eyes
A new power flows in me

[Chorus]
All I had was
All I gave
Was it not enough?
You took
You take
Never giving anything back
