I used to wanna dream
I used to wanna scream at the top of my lungs
Like a diamond in a ring
Or the song you love to sing
The shine is gone

Walking in circles, circles
Walking in circles
Walking in
Walking in

I used to wanna run
I used to wanna climb up to the sun
Ambition is killing me
And the new trends and the money
Oh, I feel so cheap

Ow, ow, ow I'm walking in circles, circles
Walking in circles
Walking in
Walking in

It's a feeling that you know
A feeling that explodes
A feeling you want more
And more
And more
And more
Circles
See them?

It's a feeling that you know
A feeling that explodes
A feeling you want more
And more
And more
And more
A feeling that you know
A feeling that explodes
A feeling you want more

And more
And more (more, more, more)
And more (more, more, more)
And more (more, more, more)

Walking in circles, circles
Walking in circles
Walking in
Walking in

It's a feeling that you know (know)
A feeling that explodes (explodes)
A feeling you want more (you want more)
And more
And more
And more

It's a feeling that you know (know)
A feeling that explodes (explodes)
A feeling you want more (you want more)
And more
And more
And more
