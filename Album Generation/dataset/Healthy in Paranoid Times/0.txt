Looks like the holy ghost is gone
Now you're afraid of yourself
Over your shoulder you have to watch
Heaven fall into hell

Looks like your boat's about to sink
So it's time to prepare
Even the angels are losing sleep
And the sidewalks are bare

It's like the calm before the storm
You better swim
Just like it's cold before it's warm
You'll get back here again

And I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait till you fall from grace
It's the calm before the storm
It's there then it's gone

Oh it looks like the war was in your head
Not your heart
Just when you think it's figured out
Well, it all falls apart

It's like the calm before the storm
You better swim
Just like it's cold before it's warm
You'll get back here again

And I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait till you fall from grace
It's the calm before the storm
It's there then it's gone

Looks like the holy ghost is gone
Looks like the holy ghost is gone
Looks like the war was in your head
Looks like the war was in your head
War was in your head

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait till you fall from grace
It's the calm before the storm

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait till you fall from grace
It's the calm before the storm
It's there then it's gone
