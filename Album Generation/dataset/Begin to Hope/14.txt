[Verse 1]
You have tamed me
Now you must take me
How am I supposed to be
I don't have my thorns now
I feel them sprouting
They'll grow right though if I don't watch it
They'll grow right through even if I watch it
And a sunset couldn't save me now
These baobabs and baobabs and baobabs some more
But you can't outwait fate

[Bridge]
And you have tamed me
Now you must take me
Taa-tt-ttaa-ttt-taa-tt-taake

[Verse 2]
And I wouldn't raise my child inside this city anyway
They grow up too savvy and they grow up too fast
And they know about buying shit and they know about sex
And they know about investment banking and also about brokerage firms
And they know about the numbers and they know about the words
And they know about the bottom line and also about stones
And they know about careers and about the real deals
And they all grow up and become people's people with people skills

[Chorus][x2]
But you have tamed me
Now you must take me
How am I supposed to be
I don't have my thorns now
