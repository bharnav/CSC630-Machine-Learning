[Refrain]
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the lies
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the lies

[Chorus]
You don't have no doctor Robert
You don't have no uncle Albert
You don't even have good credit
You can write, but you can't edit
You don't have no doctor Robert
You don't have no uncle Albert
You don't even have good credit
You can write, but you can't edit
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit

[Refrain]
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the lies

[Chorus]
You don't have no doctor Robert
You don't have no uncle Albert
You don't even have good credit
You can write, but you can't edit
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit

[Piano Interlude]

[Refrain]
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the—
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the—
White lines on your mind
Keep it steady
You were never ready for the lies, lies

[Chorus]
You don't have no doctor Robert
You don't have no uncle Albert
You don't even have good credit
You can write, but you can't edit
You don't have no doctor Robert
You don't have no uncle Albert
You don't even have good credit
You can write, but you can't edit
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit
