[Verse 1]
I wish I'd see a field below
I wish I'd hear a rooster crow
But there are none who live downtown
And so the day starts out so slow

[Chorus]
Again the sun was never called
And darkness spreads over the snow
Like ancient bruises
I'm awake and feel the ache
But I wish I'd see a field below
I wish I'd see a field below

[Verse 2]
I wish I'd see your face below
I wish I'd hear you whispering low
But you don't live downtown no more
And everything must come and go

[Chorus]
Again the sun was never called
And darkness spreads over the snow
Like ancient bruises
I'm awake and feel the ache
I'm awake and feel the ache
But I wish I'd see a field below
But I wish I'd see a field below
I'm awake and feel the ache
Oh, but I wish I'd see a field below
I'm awake and feel the ache
Oh, but I wish I'd see a field below
I wish I'd see a field below
I wish I'd see a field below
