[Vere 1]
Life inside the music box ain't easy
The mallets hit, the gears are always turning
And everyone inside the mechanism
Is yearning to get out

And sing another melody completely
So different from the one they're always singing
I close my eyes and think that I have found me
But then I feel mortality surround me

I want to sing another melody
So different from the one I always sing

...But when I do the dishes

[Verse 2]
I run the water very very very hot
And then I fill the sink to the top with bubbles of soap
And then I set all the bottle caps I own afloat
And it's the greatest voyage in the history of plastic

And then I slip my hands in and start to make waves
And then I dip my tongue in and take a taste
It tastes like soap but it doesn't really taste like soap
And then I lower in my whole mouth and take a gulp

...and start to

[Verse 3]
Feel mortality surround me
I close my eyes and think that I have found me
But life inside the music box ain't easy
The mallets hit, the gears are always turning
And everyone inside the mechanism
Is yearning to get out

And sing another melody completely
Is yearning to get out
Is yearning to get out
Is yearning to get out
