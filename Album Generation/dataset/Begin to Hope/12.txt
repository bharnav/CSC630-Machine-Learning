[Verse 1]
In another town
Don't let me forget
In another town
Mouth full of regrets
In another town
Please place final bets

[Verse 2]
In another town
But I know I know I know
In another town
My fingers so cold
In another town
My soul feels so old

[Verse 3]
In another town
I've sold all my gold
In another town
But I know I know I know
I love you

[Verse 4]
In another town
They've given me the key
In another town
I'm drinking for free
In another town
A girl just like me

[Verse 5]
In another town
But I know I know I know
In another town
The light fills my room
In another town
They're painting my moon

[Outro]
In another town
I won't see it soon
But I know I know I know
I love you
