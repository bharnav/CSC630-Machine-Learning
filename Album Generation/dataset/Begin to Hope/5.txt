[Intro]
Come in, come in
Come into my world I've got to show
Show show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know
Know know you

[Chorus 1]
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool

[Bridge]
Floaters in my eyes
Wake up in an hotel room
Cigarettes and lies
I am a child, it's too soon

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address I wade downstairs

[Verse 1]
The porter smiles to me a smile
I've bought
With a couple of gold coins
A sign that I've been caught

[Chorus 2]
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my dear
Will never be my dear, dear friend
Dear dear friend, dear dear friend

[Chorus 2]
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address

Come in, come in
Come into my world I've got to show
Show show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know
Know know you

[Chorus 2]
