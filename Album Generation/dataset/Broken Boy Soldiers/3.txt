[Verse 1]
I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop
I've got a girl and she likes to shop
The other foot looks like it won't drop
I had an uncle and he got shot

[Bridge 1]
Is this greeting the type that's meant for me?
Are you part of this kakistocracy?

[Verse 2]
This ringing in my ears won't stop
I've got a red Japanese tea-pot
I've got a pen but I lost the top
I've got so many things you haven't got

[Bridge 2]
This fellow's craft is just not for sharing
He's not an intimate secretary!

[Verse 1]
I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop
I've got a girl and she likes to shop
The other foot looks like it won't drop
I had an uncle and he got shot

[Bridge 3]
Then on rubble of scummest malarchy
Down with luck we'll see Ecclesiarchy

This fellow's craft is just not for sharing
He's not an intimate secretary!(14975308)

[Verse 4]
The exarchy's inspector inquisitor (The ringing in my ears won't stop)
The demockery illustrious master (I've got a red Japanese teapot)
Are you part of this kakistocracy? (I've got a pen but I lost the top)
Is this greeting the type that's meant for me? (I've got so many things you haven't got)
