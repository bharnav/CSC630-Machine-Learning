[Verse 1]
Can we call it a day?
Now would that be OK?
Can we just go our own separate ways? (ways)
'Cause I'm cold and wet
And I'm willing to bet
That you constructed this maze (maze)

[Verse 2]
I stumble around
Try to follow the sound
Then something takes hold of my hand (my hand)
If we cause such a mess
And I'd venture to guess
That you concocted this plan (plan)

[Verse 3]
I don't know what to do
'Cause it's always been you
Who helps me to make up my mind (my mind)
But I'll stake my life
And swear by this knife
That it's all by your design (design)

[Verse 4]
Enough has been said
It goes 'round in my head
Until I break down and cry (and cry)
I wouldn't be surprised
If that look in your eyes
Was your way of saying goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 1]
Can we call it a day?
Now would that be OK?
Can we just go our own separate ways? (ways)
'Cause I'm cold and wet
And I'm willing to bet
That you constructed this maze (maze)

[Verse 2 - Mostly instrumental]
(My hand)
You concocted this plan (plan)

[Verse 3]
I don't know what to do
'Cause it's always been you
Who helps me to make up my mind (my mind)
But I stake my life
And swear by this knife
That it's all by your design (design)
Yeah it's all by your design
