[Verse 1]
Girl you got those hands that heal
Help me get in touch with what I feel
'Cause you understand and you sympathize
And you know me best it's no surprise

[Chorus]
When you're with me there's a light and I can see my way
When you speak to me it's a song and I know what to say

[Verse 2]
Girl you got those eyes that see
Help me find the good that's inside me
'Cause you're the only one who really knows
How the feeling comes and why it goes

[Chorus]
When you're with me there's a light and I can see my way
When you speak to me it's a song and I know what to say

[Break]

[Outro]
When you're with me there's a light and I can see my way
When you speak to me it's a song and I know what to say

When you listen there's a hope and I know I'm being heard
When you smile at me and I know and we don't have to speak a word

When you're with me there's a light and I can see my way
When you speak to me it's a song and I know what to say
