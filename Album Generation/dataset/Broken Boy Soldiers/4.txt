[Verse 1]
You and me forever
We belong together
And we'll always endeavor
Throughout any type of weather

[Chorus]
You want everything to be just like
The stories that you read but never write
You gotta learn to live and live and learn
You gotta learn to give and wait your turn
Or you'll get burned

[Verse 2]
You wrote our names down on the sidewalk
The rain came and washed 'em off
So we should write 'em again on wet cement
So people a long time from now will know what we meant

[Chorus]
You want every morning to be just like
The stories that you read but never write
You gotta learn to live and live and learn
You gotta learn to give and wait your turn
My only concern

[Verse 3]
I'm adding something new to the mixture
So there's a different hue to your picture
A different ending to this fairytale
When the sunset into which we sail

[Chorus]
You want everything to be just like
The stories that you read but you can't write
You gotta learn to live and live and learn
You gotta learn to give and wait your turn
Or you'll get burned
