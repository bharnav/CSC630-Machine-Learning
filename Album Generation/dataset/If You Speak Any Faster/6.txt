Well I've got plans for you
If you were afraid of this constant drama
Then I have a place for you
Did you hear what I said, or would you like me to say it again?

I'm taking you down with me
Was I wrong or right, or does it even really matter anymore?
Does this shit even really matter anymore?

Have you made up you mind yet?
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to aim high, you hit low
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to leave

Are you through? It seems like this follows the same old pattern
I'm begging you for something new
Want me to choose a side? We'll decide. Or should I say it again?

I'm taking you down with me
Was I wrong or right, or does it even really matter anymore?
Does it even really matter anymore?

Do you still lay awake when everybody leaves?
Was it me who helped you to sleep?
No, I'm just being naïve
You know I never really wanted you to leave

Have you made up you mind yet?
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to aim high, you hit low
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to leave
You know I never wanted you to leave
You know I never wanted you to leave

It's often draining to think back on what we used to be
Can you please, can you please?
Do you still lay awake when everybody leaves?
Was it me who helped you to sleep?
No, I'm just being naïve. (Can you please, can you please?)

Have you made up you mind yet?
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to aim high, you hit low
I gave up on you a while ago
You know I never wanted you to leave
You know I never wanted you to leave
You know I never wanted you to leave
