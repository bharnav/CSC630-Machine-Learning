Get over yourself
You'll find me under your skin
This is you being selfishâ€¦
This is you feeling sorry for yourself
And if not, you're kidding yourself

It started off from the get go
I'll kill to remember and you'll drink to forget
But it's just your tongue you'll choke on
If you speak any faster!

It's just as easy to rip a piece off
I'll write all your lies off
And I don't really care what you wear on your sleeve
Did you really think
(That you had hidden the pillow)
That covered the weapon
(The knife that cut?)
I'm still in hiding
(And you're still kidding yourself.)

Speak up. Speak up
Am I you're easy way out?
You must be kidding yourself. You must be kidding
Just as easy as to rip out this sliver from under your skin
It's just your tongue you'll choke on
(You will always drink to forget.)
