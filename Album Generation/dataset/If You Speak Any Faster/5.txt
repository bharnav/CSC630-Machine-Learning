These sheets won't touch the floor tonight
Because she's wearing that shirt that cuts from the shoulders
She's better off with a dress that drags
(better off with a dress that drags)
From the small of your back/to the bedroom
After this you'll keep me guessing once again
After this, you're better off with the dress that drags
(She's better off with the dress that drags) to the small of your back

I forgot this is not where I left you
I'm going to get to the bottom of this (the bottom)

Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
You're always into getting me started (started)
Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
You're always into getting me started (started again)

This is your desperate attempt at keeping promises
Your motive is your weakness
She's still self-conscious about her pale skin
That's why she's feeling/this is your mistake
After this you'll keep me guessing once again (once again)
Better off and you're still self-conscious
After this wish you were better off and you wish you were better than this

I forgot this is not where I left you
I'm going to get to the bottom of this (the bottom)
And I forgot this is not where I left you
I'm going to get to the bottom of this (the bottom)

Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
You're always into getting me started (started)
Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
You're always into getting me started (started again)

You're always good at getting started
I was always so much better at talking myself out of this
These feet won't touch the floor tonight
Just make sure you lock the door

She fell asleep with TV on
The liquors there just to keep you warm
You are my struggle

You're always good at getting started
I was always so much better at talking myself out of this
(She's wearing that shirt that cuts from the shoulders)
She's better off with the dress that cuts from her back

Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out/you are

Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
You're always into getting me started (started)
Get me out/you are, you are always into get me out
(You're always good at getting started
I was always so much better at talking myself out of this)
You're always into getting me started (started again)
