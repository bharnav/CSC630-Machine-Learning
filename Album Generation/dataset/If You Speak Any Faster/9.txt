I can see it in your eyes
This time you're hardly breathing
But don't be alarmed girl
This time we don't go up for air
I love it when you're nervous
(this time we don't go up for air)
Your arson will keep us here
Think of your way out
Cause it's about time
For you to follow or its
Dead or alive
You'll give up or survive
These lungs weren't made for breathing
And the lock on the door
Keeps your head to the floor
As the flames dance up the walls
You start to feel the heat against your back
Find the hall
Make the call
Save the girl
Or let her fall to her creation
You will see
I'll turn the tables back around
In this penitentiary
Find a nice spot in this room where you can
Dig yourself much deeper in
You're giving up on getting out
When your hell begins to win
This is exactly what you wanted
This ending that you started
Your attempt was so half hearted:
Are you listening
Well think of your way out
It's down to every man for himself
Hey it's about time for you to follow
Maybe cause you're dead
I'm alive
You gave up
I'll survive
Your lungs gave up on breathing
And the lock on the door
Keeps your head to the floor
As the flames dance up the walls
You start to feel the heat against your back
Find the hall
Make the call
Save the girl
Or let her fall to her creation
You will see
I'll turn the tables back around
In this penitentiary
Find a nice spot in this room where you can
You almost thought that you had won
Dead or alive
Is that what you had in mind listen up
Call your bluff
Close your eyes
I recommend you take my advice
Save your air
This room is like your lungs
Once were save your tears
Evacuation slim to none
The flicker of the lights
Through the thick of the smoke
And now you wish you'd make it out:
Find the hall
Make the call
Save the girl
Or let her fall to her creation
You will see
I'll turn the tables back around
In this penitentiary
Find a nice spot in this room where you can
