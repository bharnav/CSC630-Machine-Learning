This is about the story that never ends
But this pen won't run out, but the pages always end up on the floor

(Chorus:)
You like to keep me awake. Is there something that you wanted?
No, don't apologize; just hold your breath
Try not to freeze before the morning
â€˜Cause I am the winter; this sickness will break out
I am contagious and this illness is what you want

So I'll stand by your door
Lay in your bed now, because this is your grave
Now and burn all your clothes (off) I can tell that your fever is rising

Why is it so much colder on your side of town?
Would it make things any easier if something comes up and I'm not around?
You can say this is all my fault at the time when you're painting your finger
