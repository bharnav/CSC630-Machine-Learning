Keep excuses to yourself
I'll come from the back door and catch you off guard
Did you really think you were all by yourself?
I'll catch you off guard

Sit down somewhere in your room
Will I get you? Will I get you?
Will you still send all your letters when I'm not home?
Will you still write them?

And I am the reason you're always complaining
This is my side of the story, but she always knows it
And I already know what I've been missing

Well kept secrets you kept to yourself
I don't want to hear them. Where is your argument?
"You can't hate me for this." I'll keep you right where I want you
She said, "Stop running your mouth off."

Sit down somewhere in your room
Will I get you? Will I get you?
Will you still send all your letters when I'm not home?
Will you still write them?

And I am the reason you're always complaining
This is my side of the story, but she always knows it
And I already know what I've been missing
Been missing

No, no, no, you won't regret
'cause I'm just your selfish little catch
I'll sit in your apartment as I bide my time
You don't have to think about me now
So just start to tune me out
It will make you think you're all alone

So keep excuses to yourself
I'll come from the back door
I'll catch you off guard
Did you really think you were all by yourself?

'Cause I am the reason you're always complaining
This is my side of the story, but she always knows it
And I already know what I've been missing

And I am the reason you're always complaining
This is my side of the story, but she always knows it
And I already know what I've been missing
