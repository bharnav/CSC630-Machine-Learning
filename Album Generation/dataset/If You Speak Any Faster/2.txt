Change your mind so I don't have to
Is your target in position
Am I in position cause I
& I won't surrender until I'm surrounded
Am I surrounded?
One foot in the door
One foot in your grave
You're the one that started this
You're the one they thought they couldn't save
So tell me one thing can you
Live up to what you had in mind
I choose to follow the tracks
To study the facts the acts that
You've left behind
When you turn your back to me
This is what you deserve
And on my count one two wait for:
Hesitate to pull your trigger
(hesitate you'll hesitate to
When you're down and out
You'll forget who I really am)
My head to fill your crosshairs
Your head to fill my crosshairs
And I'll take it all the way
This is what I'll say
You're down that's what you want head towards
A friend to see if I'm lying
This isn't what your (I'm) thinking
Get up to see me walking
And head for your weapon
When you're down and out
(when you're down and out)
Get up to see you walking
And head for my weapon
Hesitate to pull your trigger
(hesitate you'll hesitate to
When you're down and out
You'll forget who I really am)
My head to fill your crosshairs
Your head to fill my crosshairs
Change your mind so I don't have to
Is your target in position
Am I in position cause I
& I won't surrender until I'm surrounded
Am I surrounded?
Hesitate to pull your trigger
My head to fill your crosshairs
Your head to fill my crosshairs
And I'll take it all the way
Take it all away
