Didn't think to get an answer
I'll say what you wanna hear
You know that I am better than that
But the silence is awkward
And I've been, I've been just fine
How about you?
Start a little conversation
I'm sorry, I'm going up are you going down?
Or are you in or out?
Well have to wait and see now

I got a question, but I didn't mean to interrupt
Tried to figure you out, not cut you off
I'm sorry, I will wait, I'm sorry, I will
Can you really think just how this feels?
All I wanted all i wanted was your time
Can you really think just how this feels?
Can you really think just how this feels?
All I wanted was your time
Cause I know you got an answer set aside

Didn't think to get what you want
Say what you have to say
Keep it together, you know I didn't mean to interrupt
But I can fill you with the lies
And you know, you know, how I keep this conversation going on and on
And I know that your starving for more
But your foot's out the door
Or are you in or out?
Well just have to wait and see now

I got a question but I didn't mean to interrupt
Tried to figure you out not cut you off
I'm sorry, I will wait, I'm sorry, I will
Can you really think just how this feels?
All I wanted all I wanted was your time
Can you really think just how this feels?
Can you really think just how this feels?
All I wanted was your time
Cause I know you got an answer set aside

Try to figure you out
I can, I can
When you always ask for more
I can, I can
Try to figure you out
(All I wanted was your time)
I can, I can
When you always ask for more
(All I wanted was your time)
I can, I can

I got a question but I didn't mean to interrupt
(Can you really think just how this feels)
Tried to figure you out, not cut you off
(Can you really think just how this feels)
I'm sorry, I will wait, I'm sorry, I will
All I wanted, all I wanted was your time
Can you really think just how this feels?
Can you really think just how this feels?
All I wanted was your time
Cause I know you got an answer set aside
