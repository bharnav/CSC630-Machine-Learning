Is this what you wanted?
With your match to catch and burn me down
With your type of answers?
It's just how you say it
Half drunk. Well is it time?
He'll watch from the window
Is this what you wanted?
(Is this what you wanted?)

It started off like this
(I know, you know) Will you go when it's time?
I know, you can light the match
(I know, you know) Will you go when it's time
To burn me down?

I know, you know what
I'll fold, I'll forget
Will you?

Is this what you wanted
Now and again through your ears I'm listening
It's just impossible to get your attention
And it always comes down to just how you say it
Come home. Well, I promise
Let down, but would you let me go
If the time was right
(We will leave this option for you)

It started off like this
(I know, you know) Will you go when it's time?
I know, you can light the match
(I know, you know) Will you go when it's time
To burn me down?

I know, you know what
I'll fold, I'll forget
Will you?
(to burn me down)

I won't come home but
I know, you know what
I'll fold, I'll forget
Will you?

Would you go if the time was right?
(burn me down don't forget to)
Would you go just say you would want
To take me, take me, please take me, please take me
(This fire is almost out)

Would you go if the time was right?
(this time we fall)
Would you go? Just say you want
To take me, take me, please take me
And burn me down

I know, you know what
I'll fold, I'll forget
Will you?

I won't come home but
I know, you know what
I'll fold, I'll forget
Will you?
