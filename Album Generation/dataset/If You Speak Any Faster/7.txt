I've got your invitation to be disappointed
Well I'd love to hear you out
I'm just having trouble finding reasons
It always seemed to be, your voice that kept them awake
It always seemed to me

I've got your invitation to be disappointed
Well I'd love to duck and cover, or just hide behind regret
I'm just having trouble finding reasons
It always seemed to be, your voice that kept them awake
It always seemed to me

You've hid this all inside
(No matter how hard you tried)
You always hid behind your best disguise
You must have misunderstood this
When did you become so good at making me feel like I'm wrong?

I can hear it in your voice
(But I'm blocking the words out)
I guess I don't have to make a choice
(Your cards are out on the table now)

I know this conversation
It's the tone in your voice that always gives you away
Or are you still unhappy about the weather?
I was never able to tell

Just to get this through to you
I'll stutter on my words and never second guess my phrases
I guess that's why you're learning how to fake this
I guess that's why I've grown to hate this
