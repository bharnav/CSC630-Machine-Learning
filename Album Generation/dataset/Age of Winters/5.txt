Iron Swan
The Sword
Iron ships on seas of blood
Black winds fill their silver sails
Iron swan rises high above
In crimson twilight through the earthly veil

Legions of vermin surround me
Malefic taint in their eyes
Madness gives sway to delusion
In defense of a fortress of lies

The iron swan floats amidst the reeds
It's shadow long upon the water
It gives a cry for what can never be
Which draws the eyes of Odin's daughters

Scion of storms, aegis of rime
I call on the powers of old
Unleash your vengeance to punish the crimes
Of those who I name as my foes
