I can play the sweet little girl if you want me to
Or a just can be the woman of your dreams
Just say the word there's nothing that I
Wouldn't do for you
I can show you things you've never seen

What ever your heart desires
I mean anything
Don't go put out this fire
Set me free
Baby please

Because I can't be loved
I can't be loved
Because I can't be loved
Bood Bood BeeBood
Because I can't be loved
I can't be loved
Because I can't be loved
By no one but you
No one but you

I can dress me up, take me out, take it off again
Or maybe we should stay right here tonight

What ever your heart desires
I mean anything
Don't go put out this fire
Set me free
Baby please

Because I can't be loved
I can't be loved
Because I can't be loved
Bood Bood BeeBood
Because I can't be loved
I can't be loved
Because I can't be loved
By no one but you
No one but you
