This ain't no one man show
Not a solitary game
You know as well as I
I'm not the only one to blame
Fear of attention, scared to be abused
Tell me, if we have nothing
What is there to lose
There to lose

Let's go beyond, beyond the distance
We have ever gone before
Let's go beyond, beyond the shadows
Of not ever wanting more
Everything is different now I know
It's all I know
To find out if we're wrong or right
Let's go beyond tonight

This is a two way street
With a cross road up ahead
You know as well as I
Hearts can be mislead
Somehow it feels like
This is ment to be
To make it something
Will you walk with me
Walk with me

Let's go beyond, beyond the distance
We have ever gone before
Let's go beyond, beyond the shadows
Of not ever wanting more
Everything is different now I know
It's all I know
To find out if we're wrong or right
Let's go beyond tonight

To see what tomorrow knows
See what tomorrow holds
Let go of all resistance
The road ahead is open wide
Hold me now, let us see
What's on the other side

Let's go beyond, beyond the distance
We have ever gone before
Let's go beyond, beyond the shadows
Of not ever wanting more
Everything is different now I know
It's all I know
To find out if we're wrong or right
Let's go beyond tonight
