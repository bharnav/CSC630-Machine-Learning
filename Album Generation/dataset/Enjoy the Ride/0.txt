I'm so far ahead of you
Like we're in a race
I think It's time for you to pick up your pace
Keep it up, don't be slow
I think It's time for you to pick up your pace

I need to see your passion
I need to feel your drive
You gotta show me baby
You're alive

Pull the reins
Straddle the seat
Don't let go, work with the beat
Pull the reins
The feeling all around
Is Ecstatic inside
Sit back and relax
Enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

I'm still waiting here for you
To get whit the groove
Why don't you show me now you go all the moves
Turn me on, make me sweat
You gotta prove
Why don't you show me now you got all the moves

I need to see your lustin'
I need to feel your thrive
You gotta show me baby
You're alive

Pull the reins
Straddle the seat
Don't let go, work with the beat
Pull the reins
The feeling all around
Is Ecstatic inside
Sit back and relax
Enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
