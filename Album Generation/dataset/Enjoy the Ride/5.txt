Mmm, Move over darling
I wanna be next to you
Slip under your covers
I wanna be lovers
For a while
Oh Yeah

Hey I need you baby
I need your hands all over me
Don't be shy now
I know you got the know how
So please, please
I can't help myself

Cause I love making love in the morning
Baby let the sunshine
And let it all begin
Cause I love making love in the morning
Your breath against my skin
I feel you deep within
Yeah yeah

Yeah, pick up the rhythm
And baby take my breath away
There's nobody
To treat my body the way you do
I can't help myself

Cause I love making love in the morning
Baby let the sunshine
And let it all begin
Cause I love making love in the morning
Your breath against my skin
I feel you deep within
Yeah yeah
