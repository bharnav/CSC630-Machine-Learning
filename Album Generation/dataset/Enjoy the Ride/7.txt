What you gonna tell me
That you couldn't find a phone
That you car just had a breakdown
That you were out there all alone

Why do you even bother
Why do trying to deny
Im know You got yourself another
It's really no surprice
Don't cut me down to size... no
(Time for you to realize)

Calling all detectives
Calling F.B.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie
Calling all detectives
Calling C.S.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie

Cause I have seen your little black book
I've heard you mumble in your sleep
I've tasted lipstick on your collor
Why can't you see your in too deep

Calling all detectives
Calling F.B.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie
Calling all detectives
Calling C.S.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie

I gather proof, I follow leads
They all uncover your dirty deeds
No need for you to even testify
You do the crime... Yeah
You gotta do the time
Case closed

Calling all detectives
Calling F.B.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie
Calling all detectives
Calling C.S.I
You can say what you want
The evidence never lie
