So you say there's nothing wrong
Then tell me why I don't believe you
Maybe you sound just to sincere
Maybe I just saw right trough you

Cause who's the girl
Walking there by your side
The way she smiles I just know

I wasted love
I wasted love
I wasted all my emotions on you
I wasted love

So here the walls come tumbling down
A heart's breaking into a thousand pieces
I might be damaged but I'll be Ok
Everything happens for a reason

Who's the girl
Walking there by your side
The way she smiles I just know

I wasted love
I wasted love
I wasted all my emotions on you
I wasted love

Everything happens for a reason

Who's the girl
Walking there by your side
The way she smiles I just know

(I can tell by the way you smile, yeah)
I wasted love
I wasted love
I wasted all my emotions on you
I wasted love
