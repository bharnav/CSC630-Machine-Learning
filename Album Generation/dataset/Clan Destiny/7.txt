As the night falls all around me
Black as the raven
I am silently waiting
For sleep to come
Through the doors of perception
I am gliding swiftly
To dreams beyond them
I am not alone
I have never felt a bond so strong
You’re by my side
Gave all your love to guide me there
I have no fear
I’m not afraid to turn my face
To the light
It’s a fine threaded line
Around my pillow
Holds me safe through the darkness
Till the raven flies
When I’m torn and helpless
And drawn to the dark side
I have only to feel you
And the raven flies
You’re by my side
Gave all your love to guide me there
I’m not afraid to turn my face
To the light
