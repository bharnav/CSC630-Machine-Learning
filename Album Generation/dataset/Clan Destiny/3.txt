Money can’t buy it
The love I have to give
You can’t deny it
It’s my kiss that you miss
Love, let’s be patient, one day soon

Memories haunt me
And I ask myself why
They tease me and taunt me
Since we said, said goodbye
I’m living a new life from now on

After we parted
It all came so clear
I looked and I counted
The sum of my fears

With memories like loose change
In the palm of my hand
Can’t let you escape from me now
There is no way, now how
I feel like that loose change
And I can’t understand
There is no way, no how
I’m living a new life from now on

These memories haunt me
And I ask myself why

Money can’t buy it
All the love that you give
