Going down to Steam Town
Gonna lay my money down
Going down to Steam Town
It’s like that big hole in the ground

Punch-drunk and restless
I got some bills to burn
We came down from the Pocono Mountains
Too late to take a U-turn

We talked a lot of nonsense
As we urged each other on
We didn’t heed the one true constant –
The party looked like a bomb

Meet me at the station
I’ll be waiting at track number nine
We can make it to New York City
By just about supper time
