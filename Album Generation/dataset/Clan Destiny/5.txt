Savour the moment as you take your first breath of the day
Capture that moment with no thoughts to intrude in your way
Go with the feeling; don’t be scared to strike out on your own
All your spells and your potions will protect you from feeling alone

All you aspire to, all will be there for you

The illusion of fredom is what gets us through the night
Rebirth and renewal are the lessons of all that’s right
Stay in that sweet spot, let the fear and the loathing slide by
Capture the moment as you ready yourself to fly
