Now that I can be
Once and finally
All that you want me to be
Not so sure that it serves me well;
The person you want me to be

Lovers need to be free from tyranny
As they’re working it through
Took some time for the mist to clear;
It may take time for you

Feel I’m left with an open wound;
Not made the best of my time
The break was made not a moment too soon;
I must be cruel to be kind

Lovers need to react with empathy
As they’re working it through
Leaving time for some tea and sympathy
Something we did not do

Can’t be your dog, your fool
Your crutch, your tool
Am I able to make myself clear?
Damned if I do or don’t
Bend to your will, I won’t
We never made anything clear

Lovers should trust each other equally
Respect all that they do
Find the space to live and let live
Something we did not do
