There's a long night ahead
Noise enough to wake the dead
Then you and I can cut loose
Gonna show you where I roost
A world gone mad –
Slime time on the news
Politics of fear
Shortening the fuse

Yes, I've grown weary
So very weary
(Take this) weight off my shoulders

Get to questioning my sanity
Don't need them to check my integrity
Can't be blind to my vanity
With friends like these, well, who needs enemies?

When I'm wracked with the pain
Been nearly driven insane
I reach for you in the night
Make the load seem light
You raise my kundalini –
Never been more in tune with my fantasies
It‘s a revelation
The new infatuation

Yes, I've grown weary
So very weary
(Take this) weight off my shoulders
Get to questioning my sanity
Don't need them to check my validity
Can't be blind to, yes, my vanity
With friends like these, well, who needs enemies?

We're all part of a manifest destiny
I'm down on pushing this corporate identity
There'll never be a need for their indemnity
As long as there's blacktop right in front of me
Never been more in tune with your energy
