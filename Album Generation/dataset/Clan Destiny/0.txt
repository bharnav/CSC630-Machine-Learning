Now that we’re through
I guess you’ll be leaving
To pastures new
Well, I won’t be grieving

Light outta darkness
Dreams outta dust
Knowing that you
Sold out my trust

Well, I can’t be part of that tragedy
Knowing that you’re so wrong for me

I’m never through
Through with believing
Seems that it’s true;
You were deceiving

Light outta darkness
Dreams outta dust
Lucky in life
If not in love

Well, I can’t be a part of this tragedy
’Cause you and I were never meant to be
