[Verse 1:]
Every day we walk right past
All the concrete and the glass
I don't know where we're going
I hardly ever see your face
And there's not enough space
For all the love we should be growing

[Chorus:]
We just need a little earth to stand on
Plant our hearts on solid ground
Turn the lights out on this city
And wake up in a new hometown
We'll stand out in our front yard
Where we can finally breathe
If we find a little earth to stand on
Baby you and me

[Verse 2:]
Imagine Friday football games
Where everybody knows our names
They even stop to say hello
I bet they'll have a town parade
Kids selling lemonade
Baby, don't you wanna go, ohhhh

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I don't want to face tomorrow
If we don't leave this place tonight
I've never been more sure
Of anything in my life

[Chorus:]
All we need's a little earth to stand on
Plant our hearts on solid ground
Turn the lights out on this city
And wake up in a new hometown
Stand out in our front yard
Where we can finally breathe
If we find a little earth to stand on
Baby you and me

[Chorus:]
Need a little earth to stand on
Plant our hearts on solid ground
Turn the lights out on this city
And wake up in a new hometown
We'll dance out in our front yard
Underneath a maple tree
If we find a little earth to stand on
Baby you and me
