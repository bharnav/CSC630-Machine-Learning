[Verse 1]
Can't kick that habit
I guess you know
What conversation
But here I go
I can't stand it
Facing this alone
Don't change the subject
If it's not clear
Don't say you're sorry
Then disappear
Because that means nothing
Nothing if you're not here

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't turn it off alone
Turn it off alone
Turn it off alone

[Chorus]
I can sing
But I can't sigh
I can barely breathe the air I need
To justify
Why I said "so long"
To get so high
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
Can't kick the habit

[Verse 2]
To save my soul
One foot in heaven
One in the hole
My whole focus
In a poison picture show

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't turn it off alone
Turn it off alone
Turn it off alone

[Chorus]
I can sing
But I can't sigh
I can barely breathe the air I need
To justify
Why I said "so long"
To get so high
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit

[Bridge]
If I let you in
Will you let me in?
If I let you in
Will you let me in?
Will you let me in?
If I let you in
Will you let me in?
If I let you in
Will you let me in?
Will you let me in?

[Outro]
Can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
Will you let me in?
Let me in, let me in
Will you let me in?
Will you let me in?
Let me in, let me in
Will you let me in?
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
I can't kick the habit
