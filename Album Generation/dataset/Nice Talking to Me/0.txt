I won't talk to you, baby, won't talk to you
Baby, 'til you talk to me
I won't walk to you, baby, won't talk to you
Baby, 'til you walk to me
A little bit of love, a little bit of hate
We're too busy talking to communicate
I won't talk to you, baby, won't talk to you
Baby, 'til you talk to me

I don't wanna talk about talking 'bout it
I don't wanna talk about talking 'bout it

Hey hey, honey honey, hey hey
The louder we talk, the less we say
Hey hey, honey honey, can't you see
Talk is cheap but love is free
Nice talking to me

I won't speak to you, baby, won't reach for you
Baby, 'til you reach for me
I can't get contact with you, can't get back to you
Baby, with your back to me
You're talking me down, I'm chatting you up
No one makes a point 'cause we always interrupt
I won't speak for you, baby, won't reach for you
Baby, 'til you reach for me

I don't wanna talk about talking 'bout it
I don't wanna talk about talking 'bout it

Hey hey, honey honey, hey hey
The louder we talk, the less we say
Hey hey, honey honey, can't you see
Talk is cheap but love is free
Nice talking to me

You show me to the door
And nail me to the floor
You're asking me to stay
And then you move away
You love me half the time
And then you draw the line
How I could love you now
If you'd stop explaining how

I won't talk to you, baby, won't talk to you
Baby, 'til you talk to me
I won't walk to you, baby, won't talk to you
Baby, 'til you walk to me

Hey hey, honey honey, hey hey
The louder we talk, the less we say
Hey hey, honey honey, can't you see
Talk is cheap but love is free
Nice talking to me
