Since we arrives she's been nothing less than rude
Dropping names the way I wish she'd drop the attitude
Her has really hasn't
She called someone a peasant
She's got a pretty face but her expression is unpleasant

She's just my date and that's probably what she'll stay
'Cause tonight you could steal me away

(Tonight you could steal me away)
Oh... (Tonight you could steal me away)
Yeah, tonight (Tonight you could steal me away)
Tonight you could steal me away
(Tonight you could steal me away)

You come in swirling with all the silver skies
Riding shotgun on the twinkles in your eyes
Entering and breaking, well, I'm out here for the taking
Like candy from a baby, I'm the robbery you've been staking

She's just my date and that's probably what she'll stay
'Cause tonight you could steal me away

(Tonight you could steal me away
Oh... (Tonight you could steal me away)
Yeah, tonight (Tonight you could steal me away)
Tonight you could steal me away
(Tonight you could steal me away)

Hey, hey, steal me away
Hey, hey, steal me away
Hey, hey, steal me away

(Tonight you could steal me away)

Your eyes are molten with promises of bliss
Your lips have no alibi to hide a stolen kiss
Oh, who could we be wronging if we give in to our longing
For each other that could save us
From a fate much worse than yawning

She's just my date and that's probably what she'll stay
'Cause tonight you could steal me away

Tonight you could steal me away
Oh... (Tonight you could steal me away)
Tonight you could steal me (Tonight you could steal me away)
Tonight you could steal me away
(Tonight you could steal me away)
