I don't mind when you kiss and talk
It's so sweet when you chew gum and walk
The other boys they watch you pass
And wish that they were in your class

I stole you from my ex-best friend
Now I wish I could give you back again
I thought that I was just so smart
I stole your hand but you stole my heart

I guess you're my problem now
You're gonna get me in trouble and you don't care how
Much I love you, you make no vow
I guess you're my problem now

When I Leapt before I looked
I bit the bait around the hook
I wish I hadn't wished for you
'Cause I wished off more than I could chew

I guess you're my problem now
You're gonna get me in trouble and you don't care how
Much I love you, you make no vow
I guess you're my problem now

I don't know if you'll keep me round
Or keep me down
I fought and now I'm caught
In the threads of the web I wound

The other boys they give me looks
When I walk you home and carry your books
You're so good but you're so bad
The best bad time I've ever had
