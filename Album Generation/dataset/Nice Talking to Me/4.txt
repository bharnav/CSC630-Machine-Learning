Oh your drowning eyes search the swimming skies
For a break in the rain, oh you never change
Slow motion breeze like a star lost in space
Your facts are clear but your point is hazy

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too

You're a little bird whose song is overheard
Looking over your shoulder, do you want a lover or a soldier
Oh you're not always nice, but you're warmer than ice

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too

I don't have all the cards I'd like to deal ya
I'm my own best friend, you're your own Ophelia
You're a symphony short one note
You're a winter short of a coat
You might be a petal short of a daisy

I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd love to like you, and I think I almost do
I'd like to love you but I think you might be crazy
I'd like to love you, but you make me crazy too

You make me crazy too
