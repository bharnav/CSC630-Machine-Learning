Love doesn't come with a guarantee
It may hurt you, you know it's killing me
Love slips in between the sheets
From the shady side of the street

Love's a thief who will make you cry
Make you weep and even make you die
Get you lost, get you found
Lift you up if it can let you down

I want to be your sword
I want to be your shield
I want to be absorbed
I want to be revealed
I'm a burning bridge
To a ragged shore
I'm a rolling stone
Stopping at your door
See me soar, see me spin
I want to be your sword
Not your safety pin

Love's a banner in the air
It isn't free and it isn't fair
Love takes place on a high wire
On a narrow ledge, in a ring of fire

I want to be your sword
I want to be your shield
I want to be absorbed
I want to be revealed
I'm a churning storm
Yearning for a calm
I'm a rolling stone
In your open palm
See me soar, see me spin
I want to be your sword
Not your safety pin
Safety pin

I'm a burning bridge
To a ragged shore
I'm a rolling stone
Stopping at your door

I'm a churning storm
Yearning for a calm
I'm a rolling stone
In your open palm

I'm a churning storm
Yearning for a calm
I want to be absorbed
I want to be revealed

I'm a churning storm
Yearning for a calm
I want to be absorbed
I want to be revealed
