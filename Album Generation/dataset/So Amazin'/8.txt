[Chorus:]
Breathe just a little bit harder
Make love a little bit sweeter
Heartbeat a little bit faster
I'm up for this
I could get used to this boy

[Verse 1:]
I don't really feel like going home
I'm trapped in this
I'm wrapped in this
I'm likin' this
You make me just
Wanna scream ya name
(Boy)
I don't know but it feels so right
(Boy)
How about you and me spend the night
(Boy)
Everything you do it feels like the first time we made love
The night when we kissed
Everything boy it makes me just

[Chorus:]
Breathe just a little bit harder
Make love a little bit sweeter
Heartbeat a little bit faster
I'm up for this
I could get used to this boy

[Verse 2:]
Tell me what it's gonna be cuz
I'm wantin' this (uh)
I'm lovin' this (uh)
Inside of this (uh)
I can't resist
Wanna scream your name
(Boy)
I'm so sure that it's gon' feel so right
(Boy)
Let's just see where it leads tonight
(Boy)
Everything you do it feels like the first time we...
Everything boy it makes me just

[Chorus:]
Breathe just a little bit harder
Make love a little bit sweeter
Heartbeat a little bit faster
I'm up for this
I could get used to this boy

[Bridge:]
Feels like I reached the sky
When you touche me I can't believe this life
I'm so lucky how I found that someone who gets me so high
Boy you know what you doin', what you do to me it makes me just

[Chorus:]
Breathe just a little bit harder
Make love a little bit sweeter
Heartbeat a little bit faster
I'm up for this
I could get used to this boy...
