[Verse 1:]
You supposed to be that nigga
You got a dime on ya side
(So why you foollin' with me ?)
Listen I ain't bein' reckless
I'm just tryin' to get this record straight
(Look what ya doin' to me)
You got me contemplatin' thinkin' maybe
I should come check you out in that suite
Pop open some yellow bottles undress me like a model
Then maybe we could wrinkle the sheets

But then I know she'll always be the one you
Take out show around
But you continue to hold on to me so
(Why ?)
Would you think that I could settle for less it's just
One night no I
Don't wanna wake up the next mornin' askin'
(Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I need to know is
If you're foollin'
Only foollin'
All I asked is (Why ?)
If you're foollin'
Only foollin'
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Verse 2:]
Now the media's gossipin' pinnin' me in magazines
Sayin' I was the one
(No)
Comparin' us to that Brad, Jen and Angelina affair
Look baby I ain't the one
What I'm sayin' is
I ain't tryin' to go for that
(No)
Look I can't go for that
(No)
You need find out where your home is at
And turn the key and range rove it back

You didn't want me then so tell me what made
You changed ya mind
Cuz ain't a thing don't changed about me
Tell me (Why ?)
Cuz when you say you love me it's when I'm with
Someone else I can't help
You to continue foollin' me
So tell me (Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I'm tryna' say is
If you're foollin'
Only foollin'
All I asked is (Why ?)
If you're foollin'
Only foollin'
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Bridge:]
I'm like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I wanna know boy
(Why ?)
I'm like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
All I'm askin' you is
(Why ?)

[Chorus]
[Repeat â€˜till the end]
