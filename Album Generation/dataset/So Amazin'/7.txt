(Chorus:)
I'm writtin' you this letter to tell you
How I'm feellin' inside
To let you know that I like you
And when you read it know I'm excited
Waitin' for you to call me
Boy come over don't stall me

My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on

(Verse 1:)
Late night
Eye to eye
'Till the sunrise
It's like I'm fallin' for you
Hearts beatin'
Four seasons
There'll be no sleepin'
Don't wanna be without you
Cuz I can't wait here all alone
Anticipate you boy
You got me waitin' boy
So open up I'm at ya door
Hear me knockin'
"Let me in"

'Till then I'll be writtin' you this letter
Prayin' when you'll get it
You'll read it and you dream about me
It ain't gon' be right 'till we're together
This life can't get no betta 'till you layin' up under me

(Chorus:)
I'm writtin' you this letter to tell you
HHow I'm feellin' inside
To let you know that I like you
And when you read it know I'm excited
Waitin' for you to call me
Boy come over don't stall me

My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on

(Verse 2:)
This feelin' so new
Been searchin' for you
I wonder how you lived life without me
Cuz somethin' tells me
You're all that I need
I wanna give you my everything
I'll let you think about this in the meantime
I'll make your life better in between time
I'm knowing that we're meant to be together boy
Just tell me I will do whatever

'Till then I'll be writtin' you this letter
Prayin' when you'll get it you'll read it and you dream about me
It ain't gon' be right 'till we're together
This life can't get no betta 'till you layin' up under me

(Chorus:)
I'm writtin' you this letter to tell you how I'm feellin' inside
To let you know that I like you
And when you read it know I'm excited
Waitin' for you to call me
Boy come over don't stall me

My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
My Lovin' it goes O-o-o-o-o-o-o- on
