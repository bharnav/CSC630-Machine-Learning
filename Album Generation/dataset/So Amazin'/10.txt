(Phone Rings)

(Talking:)
Papi, wake up your phone is ringing
Your not gonna get it?
I see, go back to sleep
Te quiero baby

(Verse 1:)
She don't know that your laying by my side tonight
I hear her calling you (A donde esta a donde esta)
Boy where have you been?
And she don't know that you changed your mind 'bout her
And I'm your one true destiny (Pobresita perdoname)
Pero he's in love with me

(Chorus:)
Ah ah, I need this love beside
Ah ah, I dreamed it all my life
Sometimes the things that don't seem right
Leads to the best thing of a life

(Pre-Hook:)
She don't know, she don't know
That your in love with me
I can't let go
Because your the one for me
You are my Corazon
Ah ah, I love you better
You have my Corazon
Y yo te quiero

(Hook 4x:)
Ah ah, ay yo te quiero, te quiero
(I love you)

(Verse 2:)
I know I'm being selfish
But you know I can't help it
Know we neva felt this
I'm melting, into your love
I'm going deeper and deeper
Fee like I, I gotta secret
I'm gon' keep it cuz she don't know your mine
Damelo yo quiero tu besos
I love it when you kiss me
Necesito tu besos, kiss me now
Cuz you'll never understand
The way I can this love we have inside
(Inside, inside, inside)

(Chorus:)
Ah ah, I need this love beside
Ah ah, I dreamed it all my life
Sometimes the things that don't seem right
Leads to the best thing of a life

(Pre-Hook:)
She don't know, she don't know
That your in love with me
I can't let go
Because your the one for me
You are my Corazon
Ah ah, I love you better
You have my Corazon
Y yo te quiero

(Hook 4x:)
Ah ah, ay yo te quiero, te quiero
(I love you)

(Guitar Solo)

(Pre-Hook:)
She don't know, she don't know
That your in love with me
I can't let go
Because your the one for me
You are my Corazon
Ah ah, I love you better
You have my Corazon
Y yo te quiero

(Hook 4x:)
Ah ah, ay yo te quiero, te quiero
(I love you)
