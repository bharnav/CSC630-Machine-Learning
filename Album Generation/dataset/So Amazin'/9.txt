(Intro)

(Verse 1)
Let's talk about
Cookin dinner for ya, makin sure you got somethin to eat
When you come home from runnin 'round on me
Let's talk about
Washin clothes for ya, makin sure you fresh when you hit the streets (uh uh)
Or all these southern chickens to see
Let's talk about
Not hangin' out with my girls
Because you say they triflin'
Tellin' me they ain't no good
When you was probably tryin to get with 'em
So tired of this disrespectful
So ungrateful, make me hateful
Y'all don't appreciate nothin'

(Hook)
Playin' my part for for you
Faithful and trustin'
But yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin'
Above me I placed you
Like it was nothin'
But yall, yall don't really appreciate nothin'
And I did it 'cause I wanted to
'cause I wanted you happy
Isn't that how love suppose to be?
But now I'm so done, I'm through
I'll tell ya somethin
Yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin

(Verse 2)
Oh (oh), let's talk about somethin' personal
Like havin' to put on a show
So I don't ruin yo ego
Don't run like you don't know what I mean
Baby you come home late, like after three
Tappin me like 'are you sleep?'
I put yo priorities over me
Even when I had to go to work
I stayed up (I stayed up) with you til the early mornin
Makin' sure you got what you need (uh oh)
I'm tired of this boy you're not appreciatin' me

(Hook)
Playin' my part for you
Faithful and trustin'
But yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin'
Above me I placed you
Like it was nothin'
But yall, yall don't really appreciate nothin'
And I did it 'cause I wanted to
'cause I wanted you happy
Isn't that how love suppose to be?
But now I'm so done, I'm through
I tell ya somethin
Yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin

(Bridge)
See you don't think
Don't understand
Just 'cause you a man
It's okay to do what you do
I tried to work it out
Ain't no reason to no more
Boy that's why you out the door
Packed yo bags now you out the door
See you don't think
Don't understand
Just 'cause you a man
It's okay to do what you do
I tried to work it out
But you couldn't do it
So now I'm gone

(Hook)
Playin' my part for you
Faithful and trustin'
But yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin'
Above me I placed you
Like it was nothin'
But yall, yall don't really appreciate nothin'
And I did it 'cause I wanted to
'cause I wanted you happy
Isn't that how love's suppose to be?
But now I'm so done, I'm through
I tell ya somethin
Yall really, yall really don't appreciate nothin
