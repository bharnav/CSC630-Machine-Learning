But you got me going so crazy boy

[Hook:]
It's the things that you do
When you doin' the things that you doin'
(ooohhh...)
Temperatures rising
You're so advertising
My votes they're outsizing
(oh)
Dammit this feeling
I can't help but feeling that this could be real
And...(oh,ooh,oh,ooh)
It's so amazin'
My heartbeat is racin'
When i see your face and...
All i know is i...
All i know is i, im in the zone
And im writing this song for you

[Chorus:]
Boy you got me all twisted, twisted up
Boy listen up
You got me thinkin i just might miss
(might miss the bus)
Boy twisted up
Oh you've got me all twisted, twisted up
Boy listen up
All i know is i...
All i know is i, im in the zone
And im writing this song for you

[Verse 1: (Christina Milian)]
You and i liking touching fire
Practically blazing the whole place down
Have it feel so good
Turn up the heat a little higher
Turn up the music; little louder
I just can't get enough of you
Oh boy
It's the things that you do
When you do what you doin
(ooohhh...)

[Hook:]
Temperatures rising
You're so advertising
My votes they're outsizing
(oh)
Dammit this feeling
I can't help but feeling that this could be real
And...(oh,ooh,oh,ooh)
It's so amazin'
My heartbeat is racin'
When i see your face and...
All i know is i...
All i know is i, im in the zone
And im writing this song for you

[Chorus:]
Boy you got me all twisted, twisted up
Boy listen up (boy you got me yea...)
You got me thinkin i just might miss
(might miss the bus)
Boy twisted up
Oh you've got me all twisted, twisted up

My light just ignites when im here with you
Cause my night turns to day when im seein' your face
