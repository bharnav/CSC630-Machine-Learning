[Intro]
I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissing not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was goin' ride
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana

And I'm gonna tell everybody
Cause you cheated
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
And Mistreated
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
I don't need you
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
So ya leaving
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
I don't need it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
Don't believe it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
Ya deceive it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody now
Damn

[Verse 1]
Sittin' up in my room
I'm lighting candles
Handlin' my handle thinking why
I could I let this situation get the best of me
When I gave the best of me
It's just crazy how one minute we connect
I was baby ya lady sweet sadie
Holdin' hands was your favorite
{Now I} Now I ain't got no sad song to sing
You're dead wrong to me, cause I was so committed but
Since we separated I know you will never find
Another chick like me that's why I stay up on ya mind
I know it's hard for you to hear, but I ain't got the time
I moved on, I moved on
I don't want you now

I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissing not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was gon' die
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana

And I'm gonna tell everybody
Cause you cheated
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
And Mistreated
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
I don't need you
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
So ya leaving
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
I don't need it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
Don't believe it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody
Ya deceive it
And I'm Gonna tell everybody now

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin' I'm just saying
Look at what you missing out on now
Yep it's all out now, I'm goin' all out now
And I ain't gon' cry about
Grab my keys to that Bentley GT
Call all my girlfriends and ride
You ain't go nothin' on me
{Christina's going out to party}
You ain't got nothin' on me
You ain't go nothin' on me
Really this thing ain't nothing
You ain't got nothin' on me
{Run and go tell everybody}
You ain't got nothin' on me
You ain't got nothin' on me
Really this thing ain't nothing

I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissing not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was goin' ride
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana
