Emptiness I've found you, how bleak you are
Moving in the shadows, you're here and it's clear
That it's just a state of mind running through the times keeping us alive
First time that I saw you, teeth squeezed my lips
And I thought I'd die without you but you're here and it's clear
That it's just a state of mind running through the times keeping us alive
Just a state of mind, keeping us in line before we take a dive

Oooooh-oooooh... Oooh-oooh...
Just be happy, you are strong now
It's so lonely to love someone

Happiness I've found you, how sweet you are
Smiling in the shadows, you're here and it's clear
That it's just a state of mind running through the times keeping us alive
Just a state of mind, keeping us in line before we take a dive

Oooooh-oooooh... Oooh-oooh...
Oooooh-oooooh... Oooh-oooh...
