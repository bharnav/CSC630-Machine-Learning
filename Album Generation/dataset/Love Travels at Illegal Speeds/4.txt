[Verse 1]
You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky
Gotta decide
If we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gonna look to the sky
We're gonna die
Wondering why
Life ain't nothing but sorrow

'Cause it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you've gotta let me know
Or maybe
You won't

[Verse 2]
You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky
Gotta decide
If we're gonna see tomorrow

You and I gonna look to the sky
We're gonna die
Wondering why
Life ain't nothing but sorrow

'Cause it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you've gotta let me know
Oh baby
Don't go

[Chorus]
Never met a girl like you before
Don't think I ever will again
Why don't you smile?
Why don't you smile?

Never thought I'd see you walking out that door
Don't think I ever will again
Why don't you sing?
Why can't you sing?
Why can't you sing?

La-la-la-la-la-la (x3)

[Bridge/Outro]
You and I gotta think for a while
Look to the sky
Gotta decide
If we're gonna see tomorrow (x3)

'Cause it's gonna be a while
'Til I get to see you smile
And you've gotta let me know
Oh, baby

La-la-la-la-la-la (x6)

Oh, oh
