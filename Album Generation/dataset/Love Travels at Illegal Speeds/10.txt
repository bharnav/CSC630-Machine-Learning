Saw you on the corner by the cash machine
You made the cutest couple that I ever did see
You hug him and you kiss him and I'm hearing what you're saying
Britannia Junction's not the place for me
Britannia Junction's not the place for me

What's he got that I haven't got?
Where's he been that I've never seen?
Can't bear to see you walking hand in hand
He's kinda cool but I don't understand
What in the world has he got?
Guess he's just better looking than me, oh...

Got a brown leather jacket on and tight blue jeans
Wears a pair of black Beatle boots just like me
He's got a lot of hair on his face and on his head
So why'd I get my hair cut so short instead?

What's he got that I haven't got?
Where's he been that I've never seen?
Can't bear to see you walking hand in hand
He's kinda cool but I don't understand
What in the world has he got?
Guess he's just better looking than me, oh... Yeah!

What's he got that I haven't got?
Where's he been that I've never seen?
Can't stand to see you walking hand in hand
He's really cool but I don't understand
What in the world has he got?
Guess he's just better looking than me
