Baby, baby, babe what can I do? I'm so in love with you
I know you won't believe me but it's true
I'm so in love with you, I'm so in love with you
Just the way the sunlight hits your eyes, makes me feel alive
My body and my soul have been revived
I feel like I can fly, I feel like I can fly

I can feel you breathe from miles away
It helps me see a better day
A voice inside is telling me to stay
I'm falling deeper every day, I'm falling deeper every day

Something in your smile that made me see, a place I long to be
I look at you and I can't quite believe
That you could be with me, that you could be with me

I can feel you breathe from miles away
It helps me see a better day
A voice inside is telling me to stay
I'm falling deeper every day, I'm falling deeper every day

Gotta call you on the phone 'cause I ain't feeling right
I can't stand to be alone on these dark dark nights
And you're the only girl who can shake my blues away
With your miracle smile and the things that you say, yeah

Baby, baby, babe what can I do? I'm so in love with you
I know you won't believe me but it's true
I'm so in love with you, I'm so in love with you
