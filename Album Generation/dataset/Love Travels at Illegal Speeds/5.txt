We're a right pair, you and I
It's a messed-up situation
Are you gonna dump this other guy
Before I die of sexual frustration?
I can't stand the crowds on a Saturday night
Why don't you come round and try to make it alright?

Gimme some love, gimme some love
Gimme some love, gimme some love

The way you get into my corduroys
Like you're on some kind of expedition
Your shaking hands are the destroyer of boys
I run into the arms of certain extinction
First you're teasing me, then you're wanting a fight
Just 'cause it pleases me doesn't make it alright

Gimme some love, gimme some love
Gimme some love, gimme some love

We're a right pair, you and I
It's a messed-up situation
Are you gonna dump this other guy?
Before I die of sexual frustration
I can't stand the crowds on a Saturday night
Why don't you come round, try to make it alright?

Gimme some love, gimme some love
Gimme some love, gimme some love
Gimme some love, gimme some love
Gimme some love, gimme some love
