You've got a bug in your body
And an itch in your head
Shooting looks down every street
Hoping there's someone to meet, do you care?
You better start making changes
Before they put you away
Shooting looks down every street
Feral kid with no beliefs
Stealing hearts just like a thief
Killing boys with your body

Can't you see in their faces that you make them so frikking crazy?
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in

Though I've forgot what your name is
You're on the tip of my tongue
And I just refuse to see, you as an atrocity
You better start making changes
Before they put you away
Are you dressing like before?
Is there another boy to score?
Will you take him on the floor?
Will you drown in your sorrow?

Can't you see in their faces that you make them so frikking crazy?
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in

Can't you see in their faces that you make them so frikking crazy?
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
I can't look at your skin 'cause it's doing me in
