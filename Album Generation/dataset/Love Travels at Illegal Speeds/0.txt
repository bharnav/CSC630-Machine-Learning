Standing on the shore watching our ship go down
Sinking in the sand and I can't turn around
Future's looking black and it's a sight to see
Just a thousand grey waves crashing over me
Just a thousand grey waves breaking over me

Now it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?
Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?
Watching 'til you're out of sight
Dreaming I did something right standing on my own again

Water in my lungs and it's a pain to breathe
Salt is in my eyes and it's a pain to see
I can't stand the pressure though you think I can
Just don't wanna see it going down the pan
Just don't wanna see it going down the pan

Now it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?
Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?
Pushing you to your wit's end
Guess I'm gonna lose a friend standing on my own again
Now it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?
Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?
Watching 'til you're out of sight
Dreaming I did something right standing on my own again
