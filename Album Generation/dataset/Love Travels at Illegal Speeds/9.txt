Flights to the sea forgetting you, forgetting me
I wanna love you in the sand, I won't let go of your hand, lovely rain

Flights to the sea, I loving you, you loving me
Though I might lose you to the sand, I won't let go of your hand, lovely rain
Lovely rain, lovely rain, lovely rain, lovely rain
Lovely rain, lovely rain
