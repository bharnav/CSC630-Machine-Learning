You talk about money, you talk about soul
I guess you better get some before you get too old
Lay down on your side and say bye bye
You talk about money, you talk about soul
I guess you'd better get some before you get too too too old
Lay down on your side and say bye bye

I know they're saying that I never tried to stay by your side
Oh, baby-baby they'll take you for a ride, oh
You always let me down, you always let me down
You always let me down, you always

You talk about money, there ain't none around
You can't seem to let me have the freedom that I found
Drop your foolish pride and say bye bye

What you saying that you haven't tried to say before?
Oh, baby you know you been had before
You always let me down, you always let me down, yeah yeah yeah yeah!
I know they're saying that I never tried to stay by your side
Well baby baby they'll take you for a ride
You always let me down, you always let me down
You always let me down, you always let me down, first chance you get
You always let me down, first chance you get
You always let me down, first chance you get
You always let me down, first chance you get, you always let me down
