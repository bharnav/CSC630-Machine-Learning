You've got the need to wander, I'm getting it from your eyes
I know I'm not the one to tell you exactly where your feelings should lie
When I saw you my life turned so beautiful
I never met no-one like you before

Why can't you tell it like it is, just make it clear
You came into my life and then you disappear
All I have of you is a ringing in my ear
And when I reach out 'cause I wanna hold you near
There's nobody here

And as you're packing your suitcase, I'm catching you dry your eyes
But you're keeping a straight face like this happens all the time
You treated me like I was brand new before
No-one had made me feel like you do before

Why can't you tell it like it is, just make it clear
You came into my life and then you disappear
All I have of you is a ringing in my ear
And when I reach out 'cause I wanna hold you near
There's nobody here

When I saw you my life turned so beautiful
I'd never met no-one like you before
And as I feel your footsteps move the floor
I welcome loneliness back through the door

Why can't you tell it like it is, just make it clear
You came into my life and then you disappear
All I have of you is a ringing in my ear
And when I reach out 'cause I wanna hold you near
There's nobody here
