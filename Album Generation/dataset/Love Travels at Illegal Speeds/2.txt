Getting paranoid, heart beats fast
Start to sweat when I see you walk past
Legs are killing, and my eyes
Wanna close them when they're open too wide
Pull my hair out, going mad
Have to wait though I want you so bad
Gotta go now, oh my God
Call my number, I'll be waiting

Can I see you in the bedroom tonight?
Can I see you on the beach tonight?
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know

When can I see you and not your ghost?
You're never there when I'm needing you most
It's devastating, it's all too much
My mind's exploding when I think of your touch
You've got the power over me
I'm only seeing what you want me to see
My pulse is racing, I'm falling down
I'm gonna need resuscitating

Can I see you in the bathroom tonight?
You gonna let me make you feel good tonight?
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know

Can I see you in the bedroom tonight?
Can I see you on the beach tonight?
Can I see you in the bathroom tonight?
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
Don't let your man know, don't let your man know
