She's got baggage
She's got so much heavy baggage
The weight of the world is on her shoulder
I wonder how she carries it around

Wake up, it was the middle of the night
Telephone ringing so I turned on the light
What up she must be calling me again
Night after night and it's driving me insane

She's got baggage
She's got so much heavy baggage
The weight of the world is on her shoulder
I wonder how she carries it around

Got up, dragged myself out of bed
Nuclear explosion banging in my head
Why me, how did I get so lucky
A million other guys she had to pick me

She's got baggage
She's got so much heavy baggage
The weight of the world is on her shoulders
I wonder how she carries it around

Hey Joe, say it ain't so
She called me up then she put me on hold
Hey Joe, say it ain't so
She called me up then she put me on hold

Watch out, we got a whacked out woman
Hurricane warning and it's blowing me away

She's got baggage
She's got so much heavy baggage
The weight of the world is on her shoulders
I wonder how she carries it around
