Some folks are born, made to wave the flag
Ooh, that red, white and blue
And when the band plays, "Hail To The Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks are born, silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, y'all
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house look-ah like a rummage sale, yes-ah

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Yeah, yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they'll send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More, more, more"

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no
