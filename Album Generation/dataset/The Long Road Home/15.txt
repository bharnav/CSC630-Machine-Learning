Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path
Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path
Every time I get some good news
There's a shadow on my back

Well, I saw the gypsy man
'Way down in San Berdoo
Well, I saw the gypsy man
'Way down in San Berdoo
Five dollars on the table
Keep me 'way from my tomb

Said I got thirteen months of bad luck
Bound to be some pain
"Don't you do no trav'lin'
Fly in no machines"

Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path
Every time I get some good news
There's a shadow on my back

Every time I get some good news
There's a shadow on my back
