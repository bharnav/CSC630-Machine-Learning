I just got home from Illinois, locked the front door, oh boy
I got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin'
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my backdoor
There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Dinosaur Victrola listenin' to Buck Owens
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my backdoor
Well, tambourines and elephants are playin' in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo, doo
A wond'rous apparition provided by a magician
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my backdoor
Well, tangerines and elephants are playin' in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo doo
A wond'rous apparition provided by a magician
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door
Well, forward troubles, Illinois, I locked the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancin' on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrow
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my backdoor
