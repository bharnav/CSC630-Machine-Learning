[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn
You know there's no return
Change your empty rules!
You join the other fools!
Turn to somethin' new!
Now, it's killin' you!

[Verse 2]
First, it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusionin'
You push the needle in
From life, you escape!
Reality's black drape!
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time!

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're givin' Death a kiss
Poor little fool now!
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now!

[Chorus]
You're havin' a good time, baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're livin' too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, you know the scene
Your skin starts turnin' green
Your eyes no longer seein'
Life's reality
Push the needle in!
Face Death's sickly grin!
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin!

[Verse 4]
Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn!
You don't wanna learn!
Price of life is high!
Now, you're gonna die!
