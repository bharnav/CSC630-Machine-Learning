[Verse 1]
We sail...
Through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon...
In silver dreams
Pours down in beams
Light of the night
The earth...
A purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

[Verse 2]
While down...
Below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight
Breaks dawn from night
And so...
We pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel
The universe

[Instrumental Outro]
