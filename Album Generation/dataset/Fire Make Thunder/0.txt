Pray to a higher power
Enemy's gonna do the same
You make energy matter
The universe doesn't know your name

Cold call, cold call
Enemy's gonna do the same
Cold call, cold call
The universe never heard of us

Light those candles
Cut off their hands if they don't know how
Cite that stanza
Get it all in before the music stops

Cold call, cold call
Enemy gonna do the same
Cold call, cold call
The universe never heard of us

I guess I'm fine but my neighbors could be better
I drank that wine and I got my reference letter
Who will they come for?
I wanna see you there!

Cold call, cold call
Enemy's gonna do the same
Cold call, cold call
The universe never heard of us
