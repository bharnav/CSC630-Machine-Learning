Give us a name
So we know where we're starting from
Focus the wave
Between the cars
Under the sun

Floodlights on the rail yard hold you, hold you like
Headlights on the highway pull you, pull you
But no one turns them off
No one turns them off like you do

Under cover of night
We go up the river side
Show us your hands
As we come again
The invisible man

Starlight on the railway
Holds you, holds you like
Headlights on the highway pull you, pull you
But no one turns them off
No one turns them off like you do

If all we have is time to cover for
You've got secrets keep your secrets don't we all
I'm trying to shake these pictures but I'm losing
Over bridges under tunnels keep it moving

Careless causes heaven's gonna
Burn a hole beside my bed
Time moves slow so tap the tempo
Frozen on the string you broke
Houseless haunted voices gonna
Shake the cup beside my bed
Sound move slow so tap the tempo
Stretched out on the string you broke

If all we have is time to cover for
You've got secrets keep your secrets don't we all

Under cover of night
We go up the river side
Show us your hands
As we come again
The invisible man
