Don't feel like the sun's coming up
Don't feel like it's gonna get better

I can't keep promises
I forget being seventeen
Hard times come to your troubled son
Hope is the last thing that he needs
Hope is a candle that feeds
Off the air till it leaves almost nothing

Gotta stay
Gonna stay
Gonna stay
Can't stay

Hope only got us so far
And the saddest thing
As the wind blows your hair
Are the seeds of our nothing
