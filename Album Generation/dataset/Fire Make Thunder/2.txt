Uncovered for a little while
You told me, don't stop
Uncovered for a little while
With no one there to terrify

We'll start in Canada
We have a chance there
Move forward in reverse
Oh come on indian curse
We'll end with Mexico
Over our shoulders
Oh come on indian curse

We'll pass through Panama
That's what it's there for
Oh engine running worse
Oh come on indian curse
We exit Ecuador
Along the shoulder
Oh come on indian curse

Gonna wait this out
Gonna wait it out
Gonna wait it out on the plains
Changes
No more changes
No more changes after now

Uncovered for a little while
You told me, don't stop
Uncovered for a little while
With no one there to terrify
