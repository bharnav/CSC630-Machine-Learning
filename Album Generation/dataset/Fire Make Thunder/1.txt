We're kids on the corner, we're sure as hell
That daddy's got a gun that he cannot draw
We hear you're carrying yours as well
We're calling, we're calling, we're calling
We're calling you

Christians and cutters we all confess
On twenty-one channels, each day one less
You can't keep shooting the camera test
We're calling, we're calling, we're calling
We're calling

Some guards call it the forward slash
Others can't talk with a knife in their back
We're call call calling
We're call call calling
We're calling

Got a king but he's sailling his robe
A kid kissed him and he turned to a toad
The queen screamed but it came out a croak
And if you listen you can still hear them singing

Your dog's on the phone, are you out or in?
Another day dead is a week for him
You can't keep huffing the oxygen
We're calling, we're calling, we're calling
We're calling

Some guards call it the forward slash
Others can't talk with a knife in their back
We're call call calling
We're call call calling
We're calling you
