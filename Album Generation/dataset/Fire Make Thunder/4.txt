This quality won't come again
Completely overwhelmed with nothing
Compare the quiet to the pain
Just tell them everything is perfect

Well the camera get what the camera take
And it's all gone, all gone
And the wind won't howl if the window break
And we're all gone
Well the indian want what the camera take
But it's all gone
And the guard go home when the jailhouse break
Cause they're all gone

This quality won't come again
Completely overwhelmed with nothing
Compare the quiet to the pain
Just tell them everything is perfect

We were already down before
We were already down on the floor
