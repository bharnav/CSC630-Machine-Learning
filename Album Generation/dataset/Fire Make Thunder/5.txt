Dead man dog at the graveyard fence
He wanna go where his master went
Cop shoot man 'cause the knife got bent
And the landlord suin' for the backward rent

Man bite dog 'cause the master dead
And the dog just glad that someone got fed
Man shoot wife 'cause the knife got bent
And the wife take offense to the message that sent

Chief leave nothin' before he drop
Hock his rhymes at the pawn-it shop
Mail his feather to an astronaut
Spent all the cash on a corner plot

Spaceman glad at the deal he got
He second line in space a lot
Them cowboys love them indian mask
And they write it off on the turbotax

We got no money 'cause we just got paid
We smoke in packs on the esplanade
We trawl for oil where they stumped the oak
And we can't go home 'cause the river broke

We got no money 'cause we just got paid
We smoke in packs on the esplanade
We trawl for oil where they stumped the oak
And we can't go home 'cause the river broke
