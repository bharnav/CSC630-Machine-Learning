Well, it's a god-given fact
That you can't go back
No, you can't go back

It's a god-given law
That you're gonna lose your maw
Yes, you're gonna lose your maw

Well, it's a god-given fact
You gotta buy 'em by the sack
Gotta buy 'em by the sack

Well, it's a god-given law
That you're gonna get small
Yes, you're gonna get small

Maybe just another rap
But you're running out of sap
Yes, you're running out of sap

Well, you better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap
Dying under daddy's cap

Shrivel up

It's at the top of the list
That you can't get pissed
No, you can't get pissed

It's rule number one
Living right isn't fun
Living right isn't fun

Cause it's a god-given fact
That you can't go back
No, you can't go back

It's a god-given law
That you're gonna lose your maw
Yes, you're gonna lose your maw

Time-tested and true
You gotta pooty, poo-poo
Gotta pooty, poo-poo

Well, it's a god-given law
That you're gonna get small
Yes, you're gonna get small

Maybe just another rap
But you're running out of sap
Yes, you're running out of sap

Well, you better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap
Dying under daddy's cap, now

Oh, shrivel up

Shrivel up DEVO
