They tell us that
We lost our tails
Evolving up
From little snails
I say it's all
Just wind in sails

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O

Monkey men all
In business suits
Teachers and critics
All dance the poot

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko Homo

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O
Are we not pinheads?
We are Devo!

(All together now)
God made man
But he used the monkey to do it
Apes in the plan
We're all here to prove it
I can walk like an ape
Talk like an ape
Do what monkey do
God made man
But a monkey supplied the glue

D-E-V-O
(We must repeat)
D-E-V-O
(We must repeat)
D-E-V-O
(We must repeat)
D-E-V-O

Okay lets go!
