Oh Mrs. O
Will you tell us where the naughty children go
Will you show
How the sky turned white and everybody froze
Heaven knows how they got into the fireplace
But everybody's saying grace
And trying to keep a happy face

And oh Mrs. O
Can you teach us how to keep from getting cold
Out we go and you watch us as we face the falling snow
What a show with our hairdryers aimed heavenwards
And fifty-foot extension cords
You really have a way with words

The truth can't save you now
The sky is falling down
Watch the vultures count the hours
April trains may bring strange showers

And oh Mrs. O
Will you tell about the time they made you go
All alone to the palace where they took your only clothes
We all know
There's no hell and no Hiroshima
Chernobyl was a cover up
The world is really all in love

Oh Mrs. O
Will you leave us hanging now that we are grown
Up and old
Will you kill me if i say i told you so
We all know
There's no Hitler and no holocaust
No winter and no Santa Claus
And yes, Virginia, all because
The truth can't save you now
The sky is falling down
Everything they ever told us
Shakes our faith and breaks their promise
But you can stop the truth from leaking
If you never stop believing......
