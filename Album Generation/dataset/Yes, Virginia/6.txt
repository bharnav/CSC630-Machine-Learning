It is a thursday
I get up early
It is a challenge
I'm usually lazy
I make some coffee
I eat some Rice Chex
And then I sit down
To check my inbox
I only read a word or two
I stare across the street and see the churches and the blue
The first orgasm of the morning
Is cold and hard as hell
There won't be any second coming
As far as I can tell
I arch my back cause
I'm very close now
It's very cold here
By the window
There are some school kids
Yelling and running
I barely notice
That I am cumming
The first orgasm of the morning
Is like a fire drill
It's nice to have a little warning
But not enjoyable
I am too busy to have friends
A lover would just complicate my plans
So I will never look for love again
I'm taking matters into my own hands
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me
Won't you hold me?
