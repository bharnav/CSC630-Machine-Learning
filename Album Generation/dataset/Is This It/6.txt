[Verse 1]
Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round, oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen-oh minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why I keep walking for miles

[Chorus]
And say, people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 2]
Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned round, oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie, 'cause I left that night, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 3]
Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round, oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door, yeah
