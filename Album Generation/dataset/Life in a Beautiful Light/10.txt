Oh the sky it always grows and the lights they never fade
There's magic in the air, I can feel it everywhere
But the green and the blue come between me and you
But I will always be true to you

And the sun it never shines and the wind it always blows
The treasure that you're looking for is right under your nose
But the green and the blue come between me and you
On a Saturday afternoon

I never knew I could feel so lonely
I never knew it would be true
I never knew I could see a night like this
Standing here with you

But no matter where I roam, no matter where I'll be
Something always brings me back to these streets
But the green and the blue come between me and you
On a Saturday afternoon

I never knew I could feel so lonely
I never knew it would be true
I never knew I could see a night like this
Standing here with you

But no matter where I roam, no matter where I'll be
Something always brings me back to these streets
But the green and the blue, they unite me and you
We're both Glasgow through and through
