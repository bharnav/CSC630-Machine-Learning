The furthest star in the sky, well that's the one that passed me by
I tried to wish upon that star, it didn't get me very far
It fell on empty ears, it fell on empty hearts
And my dreams, they fell apart

I'm always wishing I was someone else
I'm always hoping I can see sell myself

But I'll be free for what I believe
And I won't sell my soul just to achieve my goal
And I've been holding back the tears, dreaming all these years
And I'll sing from the heart if you'll listen to me
Everything I do is what I believe

The lights went out across the world and your house of cards came tumbling down
Cos nothing stays and noting sticks when you're roaming with the lunatics
But my star in the darkest sky, twinkles and watches while the other stars die
Upon your empty ears and empty hearts

I'm always wishing I was someone else
But I've given up the ghost, I will never sell myself

But I'll be free for what I believe
And I won't sell my soul just to achieve my goal
And I've been holding back the tears, dreaming all these years
And I'll sing from the heart if you'll listen to me
Everything I do is what I believe

The furthest star in the sky, well that's the one that passed me by
I tried to wish upon that star, it didn't get me very far
