The world kept moving, you stood still
Caught in a moment against your will
And I'll think of you tonight
The world kept going and nobody could see
The hell that was happening too hard to believe
And I shed a tear for you

No matter how many bombs we've dropped
No matter how many wars we've fought
It's good to see that it's not dead
Human spirit is alive and well

The people couldn't get it, they said it wasn't true
How could this happen, happen to you
But we'll try our best be home for Christmas
And all the while we're still thinking 'bout ourselves
Worrying about money and stressing about wealth
But there's much more, much more to live for

No matter how many bombs we've dropped
No matter how many wars we've fought
It's good to see that it's not dead
Human spirit is alive and well
Human spirit is alive and well
Human spirit is alive and well
