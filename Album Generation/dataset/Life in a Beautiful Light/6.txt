Listen to my heart as it beats for you
And it's telling you the things that I never could
And it's laying it down
On the line for you
And the years are catching up
I can see it on your face
And the days of being young and free
Are left there with the memories that blow
In the wind

And I can feel it coming when the Monday morning blues
They last all through the week I feel it on Sunday too
And I can feel it coming when my knees feel weak
And I cannot speak the truth

The days of being young, the days of being free
They're etched upon my face in every line that you see
The stories I could tell, the lies I told as well
What I wouldn't give to live it all again

The years are passing by every single day
Where did they go, did you take them all away
Now I'm older and grey
And their children they all left, they fled the family nest
And now we're all alone
The house don't feel like home anymore
Anymore

And I can feel it coming when the Monday morning blues
They last all through the week I feel it on Sunday too
And I can feel it coming when my knees feel weak
And I cannot speak the truth

The days of being young, the days of being free
They're etched upon my face in every line that you see
The stories I could tell, the lies I told as well
What I wouldn't give to live it all again

And in my baby's eyes I lived it all again
The fear, the surprise, everything
In my baby's eyes I lived it all again
And I wouldn't change anything
And in my baby's eyes I lived it all again
And I wouldn't change anything
