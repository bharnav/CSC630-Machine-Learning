Why did I dream last night?
Why did I not see the light?

Cos here and now is what I've been waiting for
All my life, this is what I was born to do
No sacrifice, I wouldn't give it up for you

And set fire to my heart then tear my world apart just like you always do
And give gimme me just a taste, then take it all away
I'm lost in the game
The game they call the fame

Why did I think there was something more?
Why did it feel different to the years before?

Cos here and now is what I've been waiting for
All my life, this is what I was born to do
No sacrifice, I wouldn't give it up for you

Set fire to my heart then tear my world apart just like you always do
And give gimme me just a taste, then take it all away
I'm lost in the game
The game they call the fame
The game they call the fame

And set fire to my heart then tear my world apart just like you always do
And give gimme me just a taste, then take it all away
I'm lost in the game
The game they call the fame
