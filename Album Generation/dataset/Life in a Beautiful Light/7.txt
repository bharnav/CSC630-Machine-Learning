[Verse 1]
Oh my dancing's getting slower now
'Cause my years they're getting older now
And my eyes, they won't cry
My tears have all run dry
And my memory doesn't get me very far
I can't remember my name or exactly who you are
And I don't know why
No I don't know why

[Chorus]
Will you please believe I'm not the person you see
I left that body long ago, I left it way back there
Will you please believe given all that you see
I left that body long ago but somehow nobody knows

[Verse 2]
So goodbye, you were my world and my life
And I don't know why you've lost your mother, lost your wife
But there's more, something more than meets the eye
This is not the end, this is only goodbye

[Chorus]
Will you please believe I'm not the person you see
I left that body long ago, I left it way back there

[Outro]
Now I'm free, I'm as happy as can be
I just wanted you to know
That I left that body long ago
So long ago
