Wishing I was dreaming, wishing I didn't know
All the thoughts I was thinkin', you don't want to know

Everyone's always movin', I'm standing still for all the time
Thoughts that I was livin', echoes in my mind

There's so much more that I could be
So many places that I'll never see
So many lives that I'll never meet
I'll just dream until we get there in the end

Always thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, before today is even through
Always thinkin' 'bout the future, what on earth will happen to you

There's so much more that I could be
So many places that I'll never see
So many lives that I'll never meet
I'll just dream until we get there in the end

And if the world stopped spinning would I start moving on
And if the world stopped dreaming, would I stop believing in it all

There's so much more that I could be
So many places that I'll never see
So many lives that I'll never meet
I'll just dream until we get there in the end
I'll just dream until we get there in the end
I'll just dream until we get there in the end
