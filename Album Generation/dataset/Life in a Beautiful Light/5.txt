Wave your flag high above your head, you deserve to smile, celebrate in style. 'cause everything that depressed you now is gone
And eighteen days while the world looked on, you stood your ground, kept holding strong. Eighteen days while the world looked on

Across the Nile there are stars tonight and they shine much brighter than before
Across the Nile there's peace and love tonight
And it shows much stronger than before, much stronger than before

Free and fair life they said it would be, cross our fingers, wait and see and dream of a better day
And across the world you've shown them all that hope and strength can conquer all
Will we stand together again?

Across the Nile there are stars tonight and they shine much brighter than before
Across The Nile there's peace and love tonight
And it shows much stronger than before, much stronger than before

Hope and strength can conquer all, you've shown the world how the mighty fall
And across the Nile there are stars much brighter than before
