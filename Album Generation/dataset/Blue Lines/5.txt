[Verse 1]
I know that Iâ€™ve imagined love before
And how it could be with you
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?

[Hook]
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

[Verse 2]
The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?

[Hook]
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

[Bridge]
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part

[Outro]
I don't know where this one came from
I don't know where this one came from
I don't know where this one came from
