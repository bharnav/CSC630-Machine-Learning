Eyes are still red
Coming apart
Lies won't take me far
Body aches
These hands shake
Dealing comes with scars
It's hard to sleep with all that's questioned

Can I find
Peace of mind
Barricades in time
Can I find
Peace inside
And let love come save my life

Tried to forget
Feelings of death
Invading panic spawns
Can't concentrate
No one relates
Stealing all the light
Spreading thin a soul in sections

Can I find
Peace of mind
Barricades in time
Can I find
Peace inside
And let love come save my life

The enemy's my own thinking
I never let it show
The weight on me I am sinking
I fight this more than you know

Can I find
Peace of mind
Barricades in time
Can I find
Peace of mind
Can I find
Peace inside
And let love come save my life
Everything is fine

Can I find
Peace of mind
Barricades in time
If you ask
Everything is fine
Can I find
Peace inside
Barricades in time
As I deal with my own strife

The enemy's my own thinking
I never let it show
The weight on me I am sinking
I fight this more than you know
