You're not thinking with your mind
You'll remember well
Surrender general
Fine
Unspoken and uninspired
Your orders spoken
Vikraphone

Your mind's made up
Vikraphone
You won't give it up
Vikraphone
This is what you've got inside your vikraphone
You won't stop us
You can't stop us

Lights left blinking
Turn off tonight
Here's forever
Aren't you clever
Asinine
You don't know
And never mind
Doors left open
You won't be closing
Vikraphone

Your mind's made up
Vikraphone
You won't give it up
Vikraphone
This is what you've got inside your vikraphone
You won't stop us
You can't stop us

Vikraphone
Your mind's made up
Vikraphone
You won't give it up
Vikraphone
This is what you've got inside your vikraphone
You won't stop us
You can't stop us

Hold in your hand
And believe what you say
In the light of the dark
You will soon find your way
And it's cool we can smile
Hope to see you one day
No remorse
No regrets
We were lost in the way
You're no fool
You're just you
Here's the truth and believe
It's the youth we obtain by the bonds that we breathe
It's all a ball and a word where the sky is out space in this freedom we live

You won't stop us
You can't stop us
