You'll hear them breaking bones ((repeatedly echoed throughout the song))

Silently pacing
All fear erased here
It's time to face it
Cold sweats profusely
Crowd chanting loudly
One goal pursuing
One thought consuming

Now you're stepping inside
Where you can't be afraid

No excuse will suffice
Deadly
Quick
And precise
Trained for this moment
No one else can own it
Keep all eyes on me
One goal pursuing
One thought consuming

Now you're stepping inside
Where you can't be afraid
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage
Put your heart on the line
It determines your fate
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage

Inside this octagon
Eight sided nightmare just begun
Warriors modern battle ground
Can't let him get me down
No noise
Just quiet now
One goal pursuing
One thought consuming

Now you're stepping inside
Where you can't be afraid
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage
Put your heart on the line
It determines your fate
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage

When you enter the cage
Get tapped out

Now you're stepping inside
Where you can't be afraid
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage
Put your heart on the line
It determines your fate
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage

Now you're stepping inside
Where you can't be afraid
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage
Put your heart on the line
It determines your fate
It's a matter of pride
When you enter the cage

When you enter the cage
Get tapped out

Get tapped out When you enter the cage
