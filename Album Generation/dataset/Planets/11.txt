It's so hard to watch you struggle (struggle), here and hard or would I have to see you stumble
Short tempers harsh words that are humble, watching the world, watching the world around me crumble

I won't fight back, can't give in. Won't stay here forever like this, all the world be nice and sound again

Like a brother, like a sister, something like a family I was so lonely, but you saved me
Insecurities race through my heart, new sensation realizing my part
Your mien has changed like the seasons, we're fighting our own addictions

Patience brings heart aches, anger flies, still we try

I won't fight back, can't give in, won't stay here forever like this, refusing consciousness
To drown in to cope with, inebriate to find when waking that nothing has been changed

Take one more drink you can't live without it, Take one more drink
Take one more drink you can't live without it, Take one more drink
So hard to talk about it, how did I know that you would lie about it
Stand there and watch you ashamed without it, losing sleep at night I would still dream about it

I won't fight back, can't give in, won't stay here forever like this, refusing consciousness
To drown inÂ¦ to cope with, inebriate to find out that nothing has changed
