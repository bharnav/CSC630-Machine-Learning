One little request changes life for your best interest
No need for self-control while doctors line their pockets

One for your pain and one for your mind
Reliant
You're not addicted
It's fine
One to lose weight and make you look right
One day there'll be one for these lies

Of course feeling numb
Of course feeling numb here
Is habit forming
No matter what's wrong will set you free
Better living through chemistry
Prescriptions for rent if you need relief
Better living through chemistry

Every place I turn my eye
New drug marketing line
The sure for everything is just around the corner
This dealer wears a name tag here to fill our order

One for your pain
And one for your mind relay
And I'm not addicted it's fine
One to lose weight and make you look right
One day there'll be one for these lies

Of course feeling numb here
Of course feeling numb here
Habit for me
No matter what's wrong will set you free
Better living through chemistry
Prescriptions for it if you need relief
Better living through chemistry

Get your life under control

Patients are paychecks just looking for the kick back
Money's the motive and corruption is the tool of their trade
Greed is taking over the hollow heart of health care
No longer taking chances
They've given up on us

We are the only ones that can end epidemics like this
Stand up
Now that you know

No matter what's wrong they'll set you free
Better living through chemistry
Prescriptions for it if you need relief
Better living through chemistry

We are the only ones that can end epidemics like this
Better living through chemistry

Stand up
Now that you know
Stand up
Get you life under control
Stand up
Now that you know
Get your life under control
