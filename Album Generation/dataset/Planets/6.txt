I'll make you a promise today
That this family I'll never betray
Life sometimes fades away

Night is upon us
And I hope that this one never ends
The face of a woman
Whom I loved before I was a man I'm making some time
And I'm honest
In pain we can live till the end you know you're on my mind
And I promise
That I'll see you someday so for now I will just pray

Can't believe it's over
Life just gets in the way
Life just gets in the way

Your eyes were upon us
There are no words for how much that meant
This trace of my mother
And not enough days that we spent it was my selfish pride
And you taught us
There was no one to blame in the end bitter feelings reside
And it caught us
Before that day we set everything straight

Can't believe it's over
Life just gets in the way. Life just gets in the way
I remember the words that you said
Hearing them as I sat by your bed
Now life just gets in the way

Feeling the same everyday without you
Can't seem to find my way
Cold sweats in the night wake me from sleep
Thinking you're alright

Life just gets in the way
Life just gets in the way
I remember the words that you said
Hearing them as I sat by your bed
Now life just gets in the way

Oh, I'll make you a promise today that this family I'll never betray
Life sometimes fades away
