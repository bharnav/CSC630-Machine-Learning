Despite these imperfections
Despite all I say
Insight and recollection
I'm done with yesterday

I will lose my mind
And make real this time
To leave it all behind
I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign
Planets will align
I'm gonna blow my mind
I won't cry wolf

The one I trusted sold me
This is overblown
But I didn't want to believe
Everyone I trusted deceived me

I will lose my mind
And make real this time
To leave it all behind
I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign
Planets will align
I'm gonna blow my mind
I won't cry wolf

I figured out I'm holding on too tight
And I can't let go
I'm hiding
I'm needy
On the inside I'm bleeding
I'm searching for something but it can't seem to find me
On the surface there is someone that pretends to focus
I'm waiting and wanting
Too confused to go on
Trying to live when the pain can all be gone
Conforming to confusion
The voice in my head
Leading me here back home

I will lose my mind
And make real this time
To leave it all behind
I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign
Planets will align
I'm gonna blow my mind
I won't cry wolf

Show me a sign
Planets will align
I'm gonna blow my mind
I won't cry wolf
