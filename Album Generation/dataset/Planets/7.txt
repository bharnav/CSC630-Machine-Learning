True I wasn't there for you
Sorry that I hurt you deeply
Too young to know what to do
16 and I have no worries
When I saw that picture of you
I had to find the daughter I never knew

My absence grows
I reap what I've sewn
These mistakes are my own
Little child you're not alone

Locked behind those bars of you
Wish there was a way I could help
Too young to know what to do
Lessons burn the point you've proven
This love is complicated and bruised
Realize what makes me makes you

My absence grows
I reap what I've sewn
These mistakes are my own
Little child you're not alone
Time to take it slow all this anger
Let it go
My child I long to hold all this anger

I know I'm not a lord
I was never a saint
Gotta take what you got cause I'm nothing you ain't
If I gave you the world would you throw it away
Better keep your chin up
Living life for today
You can abuse it
You can misuse it
You can go right back down that line
You can't escape it
Never erase it
Now you know

I'll be here your future fading
Understand what I'm explaining
I'm waiting, anticipating
I'll be here
Your future fading

My absence grows
I reap what I've sewn
These mistakes are my own
Little child you're not alone
Time to take it slow all this anger letting go
My child I long to hold all this anger

Little one
Can't you see I wanna let you know
Don't you be like me
