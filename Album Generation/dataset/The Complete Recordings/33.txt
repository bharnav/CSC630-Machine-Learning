[Verse 1]
Everytime I'm walkin', down the streets
Some pretty mama start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind

[Verse 2]
I can't walk the streets now con, consolate my mind
Some no-good woman she starts breakin' down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got it gonna bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind

[Verse 3]
Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown
You won't do nothin' but tear a good man reputation down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind

[Verse 4]
Now, I give my baby, now, the ninety-nine degree
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind

[Verse 1]
I can't start walkin' down the streets
But some pretty mama don't start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down, yeah stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
