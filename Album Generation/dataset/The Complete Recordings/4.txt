I got rambling
I got rambling on my mind
I got rambling
I got rambling all on my mind
Hate to leave you my baby
But you treats me so unkind
I got mean things
I got mean things all on my mind
Little girl, Little girl
I got mean things all on my mind
Hate to leave you here babe
But you treats me so unkind
Running down to the station
Catch the first mail train I see
Running down to the station
Catch that old first mail train I see
I got the blues 'bout Miss So and So
And the child got the blues 'bout me
And I'm leaving this morning
With my arm fold up and crying
And I'm leaving this morning
With my arm fold up and crying
I hate to leave my baby
But she treats me so unkind
I got mean things
I got mean things on my mind
I got mean things
I got mean things all on my mind
I got to leave my baby
Cause she treats me so unkind
