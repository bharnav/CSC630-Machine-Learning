[Verse 1]
Living on the street tonight's
A lonely place to be all right, oh lord
The rhythm of the city, i don't find it pretty anymore
Like i did before
You walked out my door

[Chorus]
Give me back the beat [x2]
Give me back the only thing that makes my life complete
If you come back to me
I'll be dancing in the street
I miss the two we had before
That made me tap my feet
That used to rock this boy asleep now that you're gone
Give me back the beat and let's rock on

[Verse 2]
I feel the pounding of your heart
But i'm alone here in the dark, it's true
Alleys filled with misery
Shadows of your memories break thru
I never knew
How much i needed you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I won't sleep baby, i can't eat
I'm in too deep
It's a high fall running into a brick wall
All by yourself
But i know what will help

[Outro]
Give me back the beat [x2]
Give me back the only thing that makes my life complete
