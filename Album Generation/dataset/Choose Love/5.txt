[Verse 1]
Why am i wrong all the time?
That's all that i want to know
I used to do everything right
It doesn't seem that long ago
Why am i wrong all the time?
I'm not the one who has changed
You look with a new point of view
I still look at you the same

[Chorus]
I'm the same man that i was
Now all you see are my mistakes
All i want to give is love
But the way that we are
Makes my heart break

[Verse 2]
Give me a reason to go on
Or i'm gonna walk out that door
And you'll realize when i'm gone
I'm the same man that i was before

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Give me a reason to go on
Letting love die is unkind
If i still know you're the one
Why am i wrong all the time?
How can i be wrong all the time?
