[Verse 1]
Dark clouds in my head disappear
The sky is turning blue, now you're here
We've come a long way, day after day, (we still got a long way to go)

[Chorus]
You've got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter what you choose, choose love

[Verse 2]
The long and winding road, is more than a song
Tomorrow never knows, what goes on
To live your life right, you've got to let in the light, and let all the darkness go

[Chorus]
You've got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter who you choose, choose love
Love, love, love, love, love
Choose love!

[Chorus]
You've got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter how you choose
You've got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter what you choose, choose love

[Outro]
Choose love, choose love, choose love
(Love is the answer)
