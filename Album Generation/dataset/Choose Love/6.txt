[Verse 1]
With my inside outside
Looking for a free ride
Waiting for the band to come
Is it me or the drumming
Or your guitar strumming
Gotta tell me i'm the only one
I wanna sit here, drink beer
I really love you dear but there's a
Rent man knocking at the door
I got new shoes, new dress
Hair-do, i guess
You don't love me anymore

[Chorus]
Don't hang up
Don't hang me up

[Verse 2]
When i'm out there rocking
I'll be rocking round the clock and
I will always come home to you
While you're downtown playing
I'll be uptown straying cause
That's what lonely women do

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Love is strange, love is sad
But love is everything we have
It's gone today, gone tomorrow
Why is that the way it has to be
For you and me? [x2]
I got good news/bad news
The record deal fell through
Wait dear/not here

[Chorus]
