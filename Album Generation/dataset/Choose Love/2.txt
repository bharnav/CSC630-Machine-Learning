[Intro]
Help me lord [x2]
I need your love so bad

[Chorus]
Oh my lord [x2]
I need your love so bad

[Verse 1]
When i'm in darkness and full of fear
I know the answer when you are here
Now i believe, it's all become clear

[Chorus]
Oh my lord
Oh my lord
I need your love so bad

[Verse 2]
When my heart is wandering hopeless and sad
I look for the answers, the ones that you have
I have to let go to be in your hands

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The sky is blue
Because of you
You're everywhere
With peace and love
We'll rise above
And find you there
Of all that's uncertain, after all i've been through
The one thing that's certain, that i know is true
The love that we need all comes from you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Help me lord [x2]
I need your love so bad
