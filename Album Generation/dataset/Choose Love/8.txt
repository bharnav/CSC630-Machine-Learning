[Verse 1]
I won't tell you what to do
No need to tell you what we've been through
I am speaking from my heart tonight
Maybe this time i will get it right

[Chorus]
And darling this is true
It's me and you

[Verse 2]
I remember when times were bad
You were the best friend i ever had
You were always by my side it's true
There was no place i could hide my blues

[Chorus]
Still we made it through
Just me and you

[Verse 3]
Hold me
It's now or never
Hold me
I'm gonna love you beyond forever
I am speaking from my heart tonight
Maybe this time i will get it right

[Chorus]
'Cause darling this is true
It's me and you
It's me and you
