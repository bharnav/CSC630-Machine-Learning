[Verse 1]
When it starts to go wrong
And i feel like it can't go back
It's just a bump in the road
It's just a penny that's on the track

[Chorus]
Some people can't move on
And some can't let it go
But i can...And you can
So we don't have to worry 'bout that

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it seems
Like we'll never be whole again
Like an oak in the wind
We bend a little bit now and then

[Chorus]
Some people won't reach out
Some people won't reach in
But i will...And you will
So we don't have to worry 'bout that

[Verse 3]
Hold on tight
Try with all your might
It might get a little rough sometimes
Like a ship on a stormy night
But it's all gonna be all right
At the end of the day
Love is the only word
And there's nothing to say
It's the best one we've ever heard

[Chorus]
Some people don't forget
The troubles that come their way
But i do... And you do
So we don't have to worry 'bout that
I do... And you do
So we don't have to worry 'bout that
