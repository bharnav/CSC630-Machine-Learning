[Verse 1]
Give me all the time you have
Won't be satisfied
I'm happy when you hold my hand
Still not satisfied
And when you tell me it's time to go
I'll ask for a minute more

[Chorus]
And if you never leave my side
I won't be satisfied

[Verse 2]
If i only had one day with you
Won't be satisfied
Even with a year or two
Still not satisfied
I'm not asking for too much
Not a smile or a touch

[Chorus]
And if you ever leave my side
I won't be satisfied
I'm not satisfied

[Bridge]
I've spent my lifetime looking for someone like you
And when you're laying next to me you made a dream come true [x2]

[Verse 3]
Here in the morning light
Yes i'm satisfied
If i'm ever out of your sight
I am satisfied
I only want to hear your smile
I want forever not just a while

[Outro]
And if you never leave my side
I'll be satisfied
Yes satisfied
Satisfied
I'll be satisfied
