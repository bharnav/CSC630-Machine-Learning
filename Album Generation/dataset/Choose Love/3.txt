[Verse 1]
Here in the night is when the memories fly
Cause when i'm alone i'm alone and i can't lie
Doesn't matter what i do
I'm still in love with you
Why is it so hard, so hard to be true?
If i could take back all the things i've done
When i live in the past i relive every one
Lying to myself, i knew
I'd break my heart in two
Why is it so hard, so hard to be true

[Chorus]
Time after time
Am i a record that's been broken
I know that i'm
Outside a door that i can't open
The words "true love" i've never spoken [x2]

[Verse 2]
It's such a surprise to feel so much regret
But you were a love i know i won't forget
What i did i can't undo
I really wish i knew

[Outro]
Why is it so hard, so hard [x2]
Why is it so hard, so hard to be true
