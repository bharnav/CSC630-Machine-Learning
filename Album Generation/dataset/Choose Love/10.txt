[Verse 1]
How thick can you be?
Lost in the dreamery
Pick your own reality
How many versions do you need?
How low can you go?
Hear the devil say hello
If you light the fuse, don't you know
Like moby dick...there she blows

[Chorus]
Somewhere out there you can find it anywhere
Uptown downtown you've got to find the turnaround

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what to say
I'm gonna say it anyway
Black and blue or shades of gray
Find the middle s'il vous plait
How do you get to sleep?
With the promises you never keep
The hill you're on is mighty steep
But it's all right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You draw your own conclusion
Reality or illusion
Stop the chaos and confusion
Get yourself a life transfusion

[Chorus]
