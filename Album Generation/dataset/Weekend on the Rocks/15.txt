[Verse 1]
"No, no" mama cried, devil they dosido
Two young boys lying dead by the side of the road
The coins on their eyes represent the money they owe
No judge or jury ever gonna hear the story told

[Chorus 1][x2]
Down by the bayou
Trying to play with the cane
Trying to play with the cane
Same story again
Down by the bayou (Louisiana bayou)

[Verse 2]
Sweet girl daddy done beat that girl like he's insane
Brother can't watch him beat that girl down again
So, late one night cooking up with a couple of friends
Swears his daddy's never gonna see another day

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2]
No, no mama cried devil they dosido
See two young boys lying dead by the side of the road

[Chorus 3]
It's a damn shame
It's a shame to lose your way running wild
It's a shame to lose the light that shines on you
It's a shame to lose your way as a child
It's a shame, it's a damn shame

[Verse 3]
Money on the bed, but you ain't got to go
Sold your soul just trying to get overload
No empty pocket gonna keep you from getting yours
No judge or jury ever gonna hear the story told

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 3]
