[Verse 1]
What a sight
Never thought I'd find you here
Last I knew you'd disappeared
We all get lost
I thought I
Had lost you amongst the mess
And the cluttered things in my head
But here you are
When you wake
I'll be a thousand miles away
From the promises I made
And all our love
I'm a dreamer
With nothing left to dream
Trying to tear a hole in the seam
Of reality

[Chorus]
Don't ever forget me
Don't ever forget me
I thought I lost you
Thought I lost you
I thought I lost you

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd lost you amongst the mess
And the demons in my head
But here you are
I would leave
To return more lost than before
A little more tired a little less sure
Of where I was
The earth would move but
We would stand in place
Hide in the shadows of the day
We're almost out of time
Yeah we're almost out of time

[Chorus]
Don't ever forget me
Don't ever forget me
I thought I lost you
Thought I lost you
I thought I lost you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't ever forget me
Don't ever forget me
I thought I lost you
Thought I lost you
I thought I lost you
