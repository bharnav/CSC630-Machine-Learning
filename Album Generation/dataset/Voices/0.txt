Have you, have you been keeping secrets from me?
Hoped I wouldn't find out
And you'd just go free
There's a whole world outside your window pane
And I've got scars to prove it
But you should have known
You should have known
You should have known
You should have known

Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you

Was is it everything you hoped it would be
What kept your world spinning
Left you dizzy
Your apologies will never sooth the sting
Just keep scratching our eyes out
You should have known
You should have known
You should have known

Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you
Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you
We'll find you
