[Verse 1]
Shallow it seems but I need you here
From me to you, I know I can’t feel a thing
Oh, sing me to sleep
I won't fight it when you leave

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here, oh...

[Verse 2]
Desperate it seems but I can’t breathe
Are you real?
Are you real?
I can’t feel a thing
And this machine won’t stop
Be here when I wake
Sing me to sleep
I won't fight it when you leave
Sing me to sleep
I won't fight it…

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here, oh...
