You found revenge in the bed
And it only cost a name
You make me sick, sick to my stomach
Sick, sick, to my stomach
You keep me in suspense
But you're just shooting blanks
All I hear is bang bang
All we fear is the bang bang

And no, you'll never have to see
You'll never have to see me
Never have to deal with me again
If that's what you want
And that's what you get
No, you'll never have to see
Never have to see me
Never have to deal with me again
You'll never have to deal with me again

Keep me in suspense
And tell me what it meant
The anxious air between you and me
Look me in the eyes
And tell me what it meant
Just before we both go

I never looked back
Cross my heart and hope to die
I did it for love, love
A pretty thing called love, love
I wanna overdose on a kiss
Leaving me lifeless
Will you be my drug, drug?
Yeah, be my drug, drug

And no, you'll never have to see
You'll never have to see me
Never have to deal with me again
If that's what you want
And that's what you get
No, you'll never have to see
You'll never have to see me
Never have to deal with me again
You'll never have to deal with me again

Keep me in suspense
And tell me what it meant
The anxious air between you and me
Look me in the eyes
And tell me what it meant
Just before we both went numb

Keep me in suspense
And tell me what it meant
The anxious air between you and me
Look me in the eyes
And tell me what it meant
Just before we both go numb

Keep me in suspense
Keep me in suspense
Just before we both go numb
