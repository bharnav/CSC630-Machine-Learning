They're all asleep, they'll never know
We'll escape through your window
And they're onto us
But this time is ours
There are reasons for what I did
It wasn't some vile attempt or accomplishment
It was innocent you know

La, ladada, lada, ladada, lada, ladada, lala

Nurse, something for the pain
Something to make this guilt go away
You're forgetting us
You're forgetting everything
And I wanna hate you for my mistakes
I hate you for everything
This is goodbye, this is always

We're covering up our tracks
And living in secrets
We can learn to love life
Or learn to love pain
And if you still hear my voice
Than give me a sign, let me know
You're still here, like it or not

But wait, what do we have here?
Who's that dress for?
Let's keep toasting to innocence
And drown our regret
Let's have no recollection of any of this
Don't wait up for me
I'll be taking swings at a ghost while you're laying down
Playing dead right in front of me

We're covering up our tracks
And living in secrets
We can learn to love life
Or learn to love pain
And if you still hear my voice
Than give me a sign, let me know
You're still here like it or not
Like it or not

My heartbeat was louder than
The sound of my steps to your door

You're cold but you're beautiful
You're a mess but I like it that way
I'm a fool, but only a fool knows a miracle
And I won't ask for anything
No, I won't ask for anything, ever again
Just give me this one thing, that's all I ask
That's all I ask

Don't wait up for me
Well I'll be taking swings at a ghost while you're laying down
Laying dead right in front of me

We're covering up our tracks
And living in secrets
We can learn to love life
Or learn to love pain
And if you still hear my voice
Than give me a sign, let me know
You're still here like it or not
Like it or not
