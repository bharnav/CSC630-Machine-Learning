We're all eyes
And in my personal opinion
If we're not all you were hoping for
When you say my name
Say it like a curse

I saw your face in the magazine saying I can't hear it
All the girls all glittered and glossed
Screaming we can feel you, can you feel me?
We're tied up in knots
In our courts of conscience
Life is lies
Lies are life
But don't lie to me

You're just chasing shadows
Show us some heart and confess your sins
We'll sing with eyes closed
And you can tear us apart but you won't break the skin

Just put on your face and...

I would love nothing more in the world
Than to watch you as you spill your guts
Unrehearsed you're just a silhouette
You never had a voice so why all the fuss?
You can have the kingdom, you can have the crown
But you won't have the people
No, we'll see you down

You're just chasing shadows
Show us some heart and confess your sins
We'll sing with eyes closed
And you can tear us apart but you won't break the skin

Put on your face
Put on your face
And scream

You're just chasing shadows
Show us some heart and confess your sins
We'll sing with eyes closed
And you can tear us apart but you won't break the skin

Just put on your face
Just put on your face
And scream
And scream
And scream for me
