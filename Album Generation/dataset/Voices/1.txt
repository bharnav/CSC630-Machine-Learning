These are my sins
These are my regrets
I want to trade them in for some truth
And just let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Don't waste your breath
Save your tears for somebody who believes
I can't help myself, let alone you
I give up
I give up

These are my dreams, these are my beliefs
I want to trade them in for something real
And just let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Don't waste your breath
Save your tears for somebody who believes
I can't help myself, let alone you
I'm tired of making love to a memory
I give up
I give up
I give

Don't waste your breath
Save your tears for somebody who believes
I can't help myself, let alone you
I'm tired of making love to a memory
I give up
I give up
I give up on you
