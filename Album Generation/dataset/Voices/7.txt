You're so unpredictable and I'm so typical
I tried to sell you a heart before you saw the world
I will sing a melody until the fluid starts choking me
And when my eyes are paralyzed I'll stare up at you my star
That I could never reach

I'll wait for you if you want me to
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be any more or any less
Your secrets safe I'll take it to my...

You're so unpredictable and I'm so typical
I keep tearing away at the skin
To see what's underneath
I will sing a melody until the fluid starts choking me
And when my eyes are paralyzed I'll stare up at you my star
That I could never reach

I'll wait for you if you want me to
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be anymore or any less
Your secrets safe I'll take it to my...grave

Ohhhhh

I'll wait for you if you want me to
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be any more or any less
Your secrets safe I'll take it to my...grave
