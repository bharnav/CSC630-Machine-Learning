Love
Bring me the head of jealousy
His curse is the poison on her lips
A love as certain as a sinking ship
Unstoppable

This isn't a dream
This is what you are
And I'll take the blame
But that won't heal your scars

Look
Look a little closer, and then
Shut off
You should have known this wasn't a truce
Keep taking your cheapshots
Until I'm black and blue

You should have known better
Than to change your mind
Tears won't tame your misery
They're the ones that say
Your heart is just a beat
You're just keeping time

This isn't a game
Who do you think you are
I'll take the blame
But that won't heal your scars

Look
Look a little closer, and then
Shut off
You should have known this wasn't a truce
Keep taking your cheapshots
Until I'm black and blue

Look
Look a little closer, and then
Shut off
You should have known this wasn't a truce
Keep taking your cheapshots

Look
Look a little closer, and then
Shut off
You should have known this wasn't a truce
Keep taking your cheapshots
Until I'm black and blue
