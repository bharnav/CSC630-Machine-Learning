I was sent out to the world
From the mission I just returned
The dust has not settled down yet
Still I'm needed more famee to be earned

I thought I could have some rest
But I feel like I'm possessed
I shouldn't be complaining cause I am blessed

Must have been the Gypsy
The Gypsyn in me

All the pressure on my shoulder
I can feel it makes me older
I've given everything tonight
Is it enough, I still have to fight

My heart is beating so fast
If this breathe would be my last
Would I die happy or would I regret my past

Must have been the Gypsy
The Gypsy in me

Must have been a mistake
But I agreed
