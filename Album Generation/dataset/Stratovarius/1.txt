Climbing mountain, big stone on my back
Hopeless feeling, everything is black

What am I fighting for?
What am I living for?
That is the part that I don't know

You gotta fight, fight for your life
Until you die, fight for your life

Endless searching in the cyberspace
All is turning into a disgrace

What am I searching for?
What am I running for?
That is the part that I don't know
