Time goes by, but you can't rest
Too many things, and you're obsessed
Trying to find some sense to it all

No one knows what you've been through
Like no one cares, but its not true
Turn the page and make a fresh start

When you are low you should know
You are not the only lonely soul
And you will find the strength inside
There is no more need to hide

Just carry on, fulfill your dreams
Don't let them try to pull you down
So carry on and reach your goal
Stand proud, don't give up
March on 'til the end
The road is long but you'll reach the final bend
