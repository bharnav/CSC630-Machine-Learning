This year has been a nightmare
I feel so low, I don't care
I've dwelt in depths of darkess
Swam across the ocean of pain

I've fed the tabloids, the media
I's a bottomless pit, a redia
Front pages, gossips, knifungs, drunken nights and days

Sadness, rage, hopelessness
I am nothing without you

Again the dance
I do the maniac dance
Just like in trance
I do the maniac dance

This demon serves me well
It wants to send me to the depths of hell
A roller coaster ride is has been I can tell
I'm a walking miracle of medicine
A real catastrophe on legs
A proud member of human race known as the dregs

Xanax, Remeron, Therapy, Buspiron
Anger, fear and shame
