Listen to what I have to say
We could get out of here today
I'll take you with me if you want to go
New kind of place, just let me know
I am the man, not a child
And I am free, 'cause I can feel
We just have to get away
We have nowhere left to stay
We can run and we can hide
We just have to leave the tribe
Doing things in our own way
We'll just let the others stay
Those who fought and those who lied
We just have to leave the tribe, leave the tribe
Everything is always the same
They try to make you play their game
â€½This is the wayâ€, you're being told
But hear me out, you can't be sold
And still they roll like pigs in the mud
While you have the fire burning inside
We just have to get away
We have nowhere left to stay
We can run and we can hide
We just have to leave the tribe
Doing things in our own way
We'll just let the others stay
Those who fought and those who lied
We just have to leave the tribe, leave the tribe
We just have to get away
We have nowhere left to stay
We can run and we can hide
We just have to leave the tribe
Doing things in our own way
We'll just let the others stay
Those who fought and those who lied
We just have to leave the tribe, leave the tribe
Yeah, you have to leave the tribe
You have to leave the tribe
You got nowhere else to stay
Leave the tribe, whoa just leave the tribe
I have to leave the tribe
