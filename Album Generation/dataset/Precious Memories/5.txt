[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And He walks with me

[Chorus]
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse 2]
I'd stay in the garden with Him
'Tho the night around me is falling
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
