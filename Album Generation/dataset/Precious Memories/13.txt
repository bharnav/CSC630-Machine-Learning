[Verse 1]
Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
Thy hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed

[Chorus]
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

[Verse 2]
When Christ shall come
With shouts of adulation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim My God
How great Thou art

[Chorus]

[Outro]
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
