[Intro]
Now let me holla at you for a minute
‘Cause I just got somethin’ that I need to say
You ever heard about that thing?
I mean that real thing?
I mean sometimes when you just can’t even sleep, you can’t think
You just lose yourself, wrapped all up in it
Hmm, shit, baby, you got me mesmerized
Let me sing it for you

[Verse 1]
You don’t know
What you do to me
Let me tell ya
How ya make me feel
I need your lovin’
It’s so good to me
I can’t even sleep (Oh!)
Boy, you got me weak (yeah!)
My heart is on fire since you put that thang on me, oh
You put that thang on me, that thang, baby

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(I said 1…2…3…4 hit it, uh!)
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized

[Verse 2]
You got me mesmerized
I don’t know what to do
Baby got me hypnotized
I think I’m in love with you
You got me so caught up
Baby, I’m spellbound
I’m floatin’ on cloud nine
And I don’t think I’m comin’ down
Don’t you know
What you do to me?
Baby, baby, it’s like ecstasy
I can’t even sleep
Boy, you got me weak
My heart is on fire since you put that thang on me, oh!

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(I said 1…2…3…4 hit it, uh!)
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby mesmerized
(Baby, I’m hypnotized, yeah)

[Bridge]
I just can’t understand, I can’t understand
You got me lookin’ so crazy, baby
You got me lookin’ so crazy right now
Make me wanna clap my hands (My hands)
Make me wanna stomp my feet (My feet)
Make me feel real, real good (Real good)
When you put that thang on me
Let me tell you now

I can’t even sleep
Boy you got me weak
Your love is so sweet
Said you knock me off my feet
I can’t even sleep
Boy you got me weak
Your love is so sweet
Said you knock me off my feet

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(I said 1…2…3…4 hit it, uh!)
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(You’ve got me mesmerized
Don’t know just what to do, I’m hypnotized)

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(I said 1…2…3…4 hit it, uh!)
(Oh, you've got me; oh, you've got me, yeah yeah yeah)
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(C’mon! Ain’t it funky now!)

[Outro]
You got me mesmerized
I don’t know what to do
Baby got me hypnotized
I think I’m in love with you
You got me so caught up
Baby, I’m spellbound
I’m floatin’ on cloud nine
And I don’t think I’m comin’ down
Don’t you…
