[Verse 1]
I can remember the day and time that we broke up
It was December and the holidays were coming up
I didn’t expect to lose all of the time I shared with you
But now that it’s gone I find myself longing for you

[Pre-Chorus]
No doubt about it, I’m sorry for the way things worked out
If I could change it, I would change it but I don’t know how
No, I can’t, ain’t no need to cry when I know the reason why
You chose to leave me but I still wish you were here with me

[Chorus]
Yes, it's true, I can’t get over you
No matter what I do
Even if I try I, I can’t get over you

[Verse 2]
I can remember calling your phone and hanging up
'Cause I was to afraid to talk, if by chance you picked it up
But now that I done thought about it
I’d feel better if we talk about it
To let you know what’s on my mind
See, I wanna try to make things right

[Pre-Chorus]
No doubt about it, I’m sorry for the way things worked out
If I could change it, I would change it but I don’t know how
No, I can’t, ain’t no need to cry 'cause I know the reason why
You chose to leave me but I still wish you were here with me

[Chorus]
Yes, it's true, I can’t get over you
No matter what I do
Even if I try I, I can’t get over you

[Bridge]
Lately, I’ve been doing some reminiscing
I’d be lying if I said that I don’t miss you
What's done is done and I'm willing to leave it in the past
'Cause now I realize that it wasn’t so bad

[Chorus]
Yes, it's true, I can’t get over you
No matter what I do
Even if I try I, I can’t get over you
Yes, it's true, I can’t get over you
No matter what I do
Even if I try I, I can’t get over you

[Outro]
I can’t get over you
I can’t get over you
No, I can’t get over
Done away, can’t get over
Oh oh, I can’t get over
Oh no, oh hey, alright, yeah, yeah yeah
