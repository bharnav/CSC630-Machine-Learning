[Verse 1]
Now let me be real with you
About my feelings
The way that I deal with you
I just can't conceal it
Now I don't really mind all your female friends and all but
Just know that I'm possessive and aggressive
When it comes to you

[Chorus]
I'm so jealous, 'til I can't help it
I'm not the type that cares to share because I'm selfish
And I'm so jealous, I can't control it
And ain't no need to lie about it 'cause I know it, ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
Now don't you get it confused, 'cause im not trippin'
And I know there's no substitute for what I'm givin'
But all the super friendly extra lovey dovey hugs and greetings
Make me feel like you might be out there cheating

[Chorus]
I'm so jealous, 'til I can't help it
I'm not the type that cares to share because I'm selfish
And I'm so jealous, I can't control it
And ain't no need to lie about it 'cause I know it, ooh ooh

[Bridge]
Every now and then I might check your Caller ID
Just to see who's calling other than me
And, every other girl I know does the same thing too
But they don't ever say that they do, Oh

[Chorus]
I'm so jealous, 'til I can't help it
I'm not the type that cares to share because I'm selfish
And I'm so jealous, I can't control it
And ain't no need to lie about it 'cause I know it, ooh ooh
I'm so jealous, 'til I can't help it
(I got to be real with you, I might check your pager too)
I'm not the type that cares to share because I'm selfish
And I'm so jealous, I can't control it
And ain't no need to lie about it 'cause I know it, ooh ooh

[Outro]
'Cause I know, oh oh yeah, yeah...
Oh, and ain't no need to lie about it, no
Said I'm so...
