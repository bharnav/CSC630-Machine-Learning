Take your time, oh...

[Verse 1]
If you just, relax, and take your time
You'll see in me you'll find peace of mind
Something about the way that you touch me makes me glow
In me you can confide
But the love it takes some time

[Chorus]
Feels like you could be the one that's catchin' feelings
I know you can't help it but just slow down
Boy, you know you alright with me (you know that you're alright)
Feels like you could be the one that's catchin' feelings
I know you can't help it but just slow down
Boy, you know you alright with me (you know that you're alright)

[Verse 2]
If you weren't so young
Maybe we could be serious, oh
Infatuations killing me so mysterious
When there's no other, you'll be my lover if you play it cool
(baby, just take it slow)
I can't fall in love with you (in love with you)
So maybe we can rendezvous (rendezvous)

[Chorus]
Feels like you could be the one that's catchin' feelings
I know you can't help it but just slow down
Boy, you know you alright with me
Feels like you could be the one that's catchin' feelings
I know you can't help it but just slow down
Boy, you know you're alright with me

[Bridge]
I knew you were so young
You were just a young thing and I
I just let you get a taste of my love
I let my guard down
It was only supposed to be one time
Oh but now we find ourselves
Doing it over and over and over
'Cause what we have is only physical (only physical)
I gotta give you time to let you grow

[Chorus]
It feels good but you gotta slow down
Catching feelings
'Cause I don't wanna turn you out catching feelings
(baby, just take it slow)
Take it slow, take it slow
Take it slow, take it slow
Take it slow, take it slow
All you gotta do (baby, just take it slow)
Take it slow, take it slow
Take it slow, take it slow
Take it slow, take it slow
Just take it slow...
