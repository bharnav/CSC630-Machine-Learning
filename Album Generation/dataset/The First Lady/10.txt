[Verse 1]
Love was just a four-letter word
Misused to entrust the heart of followers
But it never meant a damn thing to me
Until you came so unexpectedly
Then you curved my whole attitude
Got me feelin' ways that I never thought I could
See, really what I'm tryin' to say is I like what I'm feelin'
And I hope you never take it away

[Chorus]
I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came
Baby, I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you walked through my defenses
And made me smooth out my rough ends and
You got me open and I'm hopin' that this ain't no act
'Cause I don't want no parts of that
Matter fact, I really hope that you're true
'Cause I wanna invest my time in you
And all my childish dreams with all my conversations
'Cause I know that somethin' special's in the makin' I

[Chorus]
I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came
Baby, I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I

[Bridge]
Ooh la la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Faith talking over bridge]
Yo! Seriously though, I'm buggin'. I'm, I'm really confused
'Cause I trust you with some things you say
But with other things, I just don't trust you
But my heart says 'roll with it,' you know what I mean?
It's like I've just been going through all these emotions
And I'm dealin' with stuff I've never dealt with before
It's like you just, hmm, you got me straight trippin', boo
I don't even know what's wrong with me
But I hope you understand how I feel
'Cause I really care about you
So check this out, baby

[Chorus]
I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came
Baby, I never gave my heart to love
(You got me going crazy)
I never gave my time to love
(I wanna be your lady)
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I

I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came
Baby, I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I
