[Verse 1]
I knew from the start you were running game
You'd fade away like Jordan
Then you cross me over when you come back again
I'm not superwoman so i can't see what's going on in your mind
(Hmm, so I figure, 'You wanna play?', I'm willing, I got some time)
It's been so long that I strung you along
So many dates, so many hours on the phone
And I know you're getting tired of playing the game of cat and mouse
I wonder if I let you catch me, would you run your mouth?
So I'm not sure if I wanna

[Chorus]
Stop, go
Just move slow with it or
Let, go
And enjoy the moment
Stop, go
So confusing that I
Don't, know
I feel I wanna explode

[Verse 2]
We're in the fourth quarter and I feel I wanna
But I know we oughta not
'cause if I pass it to you
There's a chance that you might mess around and drop the rock
So you better make sure in the clutch you're the best I've ever seen
'cause I would hate to have to trade you to another team, another team
It's been so hard playing my emotions off
Knowing that I wanna give in but too afraid to go too far
And I know you're getting tired of playing the game of hard to get
But I wonder if I let you in, would you tell your friends?
So I'm not sure if I wanna

[Chorus]
Stop, go
Just move slow with it or
Let, go
And enjoy the moment
Stop, go
So confusing that I
Don't, know
I feel I wanna explode

[Bridge]
My heart says yes
My mind says no
'cause I don't know if I wanna break down and let go
My heart says yes
My mind says no
'cause I know if I break down, I'll be wanting more
More this, more that
More time, to chat
And I'll be wanting a commitment from you and much more of your attention
That's why I'm so confused
When it comes to loving you, oh...

[Chorus]
Stop, go
Just move slow with it or
Let, go
And enjoy the moment
Stop, go
So confusing that I
Don't, know
I feel I wanna explode
Stop, go
Just move slow with it or
Let, go
And enjoy the moment
Stop, go
So confusing that I
Don't, know
I feel I wanna explode
