[Verse 1]
[Mario Winans]
Lately, the vibe has been a little different, lately
But I want to understand you so much more
Open the door and then just tell me
Open up and say it, baby

[Faith Evans]
Lately, I've been trying to keep my distance, crazy
It's not what I expected at first
But now I understand you gotta be a man
And now it's so clear to me, so you can keep it real with me

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Mario Winans]
You ever wonder what makes a woman cry?
You ever wonder why, sometimes you make me cry
You ever wonder what makes a woman smile?
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile

[Verse 2]
[Mario Winans]
Maybe, we jumped into a situation too early
But it's something that our bodies can't ignore
And now you want more
But I think I'm ready
So open up and say it, baby

[Faith Evans]
Babyy, not to mention that you got me feeling crazy
Every time you walk through my door
My emotions won't let me say no
And now I'm wondering if after this you'll want me more

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Mario Winans]
You ever wonder what makes a woman cry?
You ever wonder why, sometimes you make me cry
You ever wonder what makes a woman smile?
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile

[Bridge]
[Faith Evans]
You see I'm feeling you, you know I'm wanting to
Put all my trust in you, 'cause ain't no guarantees

[Mario Winans]
And I'm so glad you do
I feel the same way too
All we gotta do is keep communicating, baby

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Mario Winans]
You ever wonder what makes a woman cry?
(Do you ever think about it, baby?)
You ever wonder why, sometimes you make me cry
You ever wonder what makes a woman smile
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile
You ever wonder what makes a woman cry?
You ever wonder why, sometimes you make me cry
You ever wonder what makes a woman smile
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile
You ever wonder what makes a woman cry
You ever wonder why, sometimes you make me cry
You ever wonder what makes a woman smile
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile
