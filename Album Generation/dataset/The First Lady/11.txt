[Chorus]
Today is our lucky day
We can get away
Just tell the DJ to play (and play and play)
I just wanna hear you play my favorite song
I just wanna hear you play my favorite

[Verse 1]
DJ's got me feeling kinda sexy
Got my body moving on the floor, yeah
Every time I hear that funky music
I just let the rhythm take control
C'mon, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the jam you're playing for me
(don't stop, don't stop the jam)
Don't stop the jam, just play it for me
(it's that jam, yeah; it's that jam, yeah)

[Chorus]
Today is our lucky day
We can get away
Just tell the DJ to play (and play and play)
I just wanna hear you play my favorite song
I just wanna hear you play my favorite

[Verse 2]
When you put the needle on the record
Ain't nobody standing on the wall
(standing on the wall)
Everybody's stepping at this party
Doing what we're doing
Everybody just get down and have a ball

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the jam you're playing for me
(don't stop the jam)
Don't stop the jam, just play it for me
(Mister DJ, Mister DJ)

[Chorus]
Today is our lucky day
We can get away
Just tell the DJ to play (and play and play)
I just wanna hear you play my favorite song
I just wanna hear you play my favorite

[Bridge]
Let the music play 'til the break of day, yeah
Way to feel the groove, you got to make your body move
As we dance all night 'til the morning light
(shoop-shoop-ba-doo-wah) Shoop-shoop-doop-doo-wah
(doo wah) Shoop-shoop-doop-doo-wah
(shoop-shoop-ba-doo-wah) Shoop-shoop-doop-doop-doo-wah
(doo wah) Doo-wah-doo-wah-doo-wah-doo-wah
It's that jam, it's that jam (yeah yeah)
It's that jam, it's that jam, it's that jam

[Chorus]
Today is our lucky day
We can get away
Just tell the DJ to play (and play and play)
I just wanna hear you play my favorite song
I just wanna hear you play my favorite
Come on, come on, come on

[Outro]
Come on get up and dance
(Get up and clap your hands)
Come on get up and dance
(I just wanna see you dance, yeah)
Come on get up and dance
(Just let your body feel the groove)
Come on get up and dance
(I wanna see you move, yeah)
Come on get up and dance
(Everybody just wanna dance)
Come on get up and dance
(So DJ, play my song)
Come on get up and dance
(Just play it all night long)
Come on get up and dance
(Swee-da-ba-bee-da-da-bee-bip-bip-bip, yeah)
