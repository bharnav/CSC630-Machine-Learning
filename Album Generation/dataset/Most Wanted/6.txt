[Intro]
I wonder...
I wonder what I'll become...

[Verse 1]
I've been so wrapped up
In my warm cocoon
But something's happening
Things are changing soon
I'm pushing the edge
I'm feeling it crack
And once I get out
There's no turning back

[Pre-Chorus]
Watching the butterfly
Go towards the sun
I wonder what I will become

[Chorus]
Metamorphosis
Whatever this is
Whatever I'm going through
C'mon and give me a kiss
C'mon, I insist
I'll be something new, a metamorphosis

[Verse 2]
Things are different now
When I walk by
You start to sweat
And you don't know why
It gets me nervous
But it makes me calm
To see life all around me moving on

[Pre-Chorus]
Watching the butterfly
Go towards the sun
I wonder what I will become

[Chorus]
Metamorphosis
Whatever this is
Whatever I'm going through
C'mon and give me a kiss
C'mon, I insist
I'll be something new, a metamorphosis

[Chorus]
Metamorphosis
(Whatever this is) whatever this is
(Whatever I'm going through) whatever I'm going through
(C'mon and give me a kiss) c'mon
(C'mon, I insist) c'mon, I insist
I'll be something new, a metamorphosis

[Bridge]
Every day is a transformation
Every day is a new sensation
Alteration, modification
An incarnation, celebration
Every day is a new equation
Every day is a revelation
Information, anticipation
On to another destination

[Chorus]
Metamorphosis
(Whatever this is) whatever this is
(Whatever I'm going through) whatever I'm going through
(C'mon and give me a kiss) c'mon
(C'mon, I insist) c'mon, I insist
I'll be something new, a metamorphosis

[Outro]
Whatever this is
Whatever I'm going through
C'mon
C'mon, I insist
I'll be something new, a metamorphosis
(I'll be something new)
(I'll be something new, a metamorphosis)
(I'll be something new)
(I'll be something new, a metamorphosis)
