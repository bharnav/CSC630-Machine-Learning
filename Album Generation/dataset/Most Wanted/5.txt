[Verse 1]
You can change your life if you wanna
You can change your clothes if you wanna
If you change your mind
Well, that's the way it goes
But I'm gonna keep your jeans
And your old black hat, 'cause I wanna
They look good on me
You're never gonna get them back

[Pre-Chorus]
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

[Chorus]
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?

[Interlude]
Ha, okay

[Verse 2]
You can say you're bored if you wanna
You could act real tough if you wanna
You could say you're torn
But I've heard enough
Thank you, you made my mind up for me
When you started to ignore me
Do you see a single tear?
It isn't gonna happen here

[Pre-Chorus]
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

[Chorus]
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?

[Bridge]
If you're over me, I'm already over you
If it's all been done, what is left to do?
How can you hang up if the line is dead?
If you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead
If you're moving on, I'm already gone
If the light is off, then it isn't on

[Pre-Chorus]
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

[Chorus]
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard?
You're so yesterday

[Outro]
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?
