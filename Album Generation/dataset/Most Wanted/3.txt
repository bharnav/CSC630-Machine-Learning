[Verse 1]
Let's go back, back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned
'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle was no life
I defy

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean

[Verse 2]
I'm shedding, shedding every color
Trying to find a pigment of truth beneath my skin
'Cause different doesn't feel so different
And going out is better than always staying in
Feel the wind

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean

[Bridge]
I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall, let the rain fall
I'm coming

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall, let the rain fall, let the rain fall
I'm coming clean

[Outro]
Let's go back, back to the beginning
