[Verse 1]
Someone always gets their hearts stomped to the ground
This is what I see every time I look around
I never thought that this would happen to me
I never thought I'd end up this way
And now that you're through with me
Don't know what to do with me
I guess I'm my own again
Like I'm some kind of enemy
Never a friend to me
Remember when you used to say "things will always be this way"

[Chorus]
Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

[Verse 2]
Now I'm trying to get my heart up off the ground
My confidence is gone
Happiness can not be found
So look what you did to me
You got the best of me
And now I'm stuck with all the rest
It will never be the same

[Chorus]
Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me
(Why don't you) break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted has left me standing here alone
It started with you and ended with me
All I ever needed, I had it with you in my arms
It started with you and ended with me

[Breakdown]
Break my heart
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me
Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

[Outro]
Why don't you break my heart?
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
