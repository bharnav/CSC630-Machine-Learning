[Verse 1]
Here I am again, talking to myself
Sitting at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel?
So much running through my mind
First you wanna be free
Now you say you need me
Giving mixed signals and signs

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard to let you in
Thinking you might slam the brakes again

[Chorus]
Put the pedal down
Heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away

[Verse 2]
I can't keep coming back to you
Every time you're in the mood
To whisper something sweet in my ear
It's so hard to move on
'Cause every time I think you're gone
You show up in my rear-view mirror
Is this just a detour?
'Cause I gotta be sure
That you really mean what you say

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard to let you in
Thinking you might slam the brakes again

[Chorus]
Put the pedal down
Heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away

[Bridge]
To a place where I can be redefined
Where you're out of sight and you're out of mind
But the truth is, I can't even say goodbye

[Breakdown]
Here I am again, talking to myself
Sitting at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel?
So much running through my mind

[Chorus]
Put the pedal down
Heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away
