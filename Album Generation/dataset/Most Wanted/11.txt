[Verse 1: Haylie Duff + Hilary Duff]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies, well that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have no shield, no secrets to reveal

[Chorus 1: Both]
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed

[Verse 2: Haylie Duff + Hilary Duff]
It's a weapon which we must use in our defense
Silence
Spreading rumors, so far from true
Dragged up from the underworld
Just like some precious pearl

[Chorus 2: Both]
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed

[Verse 2: Hilary Duff + Haylie Duff]
Hush my darling, don't you cry
Quiet angel, forget their lies

[Breakdown: Haylie Duff + Hilary Duff]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies, well that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have no shield, no secrets to reveal

[Chorus 2: Both]
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
