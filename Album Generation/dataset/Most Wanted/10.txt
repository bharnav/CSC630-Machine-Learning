[Verse 1]
Ready for the big time, ready for the small
Whatever's coming to me, I'll be ready for it all
Sometimes it ain't easy, sometimes it's not polite
Somedays I don't get it, somedays I get it right

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said

[Chorus]
Hey boys, are you ready for the shock?
I'm living proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block
Hey boys, the girl can rock

[Verse 2]
Standing in the spotlight, working up a sweat
Giving all I got, and loving what I get
I can't hold back what I feel inside
And if I make you nervous, you'd better step aside

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said

[Chorus]
Hey boys, are you ready for the shock?
I'm living proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block
Hey boys, the girl can rock
The girl can rock

[Bridge]
Don't say maybe, or call me, "Baby"
I ain't crazy at all

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said

[Breakdown]
Hey boys, are you ready for the shock?
I'm living proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block
Hey boys, the girl can rock

[Chorus]
Hey boys, are you ready for the shock?
I'm living proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block
Hey boys, the girl can rock

[Outro]
I'm gonna live it up
I'm never giving up
I'm gonna spread the news
Around the block
It ain't no shock
The girl can rock
The girl can rock
The girl can rock
Yeah, rock
