[Verse 1]
There's people talking
They talk about me
They know my name, they think they know everything
But they don't know anything about me

[Verse 2]
Give me a dance floor
Give me a DJ
Play me a record
Forget what they say
'Cause I need to go
Need to getaway tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night
I try to make it happen, try to make it all right
I know I make mistakes, I'm living life day-to-day
It's never really easy, but it's okay

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night
Could be New York, maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go tonight
Tonight, yeah, tonight

[Verse 3]
The city's restless
It's all around me
People in motion, sick of all the same routines
And they need to go, they need to get away tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night
I try to make it happen, try to make it all right
I know I make mistakes, I'm living life day-to-day
It's never really easy, but it's okay

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night
Could be New York, maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go tonight
Tonight, yeah, tonight

[Bridge]
People all around you everywhere that you go
People all around you
They don't really know you
Everybody watching, like it's some kind of show
Everybody's watching
They don't really know you now
(They don't really know you, they don't really know you)
And forever

[Breakdown]
Wake up, wake up (wake up, wake up)
Wake up, wake up (wake up, wake up)

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, on a Saturday night
Could be New York, maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night
Could be New York, maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go tonight
Tonight, yeah, tonight

[Outro]
Wake up, wake up
