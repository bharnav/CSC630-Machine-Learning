[Verse 1]
In a moment, everything can change
Feel the wind on your shoulder
For a minute, all the world can wait
Let go of your yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you hear it calling?
Can you feel it in your soul?
Can you trust this longing, and take control?

[Chorus]
Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away
You can shine
Forget about the reasons why you can't in life, and start to try
'Cause it's your time, time to fly

[Verse 2]
All your worries, leave them somewhere else
Find a dream you can follow
Reach for something when there's nothing left
And the world's feeling hollow

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you hear it calling?
Can you feel it in your soul?
Can you trust this longing, and take control?

[Chorus]
Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away
You can shine
Forget about the reasons why you can't in life, and start to try
'Cause it's your time, time to fly

[Bridge]
And when you're down and feel alone
Just want to run away
Trust yourself and don't give up
You know you better than anyone else

[Breakdown]
In a moment, everything can change
Feel the wind on your shoulder
For a minute, all the world can wait
Let go of your yesterday

[Chorus]
Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away
You can shine
Forget about the reasons why you can't in life, and start to try
Fly
Forget about the reasons why you can't in life, and start to try
'Cause it's your time, time to fly

[Outro]
In a moment, everything can change
