[Verse 1]
Everybody wants something that seems to hard to get
So I sit here on a street in Venice
Waiting for the sun to set
Watching people live their lives wondering what it means
Sometimes getting what you want is easier than it seems
I don't want to save the day, I just want to get my way

[Chorus]
And rock this world
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world
It don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter
Don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Just like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world

[Verse 2]
Everybody's going somewhere
So why not you and I?
We're all part of the same parade
Just people passin' by
And anything can happen when the sun goes down like this
Maybe its just a miracle when you find some happiness
I don't want to save the day
I just want to get my way

[Chorus]
And rock this world
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world
It don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter
Don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Just like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world

[Bridge]
People, can you hear me?
I want you to come near me
Can you feel the pull?
It can be so beautiful

[Chorus]
And rock this world
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world
It don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter
Don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Just like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world
