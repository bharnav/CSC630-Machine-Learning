[Verse 1]
I found the fragrance separate from the flower
In all the logic I was lost
I found the fair light blossom to be sour
And beneath the soil, the real cost

[Chorus]
You came to me carelessly
I am iris and the lens
The bridge adjusting to the water, water, water, water
The level inside will rise
A fallen monument lies

[Verse 2]
A prism is only walls
My arms will not be bars
The well now is your support
In autosuggested pathways you are caught

[Chorus]
You came to me carelessly
I am iris and the lens
The bridge adjusting to the water, water, water, water
The level inside will rise
A fallen monument lies
