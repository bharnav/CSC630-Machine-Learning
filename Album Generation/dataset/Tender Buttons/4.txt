[Verse 1]
Succumb to the line
The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the corner
But I won't give up although
I've stopped too
Before the end of me and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged

[Verse 2]
Interpret the rules
My tears in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you the truth
And now I sigh too
The page turns on me and you
Across that white plane
The land is unchanged
