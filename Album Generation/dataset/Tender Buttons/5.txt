[Verse 1]
Under the white chalk
Drawn on the blackboard
Under the x-ray
I'm just a vertebrate

[Chorus 1]
Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Corporeal, corporeal

[Verse 2]
We are mankind
We are manikin
With and without mind
With or without Darwin

[Chorus 2]
Classify me
The strings of my autonomy
Classify me
The strings of my autonomy
Corporeal, corporeal

[Verse 3]
A thorny red heart
Around a thin arm
Inside a white bone
The love is inborn

[Chorus 3]
Close up to me
Up close to my anatomy
Close up to me
Up close to my autonomy
Corporeal, corporeal
Corporeal, corporeal
Corporeal
