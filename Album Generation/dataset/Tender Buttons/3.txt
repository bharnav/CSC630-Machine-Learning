[Verse 1]
Quaker toil and Texan oil
Rockets on, we're arm in arm
NASA nude, you're manly, you

[Chorus]
Oi, American soldier
America's boy
American soldier
America's boy

[Verse 2]
Gun me down with Yankee power
Cockpit Tom with army charm
The eagle lands, army commands

[Chorus]
Oi, American soldier
America's boy
American soldier
America's boy

[Verse 3]
Cowboy corn and bugle horn
Union son, don't post me on
You are dean and me the queen

[Chorus x2]
Oi, American soldier
America's boy
American soldier
America's boy
