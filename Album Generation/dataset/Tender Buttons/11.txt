[Verse 1]
Endless night
Laced with time
Under unreal light
With the goodbye girls

[Verse 2]
Pendant heart
Counterpart
Under unreal light
With the goodbye girls

[Extended Pre-Chorus]
Fraudulently
They love you
I think of you
You're in a sleepless dream
The insincere

[Chorus]
Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night
Love you all night

[Verse 2]
Honesty
Sweet deceit
You're in a cut up world
With the goodbye girls

[Verse 3]
Love distilled
For your guilt
Feelings superimposed
On the goodbye girls

[Pre-Chorus]
Fraudulently
They love you
I think of you

[Chorus 2]
Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night

[Chorus 2]
Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night
Love you all night
Love you all night
Love you all night
