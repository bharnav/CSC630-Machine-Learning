[Verse 1]
Sapphire her burning eyes
Model euphonic paradigms

[Chorus]
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser

[Verse 2]
Shadowing masonic verve
Follows the pharaoh and the worm

[Chorus]
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser

[Verse 3]
Mirror, mirror on the wall, (look at me)
Into the purring night you call, (once different)

[Chorus]
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser

[Outro]
Awkwardness happening, (once different)
Awkwardness happening, (look at me, look at me)
