[Verse 1]
Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
All my time is in half-life
Memories over memories
Can I see more than I'm programmed to be?

[Chorus]
Constellation of Orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journey

[Verse 2]
I report
There once were cities
Open academies
Avenues and trees
Human law
Automatic oracles
Calendar, the years
Verbal hemispheres

[Chorus 2]
Constellation of Orion
The repositioned light
The postatomic night
Informing me I'm near
The axis of feeling

[Chorus]
Constellation of Orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journey
