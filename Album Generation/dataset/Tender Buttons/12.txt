[Chorus]
You and me in time
You and me in time

[Verse 1]
The river flows down
The flower grows up
The snow makes no sound
On the mountain top

[Chorus]
You and me in time
You and me in time

[Verse 2]
We're saying goodbye
We're waving our hands
The waves and the tide
Move the grains of sand

[Chorus]
You and me in time
