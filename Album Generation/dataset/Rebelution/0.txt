SShhhhhh!!!!!!!
If youre readin the booklet
Or you're listenin to Track 1
Youre evidence that the Rebolution has began
You're not a statistic
No matter how many or few
In reality, all I need to change this shit is you
Came to past in the days of glorifying everything wrong
That the standard for girls became a bra and a thong
Wholesome values like curling up with a good book and a bong
Went out the window along with making a good song
Everybodys got a new image, new management team
New lawyers negotiating new dreams
Even if they come true, I still would'nt wanna be ya
Got everything new except a new idea
Why do I get the feeling I heard all this before?
I guess its because I've heard all this before
And Im sure Im gonna hear it some more
Cuz everbody thinks he's the one who invented being the bore
If these are the last days then im using my music
As my Jesus save me from this musical slavery
When non-believers try to nail my hand to the mic stand
I get my with the love of my fans
They've given me so much
I think its only fair that i stay in touch with the movement
Every year its a steady imrovement
Stay grounded and not get caught up with this this illusion
Cuz that the problem and right now im only into solutions
So I say to you now, the Rebolution is urgent
Stand befor you not as queen, but as your humble servant
Fake leaders claim thrones without building kingdoms
Same as the music business in Kingston
We need to fight for the future, for our daughters and sons
Instead you're trippin your brothers, fightin for crumbs
But we will no be deterred by knives or guns
Go tell it on the mountain, THE REBOLUTION HAS COME
Well You can fight it or hide it
Or seize the moment and ride it
Instead of fallin divided
Why dont we stand up united
Differences put aside it would be easier had if we tried it
But even if we dont
CHANGE MUST COME
CHANGE MUST COME
If its peace or its violence
If its talkin or silence
If you're with me then fight it
If you're not then sill do
Cuz no matter what you do
It will affect you
CHANGE MUST COME
CHANGE MUST COME
Its time to separate the now from the then
The boys from the men
Separate the ways of the righteous from the ways of this wicked world
And definately time to separate the ladies from the girls
Are you ready for a Rebolution??
I can't hear you
I said, R U READAY FOR A REBOLUTION????
