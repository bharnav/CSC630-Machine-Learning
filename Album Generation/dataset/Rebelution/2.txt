A few people between us
Im watchin u across the bar
And i think to myself "you're way too far"
So I found a reason to come over
I really needed a light
And i just hung around for the rest of the night
A little light conversation, Casual Touch
I feel you respond to me baby
So I know its not too much, and i say

Are you alone, If you are then Im alone
Nothing can complicate the night
Do you have a ride, If you got a ride then meet me in the parking lot outside
I'll be standing in the shadow, way outta di light
Keep my business away from the watchful eyes
I can bring the rubber, already got the rubber, everything's fine
Now all you gotta do is RISE

(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
Rise, and let me put it on you
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
I wanna put it on you
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
Let me put it on you, Yea
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)

Well mi a watch yuh like a sniper
Cauze mi wah yuh ride me like a biker
Climb up pon di buff like a hiker
Basically mi wah yuh slam mi hard like a rally rally piper
Caress him wid mi two hand
Mi have a few rubbers an a few gran
An mi done book a room over di hilton
Like Paris, mi no get embarassed
So yuh free fi bring di still cam
You alone mi a keep it one up
Tell mi, yuh man enough?
Yuh no haffi stone an gab up?
Wood a fire, yuh no haffi a/c nor fan up
Roll call, yuh hear yuh name so stan up

Let mi put it on you
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
I wanna put it on you
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
I wanna put it on you, woah
(No need to front cause I know you want it baby)
Let me put it on you

Wen we get skin to skin
Mi a move toe to toe
Every style yuh sen on mi a let it off back
If even a wuk pon di side was tabboo
Tell dem seh tonight we ago set it off bak
If wifey no like how mi put on a bruise pon you
Wen mi done she fi tek it off back
Wen mi put a likkle extra glue inna di
Stickkity
Bet any money she cyaa get it off bak, woah

Chorus until fade
