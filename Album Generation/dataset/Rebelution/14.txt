INTRO
Things bad now but trust me them could get worse
Unless of course we come together and do something first
And all mothers just gwaan pray cause it a go tek a lot more than a politician to save the day
VERSE 1
When the youths dem need a buss give them opportunity first
Cause if them siddung and a lust it nah go safe fi none of us
And all the guns weh used to rust a go rise up from the dust
Police and soldiers haffi duck when them hear the guns a buss
War a gwaan in Iraq, meh nu have nuh time fi penny that
Me a watch the youths dem pon the block a rise the SK and the Glock
It nuh safe gi go a shop, even pickney dem a drop
Now tell me what we gonna do about that?
HOOK
A long time me did a warn dem
Say the youths dem need fi eat some
Food a that can calm dem
Dem never listen when dem hear a shot a drizzle, well here comes the storm then
When the thunder start roll and get out of control we can't disarm them
VERSE 2
When opportunity mean fi wait outside another brother gate
And when nuh food nuh inna yuh plate, you know your life yuh a go hate
Your value nah appreciate no matter how you hold the fate
You end up crooked and a look it, it nuh pay fi live so straight
Seven years after college
All now job no come
So you overqualified
Still haffi live inna the slum
Father dead you haffi take care of your mother and your son
And your grip it all a done, you load the clip inna your gun
It hard fi smile with everybody weh yuh meet everyday
All when yuh do good
You still a get beat everyday
No have noten fi lose, yuh still deh pon the street everyday
If you go prison at least, yuh get fi eat everyday
HOOK
VERSE 3
When we actions nuh mirror what a come from we lips
Simply means we must be a nation of hypocrites
Politicians come from among us, as far I can see
If somen wrong with them then some must be wrong with we
A we meek them, a we elect them, and all the crap them a dish a we a take them
So it's a little insane, when we start complaining, when the bullets start raining
When a we the creator fi the harm them
HOOK
SPEAK
You know what? Me can't promise you
Say the youths dem a go drop the baretta
Hell, me me can't even promise, you say me a go act better
But one thing's for sure, we can mek a effort
And that at least we can do before we lef earth
HOOK
Every boy every girl every man man together we can
Every saint every sinner every politician together we can
Every teacher every lawyer every doctor and every don
Together we can
Warn dem.....
