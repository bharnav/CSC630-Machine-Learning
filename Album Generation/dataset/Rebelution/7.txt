Well, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride
I'd get past my pride, you'd be by my side
I wouldn't be holding on to memories
I wouldn't need them, you'd be here with me
That I was separate and complete, was my confusion
My reciprocity turned out to be retribution
So caught up with what I wanted you to be
Convinced that perfection meant spot free

Bwoy, look at me now
A shadow of my former glory
And the moral of my story is....

It may seem I'm holding it down
But if you wanna know the truth
I'm slowly losing my ground
If you wanna know the truth
There's no one keeping me warm
If you wanna know the truth
I'm only good in your arms
If you wanna know the truth

I miss the way you used to say I wanna bone ya
But I have to resist the urge to phone ya

You must have moved on it's been over a year
And it wouldn't be fair to burden you with my tears
I know I said I didn't need you and I'd be alright
But I got a much different story tonight
I miss your laughter such a beautiful thing
Now the silence closes in

Oh oh aye
Just look at me now
A shadow of my former glory and the moral of my story is...

(hook)
Oh oh, keep wishing

Just look at me now
A shadow of my former glory
And the moral of my story is..

(hook)
Just look at me now
A shadow of my former glory
And the moral of my story is it may seem
