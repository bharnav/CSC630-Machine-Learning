Where Bubba Grew Up, Kept his tobacco chewed up
And when they used to hang ropes, they always kep two up
Had crosses burnin all night like the church blew up
And if you didn't look like them, they would fuck you up

Time passed, and Bubba turned 40 years old
And all them Jack Daniels started taking a toll
Seem like Bubba was about to make a final bow
None of his friends from the clan couldn't help him now

Family gathered at his bedside, ready to sing the blues
When the doctor rushed in and said "Ive got some news!!!"
"The good news is, Bubba, Ive found you a liver, only bad news is, it belongs to a Nigga"

Do you still care, about the texture of his hair or the cocoa brown colour of his skin
Do you still care, do you still give a damn now you're in the predicament you're in
Do you still care, does it still mean a lot now
You're the one who's needin the help
Do you still care, do you still find it hard to love your neighbour as you love yourself now
Tell me why can't you accept me as I am
Just as I am now

Where Bigga grew up, boys were supposed to be tough
Girls were trophies every man always kept a few of
When he was hurt and the tears would sting in his eyes
His mother said "Stop di noise, yuh a girl? real boys dont cry!"
He learned in order to be a man he had to know how to fight
And had some very difinitive rules bout whats wrong or right
He never had the luxury of being able to choose
So to him for being different, there was no excuse

Bigga was hustling on the corner, makin some cash
When he bumped into some beef that he had from the past
He watched the guns raise and the bullets fly in disbelief
As his friends all jumped in their rides
Left him in the gutter didn't care if he died
He was rescued by a car with plates that said 'Gay Pride'
It would have been fatal
A shot in your head
They saved your life, though you always said "Chi-chi fi dead!!"

Now do you care, bout the clothes that they wear
Would you rather if they left you there
Do you still care what your friends wanna think if they see you hangin out with a queer
Do you still care, does it still mean a lot now, you're the one who's needin the help
Do you still care, do you still find it hard to love your neighbour as you love yourself now
Tell me why can't you accept me as I am
Just as I am now

And thats the reason why, war can't cease
If yuh nuh look like me, me ago pop mi piece
And thats the reason why we can't get along
If yuh nuh do it my way then you doin it wrong
And thats the reason why, Iraqui babies gonna cry
And more Palestinians and Isrealies gonna die
Thats the reason why the world is in pain
We say we want peace fi reign, but a bullets again
Now tell me why can't you accept me as I am
Just the way I am now
Tell me why can't you accept me as I am
Just the way I am woah................
