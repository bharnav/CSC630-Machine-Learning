Intro
Ha ha ha hoo yeh
Ha ha ha ha ooh
Yeh man you can call me matie
Or anythin me we still appreciate it
Ha ha wooh

Verse 1
A gal like me never flee
Never back down yet
The tighter she mek him
A di close we get
Wifey cockey eeh bout she no haffi fret
You really believe dat alright just seh bet
House hold split apart
Seperate inna pain
Naturally a dis a gal dem a blame
Call me a house recker that is a poplular fame
Cause wifey refuse to face dem own shame
If the man no happy it no mek sense she vex
Cause if it wasn't this gal it would be a next
She nah blame the speed pon the locasta flex
And she definately nah blame the boring sex

Chorus1
Well if him wah stray
Him will find a way
No matter how much you move like mange
Cause if him leave me alone or me send him back home
And nutten inna you house no change
You know you still a go loose him
A worry bout me so much you nah see when a
Next gal a groove him
You know a you kallis a gwaan like me a ballif a mussy
Me come cease him
Instead a go road a night go look fight
Gwaan home go do somethin fi please him (try dat no)

Verse 2
Well isn't it ironic
Yes man a so wifey tan
She we try anythin except please the man
She cah remember when last she squeeze a black head
And she really affi wonder how him land inna mi bed
All she worry bout a who a claim him pension
And no notice seh him need some attention
Wifey too oficious mek she gwaan front it the man
Life lack somethin and him a hunt it
She seh fi better or fi worse but when the worse
Come she throw a dozen hissfic and a thousand tandrum
Raise a ruckus you woulda think a di ski a fall dung
And all the man wah is a likkle more gum

Chorus 2
If him wah stray
Him will find a way
No matter how much you move like mange
Cause if him leave me alone or me send him back home
And nutten inna you house no change
You know you still a go loose him
A worry bout me so much you nah see when a
Next gal a groove him
You know a you kallis you wah blame me fi dis
When a you did abuse him a seh me rek you life no him present
The choice all me do a choose him

Verse 3
Anyway!
How some gal so hype
Yet anytime me touch down, she fret so much
She loose a good forty pound
Suddenly she fit inna some sexxier pants
And a war wid me before she tell me thanks
Something bout da man yah
Seriously remiss, me and him a carry on and him oblivious
To this it would appear him no much older
Dan eight or nine cause him wifey convince a me
A mek up him mind alright him lie to the two a
We and it hot but how the hell you arrive at
Blaming me fi dat, does it mek you feel fulfil when you
Have a likkle spot or you just love fi hear you
Self chat
