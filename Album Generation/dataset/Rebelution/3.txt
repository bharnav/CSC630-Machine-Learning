The people dem seh dem a talk
And nobody nah listen all along
So dem want me to put it
In the form of a song
Cause is like seh, oonu betray we trust
So this is to all of you from all of us

Verse 1
Providing no jobs and
Telling us stop the crime
Is like beating a child
And telling him not to cry
With all the highways you a build
And go through
You never build a little avenue
Fi di youths dem earn a buck
Things a run a muck
Tell me what the fuk
You really think a go happen
If dem enuh earn a buck gun a buss
And none of us
Really want that shit to happen
You mistah, you know me nah try fi dis ya
But everything no so criss ya
We jus a look a little help prime ministah

Chorus
Do you expect me to turn
The other cheek
Taste my tears and admit defeat
Do you expect me to listen
When you speak
You never ever practice what you prech
Do you expect me to still come
Out and vote
No matter what happens
Were always broke
And the people seh dem
Tired of being poor
A that the emperess a chant
And the lion a roar

Verse 2
Even the richest man haffi go
Learn fi tek a stance when
Them realize seh dem no safe
Inna dem mansion
Is a tough way fi learn seh yuh
No really secure
When the problems of the poor
Come kick dung yuh door
The youths dem a get 2000 guns
Fi everyone oonu cease
Instead of treating the symptoms
Why dont you cure the disease
You know things must really get wicked
When your paycheck is less
Than your speeding ticket
Mistah, you know we nah try fi dis ya
But everything no so criss sah
We just a beg a little help prime ministah

Do you expect me to turn
The other cheek
Taste my tears and admit defeat
Do you expect me to listen
When you speak
You never ever practice what you prech
Do you expect me to still come
Out and vote
No matter what happens
Were always broke
And the people seh dem
Tired of being poor
A that the emperess a chant
And the lion a roar

Well we say, money fi run and
It fi run inna bundle
Let it go a rema let it go dung a jungle
Dung a garden need fi water
Right down to the dirt
When last you touch a maverlywhen
Last you go Kirk
Oonu better fire up the oven
Oonu need fi start bake
And the brook valley man dem need a slice a di cake
Well the man dem outa east dem ready fi
Put down the gun
A nuh war dem love war
But the food haffi run
Well white hall and Red Hills road
You know dem have a little message fi disclosed
It goes like dis, mistah
Yuh ego big
Yuh mighta think we a dis ya
But everything no so criss sah
We jus a look a little help
Prime ministah

Do you expect me to turn
The other cheek
Taste my tears and admit defeat
Do you expect me to listen
When you speak
You never ever practice what you prech
Do you expect me to still come
Out and vote
No matter what happens
Were always broke
And the people seh dem
Tired of being poor
A that the emperess a chant
And the lion a roar
