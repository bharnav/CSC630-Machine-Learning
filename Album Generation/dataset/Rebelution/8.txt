When you left me in a fever ah shovel yoh shit
Ah never know you woulda be back ah grovel like dis
It take me so long fi get over now me finally can boast
[Every thing and armour thicker exercise your post]
So me call upon de universe if only she would let me when I need her da most

You got some nerve
Asking if I think about you
I'm sure that you know I still do
My memory's fine
You got some nerve
Thinking we could still be friends now
But this is where the story ends now
I'm drawing the line

The bad about you eclipses the good I wanna miss
And there's no longing in my heart when I reminisce
Oh, I'm so over dis!

(Chorus)
You're spilled milk
No use sitting crying over you
(No, me nah cry for u, no me nah bawl for you noo)
It's only natural that a rogue would do what a rogue would do
(No, me nah beg for you and me nah call for you noo)
And besides goodbye there's really nothing left to say
( No, me get up from you when mi did fall for u)
Cuz if you never spilled then you woulda gone sour anyway
No loss felt

I bet you think that my fa'ade woulda crack
You're spilled milk
I bet you think I woulda welcome you back
No loss felt
I bet you think dat was de end for me (you're spilled milk)
But I find a betta wood the forest full up a tree
(Spilled milk)
I bet you think you woulda still have me weak (spilled milk)
Like u nah know how much man outta street
You come ready fi me oil ah noint u
Well me sorry fi disappoint u

You got some nerve
Showing up, acting concerned now
Forgettin' I'm the bridge you burnt down just as you gotta cross (can't believe you woulda do dat)
You got some nerve!
Thinking I'm all about you
Swearing I'd be lost without you
But it was your loss!

Guess what

I'm not even angry anymore
I mopped some bigger messes than you up off of my floor
You're just another chore!

You're spilled milk
No use sitting crying over you
(No, me nah cry for u, no me nah bawl for you noo)
It's only natural that a rogue would do what a rogue would do
(No, me nah beg for you and me nah call for you noo)
And besides goodbye there's really nothing left to say
( No, me get up from you when mi did fall for u)
Cuz if you never spilled then you woulda gone sour anyway
(No last slam for you, bare blue balls for you now)
No loss felt

I bet you think that my fa'ade woulda crack
You're spilled milk
I bet you think I woulda welcome you back
No loss felt
I bet you think dat was de end for me (you're spilled milk)
But I find a betta wood if I did pull up a tree
(You're spilled milk)
I bet you think you woulda still have me weak
(Spilled milk)
Like u nah know how much man outta street
You come ready fi me oil ah noint u
Well me sorry fi disappoint u

Cuz if you hadn't spilled then you woulda gone sour anyway
