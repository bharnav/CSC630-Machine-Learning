Verse 1
Who do you call at 2 in da morning when you're feeling lonely and got no friends
Where do you go when you run outof places and the walls of your dreams
Come crashing in
What do you do whern you've used all your voices and your only choice is packing it in
Who wants to know that your life is a crisis cause you're paying the prices for living in sin
Nobody wants to know
If you're feeling down in the dumps
You climb all the way to the top floor but you can't even get up the guts to jump

Hook
Cherry Brandy (Hennessey and Red Bull)
Cames in real handy (Johnny Walker Blue baby)
Vodka wine and whickey (swig another mouthful)
Go down fine (grab another 'Q' baby)
If I get lucky (if Jack Daniels got you turning)
Maybe I'll make it to 40 (stagger to the loo baby)
But happy still ain't no friend of mine (let it out, you'll be fine)

Verse 2
Where do you go when your world turns sour and every hour just brings more pain
Who wants to know that you're crying a river happens over and over and it's all the same
What do you do when you've given your heart and it's torn apart and thrown back in your face
Who wants to know that your life is open and words are spoken that you can't erase
The world always looks better after I've put down a few
Though we're not together, when I'm stoned I'm lying next to you

Hook
Cherry Brandy (Hennessey and Red Bull)
Cames in real handy (Johnny Walker Blue baby)
Vodka wine and whickey (swig another mouthful)
Go down fin (grab another 'Q' baby)
If I get lucky (if Jack Daniels got you turning)
Maybe I'll make it to 40 (stagger to the loo baby)
But happy still ain't no friend of mine (let it out, you'll be fine)

Verse 3
Everybody calls me just another drunken slob
But I see yoru face in every glass of wine I've have
Since you no longer think of coming around
Nuttin wrong wit me drinkin and coming around
Still got hopes of seeing you again but until then

Chant
Well if me drinkin a yuh problem, F' U then
Me best friend a Mr. Wray and him Nephew dem
And if some Heineken a freeze me haffi rescue them
When it comes to 'passing the bar'
I'm not the best student no

REPEAT Hook
