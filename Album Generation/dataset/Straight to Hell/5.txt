Lowdown, once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
To get by, my friend

It's keepin' me up
Late at night
I can't settle down
My honky tonk life

Driftin' 'round 'bout half past four
With the blues on my back
And a bottle on the floor
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me lowdown

And she told me, "It'll be OK
Things'll soon get better one day"
But I don't see how

Driftin' 'round 'bout half past four
With the blues on my back
And a bottle on the floor
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me lowdown

And she told me, "It'll be OK
Things'll soon get better one day"
But I don't see how
'Cause I'm too lowdown
