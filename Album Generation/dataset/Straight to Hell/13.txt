I got the Louisiana Stripes
And their always chainin' me down
I'm in debt for 99 years for shootin' my wife to the ground

Well she had to love my friend
And that's not right with me
So I grabbed my gun, shot both in the head and then I threw their ass in the creek

Now I'm doin' my time, in this Louisiana Pen
Thinkin' about maybe bein' free on the day that I'm a dead man

Well it took some time getting' used to
Being locked in this prison cell
But I always hum those tunes of George Jones to help me through my days of hell
I've done me 25 years
And that's alright with me
'Cause I got me a lot of damn good friends in this Louisiana penitentiary

Now I'm doin' my time, in this Louisiana Pen
Thinkin' about maybe bein' free on the day I'll be walkin' to feel
That fire of the Loui-si-an-a Pen-i-ten-tia-ry

(Spanish)
"At 2:59 AM"
"This is Houston calling, we just wanted to say Hello, Hello
Hi *giggles* Alright goodnight bye"
