Well you never took my heart
When I tried hard to give it to you
And I know you can't be true
'Cause you wanna be roamin' free. (Free.)
Now I'm lookin' straight at you
An' see you with another man
So I take the shot of whiskey
So I don't have no regrets

Well, I've fallen drunk again:
I guess she must have got to me
I don't need little little woman
Getting upper hand on me
Now I'm lost an' now I'm broke
An' now I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I still here an' think about
The things we used to do

Walkin' through the crowwded streets
I don't see no-one carin' for me
That's all right, I don't need anyone
Except myself, you see
'Cause now I'm stronger an' I'm smarter
An' I'm not like I used to be
But I still sit here an' think about
The things you did to me

Yeah, I still sit here an' think about
The things you did to me
