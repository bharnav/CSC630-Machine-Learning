Well, oh what a feeling
That burns down low
When you ain't got no where to turn
Or no where to go
It makes me feel like sometimes
I'm outta control
So I'm gonna get wasted
With all my country heroes

I'm drinkin' some George Jones
And a little bit of Coe
Haggard's easin' my misery
And Waylon's keepin' me from home
Hank's givin' me those high times -
Cash is gonna sing it low
I'm here gettin' wasted -
Just like my country heroes

I'm drinkin' that whiskey
Out of that glass
And if that ain't country
Well boys, you can kiss my ass
I wanna hear them old songs -
Nothin' of the new
'cause this might be the last time
I'm gonna see you

So I'm drinkin' some George Jones
And a little bit of Coe
Haggard's easin' my misery
And Waylon's keepin' me from home
Hanks givin' me those high times -
Cash is gonna sing it low
And I'm here gettin' wasted -
Just like my country heroes

I'm here gettin' wasted -
With all my country heroes
