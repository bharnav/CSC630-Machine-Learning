Well, I have got no money but I am doin' fine
I'm just a hillbilly hell-raiser; I'm tryin' to kill my time
An' I'm lookin' for that gal, about five foot ten
An' I'm gonna take her down that road of livin' a life of sin

Because I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun
I always carry round my loaded shotgun
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine

Well, I once had this gal: I thought she'd be my bride
But then she had to leave my ass for that other guy

An' now I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun
I always carry round my loaded shotgun
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine

Well, I don't really care if you hate me, you see
'Cause I'm just a country boy from the state of Tennessee
A little bit crazy, on the loudish side
'Cause I like drink my whiskey an' I like to get high

An' now I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun
I always carry round my loaded shotgun
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine
