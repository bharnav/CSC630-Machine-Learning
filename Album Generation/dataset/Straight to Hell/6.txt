Well, I've been awake for eight days straight
Well, it must've been them pills I took
I been twitchin' an' turnin' an' seein' visions
It must've been them pills I took

Well, I don't know if it were an' I don't know where I got 'em
But they sure did make me feel good
They kept my heart from feelin' blue
An' kept my thoughts away from you

Well, there's blood on the carpet an' holes in the walls
Well, it must've been them pills I took
Yeah, the mirrors are all busted an' someone's cryin'
It must've been them pills I took

I've lied an' I've stole an' I ain't fuckin' jokin'
It must've been them pills I took
Yeah, the mirrors are all busted an' someone's cryin'
It must've been them pills I took

I still don't know if it were an' I don't know where I got 'em
But they sure did make me feel good
They kept my heart from feelin' blue
An' kept my thoughts away from you

"Doctor Forrest, dial 118, please."
"He's in a ward."
"Doctor Forrest, dial 118."
