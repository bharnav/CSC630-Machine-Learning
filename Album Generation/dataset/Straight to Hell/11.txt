Well, hello there folks, how the hell are you doin':
It's good to be in your local bar again
So let's get loud, we'll get stoned an' get proud
Have a damn good time until the show's at an' end
Sometimes I'm wired an' sometimes, I'm tired
But I'm doin' the best that I can
So let's have a drink and a glum with Hank
An' may the outlaws rise again

Well I'm a son of a son:
I've got a chip of what I've said an' done
Well, I remember watchin' ol' Waylon
When he was shootin' his shotgun
It's a certain kinda livin'
It's a certain kinda style
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild

Well I think I'd rather eat the barrel
Of a double-barrel loaded shotgun
Than to hear that shit they call pop-country music
On ninety-eight-point-one
Just so you know, so it's it's set in stone
Kid Rock don't come from where I come from:
Yeah, it's true, he's a Yank, he ain't no son of Hank:
If you even thought so, god-damn, you're fucking dumb

So let's get real loud:
Let's get stoned and proud
Pour me another shot of whiskey
An' this one's for the south
It's a certain kinda livin'
It's a certain kinda style
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild
