Yeah, I can feel it's time for me to be movin' on
And the reason I know is for us, the good times have gone
We keep gettin' further than closer, day by day
And if you ever need someone to help you, don't ever call my way

'Cause Lord, I'm fallin' further, day by day
The devil's movin' in like he's gonna stay
I tried, my heart, to give her somethin' true
But when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you

My poor heart broke the day you said goodbye:
I cried an' tried to drink myself nearly dry
Bein' alone is a pain that's hard to .....
When I'm lyin' here thinkin' of all the good times with you

And Lord, I'm fallin' further, day by day
The devil's movin' in like he's gonna stay
Oh, I tried, my heart, to give her somethin' true
But when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you
Yeah, when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you
