Satan is real working in spirit
You can see him an' hear him every day
Satan is real working with power
He can tempt you an' lead you astray
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha......)
Well, my worn out boots are takin' me down town
An' I'm lookin' for trouble an' I wanna get loud
Serve me up a drink an' I'll shoot it right down
An' I'll jump up on the bar an' holler: "One more round."
I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
An' I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
So you just better get me one more round
Well, back in the day with my Uncle Jim
He kept a lotta moonshine out in the shed
Taught me how to drink, how to be real proud
Of my hillbilly ways an' my outlaw style
I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
So you just better get me one more round
Instrumental Break
Well, I'm bracin' these back roads tryin' to save my life
'Cause the Sheriff wants to kill me 'cause I f****d his wife
I was on the run with a gun in my hand
'Cause I liked a good time an' a one-night stand
I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
I'm goin' straight to hell, (Hell, hell.)
So you just better get me one more round
Hell, you just better get me one more round
