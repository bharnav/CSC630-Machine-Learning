[Verse 1]
She said she's gonna quit me
If I didn't quit the booze
So I just started drinkin' more
To see if she would really choose
And I have to hand it to that girl:
She meant every breath
An' I'm glad she did, cause I was about
To drink myself to death

[Chorus]
Because my drinkin' problem left today
She packed up all her things and walked away
Well, it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay
Because my drinkin' problem left today

[Verse 2]
Well, she said I had problems:
Boy, was she ever right?
To keep from goin' home to her
I'd stay out, drunk, all night
And I believe that woman left me
In the nick of time
If she'd a-stayed much longer
I'd have drinked up my last dime

[Chorus]
Because my drinkin' problem left today
She packed up all her things and walked away
And it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay
Because my drinkin' problem left today

[Outro]
Yeah, it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay
Because my drinkin' problem left today
