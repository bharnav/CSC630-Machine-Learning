[Verse 1]
Well some say I'm not country
And that's just fine with me
'Cause I don't wanna be country
With some faggot looking over at me
They say that I'm ill-mannered
That I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin'
You'll know that pop country really sucks

[Chorus]
So I'm here to put the "dick" in Dixie
And the "cunt" back in country
'Cause the kind of country I hear now days
Is a bunch of fuckin' shit to me
They say that I'm ill-mannered
That I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin'
You'll know that pop country really sucks

[Verse 2]
Well we're losing all the outlaws
That had to stand their ground
And they're being replaced by these kids
From a manufactured town
And they don't have no idea
About sorrow and woe
'Cause they're all just too damn busy
Kissin' ass on Music Row

[Chorus]
So I'm here to put the "dick" in Dixie
And the "cunt" back in country
'Cause the kind of country I hear nowdays
Is a bunch of fuckin' shit to me
And they say that I'm ill-mannered
That I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin'
You'll know that pop country really sucks

[Outro]
And if you know what I'm thinkin'
You'll know that pop country really sucks
