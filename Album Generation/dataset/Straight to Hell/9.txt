[Verse 1]
Well, I was rollin' by myself, went down to Memphis, Tennessee
And I was lookin' for a guy who had a mullet and no teeth
And I was trippin' on some acid a latino gave to me
Hey, I was smokin' morphine 'til it knocked me off my feet
Then I scored some "H" from my old Uncle Pete
Now I'm startin' to feel like I might've ODed

[Chorus  1)
On an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
And I love gettin' high - hate bein' low
And I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin' real hard, tryin' to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin' state to state

[Verse 2]
Somehow I made it up to Texas with a carload full of grass
And I'm seeing all these pigs who wanna bust my ass
And I'm always livin' hard - always smokin' weed
Now I'm hangin' out in Texas drinkin' mushroom tea
And I'm fucked up on the floor - think I know why
Must've been some of that Boone county moonshine

[Chorus 2]
And an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
And I love gettin' high - hate bein' low
And I'm always about stayin' on this road
And I'm workin' real hard, tryin' to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin' state to state

[Instrumentation Break)

[Vere 3]
I tried to get up off the floor, tried to get myself in line
Cause the ceiling's talkin' to me, and the pisser's flushin' fire
That's why they call me 'full throttle' - I like a good time
It all started at a bar with a friend of mine
Had to hook me up - he said he'd blow my mind
I've been up for four days so cut me out another line

[Vese 4]
Of an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
I love bein' high - hate bein' low
And I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin' real hard, tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin state to state
