Way down in West Virginia
There are some people who are one of a kind
They don't need nothin' from nobody
Cause they're already doin' fine
You got Hasil Adkins punchin'
An' Mamie's raisin' hell
The legend of D Ray White
Will never die like a rebel yell

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his Daddy's shoes
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still punchin' out them Boone County blues
(Boone County blues.)
An' ol' Mamie, you know she's done some time in jail
The legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell

Birdie May White, she's the strongest woman
That I've ever met in my life
She raised over twenty-four of her own
An' had to watch her husband dyin'
She's always fightin' hard
An' livin' off the land
When she's done livin' in this world
You know, the Lord's gonna take her by her hand

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his Daddy's shoes
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still punchin' out them Boone County blues
(Boone County blues.)
An' ol' Mamie, you know she's still rain' hell
The legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell
Yeah, the legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell
