A man said
"Come here beautiful
I like you diamonds
And cold mounds of gold
Screaming kisses"

He made this comment
To a woman of dreams
And yet she surely
Must be a queen

To perform
The mannequin must try very hard
To move

An intense fire came from the kitchen
And the people scrambled for the exit
But the mannequin
Who could not move
She kept weeping snowflakes
The fire was extinguished
The people disappeared
And a man said
"Come here beautiful"

He made this offer
To a woman of dreams

TO A WOMAN OF DREAMS
