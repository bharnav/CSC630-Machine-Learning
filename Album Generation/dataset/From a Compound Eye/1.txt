Oh God, they see me
Spider eyes

Red and brown
(you) build me a love thing
You around, so brown oh no

Oh, spider eyes
You won't

Oh, hair long
We'll come to meet you
See the shadow

Of your eyes
Of the kind you'll bring
Of your right

To be free
Where you keep on moanin' lonely, everyday
Where you keep on pushin' your sadness
From your eyes, yeah

And your mind
