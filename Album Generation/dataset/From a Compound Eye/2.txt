Corroded lime I chased
From my old window world
Seemingly like an ancient demon
Waking up and waved out

Class examples of an onioned diagram
I'm here to follow footfalls
Of a wasted plan
I've been waved out

And next there comes a positive post
The options aren't so good
Plus once the intervention begins
It's painful

Forgive me, I must go
I've been waved out
I've been waved out
