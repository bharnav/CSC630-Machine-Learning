We heard about the mess
E: We brothers on stage
I: But we have more finesse
E: So if we orchestrate well [YEEEESSSS?]
I: Then you should put us on and press charge the clientele
E: And if the live show is strong... [YEEEESSSS?]
I: Shit, we form like Voltron (E: Let's get it on)

E: When he ain't speak
I: ...He speaks on my behalf
Mentally connected
E: Throw the microphone 50 feet in the air
I: And then catch it
E: Somebody throws a baby...
I: Oh shit!
E: Do a spin move and catch it
I: ...And the crowd goes crazy
E: Call me foolish
I: 180? [YEEEESSSS?]
E: Maybe twice the sacrifice
I: My life knifed the lazies (???)

I: Insight, with the plan, who are you too?
E: Edan, and together we stand
I: Cos when the beats sound iffy and the kids bark live
E: It'll be a sad day like when the Bizmark dies!
I: This art's mine to master
