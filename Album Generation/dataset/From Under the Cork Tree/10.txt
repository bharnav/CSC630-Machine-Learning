[Verse 1]
I confess, I messed up
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around
And I know you dressed up
"Hey, kid, you'll never live this down"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said
"Why don't you just drop dead?"

[Chorus]
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

[Verse 2]
Write me off, give up on me
'Cause darling, what did you expect?
I'm just off, a lost cause
A long shot, don't even take this bet

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said
"Why don't you just drop dead?"

[Chorus]
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

[Bridge]
Always on
You said you'd keep me honest
(Always on)
But I won't call you on it
(Always on)

[Chorus]
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

[Outro]
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
