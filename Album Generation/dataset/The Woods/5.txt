So you want to be entertained?
Please look away, don't look away
We're not here cause we want to entertain
Go away, don't go away

Reality is the new fiction they say
Truth is truer these days, truth is man-made
If you're here cause you want to be entertained
Go away, please go away

If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial

You come around looking 1984
You're such a bore, 1984
Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore
It's better than before
It's better than before

You come around sounding 1972
You did nothing new with 1972
Where's the "fuck you"?
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue

If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial

Hey! Look around they are lying to you
They are lying, they are lying and
Can't you see it is just a silly ruse?
They are lying, and I am lying too
All you want is entertainment
Rip me open it's freeing, yeah

If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial

Don't wear me down
I'm not running down
Don't wear me down
I'm not running down

1, 2,3!
If you want to take a shot at me get in line
1, 2,3!
Baby, I've had all my shots and I'm fine

1, 2,3!
If you haven't had enough of me, get in line
1, 2,3!
You too deserve it now, it's all right

1, 2,3!
We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
1, 2,3!
It feels like someone pushed rewind

1, 2,3!
Give it to me easily, my feeble mind needs time
1, 2,3!
Make it sweet and syrupy with rhyme

Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down
Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down

If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial

The grip of fear
(Woah, oh, oh) Is already here
(Woah, oh, oh) The lines are drawn
(Woah, oh, oh) Whose side are you on?
