From the stillness came an ovation
It rattled the foundations of the house that I live in
No I can't live there anymore
A child sleeps then he awakens
He shrieks till he's taken to a house he can live in
Take him to a house he can live in
And in the morning when you know it's gonna be alright
In the morning when you know it won't remember a thing
Well, in the morning when you know it's gonna be alright
[Incomprehensible], it's gonna be alright
Yeah I, I get drunk and sentimental
I need a touch that is gentle
Just to take me
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
And I heard your crooked words about something
So I'm saying nothing, I know that it's nothing
Can you hear it in the house that you live in?
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to somewhere I can live
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to a house I can live in
Take me to somewhere I can live!
