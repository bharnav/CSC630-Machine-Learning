I can't stop this feeling I've got
I know who I am and I know what I'm not
I know where I've been and I know what I've lost
But I can't stop this feeling I've got

Wasn't I looking yeah hadn't I heard
Didn't I see, didn't I learn
And I dont know what you mean to me
But im starting to think its just a mystery

I can't stop this feeling I've got
I know what I am and I know what I'm not
I know what I've gained and I know what I've lost
But I can't stop this feeling I've got

Wasn't I looking yeah hadn't I heard
Didn't I see, didn't I learn
I may be right you may disagree
But I'm starting to think it's just a mystery
Whatever it is it's just a mystery

Ah you dont know why it looks so easy
You've spend a lifetime looking for someone
And then they come and you're just so uneasy
You get the feeling that the fire don't come
Then there's one more story on your way

And I can't stop this feeling I've got
I know who I am and I know what I'm not
I know where I've been and I know what I've lost
But I can't stop this feeling I've got

The sky may fall, the sea may split
You may say that isn't it
I may be right you may disagree
Same old story same old me

And I don't know what you mean to me
But I'm starting to think it's just a mystery
I've got to admit it's just a mystery
