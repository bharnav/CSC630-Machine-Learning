[Verse 1: Scarface]
You know what?
I'm destined to be the last man standing
Carefully mapping my escape through planning
Come in and get it, and leave here with it
Making for sure that I'll be free when I hit
It's like a dope man's lotto, the dope man follows
The rule here is simple, and this is my motto
To get it how you get it homie, Murcielago
Get you a house built, keep you a dollar, know
'Cause when it's over it's over, no cheese to borrow
You fuck around, get indicted, ain't no tomorrows
My homie locked up, been six years tight
But six years is nothing, 'cause this kid's life
Is off is a cage, for the rest of his days
A price that he paid, for the mistake he made
So I'm more focused 'cause my lifestyle's bogus
I got to get out, 'cause this fast life's over

[Hook]
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
They say the ends, justifies the means
So I guess a drug dealer justifies the fiends
Poverty and unemployment justifies the screams
The reason he stacks his paper, just to buy it clean
2006 with shoes the size of me
But in the end, he wasn't really what he tried to be
I'd never let no war justify me
I question how hard some of these cats really be
'Cause real niggas don't speak, our actions talk more
Don't make me flip and turn these streets into a chalk board
I do this for all the real niggas that smoke trees
The hustlers, players, pimps, and O.G.'s
For the up-and-coming cats, to the old schoolers
The ones that remember Private Stock, and Calvin Coolidge
It's a struggle to make it, keep pushing
See how far you can take it, two eye, or one eye Navigate it, what?

[Hook]
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

[Verse 3: Willie D]
I know this cocksucker pulling me over because of my skin
(just be cool)
But the secret is to win, so I hold it in
I'm yes sir-ing, no sir-ing , but when he pull off he diss
A motherfucking, dick-sucking, redneck son of a bitch!
All it takes is one pussy who ain't getting none
To catch you on a dark street, and put you to sleep
Dude was one deep, at the store, he said I ain't no ho'
Got clapped in the back of his 'fro, woo!
It didn't have to go like that, believe me mister
Someday, niggas gon' respect these pistols
Play the safe, get out the way, when a fool got the ups
Pride'll get a motherfucker shot in the guts
And remember this before you grown, until the day that you gone
Greed it don't last too long
The secret is to range up out the game, and have money for life
Not to stick around 'til you lose all your shit to the vice

[Hook]
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
