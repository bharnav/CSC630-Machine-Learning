[J. Prince]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, this was a long mission
You know they say all good things must come to an end
But they forgot all we have to do is rewind
Yeah, this is Lil J and we’re about to close shop
But before I go, I gotta let you know who the Bring It On members are
Because radio and video discriminate against some of these guys
Because they’re so hard and so dope
So I’m gonna name the first to the last rapper
2 Low, Seagram, TMT, 5th Ward Boyz, Odd Squad, Ganksta NIP, DMG
3-2, Big Mello, Face2Face
And to those of you that’s interested in the crookedness of the system
Go and buy the Underground Lawyer written by Michael Minns
Now I have to give credit where credit is due
And I just never been in the middle of a jungle with style
With a big bowl of Gumbo Funk until I met Joe and my nigga Bido
Y’all some dope producers
And to all my brothers out there who thinking about getting in this rap business
It’s a smart move
You got good product, get with me, and let’s make some things happen
