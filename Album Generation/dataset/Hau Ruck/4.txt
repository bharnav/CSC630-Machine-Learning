Cracking under pressure violently
Chaos eats away the best of me
A former shadow of myself
Porcelain doll, just an empty shell
Bug in amber that can't be reached
Choking on fear that stings like bleach

Gimme the real thing
Gimme the life
Give me something deep
Something straight
Like a sharpened knife
Gimme the real thing
Give me the life
Gimme a fresh start
Like a new born child
Gimme the real thing

I have no friends
I'm always by myself
I cannot pacify my shame and doubt
Drained them dry
And damned them all to hell
I've no control or any will to stop

Everything perfect just melts away
I've got the touch like evil prey
Talking pictures in black and white
Spitting their venom back at mine

Everything old is new again
My only crime buried under cold skin
In the quiet of my tiger's eye
Cross my heart and hope to die
