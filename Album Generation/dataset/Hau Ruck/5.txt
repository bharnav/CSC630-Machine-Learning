The biggest mistake was to let you near me
I'm speaking to you but you won't ever hear me
Close to the touch but aeons away
On a distant planet on another day

I thought we were even I hoped it was cool
Your guilty pleasures made you a fool
I extended it all but you turned it to dreck
You keep trashing my name and stabbing my back

I shall not be terrorized
You will pay for all those lies

And every day's a good day to die
Fucka, fucka, die, mutha fucka, bye-bye

A spewing volcano of distortion and hate
You plead and beg me to spare your fate
You evoke our friendship and the days of old
But I know a dish that's best served cold

The gleaming blade a muffled cry
You won't live to testify

I gave you it all
I let you perform
You sowed the wind now you'll reap the storm
In the coldest blood steady-handed
I take no prisoners the eagle has landed

IDIOT!
