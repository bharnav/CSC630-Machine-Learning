Silence is golden
Ignorance bliss
Better off not asking
What you'd rather forget

And as the vice-grip choke holds
All of our freedoms are meeting their end
And for the wars they wage
Numberless troops lie wounded or dead

The beatings will continue
Until morale improves

Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Perilous folly
Rise up against your fate
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Tireless cunning
Stampede and break your chains

Terror at gunpoint
Torture at large
Enemy combatant
Labeled a threat
Without trial or charge

Repetition of history
Messenger, prophet
Martyr for god
All for once and for all
Reclaim your power
The tyrant must fall

The beatings will continue
Until morale improves

Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Perilous folly
Rise up against your fate
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Tireless cunning
Stampede and break your chains

"Violence in America today is not cause for the war
It's not cause for a repression
There is no romantic ideal involved
Let's recognize these people for what they are
They're the same thugs and hoodlums
That have always plagued the good people."

Free your hate
In the days of rage
Free your hate
In the days of rage

Free your hate
Free your hate
Free your hate
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
