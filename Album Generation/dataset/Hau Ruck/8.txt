Watch you as you eat your own
Half truths mixed with lies
Defending what you think you know
Changing stories all the time
Talking til your face is blue
Tripping on your words
Righteous in your knowledge
But you haven't got a clue
Laughing as the web you weave
Tangles til you choke
We are here and still the same
It's you that has become the joke

We are the ones you love to hate
Sleaze makes you wet below
Aching for a taste
Nothing but the best for you
All your little fits and starts
Crumbs that satiate
Urban legend drama
Only serves to feed our fame
Feed our fame

Our celebrated legacy
No flimsy house of cards
Hero worship or disdain
We take you all
For what you are
Chitter chatter jabber
You're the pilot to our shark
We've toured these oceans long before
Our territory firmly marked

We are the ones you love to hate
Sleaze makes you wet below
Aching for a taste
Nothing but the best for you
All your little fits and starts
Crumbs that satiate
Only make us stronger
Only serve to feed our fame
Feed our fame
