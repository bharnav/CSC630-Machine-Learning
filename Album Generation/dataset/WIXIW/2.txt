I bloodied myself awake today
I'm pushing off the on light
I bloodied myself awake today
I'm running off the on light

The spiral down
They're come back
A dead end
Again and again and again and again

Those friends of ours
Will seem pretend
They do again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again

I bloodied myself awake today
I'm pushing off the on light
I bloodied myself awake today

This culture's a disease
When you see it through lights
And I want you out

Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out

Cause I warned you I want you out
Cause I warned you I want you out
