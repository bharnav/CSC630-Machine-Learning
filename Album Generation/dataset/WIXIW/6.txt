The spider can't [?]
Was a one dream seeker
The spider said its so
Though they can't be certain
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna shake temptation
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna make a stranger

[Chorus]
So I can see a better light
Tell me its a lie, Aaron
There are many many millions doubting it's alive, Aaron

[Bridge]
One tree's hallow
You swallow
You follow the shadow
To follow sorrow
You will follow a beast's shadow

[Chorus]
So I can see a better light
Tell me its a lie, Aaron
There are many many millions doubting it's alive, Aaron

[Outro]
Lie [x8]
Tell me it's a lie, Aaron
Tell me it's a lie
Tell me it's a lie, Aaron
Tell me it's a lie
Tell me it's a lie, Aaron
