Oh the night makes you a star
And it holds you cold in its arms
You're the one to whom nobody verses "I love you"
Unless you say it first
So you lie there holding your breath
And it's strange how soon you forget
That you're like stars
They only show up when it's dark
'Cause they don't know their worth

And I think you need to stop following misery's lead
Shine away, shine away, shine away
Isn't it time you got over how fragile you are
We're all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
'Cause that's who you are
And you've only begun to shine

There are times when the poets and pornstars align and
You won't know who to believe in
Well that's a good time to be leavin'
And the past knocks on your door
And throws stones at your window at 4 in the morning
Well maybe he thinks it's romantic
He's crazy but you knew that before

And I think you need to stop following misery's lead
Shine away, Shine away, Shine away
Isn't it time you got over how fragile you are
We're all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
'Cause that's who you are
And you've only begun to shine
Yeah you've only begun to shine

Won't you shine, shine, shine, shine over shadow
Shine, shine, shine, shine over shadow
Shine, shine, shine, shine over...

And I think you need to stop following misery's lead
Shine away, Shine away, Shine away
Isn't it time you got over how fragile you are
We're all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
'Cause that's who you are
And you've only begun to shine
Yeah you've only begun to shine
Yeah you've only begun to shine
