2 Am and she calls me cause I'm still awake*
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season
Yeah we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason
Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button girl
So just cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe just breathe
May he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town you can tell he's been down for while
But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him but maybe I'll just sing about it
Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button boys so cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breath just breathe
There's a light at each end of this tunnel you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made
You'll just make them again if you'll only try turnin' around
2Am and I'm still awake writing this song
If i get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me threaten' the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
Cause these words are my diary screamin' out aloud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to
But you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand...yeah breath
Just breathe, ohho breathe
