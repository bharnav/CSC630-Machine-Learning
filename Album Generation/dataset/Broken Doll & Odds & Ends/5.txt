[Verse 1]
Scars cover you in fine lines, number you a timeline
Where was I when you stopped trying, you
Borrowing my tears and harrowing my mirror
Covering our eyes so I can't see us crying

[Chorus]
I'm not going home without you
I'll save your life, not going home without you
I'll make this right, and wait all night
If that's what it takes

[Verse 2]
I can't believe this skin is one we've always been with
For as long as we recall it for
Everything that it's been through, know that I forgive you
Know that I will hold you when our sky is falling

[Chorus]
I'm not going home without you
I'll save your life, not going home without you
I'll make this right, and wait all night
If that's what it takes

[Bridge]
And my reflection shows we're clinging to dear life
But I won't let us go, we'll make it through all right
And my reflection shows we're clinging to dear life
But I won't let us go, we'll make it through all right

Scars cover you in fine lines, number you a timeline
Maybe it is time that we lived by my guidelines

[Chorus]
I'm not going home without you
I'll save your life, no, not going home without you
I'll make this right, and wait all night
If that's what it takes

Save your life, if that's what it takes
Wait all night, if that's what it takes
