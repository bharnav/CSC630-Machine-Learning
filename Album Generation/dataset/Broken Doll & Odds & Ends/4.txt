You were at an end breaking at the bend
Heaven was an awful lot to lose
What if I'd of prayed
If I would have stayed
If I would have thought about you
I just covered your eyes and let you crumble down down down on the inside
All this trouble is mine
I let you crumble down down down on the inside
I can't lie love
I'm sort of Delilah
And I know
That I let you down, I let you down, I let you down
Once you were a tower
And the power
How did I become the wrecking ball
Didn't want to hurt you
Didn't deserve you
I'm usually the victim afterall
I just covered your eyes and let you crumble down down down on the inside
All this trouble is mine
I'll let you crumble down down down on the inside
I can't lie love
I'm sort of Delilah
And I know
That I let you down, I let you down, I let you down
I might not have started if I knew that I would break your heart
And if I tell you that I'm sorry
Would I build you back to where you started
I became the bad guy
I broke your heart, and you just let me
I don't want to be the bad guy
I just covered your eyes and let you crumble down down down on the inside
All this trouble is mine
I let you crumble down down down on the inside
I can't lie love
I'm sort of Delilah
And I know
That I let you down, I let you down, I let you down
