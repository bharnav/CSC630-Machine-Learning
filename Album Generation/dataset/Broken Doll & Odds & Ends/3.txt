[Verse 1]
There you are underneath
Someone else's lucky streak
Is that the way you like it?
Is that the way you like it?

And you believe a picture takes
A little piece of you away
Is that the way you like it?
Is that the way you like it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Be weary, love, be careful
It's only skin and therefore
So breakable but take heart it's
Only a part of who you are

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder why everybody cries
Every time you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you know the sun, rising when you come
Follows when you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you walk away, walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
You believe you've been crowned
With your own private thunder cloud
Is that the way you like it?
Is that the way you like it?

But you don't need remote control
To tell you that you're beautiful
But that's the way you like it
Is that the way you like it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Be weary, love, be careful
It's only skin and therefore
So breakable but take heart it's
Only a part of who you are

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder why everybody cries
Every time you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you know the sun, rising when you come
Follows when you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you walk away, walk away, walk away

[Bridge]
Didn't anybody tell you?
You don't have to, you don't have to jump
Only do it if you like it
If you don't like it, you don't have to jump
Just remember what it's like when you walk away
Just remember that we cry when you walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Be weary and be careful
It's only skin and therefore
So breakable but take heart it's
Only a part of who you are

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder why everybody cries
Every time you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you know the sun, rising when you come
Follows when you walk away, walk away, walk away?
Don't you walk away, walk away, walk away
Don't walk away, walk away, walk away
