Now that it's time
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
Now that it's real
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go?
And maybe try another time
And do I really have a hand, am I forgetting?
Now that I've tried
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way
Now that I turn
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go?
And maybe finally split the rhyme
And do I really understand the under netting?
You said the morning has me looking in your eyes
And seeing mine, warning me, to read the signs, carefully
Now that it's light
Now that the candles falling smaller in my mind
Now that it's here
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go?
And maybe follow another sign
And do I really have a song that I can write on?
Now that I can
Now that it's easy ever easy all around
Now that I'm here
Now that I'm falling to the sunlight and a song
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go?
And do I have to do just one?
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason?
You said the morning has me looking in your eyes
And seeing mine, warning me, to read the signs, more carefully
Now that I smile
Now that I'm laughing ever deeper inside
Now that I see
Now that I've finally found the one thing I deny
It's now I know
Do I stay or do I go?
And it is finally I decide
That I'll be leaving in the fairest of the seasons
