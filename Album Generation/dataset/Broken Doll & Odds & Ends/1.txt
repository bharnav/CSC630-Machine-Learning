I think I love you like a car crash, dear
I don't want your wreckage ball to find I cannot steer
My eyes away now, you know I couldn't stay now
Let me go, let me go
Angels raise accusing eyes, I'm gonna lose him
Let me go, let me go
Cause I might let you break my heart
If mine was all that I was worth
I might let you break my heart
If I don't break it first
The old star clock it laughs itself to sleep tonight
And that fork in the road will bleed me like a knife
But you're moving faster, beautiful disaster
Let me go, just let me go
Angel raise accusing eyes, I'm gonna lose him
Let me go, just let me go
And maybe I will taste you in another time and place
You look so good, I bet you taste like something sweet
But Hell is overflowing and there's no way of knowing
If I give up Heaven for one moment will I get it back?
And I might let you break my heart
If only mine would hurt
