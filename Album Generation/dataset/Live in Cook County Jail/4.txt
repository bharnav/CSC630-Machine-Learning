Three O'Clock Blues

Well now it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning baby
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked around me
And my baby she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
I'm going down to the Golden Ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins

Darlin' You Know I Love You

Darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always

When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
