Here we are in the orchestra
A bullet in our breath
We hold our horns like credit cards
And hope to pay the rent

But when the war is done
And we've finished all our songs
Will they offset the colossal karma debt?

The ebony and the ivory
Talked politics again
Then they sat and chewed the scenery
'Til there was nothing left

But will all their peace accords
Amount to something more or something less
Than wasted breath?

I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love
I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love
I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love

Here we are in the orchestra
A bullet in our breath
We hold our horns like credit cards
And hope to pay the rent

But when the war is done
And we've finished all our songs
Will they offset the colossal karma debt?
