Don't do much these days
Keep the wolves at bay
Don't do much to ease the pain

Heaven's hell, I say
It gets in the way
If we're never gonna reach the top
Why would we even try?

Don't do much these days
Keep the wolves at bay
Don't do much to ease the pain

Heaven's hell, I say
It gets in the way
If we're never gonna reach the top
Why would we even try?

Oh we're tumbling down
We're tumbling down
'Cause your ideal is not mine
Yes, we're tumbling down
We're tumbling down
Tumbling, tumbling

I wanna know
Who lets the wolves in
And can I see him tonight
Yeah, I wanna know
That man in sheepskin
'Cause I owe him a fight

In the valley below
Oh, a red river flows
It ain't right
I'm gonna add him below
To that river of souls
Tonight

Yeah, I wanna know
Who lets the wolves in
And can I see him tonight
Yeah, I wanna know
That man in sheepskin
'Cause I owe him a fight

In the valley below
Oh, a red river flows
It ain't right
I'm gonna add him below
To that river of souls
Tonight

To that river of souls
To that river of souls
To that river of souls
To that river of souls tonight

To that river of souls
To that river of souls
To that river of souls
To that river of souls tonight
