So we go down to the red to the river
Dig our hands deep in the banks of the sand
Loose all the black of the souls buried there
Forgive every man

Moving uptown, gonna clear the air
Moving uptown, then we’ll go everywhere

Buffalo flower
My queen of the plains
When the bully winds push on your shoulder
You show them who’s king

Oh, the man of the hour
Is another pretty young buck
Pinstripes and a tongue like a fresh cut flower
Promises sure to wither up
Oh my man, your hour’s up

So we’ll march up out the road out the valley
Build a town tall at the top of the hill
If we don’t start one foot in front of the other
We never will

Can’t change the weather
But we sure can change our shoes
Can’t change what we weather
But we can change what we do

Buffalo flower
My queen of the plains
When the bully winds push on your shoulder
You show them who’s king

Gonna do what I can right where I stand
I’m gonna do what I can
Gonna do what I can right where I stand
I’m gonna do what I can
Gonna do what I can right where I stand
I’m gonna do what I can
