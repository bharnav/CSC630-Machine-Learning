You’re not alone in anything
So listen up, my love
A tiny town can tear you down
But the right word can build you up

I know their razor blade names
Cut into your arms and opened your veins
And you think there’s nothing you could do
They haven’t already done to you

It’s hard enough in your bedroom calm
To fend off the hungry birds of prey
And it’s a fresh assault when the news comes on
Another one gone today

You study the lines in his face
He looked just like you, your story’s the same
Is there anything I could say
To make you stay

Love who you love
No matter what
No matter how hard it may come
And I promise you’ll be loved, my love
No matter what
You’re mightier than their sword-sharp tongues

Oh, I promise you are loved
Yes, I promise you are loved
So don’t give up

When you forget the words
I, I will sing them for you
When I forget the words
Will you sing them for me?

When you forget the words
I, I will sing them for you
When I forget the words
Will you sing them for me?

When you forget the words
I, I will sing them for you
When I forget the words
Will you sing them for me?

When you forget the words
I, I will sing them for you
