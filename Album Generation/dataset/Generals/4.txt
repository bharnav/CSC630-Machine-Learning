Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just a minute longer
I got, I got your back
I promise to keep you from going under

The walls, the walls caved in
And the sky came tumbling after
And the minute we thought we were out of the wreck
Came another great

Disaster, collision
All of the world is tearing at the seams
Disaster, division
What weâ€™re turning into I cannot say
I cannot say

The sky the sky turned black
And the sea the sea turned blacker
But I got, I got your back
I promise to keep you from going under
