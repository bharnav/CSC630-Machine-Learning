All along the avenues
The soldiers make their way
While lovers reap the revenue
Of a cold September day

Kiss me, darling kiss me
Like we'll never kiss again
And love me, won’t you love me
Like it’s our greatest revenge

No one knows how much it means
The pundit wars, rag magazines
Battle fronts and beauty queens
Making love in the headlines

I feel for all your progeny
How will they know what freedom means
When it’s forged to every cause and claim
On the fear assembly lines

Oh, the American machine
Oh, the American machine

What happened to our chivalry
Now pork is fed to the fattest beasts
And the women and the babies
Are starving on the ship

And the water’s coming in so fast
It's hard to know how long we’ll last
When you take in more than you give back
Oh, you’ll drown under the debt

Oh, the American greed
Oh, the American greed
It's not me
I'm gonna give what I can

Come, come feed the promise that’s inside of me
With a little love, we’ll raise a brand new army up
Of the surest doves with the hearts that gleam like golden guns
With nothing in their arsenal but love

I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love
I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love

I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love
I will sing, I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love

I will sing, I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love
I will sing, I'd give it all
I'd give it all for a legacy of love
