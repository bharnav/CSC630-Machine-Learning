She’s a radiator sister
Oh boys, I'll tell you what I mean
Her mind’s a nest of firecrackers
She needs to blow off some steam

I'll tell you right now
You will get burned
So watch out (ooh, ooh, ooh)

There’s a poison in the harbor
It’s looking deadly in the seas
And yet they're handing out blue ribbons
To the killing companies

I'll tell you right now
You will get burned
So watch out (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yes, I'll tell you right now
You will get burned
So watch out (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Radiator
Radiator
Radiator
Watch out

You're a radiator brother
You know exactly what I mean
You see ‘em dying in the breadlines
But turning profits on the street

They build the walls around each other
And keep the suburbs clean
But they cannot burn the bridges
Between you and me

I’ll tell you once more
You have been warned
So watch out (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yes, we’ll tell them once more
Karma comes 'round
So watch out (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Radiator
Radiator
Radiator
Radiator
Radiator
Radiator

Watch out
Watch out
Watch out
Watch out
