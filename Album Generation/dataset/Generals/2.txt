I need a political job in a blue collar town
So I can pay my rent
When the music is on, I get my best blood drawn
But I haven’t made a dollar yet

Haven’t I paid my dues?
Haven’t I paid my dues?
Haven’t I paid my dues yet?

Calling all my generals
My daughters
My revolutionists
We got strength in numbers
And they’re goin' to pay for it

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We burn the money in our homes
Oh our books and bones are breaking down so fast
But they keep putting all our cash
Into the next bloodbath
Honey, tell you I am sick of it

Haven’t I paid my dues?
Haven’t I paid my dues?
Haven’t I paid my dues yet?

Hey all my sisters (yeah)
What you want (love)
And all my brothers (yeah)
What you got (love)

You wanna fix it (yeah)
Or fuck it up
Come on fix it
'Cause it’s been fucked

Calling all my generals
My daughters
My revolutionists
We got strength in numbers
And they’re goin' to pay for it

Get your black boots on
Get your black boots on
Get your black, black, black boots on

Beat your marching drum
Beat your marching drum
Beat your marching drum

We’re gonna make 'em run
We’re gonna make 'em run
We’re gonna get 'em on the run

So get your warpaint on
So get your warpaint on
Let ‘em know we're out for blood
