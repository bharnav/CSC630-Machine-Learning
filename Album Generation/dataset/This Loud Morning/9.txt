Hold your tongue
Hold it tight
Or we'll be destined to fall, Like the sun did tonight
Leave it out, coz it might
Take the both of us down Before we get it right

Oh I know just what you're thinking
But if we ever let it go

I see us slipping away
Starting to fade
Crumbling down till we both hit the ground
You know if we never say
We'll never crash and burn
Coz love is a 4 letter word

Looking back, now I see
Seeing just how it feels to cause such misery
All I want is to keep this moment alive
Featuring you and me

And I know just what you're thinking
But if we ever let it go

I see us slipping away
Starting to fade
Crumbling down till we both hit the ground
You know if we never say
We'll never crash and burn
Coz love is a 4 letter word

I am afraid of losing all that we had now
A four letter word
It could all get ruined if it's ever said out loud

Slipping away
Starting to fade
Crumbling down till we both hit the ground
You know if we never say
We'll never crash and burn
Coz love is a 4 letter word

I see us slipping away
Starting to fade
Crumbling down till we both hit the ground
You know if we never say
We'll never crash and burn
Coz love is a 4 letter word

Coz love is a 4 letter word
