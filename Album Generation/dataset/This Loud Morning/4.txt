Stay
Tell me the story again
How it all fell apart in the end
Just when you thought you were too far gone
You're too far gone

Wait
Maybe the reasons dont fit
When did you lose innocence
And when did you find that you can't hold on
You can't hold on

When the whole world brings you down

When stars fall
And ground breaks
You're sinking
Coz it's too late
Don't tell me that it's over
Eventhough you're finding it hard to believe

Faith
It's easier said than done
When it's so hard to trust anyone
But maybe it's just a place inside
That you can hide

Wait
I can see us slipping away
Just stay with me

When the whole world brings you down

When stars fall
And ground breaks
You're sinking
Coz it's too late
Don't tell me that it's over
Eventhough you're finding it hard to believe
Eventhough you're finding it hard to believe

When the whole world brings you down
When the whole world brings you down
When the whole world brings you down
When the whole world brings you down

When stars fall
And ground breaks
You're sinking
Coz it's too late
I'm right here
I'm right here
Just stay with me

When stars fall
And ground breaks
You're sinking
Coz it's too late
Don't tell me that it's over
Eventhough you're finding it hard to believe

When stars fall
And ground breaks
You're sinking (Just stay with me)
Coz it's too late
Don't tell me that it's over
Eventhough you're finding it hard to believe
