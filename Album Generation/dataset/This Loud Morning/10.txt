Paint another picture black and blue
Take another moment, one or two
Just to get over you

When did all the gold around us rust?
Turning all the love we had to dust
It took the best of you
It took the best of you

Oh I've got nowhere to hide
I'd say my goodbye to the girl
I'm leaning on the edge
I'm jumping off the ledge

Take another picture off the wall
Just another moment, watch it fall
Into the ocean blue

Take a look at where we used to be
Now I'm just a vessel lost at see
I can't get over you
I don't know what to do

Oh I've got nowhere to hide
I'd say my goodbye to the girl
I'm leaning on the edge
I'm jumping off the ledge
Watching the night do what the light never could

So tell me I'm crazy
It's not gonna save me
From holding my breath
'Til the lines burn

'Cause I've got nowhere to hide
I'd say my goodbye to the girl
Oh, goodbye to the girl

Paint another picture black and blue
Take another moment, one or two

Oh I've got nowhere to hide
I'd say my goodbye to the girl
I'm leaning on the edge
I'm jumping off the ledge
Watching the night do what the light never could

So tell me I'm crazy
It's not gonna save me
From holding my breath
'Til the lines burn

'Cause I've got nowhere to hide
I'd say my goodbye to the girl
And goodbye to the world

Oh, goodbye to the world
