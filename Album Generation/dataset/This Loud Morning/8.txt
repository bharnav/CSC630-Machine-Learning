I can feel in the evening air all the words I want to say
But I can tell as you turn to leave that they wouldn't make you stay
Overhead the lights come on and suddenly I see
That glow is gonna guide you home wherever that may be

What use is a paper heart, when you're stuck in the rain, stuck in the rain
'Cause all the love that I hold inside; feel it washin' away, washin' away
Let it fall, take it all, 'cause I'm so tired of feelin' everything
So damn me and my paper heart in this pouring rain

I could watch as you fade away, but I hold on to the pain
In these arms that just let you go; on these lips that said your name
Couldn't know it would hurt this hard to hear you close that door

So punch a hole in my paper heart 'cause I don't need it anymore

What use is a paper heart, when you're stuck in the rain, stuck in the rain
'Cause all the love that I hold inside; feel it washin' away, washin' away
Let it fall, take it all, 'cause I'm so tired of feelin' everything
So damn me and my paper heart in this pouring rain

'Cause all the love that I hold inside; feel it washin' away...

What use is a paper heart, when you're stuck in the rain, stuck in the rain
'Cause all the love that I hold inside; feel it washin' away, washin' away
Let it fall, take it all, 'cause I'm so tired of feelin' everything
So damn me and my paper heart in this pouring rain
