Give me one more quiet night
Before this loud morning gets it right and does me in
Does this story have an ending?
Cause I’m needing to escape
And kill the blinding lights of day to try again
Close my eyes and start descending

CHORUS
I, I can’t seem to find a way back inside
Every last thought of love we made
That still keeps me awake, still keeps me from everything we had
That I’m trying to get back
Trying to get back

We keep floating towards the floor
Still in this pattern, nevermore of sink or swim
But the oxygen is proving more than words could ever say
To put these memories away
So this is it
These rapid eyes will keep on moving
These rapid eyes will keep on moving

CHORUS
Cause I, I can’t seem to find a way back inside
Every last thought of love we made
That still keeps me awake; still keeps me from everything we had
That I’m trying to get back
That I’m trying to get back

(That I’m trying to get back)
(Trying to get back)
Give me one more quiet
Before this loud morning gets it right and does me in

Is this story worth forgetting?

CHORUS
Cause I, I can’t seem to find a way back inside
Every last thought of love we made
That still keeps me awake; still keeps me from everything we had
That I’m trying to get back
Trying to get back
Trying to get back
Trying to get back

(Mayday)
(Somebody save me)
(Mayday)
(Somebody save me)
