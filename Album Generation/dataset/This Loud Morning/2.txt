In the night
We're all looking for a guiding light
We're all seeking something more than right
It must be there

Every day
We're all trying to find a better way
We're all hoping for someone to say
We're almost there

We believe
There's a reason that we're all here
That every doubt will disappear
We believe

In a time
And if we hit a wall that we can't climb
And if we stumble at the finish line
We'll start again

Everyone
Every single person under the sun
Has a moment where they know they won
But until then

We believe
There's a reason that we're all here
That every doubt will disappear
We believe

We believe
That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through
We believe

In the power of hope
In the strength of peace
There's a way back home
Where the battles cease
Under one we'll grow
If we just believe
This is what we know
This is what we know

We believe
That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through
We believe
That there's a reason we're all here
And every doubt will disappear
We believe
We believe
That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
