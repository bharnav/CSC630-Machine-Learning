I never thought I'd see myself down here
In the same damn place
With the different year
Well the lines on my face
Never looked so clear
I swear

You were six feet in
On a one way street
When you gave me the love
With my heart on the sleeve
In a world full of pearls
And an endless sea
You were all that needed
All I needed

Time marches on
Right or wrong
Never waits for no one new
Can't turn it off
We'll make it through
Cause time marches on without you

If you knew then what
You know right now
Would you've packed your bags
And left this town
Cause I'm still here
With my heart on the ground
This was the last thing I needed
All I needed

Time marches on
Right or wrong
Never waits for no one new
Can't turn it off
We'll make it through
Cause time marches on without you

I never thought I'd see myself down here
In the same damn place with the different year

Time marches on
Right or wrong
Never waits for no one new
Can't turn it off
We'll make it through
Cause time marches on without you

Time marches on without you
Time marches on, I know
Time marches on without you
