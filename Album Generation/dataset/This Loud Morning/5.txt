This is no escape
This is no surrender
My dear
This is my parade
My happy ever after
Only if you're here
When I'm lost and broken

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own
I know I'm not alone
Let me in your heart
Right where you stand
Take me as I am

We can take tonight
And make it last forever
If you dare
Ooh, we can run away
Take the world together
Only if you care
With these words unspoken

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own
I know I'm not alone
Let me in your heart
Right where you stand
Take me as I am

Give a second chance
We can take tomorrow
Make it better, you and me
Give me one more try
Before we say goodbye
Right here in this moment
Here forever
Everyday

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own
I know I'm not alone
Let me in your heart
Right where you stand
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
