Everyone was watching you
As everything just slipped away
And all they ever wanted was the light you gave them

You've always been the sweetest song
And even when the world went wrong
You never let the sun go down and fall to pieces
And I can never walk away with you here

If the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side

I can see the way you hide
All the things you keep inside
But all you ever wanted was the light to save you
We could run away somehow
Take the night and tear it down
Never let the stars burn out and fall to pieces
Nothing's going to stop us now
Cause we were born to live forever

If the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side

And times will always change
The wings will always break
And I will be here waiting over time
Forever by your side
Our love will never die

And if the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
And I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side
I'm on your side
