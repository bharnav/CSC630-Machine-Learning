[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in
Peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or
Will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave
