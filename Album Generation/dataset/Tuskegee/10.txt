[Verse 1]
I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain, aoh
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can, aoh
See I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah

[Chorus] [x2]
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

[Verse 2]
Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, oh, no

[Chorus] [x2]

[Bridge]
I want to be high, so high
I want to be free to know the things I do are right
Yeah, I want to be free, just me, oh, babe

[Chorus] [x8]
