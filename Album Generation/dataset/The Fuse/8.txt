Is there a reason for all your lies?
Your hatred and deceit
Reflected in your eyes
All the things you said
All the hate you bred
It's all trapped inside your feeble head
One thing that you should know
There's strength in numbers
And we're starting to grow
Face off tempers grow short
The noose is getting tighter
And you better abort
Mayhem is our middle name we're
Getting sick and tired
Of society's game
Vengeance is ours to know
We're taking to the streets
Gonna take control
They say they won't listen to me
All these years I struggled to be free
They say they don't like my ways
Now's the time for retribution
It starts today
Stand up today last chance
Don't try to turn your back on me
Are you the keepers of all our lives?
You prey and mistreat
We wait for your demise
Dishonest path you've led
Through all the blood you've shed
Excuses that you state
Will help us seal your fate
We're getting sick and tired
Of all your lies
When the fuck will you realize
That things are destined for change
You've been fucking long enough with our brains
Now it's time to feel our pain
Your retribution it starts today
