[Verse 1]
Within all of us is the instinct to survive
And to win at any cost
In the fight to stay alive
We fear the foreign cultures
That are different from our own
And make enemies from strangers
Who are just people we don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
We fight amongst ourselves
We obliterate ourselves yeah, yeah
We fight amongst ourselves
We obliterate ourselves yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And we compete until we die
Even though we don't know why
We believe in ancient lies
We compete until we die

[Verse 2]
We struggle against each other
To get things in life we need
And even more to give us the status
Which in return will help us breed
We separate ourselves by the color of our skin
And the country where we're born
And which god we believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
We fight amongst ourselves
We obliterate ourselves yeah, yeah
We fight amongst ourselves
We obliterate ourselves yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And we compete until we die
Even though we don't know why
We believe these ancient lies
We compete until we die

[Bridge]
And we compete until we die
We believe these ancient lies
If we could only change our minds
Maybe then we'd all survive

[Chorus]
And we compete until we die
Even though we don't know why
We believe these ancient lies
We compete until we die
