Make way for the next sensation
Factual Manipulation
Stay tuned for the next creation
Department of misinformation
Arrogance that makes you shiver
Ignorance and we deliver
If truth doesn't count fo something
I choose to believe in nothing
It's primetime for the middle class
You don't like it shove it up your ass
Fair and balanced prejury
And it's all on Fox TV
Delusion will rule day in this society
Intellectual property in bankruptcy
And you can't escape
We've been sold out we can get out
Lies sold tragedy all on your TV
Fabricated Journalism
Junk News and Jingoism
Media's our new religion
The pulpit is your television
Got news and we're comin' at ya
Network TV propaganda
Our credibility is degrading
We're patriots for Nielsen ratings
