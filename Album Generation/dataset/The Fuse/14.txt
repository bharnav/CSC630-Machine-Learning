Glad you're in America, there's hatred everywhere
Those people always judge a book, but no one seems to care
We all want all the luxuries, a car, a house, a home
We wanna save society, but leave our guns alone

We came into a risk house, we want our basic rights
Pissed at all our neighbors, you're settling for a fight
Try to find the reasons we're getting all the wrong
If you all agree with me, you'll help me sing it

So it's all lies
We all believe American lies
We won't give up, we're livin' in lies
Salute the flag and puppet your lie
Suck it up, you're livin in a lie

Rifle in America, but co-eds, they don't care
But if your reel is tall enough, just drink, you never care
The laws have all been rigged now, they help the middle class
You let the money sit and have 'em never payin' tax

It's hard to tell your children the truth, our youth are fucked
The pay your boxx is makin' just comes and views the ride
So work your whole life faithfully, just tryna get ahea
Don't drain all of your bank accounts until you're finally dead

So it's all lies
We all believe American lies
We won't give up, we're livin' in lies
Your uncle chance is claimin' two lives
Suck it up, you're livin in a lie

Glad you're in America, there's hatred everywhere
Those people always judge a book, but no one seems to care
We all want all the luxuries, a car, a house, a home
We wanna save society, but leave our guns alone

We came into a risk house, we want our basic rights
Pissed at all our neighbors, you're settling for a fight
Try to find the reasons we're getting all the wrong
If you all agree with me

You must believe American lies
You must believe American lies
We all believe American lies
Enough to make a pessimist cry
Suck it up, you're livin in a lie
