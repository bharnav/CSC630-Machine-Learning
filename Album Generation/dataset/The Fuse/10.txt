Just too much information
Electronic Stimulation
All this media saturation
Just gives me more aggravation
Gather round your television
Micro waving our religion
Download RAM and Gigabytes
Won't let computers run my life
Wanna Disconnect
I wanna break free
I wanna cut off the umbilical
Electronic Leash
Unplug my phone
Wanna blow up my screen
Don't wanna hear all the lies
And the lines they're selling to me
I wanna break free
Got a virus I'm infected
Gonna cut off my connection
Tendrils tied up misdirection
Come and witness my defection
Data counting our destruction
Suicidal file corruption
The Revolution's Wireless
