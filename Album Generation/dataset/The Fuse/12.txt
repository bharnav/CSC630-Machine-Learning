I'm headed for the top now
You can't bring me down
I'm searching for something
In life that can't be found
If you got the answers
Then I got the questions
Unlock the mystery
Life's too short now for mediocrity
My mind still struggles
Through strife and adversity
Its' all or nothing now
It's so plain to see
I'm gonna live for me
Cause I'm doing the best I can
I'm part of the master plan
One day at a time
As the fire burns inside
The clock is ticking
Now my time is almost out
I'm getting sick and tired
Of being knocked around
Wasted days pile up with wasted lives
It's not the end for me
It's so hard to be
Trapped in a tragedy
Life is certain but death
It can set you free
It's all or nothing now
It's so plain to see
It's just the start for me
