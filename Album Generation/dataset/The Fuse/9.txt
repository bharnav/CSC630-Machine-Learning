Hate breeds hate that's what they say
Ignore the noise and find a better way
But indecision clouds your mind
As the reason linger deep inside
Penance for a single day
To sit and rot or come out winning
Salutations fight to be
On the boundary lines
Of the world we live in
War - in the eyes
Deplore - Masterminds
Restore - All the presence
Of the world we live in
Shine - Through the sirens
Despite - Thieving tyrants
Insight - Roads to Highlands
In the world we live in
Terminate their right to be
Polarized lies of the fascist sleaze
Lining up the shadowed gaze
Beheaded for a shallow grave
Whoring in complacency
The gilded cries can't make you see
Landing on your dying breath
Your ignorance intact till death
Dying in the world
In the world we live in
