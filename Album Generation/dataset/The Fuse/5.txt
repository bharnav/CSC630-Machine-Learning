This is no way to live a life
The urban planning genocide
We have no hope or civic pride
They don't care if we live or die
It's not fair when you start with nothing
Your life feels done just before it starts
We're just trying to believe in something
6th avenue nightmare
And our fate is set
6th avenue nightmare
What you see is what you get
Another day in living hell
It's street life or a prison cell
The violence a cry for help
The cycle will repeat itself
