You can see it comn' it happens everyday
Millions of people millions of faces
All lost in the fucking fray
But I'm gonna keep on tryin'
Why you people keep on dyin'?
Standing on the brink of insanity
Tell me who you wanna be
Hey the kids are losin' it
My mind you're abusin' it
They can believe what they wanna believe
Trapped in their misery
Hey it's waste of time
Hey I'm losing my mind
Count me out of your misery
I'm never givin' up cause I am free
Not gonna change just to fit your ways
Not gonna listen to the things you say
I've got my own reality
Not buying into your conformity
Not give me shit for trying
Why do people keep on dying
Standing on the brink of insanity
Tell me who you wanna be
I am free from the chains
That are holding you down
So your rules don't apply to me
Your rules don't apply to me
Trapped in your apathy
Comply now you can see
I won't fit into your conformity
We're gonna rise above
