I am taking a big new look around
I was once so lost but now I am so found
A victim of circumstance
Just give me one more chance
Let me right my wrong
And I'll be moving on
They say you can't make a difference
That you can't make a change
It's a cruel cruel world
Full of hate and lies
And it's time to re-arrange
It seems to me if you take your time
And open up your eyes
The truth will come out
Like a flood of tears
Burning through your mind
Think of all the things your missing
Take a look around at what may be
Think of all the things your missing
Could Be!
We can do better, better if we try
The walls that block our path
Are the stepping stones of life
Defeat is in the past
This struggle will not last
Take stock of your life
It's time to get it right
This is not the end
Time heals time and again
