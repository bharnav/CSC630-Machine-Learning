If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll have more fun baby all way down the line
If you've got the money honey I've got the time

Ain't no need to tarry let's start out tonight
We'll have fun oh boy oh boy and we will do it it right
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the time

Let's go honky tonkin' make every spot in town
We'll go to the park where it's dark we won't fool around
If you run short of money I'll run short of time
You got no more money honey I've got no more time

If you've got the money I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
