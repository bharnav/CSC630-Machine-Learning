I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Oh Lord, I thought I would die
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful girl
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She don't care about me
Lord, I've tried and I've tried to keep her satisfied
But she just couldn't stay
But now that she is leavin', this is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Oh Lord, I thought I would die
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues
I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues
