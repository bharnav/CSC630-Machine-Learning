Don't be concerned for it's time I learned
Those who play with fire get burned
I'll be alright in a little while
You'll be permanently lonely

Don't be too quick to pity me
Don't salve my heart with sympathy
I'll be alright in a little while, in a little while
You'll be permanently lonely

The world looks on in wonder and pity at your kind
For it knows the future
Is not very pretty for your kind, for your kind

Will always be runnin' and wonderin'
What happened to hearts you've broken and left all alone
We'll be alright in a little while
You'll be permanently lonely
Runnin' lonely
