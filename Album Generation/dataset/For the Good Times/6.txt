There's a foul owl on the prowl tonight

Hey, little lark, get outta the dark
Foul owl on the prowl
Hey little jay, stay out of his way
Foul owl on the prowl
You just might be the quail he'll tail
Foul owl on the prowl
You just might be the swallow he'll follow
Foul owl on the prowl

If you hear him hoot, scoot
If you pass his tree, flee
If you catch his eye, fly
Don't wait to say goodbye

He's got a yen for a purty little hen
Foul owl on the prowl
He's hungry for a chick, so get home quick
Foul owl on the prowl

If you hear him hoot, scoot
If you pass his tree, flee
If you catch his eye, fly
Don't wait to say goodbye

He's got a yen for a purty little hen
Foul owl on the prowl
He's hungry for a chick, so get home quick
Foul owl on the prowl
Foul owl on the prowl
Foul owl on the prowl
Foul owl on the prowl
Foul owl on the prowl
Foul owl on the prowl
