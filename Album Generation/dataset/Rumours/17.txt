[Intro]
Oh, Daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I don’t understand why

[Chorus 1]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there’s been a fool around
It’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me

[Chorus 2]
Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You’re letting me know
You’re the best thing in my life

[Chorus 1]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there’s been a fool around
It’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me

[Chorus 3]
Why are you right when I’m so wrong?
(So wrong)
I’m so weak but you’re so strong (ooh)
(never so strong)
Everything you do is just alright
And I can’t walk away from you baby, if I tried

Why are you right when I’m so wrong?
(So wrong)
I’m so weak but you’re so strong (ooh)
(never so strong)
Everything you do is just alright
And I can’t walk away from you baby, if I tried

[Chorus 2]
Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You’re letting me know
You’re the best thing in my life

[Chorus 1]
Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there’s been a fool around
It’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me

[Outro]
Yes, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
