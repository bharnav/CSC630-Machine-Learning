No One Survives

You cut me back down to size
Whenever you decide
Can barely stand the sight
Of your plastic grin against the light
With a forceful hand we collide
No one refrains,no one survives
No one survives justified

If you're looking to tell it all
And save your soul-
I know what you can do
You can start by letting me in-
So we can begin
To mend these salted wounds

You sacrifice-you sacrifice
And if we bleed-it's justified

And I can't look into your face
It's been harder than you know
And I can't find a single place
That these demons haven't shown

So go to sleep-I need to be alone
Don't ya, don't ya wanna tell someone
What you have done-And get it off your chest?
How long can you carry this load
Until it explodes in your f**king face

We sacrifice-we sacrifice
And if we bleed-it's justified
We sacrifice-we sacrifice
And if we bleed-it's justified

We sacrifice-lift yourself off that shelf
We sacrifice-did your best and made this mess
And it's justified-lift yourself off that shelf
And it's justified-did your best and made this mess
