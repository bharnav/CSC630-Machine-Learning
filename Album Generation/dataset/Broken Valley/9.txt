Day he died
-----------

Dear son, daddy's never coming back home
He's passed on, claim him as one of your own
My mind's numb, nothing has been clearer than this
They found him on the rug at the golden gate inn
And i know, papa never intended for this
To drag me, down into this bottomless pit
I've been given just about all i can chew
I think back on love's empty truth

And i feel like the day he died
I feel like the day he died

Walked in, cops talking standing around
I kneeled down, his body lying there on the ground
I begged please please let me get a minute with him
And they said, don't touch anything kid
It smelt like life just exit the room
I cried to the shell of a man I once knew
My head's spinning way, out of control
I can't believe its been three long, years ago

And i feel like the day he died
I feel like the day he died

-solo-

And i feel like the day he died
I feel like the day
And i feel like the day he died
I feel like the day

Dear son, daddy's never coming back home
I've gone wrong, wish i had the strength to live on
I can't breathe, is there any air left in here
I can't believe, everything i hold disappears
It's gone on, time and time again i'm alone
And dear son, daddys never coming back home

And i feel like the day he died
And i feel like the day he died
And i feel like the day he died
