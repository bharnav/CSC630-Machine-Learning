The calm that disturbs you!!
You don't think I've done a thing for you It's ok it's ok
And you drag yourself about
You creep along, along you creep anyway It's ok
And the awakening storm that breaks
There's nothing more I can say I can say

See my heart I'm down on my knees I turn to shit I think I'm broken
See my heart I'm down on my knees I turn to shit I think I'm broken

Let it go - Let it go to God
What we What becomes of us
Let it go Let it bleed to God
Run
Let it all, let it all run dry
What we What becomes of us
And I need to go outside

Cold and unhappy
Kiss my falling tears Falling tears in my soul
The smell of sweat and blood
Is what I see Is crawling back In my head In my head

See my heart I'm down on my knees I turn to shit I think I'm broken
See my heart I'm down on my knees I turn to shit I think I'm broken

Let it go - Let it go to God
What we What becomes of us
Let it go Let it bleed to God
Run
Let it all, let it all run dry
What we What becomes of us
And I need to go outside

Let it go - Let it go to God
What we What becomes of us
Let it go Let it bleed to God
Run
Let it all, let it all run dry
What we What becomes of us
Let it go Let it bleed to God
