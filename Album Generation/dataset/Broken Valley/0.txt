Willing to start again
Willing to give another try
Willing to pretend but still so dead
Willing to comprehend
Willing to give up all my pride
Willing to forget but still so dead

And it's starting to take its toll
And it's starting to unwind
But the quicker that things unfold
The quicker that they subside
And writings on the wall
But the walls have all come down
If you can't see past the truth
I love to let you
Down...

Willing to walk again
Willing to step back in the light
Willing to forget but still so dead
Willing to turn my head
Willing to let my feelings slide
Willing to befriend but still so dead

And it's starting to take its toll
And it's starting to unwind
But the quicker that things unfold
The quicker that they subside
And writings on the wall
But the walls have all come down
If you can't see past the truth
I love to let you
Down...

And it's complicated
And it's complicated
Everything that I've known
What was up is now down
And its overrated
And its over rated
Everything that I know
And I love to let you...
I love to let you...

And it's starting to take its toll
And it's starting to unwind
But the quicker that things unfold
The quicker that they subside
And writings on the wall
But the walls have all come down
If you can't see past the truth
I love to let you
Down...

And I'm willing to start again
To give it another try
I'm willing to start again
