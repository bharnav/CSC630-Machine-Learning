Deathbed-I bled-downhearted

Don't toss me out like your last cigarette
I'm of your own
Bled my way up from under it
Trying to fill that hole
But down ya go...

Hold me brother
Take your finger off the trig-
Let it go-OH let it go
If you don't stop shaking
Soon you will be taking it off-taking it off
So hold me brother
Take your finger off the trigger

Don't feel like you need to leave because
You disappointed us all
Self-esteem has clipped your and now
You try and catch your fall
But down ya go

Hold me brother Take your finger off the trig-
Let it go-OH let it go
If you don't stop shaking
Soon you will be taking it off-taking it off
So hold me brother
Take your finger off the trig
Let me know-OH let me know
If you don't stop shaking
Soon you will be taking it off

Hold me-let it go
