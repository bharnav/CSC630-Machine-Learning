JUNK SICK
I was beating my head in, head in Against the wall
I was beating my brains dead, brains dead Against it all Junk Sick
Just here for the cure And I'd spit into his eyes, his eyes When he was out on bail Man
I've done a lot of time waiting Time waiting But you failed me Junk Sick(DEAD)
Don't get me wrong Junk Sick(DEAD) Just here for the cure Junk sick Don't get me wrong
I was beating my head in Against the wall I was beating my brains dead Against it all
