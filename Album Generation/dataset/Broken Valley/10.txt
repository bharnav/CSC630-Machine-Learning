BROKEN VALLEY

You came to me with this and now I've been robbed
I bit off my fingertips and why'd I even get involved
Gave all i had to give but that wasn't good enough but that wasn't good enough
Lift yourself off that shelf you're not in this alone no matter how hard you fall
Swallowed all your razor blades so you could do no harm accepted all the blame and tell me where did we go wrong?
And tell me where did we go wrong
No matter how hard you did your bestand made this mess
Ignored it all alone this broken valley's a part of us all gave all i gave all i had to give
