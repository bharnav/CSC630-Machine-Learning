JUSTIFIED
If you're looking to tell it all And save your soul I know what you can do You can start by letting me in So we can begin To mend these salted wounds You Sacrifice You Sacrifice And if we bleed It's Justified And I can't look into your face It's been harder than you know And I can't find a single place That these demons haven't shown So go to sleep I need to be alone Don't ya,don't ya wanna tell someone What you have done-And get it off your chest? How long can you carry this load until it explodes in your f**king face
We Sacrifice We Sacrifice And if we bleed It's Justified We Sacrifice We Sacrifice And if we bleed It's Justified We Sacrifice Lift yourself off that shelf We Sacrifice Did your best and made this mess And it's Justified Lift yourself off that shelf And it's Justified Did your best and made this mess
