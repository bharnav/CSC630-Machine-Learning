Wicked Ways

Sooner or later-I thought that a savior
Would come to save us all
It seems that he left us-to fend for ourselves
Just to try to make us strong
How can I face another day
Knowing he's done me wrong

Should've known what those wolves have wanted
Never told-but I tried-I tried
All they stole left me brokenhearted
They left me there-To die

Seein's believing-
Don't know what I'm feeling
Don't know who I am anymore
I tried to embrace it-but fell on my face-it's
Been laughing at me all along
All ends are frayed-and I've been betrayed scarred to the bone

Sooner or later-I thought that a savior
Would come to save us all
I'm not afraid of wicked ways
Knowing he's done me wrong
