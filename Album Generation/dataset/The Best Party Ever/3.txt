I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin at the stars
I've always been in love with you

I look tough enough
But if you hold me up to the light
You can see my broken heart
I've always been in love with you

They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
Paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way i do

Nothing stays the same
I wish i could remain the color
Of the cherry blossom tree
I've always been in love with you

I always used to leave before I went to sleep
But now I just pass out watching TV
I've always been in love with you

They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way i do

Just be careful when you shine
Because if you throw a light
On something magical
It disappears

Paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do

I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin at my scars
I've always been in love with
