Pushing through the topsoil
I'm blinking in the light
Shading my eyes from the morning sun
I just wish that I could still
See the world sometimes
The way I saw the world when I was young

Sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow

Sometimes it gets lonely
Being valiantly alone
Sometimes I wish I was there with you
I get sad just thinking
Of all the little things
I never ever had the heart to do

Sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow

If I looked out of a
Different window would the
Snow still fall as beautiful?
