Patience, I will be finding myself
You thought, you thought I figured it out
I'm lost, more lost than I've ever been, than I've ever been
I never knew how gold would ever turn to this

Everything you could imagine
Is everything I have now
You only want the surface
Don't dare ever, pray for this again

Never pray, never pray again
I want to never pray, pray for this again

Who knew, who knew gold could turn to rust
Who knew, who knew gold was so worthless

It turned to rust, sharp torn and dead. x2

Surrounded by shimmering bricks, shimmering bricks
Only makes it lonelier in the end, in the end
Could this be it? x4

Everything you could imagine
Is everything I have now
You only want the surface
Don't dare ever, pray for this again

Never pray, never pray again
I want to never pray, pray for this again

Don't dare ever pray for this. x6

Never pray for this, don't dare, x3
Never pray for this
