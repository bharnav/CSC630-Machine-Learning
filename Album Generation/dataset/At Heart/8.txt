We won't wait for the sun to set, we found our way
On our dreams again, we found our way
We won't wait for life to pass us by, we found our way
It's time to live my friends

Here's no way to get back
A collision of direction
Got us here, it got us here

But where we are there is meaning. x2

Ask yourself who you are?
Who you are? x2
Who is going to remember?

We won't wait for the sun to set, we found our way
On our dreams again, we found our way
We won't wait for life to pass us by, we found our way
It's time to live my friends

Moments that will last forever
We had to lose ourselves to find our destiny
Home lost it's flame that we see
But this future, it burns so much brighter to me

We had to loose ourselves to find our way. x2

We won't wait for the sun to set, we found our way
On our dreams again, we found our way
We won't wait for life to pass us by, we found our way
It's time to live my friends
