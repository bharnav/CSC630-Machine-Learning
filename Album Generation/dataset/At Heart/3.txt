I haven't felt like I belonged in years
She tried to comeback with all her sorry tears
Can't believe that was my last chance for a new start
There's no pity for the ones, for the ones that leave you in the dark

Hey, x3
You are not alone, not alone
Hey, x3
For we are not alone

I've cried out for years. x3
I've cried out

Oh what a world it is when everything's gone
Motherless, fatherless
I'd rather have a heart than feel this cold emptiness, like you, like you

Oh what it is to have a heart in a world like this, world like this

This is what it's like, what it's like
Being on my own, on my own
Feeling like I've done no right, done no right
No one can love you having no heart

Where was the world when I cried out?
Where is the soul that you lost now?
When does it end?

Hey, x3
You are not alone, not alone
Hey, x3
For we are not alone

I've been the one in the crowd
With no one here to stand by my side
It's been like this for too damn long
Since the first day of my life. x3

Where was the world when I cried out?

Hey, x3
Where was the world when I cried out?
