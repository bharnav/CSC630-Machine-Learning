Fight!
I will fight for this
I will fight for what I worked for
Carry!
I can't carry your weight
Carry your weight anymore
Protect!
I've protected the family
Now I will protect myself
Give!
I have set you free
But what have you gave me

I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (For you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me (You're killing me)

Take!
You have taken it all
Taken everything I am
Push!
I've been pushed to the edge
I am never coming back
Break!
The way you broke my trust
And now I will break free of you
Faith!
There is no faith anymore
I have no faith in you

I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (For you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me

I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you finally recognize
I hope this makes you finally recognize
I hope you see this through my shattered eyes (My shattered eyes)
I hope this makes you finally recognize
I hope you see this through my shattered eyes

I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (For you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (Day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me (You're killing me)
