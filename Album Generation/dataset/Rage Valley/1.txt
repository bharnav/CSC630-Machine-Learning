[Intro - Sample]
Giant tropical centipedes share their territories with tarantulas
Despite its impressive length, it’s a nimble navigator
And some can be highly venomous
As quick as lightning, just like the tarantula it’s killing
The centipede has two curved, hollow fangs
Which inject paralyzing venom
Even tarantulas aren't immune from an ambush
This centipede is a predator…

Centipede!

Centipede!

Centipede!

Centipede!

Centipede!

Centipede!
