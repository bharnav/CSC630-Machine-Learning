[Verse 1]
Gone from your side
Break one lie
With a sigh (x2)
In your words
Burned since long
Seasons change as I wait

[Refrain]
Radiant radiate, all but here

[Verse 2]
Guiding light dims the dawn
Posed appease
Cause to seize
All the signs
Faith misled
Come the tide doubts subside

[Outro]
Lost in yourself
Empty words
Forsaken what used to be within me

Scars on your hands
From nails that are worn
Our loss resign in failure

[Coda]
Source of deceit
