[Verse 1]
Mechanized patterns, fed since birth method
Separate spirit, disconnect every end
Breeding a thought, relieving the soul I’m growing
Fragments of hope awake inside me
Consciousness failed, the path to control eroding
Originate repressive measures

[Chorus 1]
I’m the one the parasite’s sucking on
We’re the ones the parasite’s sucking on
Disconnect every end

[Verse 2]
Unnecessary meaningless device
Thought-controlled, programmed
Balanced walk on the line
Radiant light, expansive and bright, is covered
Swallow the lie, let them take over
Greed is a horde that comes like a storm and conquers
Strongly implying unfair methods

[Chorus 2]
I’m the one the parasite’s sucking on
You’re the one the parasite’s sucking on

[Bridge]
I have more than you (x3)
I need a lot to care for; I need a lot to slow me down
(I have more than you)(x2)
I need a lot to care for; I need a lot to hold you down
I will stand when things burn down

[Outro]
Never fought harder than this, I built my temple on this
Pushing, fighting, bleeding, taking, giving
Every second closer to the ceiling
I will assemble all this, down to the last broken piece
Tension in the atmosphere is lower, gravity is slowly taking over
