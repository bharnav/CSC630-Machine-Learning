[Verse 1]
I have discovered a canvas
Behind its colors, I forged my cell
Minions below release a dark glow and suddenly I see
That everyone is blind but me

[Verse 2]
I have discovered a canvas
Deep in a sea of disharmony
Cosmic embrace, a soulless portrait of endless synergy
Visions of moving away from me

[Chorus]
Concentrate don't lose your illusion;
Don't let them provide the solution
Your fate in your hands
Close your eyes from false shining lights
Made to confuse us all
Architectures of domination, society they call

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I have discovered a canvas
Using its colors I saw myself
Breaking the norm, induce a reform
Defying sanity bred in the care of my vanity

[Verse 4]
See them entirely abstract
Out of the orbit, we comprehend
Careful recall deficit in all, deliberately recede
Crescent of our analogy

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Concentrate don't lose your illusion;
Don't let them provide the solution
Your fate in your hands
Close your eyes from false shining lights
Made to confuse us all
Architectures of domination, society they call

(Call)(x24)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Don't let them fall; you'll join them all)
Close your eyes from false shining lights (x2)
(You'll see them fall; you'll see them fall)
Architectures of domination (x2)
Close your eyes from false shining lights (x2)
Architectures of domination (x2)
Close your eyes from false shining lights (x2)
Architectures of domination (x2)
