[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
There is a silhouette shaped as a human
Carrying death with a merciless scorn
Fed by ideals and doctrines of terror
Warrants his act with the crown of thorns

[Refrain]
And he is out there to take
Out there to separate
Out there to break us

[Verse 2]
Guided by voices perceived as their savior
They leave their refuge embracing hope
Some of them drown led astray by his pledges
Some of them hang from an undeserved rope

[Outro]
So you should stay away
See another day
Stay away now
Please won't you stay away
Claim another day
Stay away now
