[Verse 1]
Every day I will remind you to be there
Try to see the story pictured in your head
Calmest eyes when you are screaming
One thing lost another found to make sure you

[Pre-Chorus]
Carry on in case you'll be waiting
I will be moving on while you're contemplating

[Chorus 1]
There is nothing to escape from
Nothing left to try and mend
Every day without the sun
So you trace away then
There is reason lacking thereof
Reason there to comprehend
Every day another run
So you pave your way then

[Bridge]
Feed me with anything, I will see purpose in it too
I saw you planning on something I couldn't really do
Come clear I'm lingering, I am staying here for you
I am evolving to something I never thought I would

[Verse 2]
Feed me with anything, I will see purpose in it too
I saw you planning on something I couldn't really do
Tread on the greater I need to know the truth
I've learned the lessons and bring decisions back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Carry on in case you'll be waiting
I will be moving on while you're contemplating

[Chorus 2]
There is nothing to escape from
Nothing left to try and mend
Every day without the sun
So you trace away then

[Outro]
Carry on I know you'll be waiting
I will be moving on to where you'll be waiting
