[Verse 1]
I hear a dead note sounding
Among the tones of restlessness
A harmony confounding
A capture moving in distress

[Verse 2]
It keeps me chasing closure
Preventing me from finding peace
It holds me back from leaving
This vicious circle I am in

[Chorus]
I'm becoming what I thought
What I shouldn't be
What I fear the most
Let me stay here for a while
I depend on this
It's my only light

[Verse 3]
It feels like I have journeyed
For ages without getting there
The path of endless distance
The road of comforting despair

[Chorus](x2)
I'm becoming what I thought
What I shouldn't be
What I fear the most
Let me stay here for a while
I depend on this
It's my only light
