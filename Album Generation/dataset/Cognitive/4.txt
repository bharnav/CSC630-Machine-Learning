[Intro]
Everything, it's so quiet here
Seasons last, more than thousand years
Suddenly my vision is clear
Consciousness into clarity

[Verse 1]
I can hear echoes from the sea
Overwhelmed by tranquility
Radiance unfolds gradually
Every wound now begins to heal

[Chorus 1]
Take on my burden
Shake of my head
Chained by what I understand
Won't let me grow

[Verse 2]
New found sight
Opens up for each
Step into similarity
Void is all coming into reach
Mistakable familiarity

[Chorus 1]
Take on my burden
Shake of my head
Chained by what I understand
Won't let me grow

[Chorus 2]
Lay down my burden
Take all my years away
Release me within emptiness
And make me whole

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
There is a desire, there s a need of finding faith
I decide by painting it all in gray
Inner transformation turns a weakness into a strength
Through the times the spirit will remain

Tethered by restrictions of the way to be aware
All is gone the hindrance will fade away
Fundamentals separate transcending into where
Time that flows is neither night nor day

[Outro]
Every piece that we retrieve from covering our eyes
Dawns on us we cannot leave with everything inside
Every piece that we retrieve from covering our eyes
Dawns on us we cannot leave with everything inside
I will reach my hand and try to open up the sky
On my part, the reason why is stated in a lie
I will reach my hand and try to open up the sky
On my part, the reason why is stated in a lie
