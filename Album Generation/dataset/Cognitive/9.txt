[Intro]
I am not aware of all the reasons
I am not deciding the results
Sanctioned through the principles autonomously blessed
Moving clouds to get a clearer view

[Verse 1]
Misery is the key to all religion
Power is the key to every war
Time has taught me not to wait
What is mine I'll take
Eons of our past won't be returned
I was there to recognize the victim
Cold and dry our mother has been killed
Plundered by the greed of men aftermath descends
Our time is sliding out of reach

Oooh

[Chorus]
I don't even wanna try
To become the one
That will save your halo
Everything that I denied
Every time that I lied
Aware of our failure

[Verse 2]
I'm not gonna follow your decision
It is the position I retain
Everything once born will end
Ashes be your name;
Bury me to set me free of shame
This is not the dust that we once came from
What we are is how we will return
The sun is punishing our land, soil turns into sand
What we had in common has been cursed

[Refrain]
I try not to reveal the guilt breeding in me
You are the scythe harvesting what is not yours
Soon won't be there anymore

[Chorus](x2)
I don't even wanna try
To become the one
That will save your halo
Everything that I denied
Every time that I lied
Aware of our failure

[Bridge]
There's a new day
What we should share is noticed
What we inherited
The erasure of a life
Once so vital
Now dissected and dry
Throw the first stone
Then hide your hand
While pursuing your dream
Poisoning the essence of it all

[Outro]
I don't even wanna try
To become the one
That will save your halo
