[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Would you say anything, anything at all?
Would you share with me your innocence
What I need to seize the fall
I know to keep close to you
Know to keep near regardless if it's wrong
Now I'm tearing apart what I made for us
Dissembling to be strong

[Chorus 1]
You swore on your own
You set it in stone, your slithering
You silence your words
You're leaving, you bring it to your grave

[Bridge]
Waiting for reason to claim its place
Clearing the air I can see all the ways
It's my addiction that always is growing
And it scares me in my sober moments

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
You decide, close our distance
I destroyed you; undeservedly
You decide, close our distance
I assure you're undeserving of
