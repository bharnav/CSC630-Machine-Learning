There you stood, on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye, knowing that you'd gone

By the summer it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry

Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

I tried so hard to stand as I stumbled
And fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found, knowing it was gone

If I never lived without you
Now you know I'd die
If I never said I loved you
Now you know I'd try

Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe
