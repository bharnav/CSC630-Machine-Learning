Now look what I've done
It seems that I own some
As all it turn back now to see that
In all of of my fat lines
Upstaging a climaxing dream, yeah
'Cause

If it's all right
To be your good time boy
If it's all right
Be your good boy
If it's all right
To be your good time, boy
If it's all right
It's all right, yeah

Sock it to me, now now now

Why should I mind
If I step right out of line
And I get caught be her
Get caught my her, lucky me, yeah
'Cause now I've loved a few
That's why they call me
Call me "good old dude"
And I can't, I can't change right now
It seems, yeah

If it's all right
To be your good time boy
If it's all right
Be your good boy
If it's all right
To be your good time, boy
If it's all right
It's all right, yeah

Sock it to me now
Groove it on me now
You lay it on me now, ooh

Sock it to me now
If it's all right, be your boy
Be your boy
And it's all right
Be your boy
