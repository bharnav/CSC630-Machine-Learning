[Verse 1]
Listen to my bluebird laugh
She can't tell you why
Deep within her heart, you see
She knows only crying, just crying

[Verse 2]
There she sits, aloft a perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
Thinks only of you, just you, oh yeah

[Hook 1]
So get all those blues
Must be a thousand hues
And be just differently used
You just know

[Hook 2]
You sit there mesmerized
By the depth of her eyes
That you can't categorize
She got soul, she got soul
She got soul, she got soul

[Chorus]
Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Soon she's going to fly away
Sadness is her own
Give herself a bath of tears
And go home, and go home
