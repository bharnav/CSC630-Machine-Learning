Look what's happening to me
I'm going blind, please help
There I sat until three
Gettin' further behind myself
Bymyself

And I'm hung upside down. (x2)
Hung upside down, said I'm
Hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon
Hung upside down

Someday I will be free
And there'll be times, you just wait
I will come to you, see
What I'll bring you when I get straight
Oh it's too late

And I'm hung upside down. (x2)
Hung upside down, said I'm
Hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon
Hung upside down
