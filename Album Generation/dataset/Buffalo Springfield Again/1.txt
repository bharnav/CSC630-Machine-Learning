Well there goes another day
Now I wonder why
You and I
Keep telling lies
I can't believe that what you say
'cause tomorrows lullaby
Can't passify
My lonesome crying

Make believe is all you know
And to make believe is a game
A child's rein
You've changed your name
So sadly I watched the show
And see what you became
Truth is the shame
Yeah, too much pain

Well there goes another day
Now I wonder why
You and I
Keep telling lies
