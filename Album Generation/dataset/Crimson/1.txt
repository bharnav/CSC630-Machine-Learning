It's not just the pain, the pain in my back
That laughs in my face, my face every night
Or the poison that took my lungs
That keeps me from feeling warm

And how could a rooftop view in London
Look just the same as one in Brooklyn?
Nothing has changed, but now but now I fight with the words
And I can't see so good

And there's gotta be more, much more than this
I got pages of dreams, they're covered in piss
And the poison that took my soul
That keeps me from feeling anything

And how could a rooftop view in London
Look just the same as one in Brooklyn?
Nothing has changed, but now but now I fight with the words
And I can't see so good

And how could a rooftop view in London
Look just the same as one in Brooklyn?
Nothing has changed, but now but now I fight with the words
And I can't see so good

And now I fight with words
