Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
All head south, or what

Wait here, a month or two will pass
I'm sure I won't
Faith dear, enough to get you by
Until we're home

I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again

Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
All head south

I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
