In the corner of your eye
There's a little blinking light
It's a blinking light that you don't want to see

How much I miss you, if you could
Is it difficult to look
You could take the pill and just go back to sleep

Just keep on walking
It's like nothing touches me
And I see no evil
But there's plenty here to see
Just keep on walking in my sleep

I see the look and it gets too much
Well you can just tune out
And if the mirror reflects too much
Well you can just tune out

And if the picture gets too sharp
Well you can just tune out
And if you ever regret your part
Then you can just tune out

In the belly of the beast
In the belly of the beast
There's a blinking light that you don't want to see

As you look to look away
Learn to see it but to not engage
Well it's just another picture on the screen

Ideal plans are gonna light your way
If you don't wanna wake

I see the look and it gets too much me
Well you can just tune out
And if the mirror reflects too much
Well you can just tune out

And if the picture gets too sharp
Well you can just tune out
And if you ever regret your part
Then you can just tune out

We do hear now
We do speak now
So we did it and looked away

We do hear now
We do speak now
So we did it and looked away
So we did it and looked away
So we did it and looked away
So we did it and looked away
