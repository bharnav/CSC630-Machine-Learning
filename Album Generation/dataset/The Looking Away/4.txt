[Verse 1]
Same channel on a different day
Only going through the same mistakes again
Now I'm feelin' like a skipping disc
It is something that I don't know what it's

I hope sooner I'll have reached the end
One blink and a look to start again
It's like stepping on a spining wheel
I keep turning 'till I don't know what to feel

I'm feelin' like skipping disc
I feel something but I don't know what it is
It's like I'm moving but I get nowhere
I keep on turning and I am right back here again
It's like I'm moving but I get nowhere
It's just an echo out in the air, oooooh ooooh oh

Same city in a different place
It's like a second that cannot seem to break
It's like stepping on a spinning wheel
I keep turning 'till I don't know what to feel

I'm feelin' like a skipping disc
I feel something but I don't know what it is
It's like I'm moving but I get nowhere
I keep pretending that I am right back here again
It's like I'm moving but I get nowhere
I keep pretending that I am right back here again
It's like I'm moving but I get nowhere
It's just an echo out in the air, oooooh ooooh oh

The serpent meets its tail
And I only hear myself repeating
And my heart says something else
I can only hear myself repeating, oooooh ooooh oh
