Colder...
On your face
Outlines start too to fade
To watch your fingers melted into the air
When minutes you have been through
And next thing wasn't there

Straw man blown away
Straw man blown away

Older and have been implaced
Pieces are falling away
To watch and spill them
Floating into the air
When minutes you have been through
And next thing disappear

Straw man blown away
Straw man blown away

You ..... ..... ..... .....
Empty as the branches
You .... ..... .....  no fear
You ..... ..... ..... .....
Empty as the branches
You ... .... .... .... .....

Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuuuuu

Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuu
Uuuu Uuuu Uuuuuuu
