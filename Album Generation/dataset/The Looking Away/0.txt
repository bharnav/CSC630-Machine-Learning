[Verse 1]
I even see you when my eyes are closed
The television screen when everything must go
I dreamt this coming when I saw the wave
I dreamt that everything we built was swept away

And all of England made the sound

And it all got swept away
And all the idiots say (And it all got swept away)
And it's underneath the wave (And it all got swept away)
And
And it all got swept away (3x)
Underneath the wave

And all the bottles at the beach washed out
I dreamt of plastic ones of colored painted cups
And felt as hollow as an empty can
I wanna wake up, but I just don't think I can

And, oh, my heart is filling up

And it all got swept away
And all the innocence (All got swept away)
Underneath the wave (And it all got swept away)
And it's underneath the wave
And it all got swept away (3x)
Underneath the wave

You and I just holding hands
As the wave takes back the land
Hold me closer and I will wait
Don't let go

Cause everything must go

And it all got swept away
And all the idiots say (And it all got swept away)
And it's underneath the wave (and it all got swept away)
And it all got swept away (3x)
And it's underneath the wave
