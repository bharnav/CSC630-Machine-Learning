[Verse 1]
I want it forever
Just want to be here
The sooner the better
As long as you're near

And your heart holds us together
And it all starts here
With these white sparks when we're together
It's all so clear

You are not alone
Fire's already
Dancing in your eyes
Notes just lighting up the dark
Simmering in gold
Stars collapsing
Watching them explode
Like fireworks in your eyes

'Cause when we're together
Whenever you're near
I want it forever
I want to be here

These white sparks when we're together
It all starts here
These white sparks when we're together
It's all so clear

You are not alone
Fire's already
Dancing in your eyes
Notes just lighting up the dark
Simmering in gold
Stars collapsing
Watching them explode
Like fireworks in your eyes
