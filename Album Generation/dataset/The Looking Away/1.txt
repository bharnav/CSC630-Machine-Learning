[Verse 1]
Any place, any time
You could be mine
Any night, any day
Anything we say (anything we say)

[Chorus]
You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
We can just stare away

You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
If they all look away

[Verse 2]
Any place, any time
Anything we like
Any case, any cause
Anything we want (anything we want)

[Chorus]
You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
We can just stare away

You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
If they all look away (only if they look away)

[Bridge]
So let's look at this hand, but
Not at this one
So let's look at this hand, but
Not at what we've done
So let's look at this hand, but
Not at this one
So let's look at this hand, but
Not at this one

[Chorus]
You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
We can just stare away

You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
If they all look away (only if they look away)

You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
We can just stare away (only if they look away)

You can get away with it
I can get away with anything
If they all look away (only if they look away)
