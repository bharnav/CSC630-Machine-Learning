[Verse 1]
Eyes, they cannot focus
Hands are making trails in front of you
From loving you

Smiles you don't notice
Lips are out of sync
Now I feel everything at once

Everything at once

Eyes, they cannot focus
Room is spinning out
Around me

Time is getting closer now
I must be coming home
'Cause I feel

'Cause I feel
Everything at once
Everything at once
Everything at once
Everything at once

I feel every little thing at once
Every little thing at once
All the many and the one

All the many and the one
It's like the beating of a drum
It's like the beating of a drum

And all the friends that I'm among
I have friends that i'm among
I feel ever little thing at once

Every little thing at once
And the beating of the drum
Oh, the beating of the drum

And all the friends that i'm among
I have friends that i'm among
After everything at once
Everything, everything at once
