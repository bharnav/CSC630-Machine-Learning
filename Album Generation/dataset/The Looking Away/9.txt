Well if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
Oh my lord
If you don't want to be a part of the day to day
Then it isn't love
And if it isn't love
Then you have to say
That you will be alone together, always

If you don't wanna think about it then it isn't love that's for sure oh my lord if you don't wanna be supportive well it isn't love that's for sure and if it isn't love then you have to say that you will be alone together always
Through the building trust when we gather dust through the building trust when we gather dust til the both of us til the both of us are covered
