[Verse 1]
Cold as the light on your face
Outlines start too to fade
To watch your fingers melt into the air
When minutes you have been through
And next it wasn't there

Straw man, blown away
Straw man, blown away

Old and have held me in place
Pieces are falling in waves
To watch and spill them things float into the air
When minutes you have been through
And next thing disappear

Straw man, blown away
Straw man, blown away

In white arms, empty as the branches
Your cold hands and feet
In white arms, empty as the branches
The roots underneath
Underrneath
