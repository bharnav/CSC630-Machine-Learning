The world is moving to the song I hear
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything
Felony and fellows running in my dream
We were in the van where the hits were driving
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting

(Chorus)
Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sunray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on ground and my head in the clouds
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel its for real tell me what you know

I don't need to glorify
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie
In the garden ill remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody
Check the radio but theres nothing playing
Check the radio again but theres nothing playing

(Chorus)
Rewind:

Dub-wise!

Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, Yo!
It Was always the same
Till if only what you find when you climb
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time
My life is making your mind work in overtime
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime
Slow it down You turbo too soon
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom
You might get trapped in a temple of doom

(Chorus)
