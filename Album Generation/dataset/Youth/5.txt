What im fighting for
Is worth far more than silver and gold
What im fighting for
Is a chance to unite the past
When a brothers coming home at last
Fighting together for lives

Sons and daughters of abraham
Lay down to a higher command
Don't be tricked by the acts of man
Gods wisdom revealed in a holy plan
A chance to unite the past
When a brothers coming home at last
Fighting together for lives

To zion we roll and we're not all alone
Unite and you will find

What im fighting for
Is worth far more than silver and gold
What im fighting for
Is a chance to unite the past
When a brothers coming home at last
Fighting together for lives

To zion we roll and we're not all alone
Unite and you will find

What im fighting for
