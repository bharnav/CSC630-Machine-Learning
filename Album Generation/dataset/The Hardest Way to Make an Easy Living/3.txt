[Intro: Leo the Lion]
Can you blatantly say, looking straight in her face
That you ain't telling tales to her?

[Hook: Leo the Lion]
If you never tell a lie to her
You don't have to remember anything
But it all goes out the window when
I try to do it myself

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner & Leo the Lion]
Oi, oi, can you blatantly say looking straight in her face
That you ain't telling tales to her?
That you never get stressed
When she questions events she'd be best to forget?
Can you actually blag when the lamb glances
When you're prangin', you're chatting?
That if you had the chance to go back
To her pad for a passionate act you wouldn't have it?
Oi, but why is that then?
That's 'cause the reason you've been faithful is
You've been so good
'Cause you've never seen temptation
Deep down you heed the man's burden
We all have a man's burden in our heads
You'll always be a bad person

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
It's getting you down, you were letting her down
You were tempted and you bowed
You showed her up, you need to be owning up
You need to show her you love her for once
It was an extreme circumstance, it was she that advanced
She defeated you gradually
So you must then be honest, you must get on this
Mend the wrong shit

[Hook: Leo the Lion]
If you never tell a lie to her
You don't have to remember anything
But it all goes out the window when
I try to do it myself

[Verse 3: Mike Skinner & Leo the Lion]
Oi, oi, so why you wanna phone up? Why you wanna own up?
You were selfish and so dumb
To ease it off your chest, to be relieved of the mess
That's being proper selfish, oi
I've been in some broken moments, I know what goes on the road
But there's a road you chose
However coked up your brain, you know you chose to strain
She knows your game, but oi
But it makes you see things clearer
It was weird though, man
But you didn't wanna be with her
Seriously, back home...
If your girl was to even hear it would spare her weak heart
She need not fear

[Verse 4: Mike Skinner]
The chance to see the fit thing naked will spell and mesmerise you
You'll disregard the ways the lady in your life inspires you
Which is why the day she tires of you, you'll be crying and howling
And if you have the chance to go back to her pad
For a passionate act, you won't allow it
But if your plans to the chance to go back is not even had
Then the passionate acts won't happen
'Cause you plan not to have the chance
Rewind that back if that sounded fast, oi
You can't think straightly
You got to avoid the situation, forget what she's doing
You may be mugged if you trust too much
But it will fuck you up more worrying about trust

[Hook: Leo the Lion]
If you never tell a lie to her
You don't have to remember anything
But it all goes out the window when
I try to do it myself
If you never tell a lie to her
You don't have to remember anything
But it all goes out the window when
I try to do it myself

[Outro: Leo the Lion]
You may be mugged if you trust too much
But it will more fuck you up
It will more fuck you up worrying about trust
