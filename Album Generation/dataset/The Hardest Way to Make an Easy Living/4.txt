[Verse 1]
Ah, what was the question? Oh yeah, momento mori
It means, remember it's inevitable that we will all die
It sounds quite depressing when said so raw and direct
But it means, don't hang yourself on a material life
But that gets dropped when I'm bop on a shopping day
Am I shallow, am I hung up on such wrong ways?
Yes, I am shallow and loving every wrong play
If love is blind then why do we all buy lingerie?
I've got nothing in my life away from the studio
So when I'm loose, I end up consuming dough

[Chorus]
Memento mori, memento mori
It's Latin and it says we must all die
I tried it for a while, it's a load of boring shite
So I buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy

[Verse 2]
If I start to think of life, I have prangs of paranoia
Pull one stripey shirt off a rack, toy another
Overthink my fate grasping a pastel jumper
Panic buy a flight home, prang though actually sober
Change my mind and fly back into Vegas
Buy more pastel shades and some famous labels
Frame the Ferrari through the day with the mayhem
Just to forget about the race in my head
I don't really care about the luck and the look
But driving a Ferrari is fucking book

[Chorus]
Memento mori, memento mori
It's Latin and it says we must all die
I tried it for a while, it's a load of boring shite
So I buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy

[Verse 3]
I think if I could see me now from my growing past
I'd hate the shirted cunt that seems to be so fucking flash
I reckon from the threads, I think all I think's about cash
But my manager tells me I ought to think about cash
It's like people don't know the eighties started
My car just keeps carding with the card machine
You don't regard the old you, charging a Ferrari
Minus the driving license through Nevada at speed
I never think about money
In fact I have no idea how much money I have

[Chorus]
Memento mori, memento mori
It's Latin and it says we must all die
I tried it for a while, it's a load of boring shite
So I buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy

[Verse 4]
Chilean Carmenere sips as I'm parting her hair
But I'm an ASBO drinker, I want to be chilly park air
But ASBO drinkers just don't dig my art and my flair
Even if they dig my ASBO driving, past their car light flair
Sometimes when I buy my diamond trinkets with my whores
I know I've strayed a bit from my old sins and my walks
But then I laugh out loud that my car still fucking talks
I feel awful for a bit but at least I'm not bored
