[Chorus]
Two nations divided by a common language, oi
And about two hundred years of new songs and dances
But the difference is language are just the bits you got wrong
'Cause we were the ones who invented the language

[Verse 1]
Sorry, oi, that's just my idea of a joke
But you guys are different to us "across the pond" folk
And I keep having to say that I'm only joking
In New York when I have to buy fags on the road, oi
Biggie, man, God bless America and that
But you lot keep killing all your best talent
We build up our stars and then papers sweep on them
And you build up stars and maniacs shoot them
I don't know much about nines and MACs
But we still got two twos we're inclined to pack
And I much prefer the profit margin nowadays
And crystal meth, it's all hype with crack
It was no shock to me when we flew to the door
At the Nas gig where mans were shooting a war
Since it got reported in the latest news story
That London is now more dangerous than New York

[Chorus]
Two nations divided by a common language, oi
And about two hundred years of new songs and dances
But the difference is language are just the bits you got wrong
'Cause we were the ones who invented the language

[Verse 2]
Understated is how we prefer to be
That's why I've sold three million and you've never heard of me
The paparazzi shoot me, the girls all lose on me
But don't shoot idols, we fight football rivalries
The word "whack" means to come back home
And I wrote the Ten Whack Commandments on my own
I was in front of the bloke shooting at the Nas show
They weren't shooting at me, it was honour that night though
We don't shoot idols, happily shoot instead
Up my road, the police just shot a yute dead
'Cause they guessed he might of been a bit of a terrorist there
Does my bomb look big in this bag then?
But we love Biggie, Johnny Cash and Stevie Wonder
It's no biggie we got no cash and it's no wonder
'Cause I'm proud we gave you people like John Lennon
Even though you shot him as well

[Chorus]
Two nations divided by a common language, oi
And about two hundred years of new songs and dances
But the difference is language are just the bits you got wrong
'Cause we were the ones who invented the language
