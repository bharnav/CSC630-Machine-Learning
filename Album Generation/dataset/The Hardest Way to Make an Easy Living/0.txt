[Intro]
I get back from touring and suddenly it doesn't seem like much fun to be off my face at a quarter to 11 A.M

[Hook]
You're pranging out, I see through you (I feel awful)
There's voices talking to me, this ain't funny
(The iron's been on in my house for four fucking weeks)
I see through you, I'm about to do something stupid

[Verse 1]
I dare say why my manager got lairy and smacked me
These headaches are getting unbearably nasty
Staring at the crack work, looking scary with my brandy
The rock n' roll cliche walked in and then smacked me
Carelessly rackin' out prangs just to handle the fear
I do a line, but then panic and feel a bit prang'd
So I glug Marlon from the bottle to ease off the panic
Then when it starts wearing off, I just feel a bit sad
Snort more tour support, and then have a drink
The bruise on the side of my head is madly banging
The only reason I started this was the deal me a laughing
The only reason I started this was the deal me a laughing

[Hook]
You're pranging out, I see through you
There's voices talking to me, this ain't funny
I see through you, I'm about to do something stupid

[Verse 2]
The girl in my bed is kinda distant right now
I know she's thinking she's a bit frightened somehow
I don't think she realised what I'd invited her back to my house
I don't want anyone to see me like this right now
All sorts of thoughts rolling back in my eyes
I've been a poor sport, thoughts dance in my mind
A banging headache, dancing prang'd by their side
Dancing with the pictures from the past of my life
I don't remember any of what I just thought at all
The conclusion prior to when I forgot it all
Panicking a bit, getting frightened of fuck all
So, nursing my bruise, I drink right from the bottle
I don't want anyone I know to see my like this
My fibs in single became lies in lists
She's gonna sell-tell no doubt, fuck it
I'm not gonna start drinking, no, I can't for now

[Hook]
You're pranging out, I see through you
There's voices talking to me, this ain't funny
I see through you, I'm about to do something stupid

[Verse 3]
My laptop must have slipped down and gone to sleep
Before the prang, this pain was to dawn on me
Around the time I was sketching, trying to con some sleep
And the new day on me was nearly dawning in here
I must have flaked while I inputted, waging loads more
'Cause I staked on bookings, way to total score
Why do I break my rules not to wager anymore?
I’d flaked on the bookings and majorly totalled on the score
I’ve got a simple problem, but my mind's spinning out
I remembered the website between the wine and the stout
The rush of fear made me forget how fucked I'd been
This time I’m drying my eyes and a fucking nose bleed
Turning my phone off when my promo bloke phones me
Evaded for it getting nasty when my manager
When he only beat me
I threw his wallet out the window as it had grown heated
He said, "Sort your life out", as he punched me over to my feet

[Hook]
You're pranging out, I see through you
There's voices talking to me, this ain't funny
I see through you, I'm about to do something stupid
You're pranging out, I see through you
There's voices talking to me, this ain't funny
I see through you, I'm about to do something stupid

[Outro]
Right now, logic states I need to be not contemplating suicide
'Cause rational thought, it would seem that I need not to be
Doing stuff that makes death seem like an easier option
I need a totally trojan plan right now
I see through you
