[Intro: Example]
Ahh, the fine art of hotel expressionism
Pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and your shoe
The minibar can be part of the art also

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
The fine art of hotel expressionism
Pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and your shoe
The minibar can be part of the art

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner & Example]
In the early hours of a blurry hotel
You need guests and venture quest with them
My word is word if you yearn success in hotel expressionism
Stay away from small boutique hotels
So when wrecked, there's no victim
I've been ejected from hotels that
When I'm checking in, will swear to be with us
Man, I'm not some crank vandal
Swinging the TV about at random
Attached to the lamp stand for a handle
Is the art of action through crafted illusion
Tediously mischief from raking
Or just full up, we'd hide from enemy pages
Throwing the TV out the window, mate
Is nothing clear of weak cliche
It's vandalism and expressionism is to be keenly disassociated
I'm talking incontrovertible
Structural damage human injury, real mayhem

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
The fine art of hotel expressionism
Pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and your shoe
The minibar can be part of the art

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
Fill the iron with minibar brandy
And blam, see, you have a brandy iron
The sweet boozy steam moves freely
And is, in no manner, mindless fun
Express yourself in anyway, say anything you may
And anyway, that man lied to you
(That's fucking [?], you fucking cunt
The fucking damage isn't minor, fucker)
But louts harassing is fucking droll
Spelling through the death of rock and roll
Rap and roll is separate to some acid trip
'Cause rock and roll is fucking old
The group of girls you zone in on
Have to be on their own there and pissed
But you have a problem with the man they're with
He's the dealer, but there's a rift
You need to get him fucked up on his own shit
Take his gear, he disappears
Leave him there with his hand in a bucket of water
Gaffer taped to a chair in a lift

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
The fine art of hotel expressionism
Pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and your shoe
The minibar can be part of the art

[Verse 3: Mike Skinner & Example]
I'll tell you straight
Hotel expressionism is his own form of art
Because with normal art, someone, usually the artist
They pour out their heart
But its worth is decided by committee
And has to obey the law of the sharks
I tell expressionists walk out the lift
Mind checking out pay for their art
Real art should be nothing but that
Shouldn't be about the money or fashion
I make these crap rap rhythms
To pay the hotel bills that fund my passion

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
The fine art of hotel expressionism
Pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
Compose your mood using the soap and your shoe
The minibar can be part of the art

[Outro: Example]
It's tedious, the mischief from raking
Why we hide from enemy pages
Throwing the TV out the window, mate
Is nothing clear of weak cliche
It's vandalism and expressionism
Is to be keenly disassociated
I'm talking incontrovertible structural damage
Human injury, well, mayhem basically
