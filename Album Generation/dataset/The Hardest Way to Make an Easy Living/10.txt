("Fuckin' Johnny keeps leaving these massive gaps between the songs... It all plays dead like that. See? Silence. Between the songs.")

[Hook: Repeat 2x]
If you don't like what's going down
You need to change something 'round
And what you can't change
You've got to change the way you thought about

Two days before I finally snapped
From bumped a gig, I was being a twat
The bass player behind the (?)
Is Belgium, another bright screaming gang
Johnny Drum Machine keeps leaving trailing gaps
Putting face cream on between the breaks in tracks

I needed to stop this, draw the last of my ways
20 minutes to go the floor manager says
Been a long summer, sure spanned an age
I wanna dry my eyes and all the band on stage
("Alright I wanna see how proud you Belgians are!")
Dead silence, not very nice to feel so depressed and violent

("He's fuckin' puttin' moisturizer on! He's fuckin' moisturizin' his face..."
"I know... Ridiculous.")

[Hook: Repeat 2x]

("Some cunt has printed up a load of fucking shithole Streets hats...")

Oi, oi, Amsterdam the day before the crash
The Streets hats were made by Warner staff
Thought they were fakes, not thought to ask
So I tirade the audience found under the stage
But I'd only just woken
Ted Mayhem has never seen me so darn broken

The very next day in bed in London
With a girl I have little memory of
Unable to feel anything much which was the reason I bought my first suit
I wasn't thinking at that bit on stage
The fake streets hats were actually not fake!

[Hook: Repeat 4x]

("Who's that cunt? Tell him to fuck off, man."
"The Streets!"
"Oh yeah no go go go yeah... mate, sometimes, you know, it is made so hard...")
