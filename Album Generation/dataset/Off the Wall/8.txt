[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You are not like anybody I ever knew
But that do not mean that I do not know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause

No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone is always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It is only going to happen again

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night all night

[Verse 2: Patti Austin]
And Though I am trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
Do not Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Now We are Just A Web Of Mystery
A Possibility Of More To Come
I did Rather leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
But Here I Go Falling Again

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
Over you, over you (all night)

[Chorus 1]
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It is the falling in love that is making me high
It is the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night, all Night
