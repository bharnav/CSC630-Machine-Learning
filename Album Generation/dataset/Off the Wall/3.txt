[Intro]
Ah, get on the floor and dance
Ah, on the floor and dance

[Chorus]
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially

[Verse 1]
There's a chance for dancing
All night long
There's a chance for grooving
And it will be soothing
With a song

[Pre-Chorus]
Then why don't you just dance across the floor
Because there's a chance for chances
And the chance is choosing
And I sure would like just to groove with you

[Chorus]
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially

[Verse 2]
No need for rejection
Determined to be
Gonna groove, gonna move you
Gonna say things to you
Just wait and see

[Pre-Chorus]
Then why don't you just dance across the floor
Because there's a chance for chances
And it's you I'm choosing
And I sure would like just to groove with you

[Chorus]
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially

So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl
Especially

[Bridge]
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, oww!
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, oww!

[Chorus]
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl
Especially
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl
Especially

[Outro]
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
