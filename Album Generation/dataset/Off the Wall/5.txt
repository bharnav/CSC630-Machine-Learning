[Verse 1]
Girlfriend
I'm gonna tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him (Woo hoo)
Exactly what we're doing (Yeah)
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night when the wind is free

[Verse 2]
Girlfriend
I'm gonna show your boyfriend (Yeah)
Show him (Woo hoo)
The letters I've been saving (Yeah)
Show him how you feel inside
And how love could not be denied (Oh no)

[Chorus]
We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
Do-doot-do
We're going to have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

[Verse 3]
Girlfriend
You better tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him (Woo Hoo)
Exactly what we're doing (Yeah)
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
Do-doot-do
