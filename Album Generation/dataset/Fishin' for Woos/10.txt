[Verse 1]
Ask me a question
And I'll fill you full of lies
I know now the truth is bigger than my disguise
The message that I'd sent
Was shot down long ago
All I wanted was a simple yes
But you said no

[Chorus]
You can't see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I'll put on a smile and wait just like I often do
Then I'll make myself a promise, too

[Verse 2]
I need correspondence
So please give to me an answer do
Could you repeat that one more time so I believe it's true
I've got a unique talent
Of seeing things that other people can't
I know your heart is shot full of holes from mistakes made in the past

[Chorus]
You can't see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I'll put on a smile and wait just like I often do
You say we're friends, so I'll just guard my heart
If I don't, you might tear me apart

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Tear me apart
I know you don't believe it
But I could never do
That to you
How I wish that you could see it all
From the eyes
I look through

[Chorus]
But you can't see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I'll put on a smile and wait just like I often do
You say we're friends so I'll just guard my heart
If I don't, you might tear me apart

[Outro]
Tear me apart
Tear me apart
(You can't see my point of view)
Tear me apart
(You can't see my point of view)
