[Verse 1]
Make me something out of nothing, you're good at that
I could be tripping but I think it's time we got back
To being apart if you want to
Back and forth like a pinball stuck between
Those rubber bumpers on the top of the machine

[Pre-Chorus]
We can call it a day if you want to
We can run away if you want to

[Chorus]
It's okay, it's all good
You get a smiley face for showing your good side
We're going worldwide
You know you can't shake it
Why don't we just get naked?

[Verse 2]
We go together like peanut butter and jam
And most days there's no doubt I'm your biggest fan
I buy you flowers and gum cause I want to
You hold my hand on roller coasters cause you get scared
And when you throw up cause it makes you sick, I hold your hair

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me your fine, but I want to
You can be mine if you want to

[Chorus]
It's okay, it's all good
You get a smiley face for showing your good side
We're going worldwide
You know you can't shake it
Why don't we just get naked?

[Hook]
If everything's fine, why don't we just get
Naked in the front yard
Naked on our Christmas card
In the pool, in the hall
In the fountain at the mall
Naked selling lemonade
Marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

[Chorus]
It's okay, it's all good
You get a smiley face for showing your good side
We're going worldwide
You know you can't shake it
Why don't we just get naked?

[Chorus]
It's okay, it's all good
You get a smiley face for showing your good side
We're going worldwide
You know you can't shake it
Why don't we just get naked?
