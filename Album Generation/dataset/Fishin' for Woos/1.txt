Girls in America
Girls in America
Go!

Another blurry picture from a trip
That only proves what I already knew
Another country I'm ready to get back to
The girls in America just like you

There's just something about
I can't live without
Girls in America
From the southern accents to the California tan lines
Girls in America
Oh say can you see you drive me crazy
Girls in America
No matter how far away I go oh oh oh oh
You'll stay, as beautiful
Girls, girls, girls in America

English girls age like a fine wine
Don't get me started on the girls from Japan
I love you all but there's just something about
Our lady's state of mind in the mother land

So come home with me
I wish you all could be
Girls in America
From the southern accents to the California tan lines
Girls in America
Oh say can you see you drive me crazy
Girls in America
No matter how far away I go oh oh oh oh
You'll stay, as beautiful
Girls, girls, girls in America

American girls I love how you blow me, away
I'd like to get inside each of you one day, yeah

Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls in America
Let's go!

Girls in America
From the southern accents to the California tan lines
Girls in America
Oh say can you see you drive me crazy
Girls in America
No matter how far away I go oh oh oh oh
You'll stay, as beautiful
Girls, girls, girls in America

Gotta love those
Gotta love those girls
Girls in America

Gotta love those
Gotta love those girls
Girls in America

Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls in America
