[Verse 1]
I walked the whole nine yards
Across town and missed the boat
I gave your diamond ring
To the rough part of the sea
I left a pocket full of sunshine
In my other jeans
And then it rained cats and dogs
And I'm allergic to them all
Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
Try not to think about it
Try not to dwell on it
But I like to worry myself sometimes
About things I can't control

[Hook]
I didn't wear a smile today
I looked up and all the blue skies turned grey
I don't know how I'm expected to carry on this way
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day

[Verse 2]
Embraced my red letter day
And then the mail didn't run
I stopped to smell a rose
But ate shit and poisoned oak
I went out on a limb
And a little bird told me off
I took one for the road
And drove directly into a wall
Come on!

[Pre-Chorus]
Try not to think about it
Try not to dwell on it
But I like to worry myself sometimes
About things I can't control

[Hook]
I didn't wear a smile today
I looked up and all the blue skies turned grey
I don't know how I'm expected to carry on this way
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day

[Bridge]
My trucks broken down
My stomach feels sick
My phone just died
And my neighbour is a dick
I lost my wallet
My back hurts
My knee hurts
But who am I to complain?

[Hook]
I didn't wear a smile today
I looked up and all the blue skies turned grey
I don't know how I'm expected to carry on this way
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day

[Hook]
(Should have never gotten out of bed)
I didn't wear a smile today
I looked up and all the blue skies turned grey
I don't know how I'm expected to carry on this way
This ain't my year, this ain't my week, this ain't my day

[Outro]
This ain't my week, this ain't my year, this ain't my day
This ain't my week, this ain't my year, this ain't my day
