I met her at the Sonic
She was listening to Tonic
With her iPod and her rollerskates

She said her name was Summer
When I asked her for her number
She said "Never mind, I get off at eight"

She had eyes like Heaven, face like an angel
But she had the body from Hell

Within a half an hour
We were naked in the shower
Taking dirty pictures on my cell

Then she whispered in my ear

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this

Yeah, right!

She drove me in her Saturn
To the Sweetwater Tavern
Just a block of the Denton Square

She did a shot of JÃ¤ger
And she made out with the waiter
While I was just sitting there

Before too long her
Clothes came off
Like something out of girls gone wild

Had to come up with the bail
Just to get her out of jail
And she threw up at the passenger's side

Then she whispered in my ear...

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this

Yeah, right!

She says that trouble never finds her
No fucked up history behind her
She says she's never stolen anything
Except the car we're driving

Oh shit!

Then she whispered in my ear...

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this

Yeah, right!
Yeah, right!
