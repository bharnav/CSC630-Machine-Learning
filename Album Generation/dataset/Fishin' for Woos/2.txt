Saturday Night
Saturday Night

Punch the clock
Right on time
Think I'm gonna lose my mind
5 o'clock seems like it's a lifetime away

Hate my boss
Hate this place
Wanna shove it in his face
He doesn't know his wife is texting me every day

But I see
The weekend right in front of me

I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
Here's to hoping Monday never comes
S-S-S-Saturday Night

Saturday Night

Half past six
Hit the town
Taking shots and buying rounds
Ozzy's on the jukebox riding Crazy Trains

Love my friends
Love this bar
The bouncer looks like Ringo Starr
So many girls that my neck hurts, have I gone insane?

And I see
The weekend right in front of me

I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
Here's to hoping Monday never comes
S-S-S-Saturday Night

I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
Here's to hoping Monday never comes
S-S-S-Saturday Night

This taxi cab
It really ain't so bad
As I lean out the window I say
S-S-S-Saturday

I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
Here's to hoping Monday never comes
S-S-S-Saturday Night

I wish every night was Saturday night
I wish every night was Saturday night
Here's to hoping Monday never comes
S-S-S-Saturday Night

Saturday Night
S-S-S-Saturday Night
Saturday Night
