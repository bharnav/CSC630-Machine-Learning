The weekend's finally here
And it's me and my bestest friends
Hit the town, put the week behind us
Rocking the same spots again and again
Feels like nothing will ever stop us
No rain or sleet or snow
Tonight there's not a cloud in the sky
While we cool outside on the stereo

We're always on a mission to finally get it right
The life of the party comes in bottles, cans, and pints
We talk about it, sing about it, sneak it onto planes
And every single week someone says the same thing

This has been a great night
No one got into a fight
Met some girls, saw a band
Everything went just as planned
The only thing that we forgot
Was stocking up by 12 o'clock
We'll never persevere
We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer

We've been in this band
Longer than most of our fans have been
We get started up about 6 O'clock
And we go until most of us just can't stand
And it never ceases to amaze me
Just when things start to get good
Is this record on repeat right now?
Whoever hit the store must have misunderstood

We're always on a mission to finally get it right
The life of the party comes in bottles, cans, and pints
We talk about it, sing about it, sneak it onto planes
And every single week someone says the same thing

This has been a great night
No one got into a fight
Met some girls, rocked the show
Where'd the back-up stairs go?
It's not the first time we forgot
To send someone by 12 o'clock
We'll never persevere
We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer

We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer
No beerâ€¦

This could be the worst night ever
Is what we say every time
Maybe we should plan ahead
Or at least start drinking wine!

This has been a great night
No one got into a fight
Met some girls, saw a band
Everything went just as planned
The only thing that we forgot
Was stocking up by 12 o'clock
We'll never persevere
We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer

We've got friends, chicks, guitars, and no beer [x3]
