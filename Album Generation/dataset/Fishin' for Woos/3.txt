I've been sitting feeling sorry for me
Since a week ago last week
I guess maybe I should change my clothes and wash the lipstick off my cheek
I can't explain how all this feels
I close my eyes and I can still see you laughing, singing, holding my hand, walking away. Fading....

What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up
What about me?
What about you?
What about us?

I never meant for you to compromise or meant to hold you down
All I ever wanted was to see you smile
I never meant to watch you drown
In the arms of someone a lot like a stranger, someone who never who never even knew himself
I guess I come undone like the sweater weezer sings about
Wondering if, only thinking

What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up
What about me?
What about you?
What about us?

All my life looking just like you, and
Suddenly I believe dreams came true
Searching for an answer, feels like I lost I lost my keys in a snow storm on Christmas eve
What about me?
What about me?

What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up
What about me?
What about you?

What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up
What about me?
What about you?
What about us?
