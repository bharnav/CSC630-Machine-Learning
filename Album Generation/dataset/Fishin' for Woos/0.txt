I got a note from you that said that you had gone
I wondered when you wrote that note so I could know when you left
Then I can chase you down to a neither airplane or a car
I wonder what you're thinking
You probably think I'm drinking
Let's make this interesting and start all over

Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again

You packed up your clothes and pretty underwear
You may have taken off your things that were exactly right size
I promise I'm not man that Steeler should looks way better on you
I wish you pick up the phone
I feel so alone without you
Can't go on without you
Let me write something 'bout you
Let's make this interesting and start all over

Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Start over again

I'm not asking for forgiveness
Cause I don't know what I did
But I promise I'll forgive you
For whatever, whoever you did it to
You've already got your bags packed
And I can't sell everything I own
We'll go anywhere in the world you wish
I just don't wanna be alone without you
Let's make this interesting and start all over

Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
And try it again
Let's run away
And pretend we're not in love
Let's make this interesting and start all over
