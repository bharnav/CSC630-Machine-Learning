[Intro]
(K-- In the-- And I'm drunk, too)
([Laughing])
(Uh oh oh oh...)
Baby, for years you've been saying
"Why don't you write me a song?"
And I'm like
"I don't know, because I'm not inspired to write you a song!"
But last night I decided
I'm gonna freaking do this!

[Verse 1]
We've been together for so long
And you always asked me why I never wrote a song
All about you and about our love
And about how you're the only one I'm thinking of

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been writing all night
And I got it just right
Here we go!

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Verse 2]
And all my homies
Have always said
"What you doing with that girl?
She's fucked up in the head!"
My mom don't like you
My dad don't too
And my brother says you look like
The guy from Hüsker Dü

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just keeping it real
This is just how I feel

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Bridge]
I get drunk and you get pissed!
You start dreaming I don't exist!
I say yes and you say no!
Just like Katy Perry says, you're Hot and Cold!
With all the shit that we've been through!
This is the best that I can do!
Can I still get lucky tonight?
(Please?)

[Ad-Lib]
These are manners and everything
I, uh, I-I hope you like this song
I spent a lot of time on it
But I didn't spend--
Oh, there's Erik
Just playing, I didn't spend a lot of time on this
But this is the Chorus

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Outro]
Okay, I don't know why this is still going...
(You want it? You got it!)
I anticipated this being
(Here's your freaking song!)
3 Minutes long it's still going here...
I don't even know what's happening
(You want it? You got it!)
Anyway, that's the song that I wrote for you it's, it's okay
Evidently its over now, I don't know
I have no idea on the timing of it or anything
And I... uh...
Boy this is sort of an awkward moment here...
I... uh...
I'm gonna be honest, I have to pee
