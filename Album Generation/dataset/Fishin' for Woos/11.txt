[Verse 1]
It was so long ago
That feels so strange to say
How does eighteen years ago
Seem just like yesterday?
A hundred kids from around the world
On a ship to the great unknown
Two boys for every girl
You had never been away from home
You were drinking something really green
Hopping around like a grasshopper
I was sipping diesel gasoline
Then I threw up on the mezzanine

[Chorus]
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
Because I'm afraid it's something I dwell on all of the time
I hear you're doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while

[Verse 2]
We watched the stars shine
Ate chicken by the slot machines
I was with a friend of mine
He got into your roommate's jeans
We danced to Aerosmith
And then we watched the sun appear
I took a bracelet from your wrist
You took an earring from my ear
You twisted one last twirl
Then kissed me so fucking hard
And all at once our friends would leave
Our hair tangled in the ocean breeze
You told me you loved me
I asked you if you were sure
You said you thought so
And then I said that I loved you too

[Chorus]
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
Because I'm afraid it's something I dwell on all of the time
I hear you're doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while

[Verse 3]
Georgia girl meets Texas boy
Place in time so far away
Like Leonardo Di Caprio
But our ship sank a different way
A lifetime in four short days
Said goodbye and we never looked back
A few letters always ended the same
I love you, did you know that?

[Chorus]
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
Because I'm afraid it's something I dwell on all of the time
I hear you're doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while

[Outro]
Yeah I hope you think of me every once in a while
