We are young and in too deep
Burning our bridges while we sleep
Cutting down fabrics at the seams
Strangling all our families Sheep

I have given it up, given enough…given…
You know that we can't...
We can't come clean

I saw the morning sun eat it's way through everyone

Gracefully, we dance our way to nothing...
Gracefully, we're bowing out too soon
Patiently, I wait for word of something
Knowing this ego will wash what is left of this stench that we hid with perfume

Burn
I can not breath. I can not breath
Worms
They live in me. They live in...

I am gouging out my eyes
I have made my bed with flies
I have burned out with my light
We are young and in too deep
Burning our bridges while we sleep
Cutting down fabrics at the seams
Strangling all our families Sheep

I have given it up, given enough…given…
You know that we can't...
We can't come clean

I saw the morning sun eat it's way through everyone

Gracefully, we dance our way to nothing...
Gracefully, we're bowing out too soon
Patiently, I wait for word of something
Knowing this ego will wash what is left of this stench that we hid with perfume

Burn
I can not breath. I can not breath
Worms
They live in me. They live in...

I am gouging out my eyes
I have made my bed with flies
I have burned out with my light
