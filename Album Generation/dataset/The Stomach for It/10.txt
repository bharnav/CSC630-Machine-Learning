It should come as no surprise...
The motions were not enough to mesmerize
And all the trees, they shook for miles around, just crying out
Tainted by the look in your eyes....
The garden is now overgrown (the seeds we've thrown)
I cannot stay here anymore
The waters red for miles around, just singing out
I'm singing out...

I feel I'm losing my faith in everything
I feel you've fallen out of view
Now, have you lost your faith in me?!

What the hell have I put myself through!?

I'm digging holes for desertion
What else is left to do?
I'll tell you I did it to save you the time...
But the truth's I have nothing to do...

Well
Oh, Lord...
Oh, God...
Or
Oh, Something?!
I broke a sweat tonight, while dreaming of you
In the moments that I'm lacking such clarity, decency...
What the hell can I do!?
And all the trees, they will weep at the sound of your feet coming close in the night...
They'll scream "We didn't know what's wrong from right!"
And I still can't sing these words in tune

Only you can save me from myself

I wrote this beat at the sound of your feet getting closer....
You're getting closer, but I still remain quite unchanged and the secrets I keep won't redeem what's been lost in me
And it kills me...
It really kills me
