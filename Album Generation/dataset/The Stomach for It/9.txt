Sitting all alone by candle light
Dreaming of the times we had, while I drink away the bad
It sure beats looking in your eyes when you're crying
O, My dear... tell me you won't let go
Tonight, we will burn whats left of pieces..

I'll deworm your silly sense of word
I'll search for words tonight
Never again will I ignite a flame
A flame that can't be tamed

Little girl, play in the street
The cars will come and ruin this dream
Tie off a knot just to call me your own...
I'll give up my throne, though that much has been known

Smile at all costs...
Just don't let her get away

Choking, evoking
The ministers smoking...
But you didn't hear that from me
Soaking, Invoking...
But she isn't joking...
And all she can taste is my seed
Stroking and croaking is not worth me cloaking to hide from a life on my knees
Stroking and croaking is better than soaking in all of this sick tendencies

I will learn to lie
You're dreaming of a life...
A life that I can't give
Pieces...
