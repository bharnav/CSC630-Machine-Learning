The sky fell to earth
I watched it, silently
I bridged my teeth with the lack of excitement
It was the start of something
Anything
And I knew it was over

In that moment my life became irrelevant
I quenched my fists
I bit the bullet
I swallowed my pride
I breathed in, then released

Animalistic, Oh Indifference!
It's coming to an end

Congregation, gather here
It's what I'm waiting for, open doors, baby
Congregation, shed a tear
Is it the thought that counts and nothing else?!
Congregation, won't you bare with me?
I've lost myself on rusted shelves
Congregation, have no fear
Here's what I'm losing when there's nothing left to give
