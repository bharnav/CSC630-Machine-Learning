Open up your eyes and see
We're worlds apart but Im still here waiting…
Let go of these tendencies
They keep us here and we have no room to…

*Breath*

"I find it hard to adjust to the ignorance flowing from words I keep hush
And my head. Well, my head, it keeps secrets, but maybe they show?"
"Oh…
Well, wouldn't you know?"
That it's gone?
But at least I found Christ, or I say that I did when it comes to these nights…

"Have I lost your morning touch?"
"Oh, Will you ever lose your faith in me?"
….Or is this really in your plan?

Take this burden, lay it on me
I know this isn't funny...
Coming down, Nail
Unspoken

I'll scale the mountains and I'll sail the sea, just searching for you…
And if I find nothing, where's that leave me?
I'll scale the mountains and I'll sail the sea, just searching for you…
But what if I drown or I fall down a slope, should I pack for a life on my knees?

Waste your time on self pity…
Take your time when you're digging your hole…
Take your time, like its on your side, but you're always just waiting to go

When will I be free?

I'm sure waiting's fun
I'm cutting ties
I'm living lies
I'm just like everyone
