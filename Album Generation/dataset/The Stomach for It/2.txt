Well, all these words have come to nothing
Like all my thoughts that fade away
And every night I pray for something
Then every day I throw it all away

All birds sing something
Their songs define our means, their songs define our lives
Praying for something, as I release my arrow and it pierces their eyes

I will be alone

Tie me down with nothing but a string
And preach your faith in nothing...
I'll mourn for you with passing of our time
When will we see our shadows without light?
The time will come when all that's left is all our demons here to fight

We'll all be swallowed, live and whole
Blisters from digging our own holes
We'll be too deep to see the light
We'll be too lost to set things right

Nice to meet you, Mr. Maker
Nice to meet you, see you later!

Who never knew who?
