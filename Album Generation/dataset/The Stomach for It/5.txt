This can't be right
There's something inside that binds me
Spending my nights thinking of ways…
You'll find me closer to the sun…
And I will swallow my pride, forget all the lies from lovers
I know it's been said, the skirts on the bed, hearts flutter…
Thoughts of suicide or flowers?

It's known. Or at least it was at sometime...
That these lies roll your lips at a drop of a dime...
And the end...
And the end is not worthy
Of fairytale rhymes, peace of mind, don't be worried
It's sad, that I had such foolish remorse
For suspicion of lacking, for locking of doors
Like the coat hanger swinging by means of your clothes
Being torn…
Being torn

Like I've said, it's kind of sad, we can't hold on…
And pain is said to sweep away whats left of breathing
Like I've said, it's kind of sad, you won't hold on…
A lover's bed, now dormant and deprived of meaning

You can sneak, while the city sleeps
Tie an anchor to my head
You can moan, if it builds a thrown for a heart thats lined in lead

Give it to me, give me more than…. give me more than you know…
Give it to me, let me see you turn it to gold

Turn it to gold
