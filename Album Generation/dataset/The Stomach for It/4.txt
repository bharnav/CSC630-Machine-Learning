I don't need to wait for somebody
Just to call my own, let them take what is left of me
I just need to find my soul…
When the lights go out am I all alone?

Live it up, while you wait for it
Live it up, lose a day for it

And I know that it goes without saying
That modern complexion is irrelevant here
That the only means of air flow is brought by the scent of your hair
That candlelight serves better on the inside, not out
That the square engulfs the circle like the scream engulfs the shout

I'm made of stone
Medicate the unknown
Serve me in small piece so you'll never eat alone

You hold on to a fraction of the pigmentation that was left behind
Rubble built on lies
And I know that we were happy well before it was said that involuntary motion
Never felt so bad
Tasting every notion of my writers block is just cause of effect of staring
At this clock
Now I'm walking to the ocean, looking to the sea…
Praying it will drown my sorry with whats left of me

Fill my lungs, now there's nothing left to say
