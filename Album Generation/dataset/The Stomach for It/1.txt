My God, what am I doing here!?
What the hell am I thinking!?
Well, It's not so clear…it's not so clear

You lay next to me and you look in my eyes
Well, I'll try to forgive…It just depends on the night
I can't provide what was never out there
We sleep restlessly through the middle of our lives
And we count all the stars like we're ever gunna' fly
I can't rely on your sweet ambition

We teach kids not to play with fire
And we teach them how to pray on their knees
We teach sons how to marry our daughters
And we teach sons how to spread their seed

Oh Lord, this is absolutely revolting
And at the same time I find it….. Hilarious

God, please pluck her teeth out
I know it's sick to say, I know I've gone a stray
God, please pluck her teeth out
Cause this will never end nor ever go away
She'll never see unless you sway...

I believe that I've gotten this all wrong…
And I can not pretend, I'd never hear the end of it...
