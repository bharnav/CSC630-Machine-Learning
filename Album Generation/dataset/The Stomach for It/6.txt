These words still remain quite the pleasant surprise
You're bringing me lonely
And I can't rely on the look in your eyes for the meaning of life
So the fact still remains, you're...you're not looking out for me
Like you said you would be...
Like the things that you said we could be

With my ring wrapped around your finger
With my heart kissing your shoe's sole
It seems I will remain, just a man, still unchanged
Never learning to let go
Yes, this river of life has run dry for the night
But that's nothing you didn't know
I have built up this damn in the name of a plan
Preaching "I can not learn to let go."

Oh, It won't matter...
It won't matter
It won't matter

Lord, does it matter?!
Does it matter?!
Does it matter?!

Let the rain wash me clean
Death has followed me

I've fallen apart
Summer never sets on me
I would die for a night of emotion...
I would give anything for that look in your eyes
I would gladly jump into the fire, Scream "I am a liar"
Yes, I am a liar....
And I deserve nothing
Lord, I deserve nothing...
Not even her taste, let alone her faith in me
