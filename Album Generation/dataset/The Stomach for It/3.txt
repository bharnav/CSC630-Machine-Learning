You can't stay close enough to every boy you meet
Drugs don't taste good enough... since then you've been clean

With every little taste your nails broke more beneath the surface
Of my unsteady, undying trust for your smile of decay
Beneath the unending, undying light of such little surpriseâ€¦
I could swear I never saw it coming

And with a moments pause he slipped right in..
When I was never there to begin with

God, please take me home

Here's a pretty lie
Here's a big surprise
Here's a nasty taste
Here's a dying faith
I can't breath and I swear I'll never make this bed
I can't breath and I swear we're better off DEAD

And im sick of redemption without revision
And Im sick of your eyes
This isn't why you made her...
This isn't why you made her...
