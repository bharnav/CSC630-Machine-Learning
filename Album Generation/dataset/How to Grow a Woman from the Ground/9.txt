Oh the heart beats in its cage

Well I don't feel better when I'm fucking around
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson
Cause I've already learned
Yeah the sun will be shining
And my children will burn
Oh the heart beats in its cage

I don't want what you want
I don't feel what you feel
You see I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
He gets left left left left left left left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone
Oh the heart beats in its cage

All your friends are laughing at us
All the ones you love, you mistrust
Help me now, I'm not quite myself
Look around there's no one else there
Well I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
Oh I get left left left left left left left
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire

Oh the heart beats in its cage
Oh the heart beats in its cage

The heart beats in its cage
