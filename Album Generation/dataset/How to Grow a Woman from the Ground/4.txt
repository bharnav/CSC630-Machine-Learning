What do you see that's so beautiful
That it always reflects in your eyes
The world casts no shadow across your sweet face
You're an angel and I'm gonna cry

When I used to see you I'd smile
The pretty girl up on the sign
Then I'd thank God for mine now she's leaving
And I need an angel to keep me from crying

You're an angel and I'm gonna cry
'Cause I can't have you and I'm not gonna try

I'm wasting this dream with my troubles
Let me rest in your arms for a while
Say you love me 'cause when I wake up dear
You'll just be an angel and I'm gonna cry
Say you love me 'cause when I wake up dear
You'll just be an angel and I'm gonna cry
