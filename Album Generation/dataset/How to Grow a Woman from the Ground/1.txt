Dead leaves and the dirty ground when you know I'm not around
Shiny tops and soda pops when I hear your lips make a sound
When I hear your lips make a sound

Thirty notes in the mailbox will let you know that I'm coming home
And I think I better stick around for a while so you're not alone
For a while so you're not alone

Soft hair and your velvet tongue I want to give you what you give to me
Every breath that is in your lungs is a tiny little gift to me
Is a tiny little gift to me

If you can hear a piano fall you can hear me coming down the hall
If I could just hear your pretty voice I don't think I'd have to see you at all
I don't think I have to see you at all

I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down
I got back home with no one to wrap my arms around
To wrap my arms around
To wrap my arms around

Any man with a microphone can tell you what he wants the most
And you know why you love at all if you're thinking of the Holy Ghost
If you're thinking of the Holy Ghost
