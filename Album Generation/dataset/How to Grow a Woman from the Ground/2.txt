You are the devil
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away
I am in trouble
But you're not what I need
You're not what I need
Even if I'm all alone
Crying out for help
Keep yours to yourself
Cause I'm trying to hold on
To her as long as she can stand it too

Been prying off my fingers one by one
Prying off my fingers one by one
I've been praying against you
But the damage has been done
The damage has been done
And it would take a miracle
For her to break my fall
Cause she don't care at all anymore
And I don't know why I still do
Why I'm telling you
Cause you are the devil
And you can stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away

To hell with my freedom
If it don't come for free
And I know it don't come for free

If I give in
Give me bitter songs to play
And some sweet heart to win
Friends I thought I lost
And times I've never been
Just don't ever make me fall in love again

Should of seen us fly out that church
Devil stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away
