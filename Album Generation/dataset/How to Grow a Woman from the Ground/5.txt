I caught a string full of fish down by the dam
I'll drag 'em back to the field they should be dead by then
Wipe the sweat off my neck and tally ho the plow
I'm gonna grow a woman from the ground

The night was a chalkboard with a fingernail moon
If the fish ain't dead yet they will be pretty soon
It's kinda like the feeling at an old folks home
Even though you love them you can't wait for them to go

I'll call her Angelina, she's a teacher I once had
A halo of honey wrapped around her head
And she always used to give me some when I was a kid
I told her that I loved her and then I went and hid

I'll take you into town and I will show you off
There's room on your dress for a corsage
And I'll open every door for you

I opened up my almanac and in my mind I read
Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can
So I rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the days are long

I sewed up my wrists and sowed the ground with my blood
Stained up my clothes pretty good and I turned that dirt to mud
I could not help but close my eyes and lay my body down
'Cause I heard it takes forever to grow a woman from the ground

I bleed for you now and I'm skinny as a rail
I'll be so obliged to keep you nice and warm and safe
Oh and won't you be so proud of me
