If the sea was whiskey and I was a diving duck
If the sea was whiskey and I was a diving duck
I'd swim to the bottom and I don't know if I'd come up

I'm just here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes?
I'm just here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes?
If things don't get no better then down the road I go

Whiskey and beers they don't make me drunk
Whiskey and beers they don't make me drunk
But these blues is gonna make me pack my trunk
