Portland Maine is just the same as sunny Tennessee
I said Portland Maine is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Boy, any old place I hang my hat is home sweet home to me

Well I went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
Well I went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
You know it said it's good times here but better on down the road

Well I'll eat my breakfast here and eat my dinner in New Orleans
Well I'll eat my breakfast here and eat my dinner in New Orleans
I'm gonna find me a woman, Lord I ain't never seen

Where was your momma when my train left the shed?
Where was your momma? My train left the shed
I was hanging by my front door wishing to God I was dead

Well I went to a little gypsy at a fortune telling place
Well I went to a little gypsy at a fortune telling place
She read my mind and then she slapped my face
