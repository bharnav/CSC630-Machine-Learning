Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
There used to be a railcar to take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
When I got to Nashville there was too much soldier's joy
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
If I ain't gone tomorrow you know I've gone today

Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Black highway, all night drive
Watching the tires fall away to the side
Clear channel, way down low
And it's coming in loud, my mind let go

Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time I don't want none at all
No, I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
But here I sit in Nashville with Norman's Nashville Blues
Come all you good time rounders listening to my sound
Drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down

Go back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Hard weather, driving slow
The buggies and the hats are in town for the show
Oh darling, the songs they play are all I got left of the love we made

Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
