I am yours if you want me
And I'm sorry if you do
'Cause I don't have that much to offer
A girl who knows as much as you

I am scared of your body
And I am scared of your soul
But I would rather be letdown
Than let being with you go

So I am yours if you want me
You can see I'm not mine anymore
Didn't take much to drive me crazy
I guess I wasn't that sane before

I don't care about my future
I don't care about your past
Those things come from and lead to right now
They can get the hell out fast

So I am yours if you want me
And you know what now I think you should
'Cause I want you to be mine so bad
I promise I'll make it good
