I miss my friends, my old school friends
The ones that I've known all my life
I spent so long pushing their love away
Now it cuts and it bites

I had this dream that I saw all of them
And we talked but we knew that we'd changed
Some had seen money and some had seen death
But none of them were the same

I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to feel their love again
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to be with my old friends

I can't forget getting drunk in the woods
With some liquor stolen from the market shelf
I drank a whole plastic Cherry Coke bottle full of wine
And I thought I'd killed myself

I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to feel their love again
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to be with my old friends

Kissing the same girls
Taking their sweet pearls
And giving ours away at the same time
Man I turned each memory into this perfect summertime

I know they're there, I know where
I can see their faces every day
All these pixel pictures, I studied them like scriptures
And I still feel so far away

I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to feel their love again
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want to be with my old friends
