Floatin' on the wind, until I find you
I bury myself deep inside your heart
You won't feel a change
We'll just become the same thing
And never spend a single day apart

And yes, I guess there have been many others
And yes, I've treated them the same as you
But quick I bled them dry
And I licked the salty tears they cried
And many went from many to a few

I'm the angel of death, babe, the end is near
Keep you hand on your chest, don't let me whisper in your ear
It's best to keep on walking
Lock the door when I come knocking
Mine's the voice you never wanna hear

Maybe you'll be shocked by this admittance
Things are rarely ever what they seem
I don't mean you harm by my existence
Mmmm
Just let your tired eyes slip into dreams

I'm the angel of death, babe, the end is near
Keep you hand on your chest, don't let me whisper in your ear
It's best to keep on walking
Lock the door when I come knocking
Mine's the voice you never wanna hear
