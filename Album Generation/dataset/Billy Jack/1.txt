I was born with blue skin
Tied in knots that I'm still in
When the doctor cut me free
Man, he made an enemy out of me

I should have stayed
Crawled back in and hid
But I'm glad that I've done what I did

I was raised by a stranger
Loved every word he said to me
Kept me fat and free from danger
I was the queen of the colony

I left my home
Still a stupid kid
And I'm glad that I've done what I did

I can't complain
Oh, but I do
All the same
I won't win or lose

I met someone when I was older
And I fell so deep in love
When I felt our touch grow colder
I crushed the cage and killed the dove

I couldn't look
I shut my eyelids
And I'm glad that I've done what I did

I can't complain
Oh, but I do
All the same
I won't win or lose

Live each day like it's my first
People tell me that I'm blessed
All I see is where I come from
I hope to trust to know what's best

I made mistakes
I jumped off the grid
But I'm glad I've done what I did
I'm glad I've done what I did

I can't complain
Oh, but i do
All the same
I won't win or lose
