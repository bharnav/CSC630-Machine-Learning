I got grave within my chest
You fill up that's where you rest
My haunted heart don't see your ghost
But I wish it did oh I wish for that the most

Your mine you mine all time all the time it's in my mind and I don't mind no I don't mind I don't mind at all

So I spilt my guts all about you
To some old stranger on some old bar stool
She held my hand and even shed some tears
She said some things just aren't meant to be my dear

Your mine you mine all time all the time it's in my mind and I don't mind no I don't mind I don't mind at all

Oh blood and bones
Real life love sinks me like stone
And I'd rather live the love that's in my mind

I'll put my money down and tighten my lose lips
I guess I gambled all my sanity chips
I am stock memories that don't even exist
But I'll be laughing when I go down with this ship

Your mine your mine all time all the time it's in my mind and I don't mind no I don't mind I don't mind at all

Your still mine your mine all time all the time it's in my mind and I don't mind no I don't mind I don't mind at all
