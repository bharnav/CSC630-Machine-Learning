Oh no, I don't know if I'll go with you now
I got buckets of words just to hush out the sound
Of my heart falling down into bits on the ground
Don't know how to love you when I'm not around

I sold all my clothes to get rid of your smell
I smashed all the clocks that had the right time to tell me
How long it has been since we parted ways?
Don't know how to leave you when I wanna stay

So go, go, go
Go on without me now, lose me in the crowd
Oh, I am so, so, slow
Slow moving like a sow, words stuck in my mouth

Steady the lock down and hope it will take
I'm cold rushing water for the levee to break
And the things that should soothe me just wear me away
Don't know how to hold back what I shouldn't say

So go, go, go
Go on without me now, lose me in the crowd
Oh, I am so, so, slow, slow moving like a sow
Words stuck in my mouth

Oh no, I lost track of the time that you gave
Squandered the hours that I should've saved
There's no turning back from my grave in the ground
Don't know how to love you when I'm not around

But I'll learn how to love you when I'm not around
