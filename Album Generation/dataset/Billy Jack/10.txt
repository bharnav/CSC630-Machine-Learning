Thin line
Walking a thin line
Staying out late at night

I'm not happy
Feeling low
It's so hard these days
To play my cards right

It's about time
To start the show
I got tickets for my
Friends that want to go

And I wish you'd come down
Just come on by
Oh, I need your easy roll
Around of a good time

'Cause I want whiskey when I'm sick
And a man when I'm well
But it's nice to have them both sometimes
When I feel like raising hell

So don't try and save me
I'll be just fine
I'm getting used to
Walking on a thin line

Some days I try hard
To watch my mouth
To say the right things
But the wrong just slip right out

Oh, I ain't no Southern belle
No Georgia peach
I guess all my good graces
Are too far out of reach

I sleep so deep each night
I'm lying in the bed we made
And when I get you off, babe
Well you know it's give and take

So I don't feel bad
When I get mine
Oh, I'm getting used to
Walking on a thin line

Sometimes I'm doing things
Half-ass wrong
Sometimes the words I sing
Are just some half-ass song

I get lost
And I get found
Oh, and I'll be good until I need another round

'Cause I want whiskey when I'm sick
And a man when I'm well
But it's nice to have them both sometimes
When I feel like raising hell

So don't try and save me
I'll be just fine
Oh, I'm getting used to walking on a thin line

No, don't try and save me
I'll be just fine
Oh, I'm getting used to walking on a thin line
Oh, I'm getting used to walking on a thin line
