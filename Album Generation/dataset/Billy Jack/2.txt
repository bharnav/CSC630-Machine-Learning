Some folks have the same song and dance
Downtown bars and cheap romance
Getting off not getting far alone
I watch this freeway turn to dust
I flick you off the upper crust
Shouting down how you can bring it back to how it was

I act out and you act tough
When you save face I call your bluff
If you don't wanna give me some
I'll find someone who does

Sweat your summers hot and sweet
I run your streets with my bare feet
But you still got the coldest cold I know
Ohio

Holy roller
Make some sound
Before your time
Goes underground
You built the stage
I throw it down
Ohio

Never left till my daddy died
I got swept up in family pride
The truth is that the truth came in
And hung me out to dry

I crushed my face deep in the dirt
I'll dig the ground and sow the hurt
Lungs filled up to shout the worst
And live inside
Ohio

Holy roller
Make some sound
Before your time
Goes underground
You built the stage
I throw it down
Ohio

You're a glass window display
Of preaching man you praise to pray
A hand me down thrift store trade
That never got you paid

I tap my foot and slap my knee
Play all night long to beg you please
You're still my favorite song to sing along to
Ohio

Holy roller
Make some sound
Before your time
Goes underground
You built the stage
I throw it down
Ohio
