Went down to the banks of the LA river
Had to hop a chain link fence
Concrete walls on the LA river
Water lapping up on the cement

Oh but I love my new home
Listen to the big city sound
Watching that LA river roll down
By the trains past Chinatown

Dip my fingers in the warm black water
Raw red skin on my knees
Sail my boat down the LA river
Thought I saw a body in the weeds

Oh but I love my new home
Listen to the big city sound
Watching that LA river roll down
By the trains past Chinatown

Oh but I love my new home
Listen to the big city sound
Watching that LA river roll down
By the trains past Chinatown
