You were just a baby
When you made yourself a baby's momma
Floating on the Great Lakes
Crushing beer cans with your man
Tour mother left you stranded
Said she couldn't even stand the things you can

Oh darling
Turn that finger around
You're the one bringing you down
Turn that finger around now

The neighbors in the hotel lobby
Heard your shotgun wedding going off
I'd hate to be a stranger
But I know that I am cut from the same cloth
You don't know much about him
Only how you fall around him when he talks

Oh darling
Turn that finger around
You're the one bringing you down
Turn that finger around now

Wake up every morning
Wish you had somewhere to go
Had something to show for it
Singing on the sideline
Just waiting for the wind to blow

Oh darling
Turn that finger around
You're the one bringing you down
Turn that finger around now
