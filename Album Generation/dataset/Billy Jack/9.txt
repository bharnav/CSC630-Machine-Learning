Your junked-out, beat-up car
Won't get you very far
When it's raining this hard
Hold hands and then you'll kiss
They're a tambourine you hit
And it's shaking and breaking through the dark

You miss near and you miss far
You miss drinking at the bar
And I won't be the last one making your life hard

Turning up your sleeves
You're turning like the leaves that keep changing outside
Soft and so polite
That quiet lullaby you keep singing and bringing through the night

Got my hands around my flask
And I keep watching you walk past
Plays just like a record skipping tracks

Put it all
Put it all
Put it all on you
I wouldn't lose my shirt if I did the work
That I'm supposed to do
It's all on you

I'm a broken telephone
Cause I can't say a damn thing when you come and go
You come and go
I'm all out of cards to play
You don't want 'em anyway
So I won't push my luck to make you stay

Cause I miss near and I miss far
So I went drinking at the bar
I won't be the last one taking this so hard

Put it all
Put it all
Put it all on you
Wouldn't lose my shirt if I did the work that I'm supposed to do

I put it all
Put it all
Put it all on you
I wouldn't lose my shirt if I did the work that I'm supposed to do
That I'm supposed to do
It's all on you
