[Verse]
I can't belong to winter
I can't put on your fire
This town's alone, and therefore
I see no end in sight
Olden hymns, child
Olden words you'll know

[Chorus]
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
Headstrong, today
I've been headstrong
