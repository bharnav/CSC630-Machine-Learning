Oh, light a candle's fire
Carries our good name
What would you ask a campfire?
That scares me just the same

And you, you've had it all along
An endless need for games
Just don't forget a candle's fire
Is only just a flame

I, it's certain from afar
Failed to pull my weight
But you and I, we traveled through the fog
To arrive at our front gate

Tonight we rest beside the fire
A smile upon your face

Just don't forget a candle's fire
Is only just a flame

If I had known
Not to carry on that way
It wouldn't show
In the creases on your face

If you should go
But you carry on my name
Just let it blow
In the fog of Bishop's Lane
