[Verse 1]
Only know what I'm told, only know what I'm told
Fast asleep, daydreaming
Start to push, break your own glass ceiling
Can't count, catch the pieces falling

[Chorus]
Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know you're letting me down?
How'd I end up on the ground?

[Verse 2]
Only do what I'm told, only do what I'm told
Last to leave, cold calling
You're gonna lose your arms
Amputate, Plasticine
There's no knight in silver armor, shining

[Chorus]
Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know I'm letting you down?
Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
How did he end up on the ground?
Face down on the ground

[Verse 3]
Only go where I'm told, only know what I'm told
Inch to inches, crowding
We can't leave, it's the last road open
Every speed on our knees is crawling

[Outro]
Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawling
