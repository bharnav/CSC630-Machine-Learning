Is it too late
To do it again
Or should we wait
Another day
Nobody knows
Everyone cares
Everyone's askin'
For answers to prayers
Well, you never know
How it's gonna go
No one ever knows
How it's gonna go

How many times
I heard you say
Every hour
Every day
Nobody knows
Nobody says
Anything really
That hasn't been said
Well, you never know
How it's gonna go
No one ever knows
How it's gonna go
