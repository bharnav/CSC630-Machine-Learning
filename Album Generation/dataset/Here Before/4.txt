Gotta do something
Get in with the crowd
Do what you want
For crying out loud
Another trip, another key
Another dip into the sea
Of endless possibility
The time is right
For us to feel the
Time
Right
Now
Tonight
Stay out of trouble
Take care of your name
Playing it forward
Stay in the game
Find a way without a plan
Make each day as best we can
Something for the world to see
The time is right
For us to feel the
Time
Right
Now
Tonight
Time
Right
Now
Tonight
All right
