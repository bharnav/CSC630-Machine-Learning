Everything looks familiar
Like I've been here before
Another one in a million
Another knock on the door
Slowing down to look clearly
See the world flying by
Didn't say it was easy
Never said you didn't try
Take a look around
Turn another way
It's not like before
Not like this today
It's okay
It's alright
Another day
Another night
