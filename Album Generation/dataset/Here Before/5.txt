On bluer skies I can depend
The moment I saw you again
How many times I called you friend
I never cried for what might have been

Don't wait too long
Only love will hold on

Do your time till eternity
Before I lie do one more thing
The time is right for lying on the ground
While waiting there don't make a sound

Don't wait too long
Only love will hold on
Only love

Only love (ba ba ba ba)
Only love (ba ba ba ba)
Only love (ba ba ba ba)
Only love (ba ba ba ba)
Only love
Only love
Only love
