Every time I start to wonder why
Then I see the look that's in your eye
Feel old I am out contagion shows
Looking back tomorrow only knows

Going down
Way down
Heading down
Way down

When you find the peace is not your phone
Take a look around and see the bone
Try to find the way to take control
Now it's time before it takes its toll

Going down
Way down
Heading down
Way down

Going down
Way down
Heading down
Way down
