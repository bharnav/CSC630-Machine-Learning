[Verse 1]
So close
You're wasted again
I know
Somehow
I lost myself
Again

[Chorus]
Making me high again
I almost forgot myself again
It hits me so hard
It kills me again
Today

[Verse 2]
So close
Yet you're wasted again
I know
Somehow

We'll find ourselves
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]
Then we'll be high again
I almost forgot myself there
It hits you so hard
And kills again

[Verse 3]
I almost forgot myself again
I almost forgot myself there
It's hitting me hard
It moves me again
Again
