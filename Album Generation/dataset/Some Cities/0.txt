[Verse 1]
Think I might have met you before
I think it's time we settled a score
Buildings there they stretch so tall
It's steel and brick no more, no more

[Refrain]
Can't I make you see?

[Verse 2]
Too much history coming down
Another building brought to ground
Roads that come together
My memory never severs
The love'll never sever for me

[Refrain]
Can't I make you see?

[Bridge]
Some cities crush
Some cities heal
Some cities laugh
While other cities steal

[Refrain]
Can't I make you see?

[Outro]
Some cities crush
Some cities
