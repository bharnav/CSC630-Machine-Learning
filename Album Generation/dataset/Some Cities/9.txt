[Verse 1]
Who am I supposed to be?
I can't be sure that the next one will see me

[Chorus]
And if the sky starts falling on the street outside
The only thing that satisfies
If the sky starts falling on the heads outside
The only thing that keeps me alive

[Verse 2]
If you see her again, be sure to say hello
Be sure to send my love
Did she seem like before
Could you seem above it all
Be sure to send my love

Wake up, waking up to see
It's a sign
That what will be will be

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
I swear I heard her call, call my name
I swear I heard her call, can I move on

[Chorus 3]
If you see her again, be sure to say hello
Be sure to send my love
Did she seem like before
Can't you see above it all
Be sure to send my love

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Did she call herself a friend?
Don't call on me again, don't call on me again
Did she seem like before
Did she seem above it all
Be sure to send my love
