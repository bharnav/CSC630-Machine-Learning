[Verse 1]
So ambition cut you down
Ain't a love as perfect
Everybody knows it
Something drove you down

[Chorus]
Something as good
Something new
Somebody good
Our ambition cuts us down

[Verse 2]
There's not a love that's perfect
But I, I live in hope

[Chorus]
Somebody good
Somebody new
Something as good
Something that's mine

[Verse 3]
Ain't a love that's perfect
Everybody knows it
Ambition cuts us down
