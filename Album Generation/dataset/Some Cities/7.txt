[Verse 1]
All my love and all my heart go with you
Just look into my eyes and what can you see?
But all my love and all the time keep with me
I'll keep it with me

[Refrain]
Someday soon you'll know how it feels to love someone
Someday soon you'll know how it feels to trust someone

[Verse 2]
Seven days and seven nights have fallen
Empty streets and bright lights he's walking
So why is it the ones we love we can't trust?
We can't trust

[Refrain]
Because someday soon you'll know how it feels to love someone
Someday soon you'll know how it feels to trust someone To trust someone

[Outro]
It's been a while since I loved someone
