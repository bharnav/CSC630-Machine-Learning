[Verse 1]
You weathered the storm
You came out the other side
The place you were born
Is a place inside

[Refrain]
Don't be sad it's gone
Don't be sad I'm gone...

[Verse 2]
To weather the storm
Up on your feet again
If it all comes down
Would you still call this the end?

[Refrain]
Don't be sad it's gone
Can't be sad for long

Don't give up be strong
Don't be sad I'm gone

The night you left the storm

[Verse 3]
To weather it all
To come out the other side
With the moon all high
I'll see you on the other side
So come out the other side
