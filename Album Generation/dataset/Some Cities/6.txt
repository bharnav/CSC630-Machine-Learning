[Verse 1]
Say something
Anything will do my love
There's a girl on the 'phone
That's the girl who's never home

Say something good
There's a wilderness of hope
That's the girl, on the 'phone
That's the girl who's never home

And your friends they were so close

[Verse 2]
Say you will stay
Forgot what I came here for
Passing signs on the road
Telling me I'm far from home

Strangers out here
Myself I disappear
That's the killer on a call
That's the man who works alone

[Refrain]
Your friends they were so close
One by one they didn't stay
Drift away like rolling sea
One by one they drift away
One of these days
One of these days

[Refrain]
And your friends they were so close
One by one they didn't stay
Drift away like rolling seas
Day by day they drift away
And the people that were close
Are the ones you miss the most

One of these days I'll blow away
One of these days I'll blow away
