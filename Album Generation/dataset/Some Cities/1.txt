[Verse 1]
Here comes the action
Here it comes at last
Lord give me a reaction
Lord give me a chance

[Chorus]
You should follow me down

In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I've been ten feet underground

Got to get out of this satellite town

[Verse 2]
Here comes some action
First time in my life
I gotta get up to get compensation
I gotta get up to get this to light

[Bridge]
Whether you live alone
Or you're trying to find your way in this world
You better make sure that you don't crack you're head on that pavement, man
My God! what a shock!
It's been preying on me and mine
This is a dangerous place man
This is a dangerous place, there's nothing here

[Chorus]
You should follow me down

In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I've been ten feet underground
In a black and white town

[Chorus]
You should follow me down

There's no color and no sound
In the Black and White Town
I've been ten feet underground
In the black and white town
