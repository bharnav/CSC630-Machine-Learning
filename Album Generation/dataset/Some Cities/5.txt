[Verse 1]
It seems, it seems there's nothing
That you couldn't do
With a drink inside of you
Is there nothing
You'd not do
With a drink in you?

[Verse 2]
I've always known
That you felt the pain
And it had to start to show
It'd driven you insane
I could lie, but I can't
'Cause you know it's so

[Chorus]
You tell me, you say
"I walk in fire, you walk in fire"
You're not free till you
Walk in fire, I walk with fire, I walk in fire

[Verse 3]
You've always been
A loose cannon, gone
And the way you were back then
You'd take on anyone
It takes years to accept it all
And to be yourself

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
On and on and day by day
We fool ourselves we ain't the same
Everyone who stayed away
Man I always felt your pain

On and on I tell myself
Fool ourselves we ain't the same
Everyone who stayed away
Man I always felt your pain

[Chorus]
