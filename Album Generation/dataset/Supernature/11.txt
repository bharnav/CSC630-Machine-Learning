[Verse 1]
Magic maker, wish me one wish
Hold me to your light and maybe
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star

[Verse 2]
I shiver, you shake it
Turn me on, I can't help it
Don't know, am I dreaming
Or have you, you haven't
Stop for awhile
Why don't we play
I wear your star

[Chorus]
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted critical

[Verse 3]
Turn me onto your star show me
One night, slowly aching, make me
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star

[Verse 4]
I'm goin right under
Your spell has taken over
I'm feelin, your passion
Oh there's no need for
The place where I'll wait
Why don't we play
I wear your star

[Chorus]
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted critical

[Bridge]
Turn me onto your star show me
One night, slowly aching, make me
Oh, what if I say
Why don't we play
I wear your star

[Chorus]
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted critical
