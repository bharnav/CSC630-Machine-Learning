[Verse 1]
Drifting out of time
Something on your mind
And I wanna be the one that you call when you get down
No matter where you are in the world, I'll be around

[Chorus]
Fly me away on an aeroplane
High in the sky, wanna see you again
Wanna know this time
Gonna tell you what I'm feeling
Gonna know this time
Gonna get it back, that feeling

[Verse 2]
Miles and miles of sun
Endless roads twist on
Don't wanna live a life in a world that's all the same
The crazy little things that you do are magical

[Chorus]
Fly me away on an aeroplane
High in the sky, wanna see you again
Wanna know this time
Gonna tell you what I'm feeling
Gonna know this time
Gonna get it back, that feeling

[Bridge]
This crazy life
This crazy world
We're living in
Is magical

[Chorus]
Fly me away on an aeroplane
High in the sky, wanna see you again
Wanna know this time
Gonna tell you what I'm feeling
Gonna know this time
Gonna get it back, that feeling
