[Verse 1]
Sharp as teeth and stars
I can't give you up
Like a moth to light
Move like caramel

[Chorus 1]
Till dawn, you glow
Till dawn, you glow

[Post-Chorus]
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing

[Verse 2]
Breathe back into life
Stabs at happiness
Now we're having fun
Hold tight

[Chorus 2]
Don't look down
Till dawn, you glow
Till dawn, you glow

[Post-Chorus]
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing of this world
Soon be nothing

[Chorus 2]
Don't look down
Till dawn, you glow
Till dawn, you glow
