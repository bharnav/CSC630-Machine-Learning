[Verse 1]
Breathing in your sip of gold
I follow all your little lines
I like to watch a thousand times
I want to feel you here
I like to watch a thousands times
I make a shrine for you

[Chorus]
Time out from the world
Leaving it all
Just for a day
You like there's a down
Hold me and round
Take us a day?

[Verse 2]
Here I go, I'm going back
On every world you ever said
I'm dreaming of another time
Yesterday my alibi
We changed the world, just you and I
I make a shrine for you

[Chorus]
Time out from the world
Leaving it all
Just for a day
You like there's a down
Hold me and round
Take us a day?
