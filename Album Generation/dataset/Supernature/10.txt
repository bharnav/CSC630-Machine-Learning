[Verse 1]
Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sunset only seconds
Just ripe, then it's gone
Got no new intentions
Just right, then it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
I'll be there to meet you
Getting down to greet you

[Verse 1]
Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Howl under the moon
