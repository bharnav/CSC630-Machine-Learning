[Verse 1]
You send me just colours
I'm waiting, don't hold back

[Verse 2]
Trees bow to the wind and
I'm falling inside you

[Chorus 1]
Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

[Verse 3]
So close I could touch it
I'm dreaming, don't wake up

[Chorus 1]
Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

[Chorus 2]
Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right now

[Bridge]
You send me just colours
You send me just colours

[Chorus 1]
Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

[Chorus 2]
Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right now
