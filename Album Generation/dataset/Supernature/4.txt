[Verse 1]
They sail light, ocean
Sail this night, ocean
Sail at light day, sail here
Filling my sleep so gently

[Chorus 1]
Just let it take you
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you

[Verse 2]
They sail light, ocean
Sail this night, ocean
Shimmer like gold, they're singing
Filling my sleep so gently

[Chorus 2]
Just let it take you (just let it take you)
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you (just let it take you)
Oh, this is easy

[Chorus 2]
Just let it take you (just let it take you)
Oh, let it steer
Just let it take you (just let it take you)
Oh, this is easy
