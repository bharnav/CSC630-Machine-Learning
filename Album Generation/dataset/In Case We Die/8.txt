There's a sword in your side
That you'll ignore until blood shows
And later on, when it's gone
When something's wrong
The violence grows and it's designed
To spy and try to poke your eyes
While laying low

Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights
There's never been a reason for
Shouting when it's quiet
But no-one's ever listening

Seven different reasons for satellites
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights
There's never been a reason for
Shouting when it's quiet
But no-one's ever listening

When you need to shout
No-one's ever listening
When you need to shout
No-one's ever listening

And don't go dragging your name
Through the mud and the rain
When it dries I know some dust that
Wants to get in your eyes

Put a stethoscope on
You'll notice the beat is gone
All that's left is hesitations
From your previous life

Don't go dragging your name
Through the mud and the rain
When it dries I know some dust that
Wants to get in your eyes

Put a stethoscope on
You'll notice the beat is gone
All that's left is hesitations
From your previous life
