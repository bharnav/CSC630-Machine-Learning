Maybe you can owe me?
Or should we wait and see?
'Cause I've been saving up for something we need
As long as you're open to the possibility, yeah

Surely, there's a story in counting all the minutes 'til July the 1st
But you counted all the seconds and it made you feel worse
I don't wanna be here
You just wanna be there
But it's awful complicated and you're warning me to beware

And honey, there's no hurry
I know it's overdue there's a key to the door
To the room where I'm staying
You can sleep on the floor
Half way through the night can we talk and see?
'Cause there's no way that I'll sleep when you're near me
