Frenchy, I'm faking, been longing to stir you up
Changing looks slightly like back in the '90s
Far and away whistle delayed delights
The prospect of lightning was ever so frightening

I said your kisses are nice but I'm looking for hills to roll
Down with abandon and no understanding
I borrowed your suitcase and filled it with pearls and gold
You let me down lightly, I killed you politely
