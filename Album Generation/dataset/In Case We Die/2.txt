Tonight the neon answers flare
Occasionally we'll stop to stare ... past
Tiny paintings, painted where
The clouds were wrong

With killer stares and sideways frowns
In keeping with, the universe all upside down
Twice, twice, twice
And broken legs and arms in slings
You cry secretly
You won't wear my diamond rings
Why? Why? Why?

A billion cares, a thousand stings
We lie frequently
Choose the chapter where they starts
Fights, fights, fights
And millionaires have bought this town
And changed everything
I found you in a lost and found
White, white, white!
