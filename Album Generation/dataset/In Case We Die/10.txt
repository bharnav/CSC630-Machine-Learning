[Intro]
Carve your name into my arms
'Cause I long to feel your name blood red

[Verse 1]
Leave our love life at the door
What's in store?
We don't know just yet
And that is why when we get together
There's no need to be clever

[Chorus]
Lightning struck at eleven same as last night
We talk deeper than weather
Baseball cap with a feather
Fire engine's here to quell the blaze in our life

[Bridge]
Sidestep neighbors full of lust
Good times rust
And the runaway's best

[Verse 2]
And when the love detector finds a spark
It's before dark when we couldn't care less
And that is why when we get together
There's no need to be clever

[Chorus]
Lightning struck at eleven same as last night
We talk deeper than weather
Baseball cap with a feather
Fire engine's here to quell the blaze in our life
