This country looks like one big car park
The winters are so very long
And everybody wonders where the light has gone

And shallow is moving state lines
But Africa has winter sun
And you and me we're just two creatures on the run
And we'll go where the crowds don't stare
And no one frowns at what we wear
For my fate
And we relocate

We fly over the endless ocean
We're heading for the winter sun
Cause you and me we're just two creatures on the run

And shallow is moving state lines
Africa has winter sunshine
And you and me, we're just 2 creatures on the run
We'll go where the crowds don't stare
And no one hates us for are hair
For my fate I've paid my stake
Oh we'll relocate

We'll fly over the endless ocean
We're heading for the winter sun
Cause you and me we're just two creatures on the run

America's our supermarket
In India we'll take some stopping
Cause you and me are just 2 creatures on the run

In Asia we could mend out breakdown
Cause you and me we must escape now
Cause you and me we're just two creatures on the run
You and me we're just two creatures on the run
You and me we're just two creatures on the run
You and me we're just two creatures on the run
