I'm shaking and aching and talking to the sky
And I shiver in the night but I can't sleep
You're dark as the mascara that drips down from your eyes
Look what you've done to me

You're as dark as the ocean, as cold as the rain
You got me weak with emotion, you're such a beautiful pain

So I shelter in the wardrobe and shiver on the stairs
And I slide in the gutter with the leaves
And I try to talk to God as if he is really there
Look what you've done to me

You're as dark as the ocean, as cold as the rain
You got me weak with emotion, you're such a beautiful pain
And I cling to my pillow and scratch at my veins, you kiss like a killer
You're such a beautiful pain
