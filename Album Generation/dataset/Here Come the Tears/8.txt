The pages burn, the babies scream
And lovers text in Japanese

The more you give the more they need
The more you live the less you see

Religion breeds like a disease
While people spit on refugees

The more you live the less you see
The more you give the more they need
In this brave new century

So mother where do I belong?
And mother what should I believe?
Just look what's happened to your son
In this brave new, in this brave new century

We sit and choke on magazines
And worship shit celebrities

The more you give the more they need
The more you live the less you see
In this brave new century

Century
Century
Century
Century
Century
Century
Century
