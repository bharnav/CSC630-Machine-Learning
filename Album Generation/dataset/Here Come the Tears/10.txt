When I hear the men outside my window
Kicking down my door
All the megaphones are screaming
Letters of them all
As you walk in through the gate and visit me
Would you please, in the asylum

When they're counting out the chemicals
And doing daily tasks
Giving out prescription drugs
And putting on their masks
Would you wonder through the ground
To visit me
As they opened up the gates
And send the key
Would you please, in the asylum

If they burn my brain away
Would you understand
If they try to hold me down
Would you hold my hand
Could you stand, stand the asylum

In the asylum
In the asylum
In the asylum
