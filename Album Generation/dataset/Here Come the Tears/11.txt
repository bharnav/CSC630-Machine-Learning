Estuary girl you're not the one
You don't belong to the world that I'm from
Your lazy words blow like confetti in the wind, in the wind
Estuary girl you're not part of my scene
Your feet don't belong on my upholstery
And sometimes I sink when you call me on the phone
On the phone

But if you follow me, I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo we'll fly to the moon
Yes if you follow me, I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo 13 we'll explode

Sad as a song, a child of the streets
Your skin don't belong on my designer sheets
In eyeliner you wrote me a note that I'll never read at all
Estuary girl

But if you follow me
I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo we'll fly to the moon
Yes if you follow me I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo 13 we'll explode

Yes if you follow me
I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo we'll sink like a stone
Yes if you follow me, I will follow you to the unknown
Like Apollo, like Apollo 13 we'll explode
