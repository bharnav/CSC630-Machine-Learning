I threw out the photographs
Like yesterdays flowers
I tried to erase the past
But it won't go away

I painted the second room
And cleared out the basement
And smelled some of your perfume
On the scarf that you made

The salvation army
Collected your things
I gave them the jewelry
All the bracelets and rings

Your clothes in black bin bags
I gave them away
I tried to move on
But the ghost of you stays
The ghost of you stays
The ghost of you stays

I threw out the photographs
Like yesterdays flowers
I tried to erase the past
But it won't go away

I wake in the morning
And try to be brave
But it's hard to move on
When the ghost of you stays

Oh-oh-oh (x6)

The ghost of you stays
The ghost of you stays
The ghost of you stays
