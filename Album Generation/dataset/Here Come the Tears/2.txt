Alone in my room
I switch on the tube
And wave at the screen
It stares back at me

So I turn to the sky
And watch as it cries
Just waiting in here
For the car to appear

Cause when we're together the world smiles And when we're together it feels right
We'll live for the future and its scenes
When we're together, my co-star and me

Your plane is delayed
So I walk from the gate
But when you appear
I'll stick to you dear

And we'll stumble outside
And dance in the sunlight
Like ice in the sun
We'll melt into one

And when we're together the world smiles
And when we're together it feels right
We'll live for the future and its scenes
When we're together, my co-star and me

When we're together the planets align
When we're together I burn from the inside
We'll live for forever in this insanity
When we're together, my co-star and me

When we're together the world smiles
And when we're together it feels right
We'll live for the future and its scenes
When we're together, my co-star and me

When we're together the planets align
When we're together the stars ever shine
We'll live for forever in this insanity
When we're together, my co-star and me
