Eyes that stare through television
Intermission in his mind
Where there once was such ambition
Blared like a bass line when the bass line's right

Shame he's just this fallen idol
Shattered like some broken glass
Shame he's just this fallen idol
Bits of paper for his past

Years are scattered like the rain drops
Sits at the window through the empty day
Competitions in the paper
Stares in the sky
When the sky turns grey

Shame he's just this fallen idol
Shattered like some broken glass
Shame he's just this fallen idol

Shame he's just this fallen idol
Scattered on the bit of grass
Shame he's just this fallen idol
Bits of paper for his past
Bits of paper for his past
