We're all looking for a love as strong as death

That's part of our minds and part of our flesh
Looking for a love
That takes away our breath
Equally heart and equally head

To be a wave that crashes over us
To be a wave that crashes over us
Like summer rain that washes over
Over us
Like summer rain that washes over

Looking for a love as strong as death
That's equally heart and equally head
And I wonder if this love that people say
Is as strong as death
Is out there somewhere
Or just in their heads

Is it a wave that crashes over us
Is it a wave that crashes over us
A summer rain that washes over
Over us
A summer rain that washes over
Over us

Over us
Over us
It's over
