If I could tear you from the ceilin'
And guarantee source divine
Rid you of possessions fleetin'
Remain your funny Valentine

[Chorus]
Dont go and leave me
And please, dont drive me blind
Dont go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind

If I could tear you from the ceilin'
I know best have tried
I'd fill your every breath with meanin'
And find the place we both could hide

Dont go and leave me
And please, dont drive me blind
Dont go and leave me
And please, don't drive me blind

[Chorus]

I know youre broken
I know youre broken
I know youre broken

If I could tear you from the ceilin'
Id freeze us both in time
And find a brand new way of seein'
Your eyes forever glued to mine

[Chorus]

Please, dont drive me blind
Please, dont drive me blind
Please, dont drive me blind
Please, dont drive me blind

I know you're broken
I know you're broken
I know you're broken
