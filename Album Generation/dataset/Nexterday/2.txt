You were my silver you were my gold
You were all the things that can't be told
You were my star falling through the night
You were the one who showed me grand delight
I can't see you but I need you
And you're gone
You were my right hand you were my friend
You were always strong until the end
You were my good time you were my rave

You're the one that always set the stage
You're what I once new now I miss you
'Cause you're gone
Now I spend my lonely nights
Wishing you were here to make things right
To turn my darkness into light
You were my party you were my tea
You're the one that had faith in me
