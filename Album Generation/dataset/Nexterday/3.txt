You can see the simple stars
The night comes on to you, yeah
You can go without a word
No long goodbyes for you, ha!
But you take it light, yeah
And you fly by night

Get your balance
(Balance)
Keep your balance
Oh, get your balance
Get your balance
(Balance)
Keep your balance
Oh, get your balance

Oh, you could feel your way around
You could knock on any door, ah, yeah
Even when you turn them down
Ah,there's someone wanting more, more and more
Well, you got it made
You better shoot the fade

C'mon, get your balance
(Balance)
Keep your balance
Oh, get your balance
Get your balance, oh
(Balance)
Oh, keep your balance
Oh, get your balance

Get your balance

Well, you got it made
Oh, you better shoot the fade

Oh, get your balance
(Balance)
Keep your balance
C'mon, get your balance
Yeah, yeah
Get your balance, oh
(Balance)
Oh, keep your balance
Come on, get your balance

Get your balance
(Balance)
(Keep your balance)
Oh, get your balance
