Carousel, up and down, up and down
Silly clown, there's rain in your shoes
Spin around, poison and pistols
They cut you down before they were through

Galleries, sleek lines in motion
Like wishing wells all covered with dreams
Alleyways you can't seem to cover
They cut you off before you can scream

(But soon)
But soon you will find yourself
(Soon)
And soon you will sleep
(How)
And how can you hide yourself
From something so deep
From something so deep

(Soon you will sleep)

Filigree, Eighth Avenue sideshow
What you see is falling around
All along they spike you with train fare
You know them all, they hang up your flag

(Soon)
But soon you will find yourself
(Soon)
And soon you will sleep
(How)
And how can you hide yourself
From something so deep
From something so deep

Up and down
Carousel, up and down, up and down
Silly clown there's rain in your shoes
