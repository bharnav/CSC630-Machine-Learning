All the falling freeze
The sunlit home of reality
It's a big step for you
But you got nowhere to go
Oh, don't you try to leave it
In the middle of exploding stars
I don't need covers for a night, oh, yeah

But soon you'll want to wait
Settle down in the sea of late

You gotta touch down easy
When it's getting dark
You gotta touch down easy
To hit the mark
You gotta touch down easy
When you feel the spark, oh
'Cause I'll be on my way
Yeah, I'll be on my way

You'll be falling free
Or else you need a little bit of sunshine
It's a big step for you
I won't see you smile every Sunday
I know that you're feeling wobbly
And at times you get so lonely
No one to see, no one to tell
That you were feeling that bad

But you got hope
When you look out your window
Settle down in the sea of fate

You gotta touch down easy
When it's getting dark
You gotta touch down easy
To hit the mark
You gotta touch down easy
When you feel that spark, oh
'Cause I'll be on my way
Oh, I'll be on my way
Touch down

You got hope
When you look out your window
Settle down in the sea of fate

Oh, you gotta touch down easy
When it's getting too dark
You gotta touch down easy
When you hit the mark
You gotta touch down easy
When you feel the spark, yeah
'Cause I'll be on my way

Oh, you gotta touch down easy
Touch down
(Touch down easy, so easy)
You gotta touch down easy, oh, yeah
I'll be on my way
