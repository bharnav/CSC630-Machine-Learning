How about a quick one
How about a quick one
The endless night has just begun

You know it's never like it seems
And when you wake up
It's gonna feel just like a dream
So won't you hold on, come on, hold on
Don't you leave me here tonight
'Cause everything will be alright

I know it's hard for you to take
When in the distance
You don't want to make the same mistake
So won't you hold on, ooh, hold on
Don't want to lose your dawn delight
Don't want to ever say goodnight

How about a quick one
How about a quick one
The endless night has just begun

There's gonna be blue stars tonight
And when you wake up
There's going to be a different light
So won't you hold on, come on, hold on
Don't you leave me here tonight
'Cause everything will be alright

I don't need a stranger touch
Just for something new
I'm not looking for too much
But love, it's overdue

You know it's never like it seems
And when you wake up
It's gonna feel just like a dream
So won't you hold on, hold on

Don't you leave me here tonight
'Cause everything will be alright
So hold on, hold on

You think it's too good to be true
'Cause there's someone falling over you
Hold on...
