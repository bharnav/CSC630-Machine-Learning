Well, you look just like a stranger
And they're keeping you down
But still you're feeling the ties
Slipping and a sliding
Through the lost and found
In your Egyptian disguise

Oh, what a thrill it is to see you
But I forgot your name
Oh, oh, what do you say
Can't live over yesterday
I carry you in my heart
And sometimes the memory smarts, yeah

(True to you)
I'm true to you
If you really think you want my love
I'm true to you
(True to you)
I'm true to you

Well, you never really wanted
What you already had
But still what do you got
Every little feeling
That you tend to bend
You keep it held in a slot, yeah
What a thrill it is to see you
But I forgot your name

Oh, oh, it's alright
You never wanna feel contrite
I carry you in my heart
But sometimes, honey, the memory smarts, yeah

(True to you)
I'm true to you
If you really think you want my love
I'm true to you
(True to you)
I'm true to you

Oh, oh, what can you say
Can't live over yesterday
I carry you in my heart
But sometimes, darling, the memory smarts, yeah

(True to you)
Oh, I'm true to you
If you really think you want my love
I'm true to you
(True to you)
I'm true to you

I'm true to you
(True to you)
If you really think you want my love
I'm true to you
(True to you)
It's only you I'm thinking of

I'm true to you
(True to you)
If you really think you want my love
I'm true to you
(True to you)
It's only you I'm thinking of

I'm true to you
I'm true to you
(True to you)
(True to you)
I'm true to you
(True to you)
I'm true to you
(True to you)
