I don't want no woman telling me what to do
I don't want no woman telling me what to do
Well, I'm grown now, darling, just as grown as you

I don't want no woman telling me this and that
No, I don't want no woman telling me this and that
Yes, it makes me mad, darling, and I don't go for that

You drink your whiskey, I'll drink my wine
You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine

I don't want no woman, telling me how to live my life
Yes, I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife

You used to boss your man, that I can't deny
Before I let you boss me, I lay down and die

I don't want no woman telling me how to live my life
Yes, I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife, oh yeah
