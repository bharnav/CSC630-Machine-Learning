I'm not ashamed 'cause you saw me crying
I'm not angry 'cause I caught you lying
Whoa, baby, no matter what you do
I'm gonna keep on loving you
And I'm not ashamed, oh no, I'm not ashamed

I'm not ashamed 'cause I fell on my knees
And begged you, baby, to take me back, please
Whoa, baby, some people call me the biggest fool in town
But I'm not ashamed, oh no, I'm not ashamed

Although you lie, scandalize my name
But I still love you just the shame
I'm not ashamed 'cause you saw me crying
I'm not angry 'cause I caught you lying
Whoa, oh baby, no matter what you do
I'm gonna keep on loving you
And I'm not ashamed, oh no, I'm not ashamed

I'm not ashamed 'cause you saw me crying
I'm not angry 'cause I caught you lying
Whoa, and though baby, no matter what you do
I'm gonna keep on loving you
And I'm not ashamed, oh, I'm not ashamed
