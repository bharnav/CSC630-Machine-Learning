I shoulda stayed gone
When I left before
Cause you do me wrong
When we're together
But I keep coming back
Oh, Lord, for more

[Chorus]
When I leave this time
Whoa, Lord, make sure
It's understand that
This time, I'm gone for good
Many times I've left you
But I couldn't stay away too long
Thank God for the strength
That he gave to me to leave home
And still be strong

[Repeat Chorus]
It's been warm outside
But for me, but for me
There's been no sunshine
So hard for me to leave
But I finally made up my mind

[Repeat Chorus]
This time, baby, Lord
I'm not gonna let you
Worry me no more
And this time, baby
Don't even say nothing to me
Oh, Lord, bye, bye, baby
