[Verse 1]
Walking down the levee with my head hangin' low
Looking for my mama but she ain't here no more

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 2]
She won't cook my dinner, won't wash my clothes
Won't do nothing but walk the road

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 3]
My breakfast on the table and my coffee's getting cold
And mama's in the kitchen getting a sweet papa talk

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I think my baby's too good to die
Sometimes I think she should be buried alive

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 5]
I wish I had a nickel, I wish I had a dime
I wish I hadn't give myself a fabulous time

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 6]
Look at you mama, see what you got it done
You got my money now you broke and run

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

[Verse 6]
You made me get mad and you made me get sad
The going gets tougher than you ain't never had

[Hook]
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying
