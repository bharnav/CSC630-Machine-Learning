[Verse 1]
Now listen, honey, while I say
How could you tell me that you gone away?
And don't you say that we must part
While you won't break my aching heart?
You know I loved you true for many years
Loved you night and day
How can you leave me?
Can't you see my tears
And listen at me while I say

[Hook]
After you've gone
Left me crying
After you've gone
Ain't no deny
You feel blue
You gon' feel sad
You'll miss the best lovin' you ever had

[Verse 2]
And there come a time
Don't you forget it
There come a time
When you'll regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart gon' break like mine
You gon' want me only
After you've gone
After you've gone away

[Verse 3]
After you've gone, after we break up
After you've gone, you sure gon' wake up
You gon' find that you were blind
To let somebody, come around and change your mind
After the years, we've been together
Through dawn and tears, all kind of weather
Someday, blue and down-hearted
You wanna be with me
Right back where you started
After you've gone
After you've gone away
Yeah
After you've gone
After you've gone away
