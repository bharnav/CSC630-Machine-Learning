[Verse 1]
All my life I've been a traveling man
Said, all my life I've been a traveling man
Staying alone and doing the best I can
I hold my trunks down to Tennessee
I hold my trunks down to Tennessee
Hard to tell about a man like me

[Verse 2]
I met a girl I couldn't get her off my mind
Well, I met a girl I couldn't get her off my mind
She passed me up said she didn't like my kind
I'm scared to bark around her house at night
I'm scared to bark around her house at night
She Got a police dog that's craving for a fight

[Verse 3]
His name is Rambler and when he gets the chance
His name is Rambler and when he gets the chance
He leaves his mark on everybody's pants
I think I'll travel, I think I'll let her be
I think I'll travel, I think I'll let her be
Before she sits that police dog on me
Before she sits that dog on, dog on me
