[Verse 1]
They say the Whale swallowed Jonah
Out in the deep blue sea
Sometimes I get that feeling
That same old Whale has swallowed me

[Verse 2]
The sun rise in the East
Goes down in the West
Sometimes I get that feeling
Every creature needs some rest

[Verse 3]
I believe the Whale got sick
That's why I have this blues
I do believe one day
He will finally turn me loose

[Verse 4]
Now if I live
I pray, I don't get killed
I do believe one day
I will crawl out of here
