[Hook (x2)]
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 1]
You may talk about the bonds of Gideon
You may brag about your men of Saul
But you never saw nothing like Joshua
At the battle of Jericho
When the sun stopped shining in the middle of the day
The sky began to storm
The ram horns, the sheep horns began to blow
When the walls came tumbling down

[Verse 2]
Well I know you've heard about Joshua
He was the son of none
He never stopped his work until
Until the work was done
Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand
"Go blow them ram horns", Joshua cried, "'cos the battle is in my hands"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well the bible says that Joshua's spear was eight of those cubits long
And upon his hip was a double edged sword and his mouth was a gospel horn
Up to the walls of Jericho, he marched with spear in hand
"Go blow them ram horns", Joshua cried, "'cos the battle is in my hands"

[Hook (x2)]
