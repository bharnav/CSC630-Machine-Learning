I'm the wining boy don't deny my name
I'm the wining boy, don't deny my name
Deny my name
Wining boy don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake it, like Steve and Jane
I'm the wining boy don't deny my name

Mama, mama come here look at sis
Mama, mama come here look at sis
Oh, mama, mama want you look at sis
She's out on the levee doin' the double twist
I'm the wining boy don't deny my name

Yes, I'm the wining boy don't deny my name
I'm still the wining boy, don't deny my name
Deny my name, oh
Wining boy, don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake it, like Steve and Jane
I'm the wining boy don't deny my name
I'm the wining boy don't deny my name
