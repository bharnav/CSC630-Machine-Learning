[Verse 1]
Just remember me darling
When I'm in six feet of cold cold ground
Just remember me darling
When I'm in six feet of cold cold ground
Always think of me darling
Say yeah there's another good man gone down

[Verse 2]
Don't cry baby, baby after I'm gone
Don't cry baby, don't cry after I'm gone
I've left the good man love you
And I ain't do nothing wrong

[Verse 3]
Just lay my body, lay my body in six cold feet of ground
Just lay my body, in six cold feet of ground
While I will be the loser, when that deal goes down

[Verse 4]
Remember me baby, when I'm in six feet of cold cold ground
Remember me baby, when I'm in six feet of cold cold ground
Always think of me baby, say yeah there's another good man gone down
