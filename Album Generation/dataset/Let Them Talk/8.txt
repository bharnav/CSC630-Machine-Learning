[Verse 1: Irma Thomas]
John Henry had a little woman
And the dress she wore was red
She walked down the track
She never looked back

[Hook 1: Hugh Laurie & Irma Thomas]
I'm going where John Henry fell dead (x2)

[Verse 2: Irma Thomas]
John Henry had another woman
And her name was Polly Anne
John Henry was taken sick
And he had to go to bed

[Hook 2: Hugh Laurie & Irma Thomas]
Polly Anne drove steel like a man (x2)

[Verse 3: Irma Thomas]
John Henry told his little woman
Honey fix my supper soon
I got ninety-nine miles
Of track I wanna line back

[Hook 3: Hugh Laurie & Irma Thomas]
I'm gonna line 'em by the light of the moon (x2)

[Verse 4: Irma Thomas]
John Henry said to his captain
You know a man ain't nothin' but a man
I'm bettin' right now you won't beat me down

[Hook 4: Hugh Laurie & Irma Thomas]
I'm gonna die with my hammer in my hand (x2)

[Verse 5: Irma Thomas]
John Henry hammered in the mountain
Until his hammer caught on fire
The last word's I heard that the poor boy said

[Hook 5: Hugh Laurie & Irma Thomas]
Give me a cool drink of water before I die (x6)
