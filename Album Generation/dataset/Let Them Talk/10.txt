Well Loberta, well Loberta
Girl can't you hear me, callin' you?
You're three times seven, baby
You know just what you gotta do

Well Loberta, well Loberta
Girl you tell me, where you been
Well you got home this mornin'
You had your belly full o' gin

Well I say hurry, hurry, Loberta
Girl you got company waiting at home
Why don't you hurry, little Loberta?
Don't you leave that boy alone

Yeahh
Tipitina tra la la la
Tipitina tra la la
Tipitina hoola walla malla dalla
Tipitina tra la la
