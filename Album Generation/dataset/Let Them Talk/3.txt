[Verse]
Thought I heard, buddy bolden say
The nasty and dirty, take it away
You're terrible and awful, take it away
I thought I heard him say
Thought I heard, buddy bolden shout
Open up that window, and let that bad air out
Open up that window, and let that stinky air out
Thought I heard buddy bolden say
Thought I heard judge Fogerty say
Give him 30 days in the market
Take him away
Give him a broom to sweep with
Take him away
Thought I heard him say
Thought I heard Franky Dirson say
Gimme that money, girl
Or I'm gonna, I'm gonna take it away
Gimme that money you owe me, or I'll take it away
Thought I heard Franky Dirson say
