[VI. You Are Forgiven: Verse 7]
Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang
Cello cello cello cello cello cello cello cello
I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

[Verse 8]
It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again
I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap
You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven

[ad lib]

[Outro]
You are forgiven
