I still get up and make enough coffee for two
And every day, when I pray, I still thank God for you
Even though my friends all tell me that you're long gone
I'm gonna keep hangin' on to you
When my heart ain't hurtin', when I've got you off my mind
When I know that I can make it through one day without tryin'
When I convince myself that I am really all alone
Baby, that's when I'll believe that you're gone
Here I am makin' plans for forever
Me and you, what to do we've done everything together
My imagination's workin' overtime
The pain has made me blind to the truth
But when my heart ain't hurtin', when I've got you off my mind
When I know that I can make it through one day without tryin'
When I convince myself that I am really all alone
Baby, that's when I'll believe that you're gone
On my own terms
In my own time
Soon enough, I'll admit
You're no longer mine
When my heart ain't hurtin', when I've got you off my mind
When I know that I can make it through one day without cryin'
When I convince myself that I am really all alone
Baby, that's when I'll believe that you're gone
Baby, that's when I'll believe that you're gone, you're gone
