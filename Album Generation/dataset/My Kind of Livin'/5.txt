My car broke down on our first date;
We missed the movie an' we never ate;
It was freezin' cold an' the heater broke
I apologized: you kissed me goodnight
An said: "It couldn't have been any better."
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever

If you like that ring you saw in the window
In the jewellery store down town
If you like tuxedos an' white satin dresses
Maybe you better sit down
If you like driftin' off to soft pillow talk
An wakin' up together
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever

If you like livin' on a rural route
Fixin' up an' old farmhouse
Hugs with your coffee and your good mornin's with a kiss
If you like startin' a fire on a cold winter's night
An' makin' dreams come true together:
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever

If you like that movie we saw last September:
The one you cried half way through
If you liked that scene where he got down on one knee
Girl, have I got somethin' for you
If you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time
An' keeps gettin' better an' better
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever

If you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time
An' keeps gettin' better an' better
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever
