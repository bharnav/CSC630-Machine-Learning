As he climbed in the chute, the crowd held it's breath:
He was seconds from glory or moments from death
They knew with this bull, it could go either way
He said: "Let her go boys, an' pray."

He hung on for eight but he couldn't get loose:
That's when a clown they call Crazy came to his rescue
When the dust finally settled, they both walked away
Yeah, they became best of friends that day

The cowboy an' clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles an' beers, winnin' an' losin':
Laughter an' tears, broken hearts an' bruises
They lived for the next final round:
The cowboy an' clown

From Denver to Dallas, to the Calgary Stampede:
They took all those towns, an' a few in between
But it ernded one night, in a West Texas town:
The bulls either got faster, or ol' Crazy slowed down

Five hundred pick-ups, lights on, drivin' slow
A tent on the hill at the end of the road
When the last Bible closed, one cowboy stayed
He said: "Let her go boys, and pray."

The cowboy an' clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles an' beers, winnin' an' losin':
Laughter an' tears, broken hearts an' bruises
They lived for the next final round:
The cowboy an' clown
