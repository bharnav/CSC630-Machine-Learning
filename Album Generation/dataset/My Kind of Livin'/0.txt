[Verse 1]
Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out

[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Outro]
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah
