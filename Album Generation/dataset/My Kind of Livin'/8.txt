It's ninety eight in the shade
Mr. Rose is rolling hay
Eighty acres down and ten to go
Clouds are building in the south
He knows times a running out
And there goes that tractor's radiator hose

There ain't no tricks in his straw hat
He walks a quarter mile back
Ms. Rose hears him slam that old screen door
What he sees as wasted time
Is a blessing in disguise
Oh he's cussing what she's been praying for

The day turned dark as night
And in her eyes he saw the light
He hadn't taken the time to notice
From heaven it poured down
On that little old farm house
Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
He sends rain for the Roses

She pulled down the window blinds
Even though the sun wadn't shining
The rain tapped out a love song on that old tin roof
Wrapped up in the covers
They held on to eachother
Like new lovers on their honeymoon

The day turned dark as night
And in her eyes he saw the light
He hadn't taken the time to notice
From heaven it poured down
On that little old farm house
Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
He sends rain for the Roses

Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
He sends rain (backup)
The lord sends rain
For the Roses
