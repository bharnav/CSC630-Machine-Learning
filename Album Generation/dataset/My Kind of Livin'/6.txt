Ol' Jimmy, a real hard worker, loadin' trucks at the Feed and Save
Well-liked, a really nice fella: that's why it's hard to believe
One day, two counties over, he got caught with another man's wife
Shots fired, smoke cleared: her husband took Jimmy's life
In an instant, all the good stuff he'd ever done was all gone
Now everybody just remembers the one thing that he did wrong

You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye
It can all turn around
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years
Without 20 seconds from right now
That ain't the way that I wanna go out

Rob Jenkins, sittin' on the back pew: head bowed an' his eyes closed
Preacher talkin' 'bout gettin' to Heaven, said: "Brother would you like to go?"
White knuckles holdin' his Hymnal, while the choir sang Amazing Grace
He stands up, full of conviction: turns 'round an' runs out of that place
Off in his truck, says to himself: "Next Sunday, I'm a-gonna get saved."
Runs a red light, hit broadside an' next Sunday is way too late

You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye
It can all turn around
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years
Without 20 seconds from right now
That ain't the way that I wanna go out

I'm gonna do right, an' make sure I ask forgiveness before I go:
I'm gonna take time, 'cause it's a fine line
Between here an' "You never know."

You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye
It can all turn around
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years
Without 20 seconds from right now
That ain't the way that I wanna go out
That ain't the way that I wanna go out
No I don't wanna go out
