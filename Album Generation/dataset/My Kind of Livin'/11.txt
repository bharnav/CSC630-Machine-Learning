If you see a pickup truck with a plastic coon dog mounted on the hood
If you pass a trailer with a concrete donkey in the yard and tires up on the roof
And if you see a woman in a moomoo reading Tarot cards and palms down by the road
That's how you know, that's how you know, you're in my neighborhood

In my neighborhood there's nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
In my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
A word to the wise when they turn out the lights it's a free for all ya'll every Saturday night
But everybody treats everybody the way they should
In my neighborhood

When the wind is just right you can tell they're making paper at the mill on Champion Lane
When Mabel Johnson goes to frying rocky mountain oysters you can smell em' from a mile away
You might hear the church bells playing Sweet Home Alabame cause the preacher loves rock and roll
That's how you know, that's how you know, you're in my neighborhood

In my neighborhood there's nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
In my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
A word to the wise when they turn out the lights it's a free for all ya'll every Saturday night
But everybody treats everybody the way they should
In my neighborhood

In my neighborhood there's nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
In my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
A word to the wise when they turn out the lights it's a free for all ya'll every Saturday night
But everybody treats everybody the way they should
In my neighborhood

In my neighborhood
