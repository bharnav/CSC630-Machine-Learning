Yeah, tonight it's goin' down
You know we've been waitin' much too long for this, girl
It's time to get it on, yeah, old school style
Tonight it's goin' down, keep it grown, keep it sexy, come on

I've been waitin' on you forever
I'm not gonna even front
And it's gonna get so much better
Can't wait till the moment comes

When I get to squeeze you in your arms
And lay you on your bed
Excuse me if I kiss it for a little girl
I like it when it's nice and wet

It makes me feel good
To know that you're waitin' for it
I make it so good
I hope that you're ready for it
'Cause I'm about to turn off the lights

Tonight it's goin' down
We're in the final round
It's time to close the deal
Gonna sex it up in here

Tonight we're makin' babies
We've been waitin' much too long
Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on
Tonight will be the night
Of all of the nights, tonight, tonight, yeah girl

More than just a little bit excited
I've been holdin' it for days
And when I get with you tonight
I'm gonna make you call my name

Got the right vibe and it's blowin'
Got the candlelight and it's glowin'
Got you right now and I got you goin'
Oh, let's take it all the way

It makes me feel good
To know that you're waitin' for me
I'll make it so good
I hope that you sing for me
'Cause we 'bout to make love tonight

Tonight it's goin' down
We're in the final round
It's time to close the deal
Gonna sex it up in here

Tonight we're makin' babies
We've been waitin' much too long
Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on
Tonight will be the night
Of all of the nights, tonight, tonight

Tonight will be the dreams
Of all of your dreams, tonight, tonight
Tonight I'll make you scream
Like you never screamed, tonight, tonight
Oh, baby, it's gonna be everything you wanted to be
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight it's goin' down
We're in the final round
It's time to close the deal
Gonna sex it up in here

Tonight we're makin' babies
We've been waitin' much too long
Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on

Tonight it's goin' down
We're in the final round
It's time to close the deal
Gonna sex it up in here

Tonight we're makin' babies
We've been waitin' much too long
Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on
Tonight will be the night
Of all of the nights, tonight, tonight
Tonight it's goin' down

Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on, tonight
Tonight it's goin' down
It's time to get it on, tonight
Tonight it's goin' down
