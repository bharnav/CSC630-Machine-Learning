About you, about you
It's the, it's the

Early evening conversation
Sharing how the day went down
Cancel dinner reservation
'Cause I'd rather just hang out
Just the two of us

Sitting at home just watchin' movies
Or just be chillin' at the crib
Call up and order us some take out
Or maybe somethin' from the fridge
Then have some one on one

Sometimes we wake up too each other
Wrapped inside each others arms
Oh, what I wish that we were lovers
But you don't want to go that far
That's not who you are
You wanna know what's in my heart
Then open your arms

It's the getting to know you
All about you
It's the thing I most desire
Getting to know you
Being around you
Turns the passion into fire
And I'm so alive
Everyting I look into your eyes
I'm falling in love

Early morning conversation
Blowin' kisses through the phone
Knowing your thoughts before you say them
See I just called to say hello
Ain't it wonderful

The way I feel when we're together
Especially when you're in my arms
I can make love to you forever
But you don't want to go that far
That's not who you are
You wanna know what's in my heart
Then open your arms

It's the getting to know you
All about you
It's the thing I most desire
Getting to know you
Being around you
Turns the passion into fire
And I'm so alive
Everytime I look into your eyes
I'm falling in love

(bridge)
(Everyday's a)
Everyday's a cause for celebrating
(So amazed I'm)
I'm so amazed you spend your time with me
(My anticiapa-ting)
See every day is a brighter day anticipating
Ooh, I'm
This might be the night
That you-
Make love-
Sweet!
