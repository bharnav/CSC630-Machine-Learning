V 1

Now I got you all alone
Nobody else is home
Don't you like it
When I kiss it a thousand times
All up and down your thighs, and all around it
Take off your clothes, and come to me
I want to make your body feel like ecstasy
Ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh baby baby, please love me

Chorus

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
And I don't know how
Cause you know it'd be too hard
If we stopped it right now and it didn't go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it, ooh

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
So baby don't fight it cause you know I get excited
Just don't make me stop now, its gotta go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it
You can't stop now

V 2

Now you got me on overload
Think I might just explode
I can't hide it and uh
And I know you wanted to
I can feel it inside of you, can't deny it, no
(Bring)
So bring it close, closer to me
I wanna feel your body, feel your ecstasy
And ooh baby baby
Ooh baby, baby, please, love, me

Chorus

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
And I don't know how
Cause you know it'd be too hard
If we stopped it right now and it didn't go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it, ooh

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
So baby don't fight it cause you know I get excited
Just don't make me stop now, its gotta go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it
Cuz You can't stop now

Bridge

Baby I can (Baby I can)
I can go fast (I can go fast)
Slower (slower)
Give you, all your heart desires
Baby I will (Baby I will)
I'll make it last
Show you, I will
I'll set your world on fire, baby

Chorus

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
And I don't know how
Cause you know it'd be too hard
If we stopped it right now and it didn't go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it, ooh

Girl we can't stop now, we done gone too far
So baby don't fight it cause you know I get excited
Just don't make me stop now, its gotta go down
If the body wants to do it, just do it
You can't stop now
