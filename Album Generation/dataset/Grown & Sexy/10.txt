God must love you I said to myself
'Cause you're more beautiful than
Anybody else
God must adore you, it's easy to tell
Must be wonderful to wake up to yourself
From the moment I first saw you
Had a vibe that's fit to kill
It was then you know that I knew love was real

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be

God must love you he's proud of himself
When he made you girl he broke the mold for real
There's just something 'bout you that you can't even tell
It's the way you flow you don't even know that you got that wip appeal
From the moment I first saw you, had your vibe on "set to kill"
It was then you know that I knew love was real

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be

Never thought love could be real
Suddenly I see your face and I get chills
And everything I never thought I could feel is for real
Love is real

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be
