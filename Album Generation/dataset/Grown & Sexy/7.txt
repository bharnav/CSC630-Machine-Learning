Its a good day even though we argued last monday
We made up again by late thursday
Making love as sweet as red kool-aid
It's a good day even though I hated you wednesday
I didn't like the things you said to me
But I forgot it all by next tuesday

And even though we fuss and fight (you know we always make amends, yes we do, yes we do)
And everything will be alright cause we'll fall in love again, oh yea

So put your hands up, celebrate everyday that you got love
In the end at least you got someone
Ain't it good to know, that it's good to be in love
So put your hands up, realive, recognize that you got love
It ain't a party without your lil' someone
Ain't it good to know that it's good to be in love

It's a good day even though we fought again friday
It was on again by that sunday
Making up like it was your birthday
It's a good day even though the drama on monday
Seem to last forever on that day
But we got back together like we was fresh in love

And even though we fuss and fight (you know we always make amends, yes we do, yes we do)
And everything will be alright because we'll fall in love again, oh yea

So put your hands up, celebrate everyday that you got love
In the end at least you got someone
Ain't it good to know, that it's good to be in love
So put your hands up, realive, recognize that you got love
It ain't a party without your lil' someone
Ain't it good to know that it's good to be in love

Step to the left step to the right
Put your hands up from side to side
Celebrate love celebrate life celebrate the bad and the good times
Step to the left step to the right
Put your hands up from side to side
Celebrate love celebrate life celebrate the bad and the good times

And even though we fuss and fight (you know we always make amends, yes we do, yes we do)
And everything will be alright cause we'll fall in love again, oh yea

So put your hands up, celebrate everyday that you got love
In the end at least you got someone
Ain't it good to know, that it's good to be in love
So put your hands up, realive, recognize that you got love
It ain't a party without your lil' someone
Ain't it good to know that it's good to be in love

(Repeat until fade)
So put your hands up, celebrate everyday that you got love
In the end at least you got someone
Ain't it good to know, that it's good to be in love
So put your hands up, realive, recognize that you got love
It ain't a party without your lil' someone
Ain't it good to know that it's good to be in love
