[Hook]:
Oooh
Oooh

[Verse 1]:
People can't be hand-made
But he keeps slaving away
At a stone that's too hard to break
A girl who's too lost to save

[Chorus 1]:
So you tried to replace me
But you didn't get far
And I tried to repay you
But I only got scarred

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
She'll be breaking your fall
And I'll be building new walls
But this time I'll have to make sure
To add a window for you to come back

[Chorus]:
And we tried to be faithful
But didn't get far
Now all we'll be left with
Is four broken hearts
I tried to erase you
But didn't get get far
Enough away from you because
You still can break my heart

[Hook]
