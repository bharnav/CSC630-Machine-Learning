[Verse 1]
I never told you about the summer
Every day was changing
Only photographs
But life goes on
In your mind so warm

[Verse 2]
Out on my own now
And I like the way it feels
You couldn't come through
And I'm too far gone

[Verse 3]
After the fall
Do you still want it all?

[Verse 4]
You never told me about the winter
Every day was changing
But I remember
But life went on
In my mind so cold

[Verse 5]
Out on your own now
Do you like the way it feels?
Didn't I come through?
You were too far gone

[Outro]
After the fall
I still want it all
