[Verse 1]
You said I was a back seat driver
You said I was a back seat driver
You said I was a back seat driver
You said I was a back seat...

[Verse 2]
You said I was the road map reader
You said I was the road map reader
You said I was the road map reader
You said I was the road map...

[Verse 3]
You said I was the driving licence
You said I was the driving licence
You said I was the driving licence
You said I was the driving licence

[Chorus]
On the road, on the road, on the road
On your own, on the road, on the road

[Verse 4]
You said I was the handbrake
You said I was the handbrake
You said I was the handbrake
You said I was the handbrake

[Verse 5]
You said I was the glove compartment
You said I was the glove compartment
You said I was the glove compartment
You said I was the glove compartment

[Crorus]
On the road, on the road, on the road
On your own, on the road, on the road
