When you get home there's gonna be a big present waiting on your bedside table, you said
Its your Stanley knife smile cutting into me

That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why
That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why

So you sit there sister getting cold and lonely
Camel lights to keep you warm
You're in a great big car now
Polluting that coffee cup that's never looked so good
It's the way you say my name like you're joking

That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why
That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why

You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that
You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that
You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that
You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that
You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that
You're not gonna get very far with a smile like that

That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why
That's why I cover my ears when you talk to me
That's why
