Last night, i had a dream about everybody here
You were all wearing smart red tops in the opening scene
Looking at me kinda strange 'cos i was wearing old jeans

Talking to each other
The cigarettes you smoke have no smoke to blow

(at me) a little word in your ear
(at me) a little word in your ear, girl
(at me) a little word in your ear
(at me) a little word in your ear, girl

You've got the days mixed up in your diary
You sent the moment back to have it redone
Because you sing, but i know that you'll never sing to me
Comes to my attention, that when you talk, you always talk..

(at me) a little word in your ear
(at me) a little word in your ear, girl

(ad libby-singing;
Talk a little.. sing a sad.. little song.. oh why, so little.. such high, no.. high high.. sunrise here)

A little word in your ear
A little word in your ear, girl
A little word in your ear
A little word in your ear

(at me) a little word in your ear
(at me) a little word in your ear, girl
(at me) a little word in your ear
(at me) a little word in your ear, girl
(etc, ad infinitum)
