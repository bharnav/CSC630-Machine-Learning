If I said that we could fly
Around the world two thousand times
If i said that baby your smile
Had taken me by surprise

If I had changed my mind, would I be here

You groan to passing guests
Your car has run out of gas
If i said you're working to hard
Would you be there in my mind

If I had changed my mind, would I be here

Would I be, could I be, here, come on

If I had changed my mind, would I be here

Would I be here
