[Verse 1]
Your carpet is blue so that it matches your shoes, it's the way the drains smoke in New York and it's in everything you do. You bashed your head and I found something to do; I made up memories of me and you, it's like playing with your food, it's like playing with your food, it's like playing with your food

[Chorus]
That can be arranged, she said, that can be arranged. That can be arranged, she said, that can be arranged

[Verse 2]
When I see litter on the streets, I think of you, it's the way you talk in twos, and it's whatever I fell through. How many radiators have you got on in your house? Do they make you feel warm at night? Do they tell you what to do? Do they tell you what to do?

[Chorus]
That can be arranged, she said, that can be arranged. That can be arranged, she said, that can be arranged

[Bridge]
That can be arranged(x4)

[Verse 3]
Your carpet is red so that it matches your hair, it's the way the neon buzzes in Las Vegas, yeah

[Outro]
It's in everything you do [x16]
