Looks like it's over being summer
Looks like it's all going to rot
Looks like you know who your friends are
Looks like you know who to trust
Looks like I'm opening doors now
Looks like I close 'em behind
With a pocketful of polaroids
I'll take your picture again

The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become
The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become

Looks like we'll talk to our friends now
Looks like it's coming to an end
Looks like I'm taking you with me
We went too fast through the bend
Looks like I'm covering window
Looks like the moon is our friend
I'm sitting here waiting for nighttime
All your seasons independ

The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become
The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become

The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become
The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become

The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become
The lower the sun
The taller the shadows become
