[Verse]
Travelling time, we're travelling time
Passing us by, life's passing us by
Show me your fear, I'll show you freedom
Give me your faith, I'll give you a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you waiting?
Why you waiting?

[Chorus]
See the blue horizon
And the beauty there
If we take the leap together
We can walk on air
See the mountain ranges
So beyond compare
If we take the leap together
We can walk on air

[Post-Chorus]
See the blue
See the blue

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
