I've been waiting

Living life in rewind like I'm frozen in time and place
And I'm fading
Falling further behind every step that I try to take
I've been hiding
From the heat of the sun, watching everyone come and go
Let some light in
Cuz I can't see a thing and there's so much I need to know

I wanna know you better
I wanna take you for a ride
Go on a wild adventure
Not let a moment pass me by

Turn out the lights
Turn up the bass
I wanna be front and center
Bring on the night
There's no time to waste
I wanna live forever
Turn out the lights
Turn up the bass
I wanna be front and center
Bring on the night
There's no time to waste
I'm gonna live forever

Can you hear it?
Like the beat of your heart, an electrical spark inside
Let the feeling
From the force of the sound lift you up off the ground tonight
I'm addicted
It's like a chemical high, yea I feel so alive right now
Take a picture
Cuz it's all gonna pass
This is too good to last, and I'm moving too fast to slow down

Turn out the lights
Turn up the bass
I wanna be front and center
Bring on the night
There's no time to waste
I wanna live forever
Turn out the lights
Turn up the bass
I wanna be front and center
Bring on the night
There's no time to waste
I'm gonna live forever
