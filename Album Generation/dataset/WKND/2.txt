I know a thing or two about you
And I think you find the best of me
Sometimes in search for high
You take a blow
But nothing can make you complete

The game is up
The truth is out there
Your time is up
Can't take it back

Sometimes in search for high
You take a blow
What we've got
Ain't no stop
Ain't no stoppin' a good thing

Ain't no stoppin' a good thing
Ain't no stoppin' a good thing

Ain't no stop
Ain't no stop
Ain't no stoppin' a good thing

I know a thing or two about you
And I think you find the best of me
Sometimes in search for high
You take a blow
But nothing can make you complete

The game is up
The truth is out there
Your time is up
Can't take it back

Sometimes in search for high
You take a blow
What we've got
Ain't no stop
Ain't no stoppin' a good thing
