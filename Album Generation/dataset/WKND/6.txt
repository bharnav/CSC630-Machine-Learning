You said you'd leave the light on
You said a lot of things that never were
For every word I hang on
You find a way to lead me on
Wasn't how it was supposed to be
But the truth is that I am more than OK with it
It's not the way I thought that it would be
But I'm feeling so much better when I say
No no no, I rather let you go
I gotta let you go
No no no, I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
You said I turned your light on
You said I was a fire in your life
You must have had your game on
Because I dunno where that light has gone
It wasn't how it was supposed to be
But the truth is that I am more than OK with it
It's not the way I thought that it would be
But I'm feeling so much better when I say
No no no, I rather let you go
I gotta let you go
No no no, I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I should've have seen the signs but
Wanting you made me lose my mind
No no no, I rather let you go
I gotta let you go
No no no, I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
