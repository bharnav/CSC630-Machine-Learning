What's the way to live
What's the way to love
Why do we fight so much
We can make it better for all of us
Tell me why this world is not enough
'Cause the world never stops spinning round and round
We can never slow it down
All we need is just a little more love
Just a little more love
'Cause love will, love will make it right
It's the key tonight
Just share a little love inside, inside inside
'Cause love will, love will make it right
It's the key tonight
Just share a little love inside, inside inside
