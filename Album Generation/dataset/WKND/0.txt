Can darkness be bright
Turn gloom into light
A day without rain
Let go of the pain

Hearts are estranged
Nothing but fear
A moment is gone
Clouds drifting near

When miracles start
Some won't break through
Can't hold it back
Emotions are skewed

Can darkness be bright
Turn gloom into light
A day without rain
Let go of the pain

Visions have clashed
Silence is here
Emptiness found
So close, so near
I walk along the miles
Looking for signs
Find some small hope
A moment that shines

Can darkness be bright
Turn gloom into light
A day without rain
Let go of the pain
