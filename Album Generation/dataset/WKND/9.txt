Without you i can’t live and breath
Love doesn’t’ end just because I don’t see you
Whatever I have been told over you
I would be first in night
In your eyes I almost forget in your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
Hold the air is .. with your pray
Change will make me run in circles
I could melt like a .. on the floor kiss and make
Like a .. on my floor
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
In your eyes I am lost again
