[Verse 1]
Got to get some food
I'm so hungry all the time
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Verse 2]
Got to get some sleep
I'm so nervous in the night
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Verse 3]
I got to pick up the phone
I will call any number
I will talk to anyone
I know I've gone too far
Much too far I gone this time
I don't want to think what I've done
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Bridge]
There are always hidden silences
Waiting behind the chair
They come out when the coast is clear
They eat anything that moves
I go shaky at the knees
Lights go out, stars come down
Like a swarm of bees

[Refrain]
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self...
No, no

[Verse 3]
You know I hate to hurt you
I hate to see your pain
But I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop

[Verse 4]
Street after street
Night after night
I walk on through the rain
I walk on through the rain
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Hey, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
