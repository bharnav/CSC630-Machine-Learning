[Verse 1]
I had a roof overhead
Had shoes on my feet
Sure I was fed, but no-one was there
When I was in need, yeah
So who am I now?
Who do you want me to be?
I can forgive you, but I won't relieve you
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be

[Chorus]
I'm going to live
I'm going to  survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm going to dream
I ain't going to die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I want to be loved [2x]

[Verse 2]
I found a picture
Our so-called family tree, yeah
I broke all the branches, looking for answers
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be

[Chorus]
I'm going to live
I'm going to survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm going to dream
I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I want to give
I'm ready to try
Willing to lay it on the line
I want to be loved
I want to be

[Bridge]
I ain't going to  cry
I dont want to scream
But i got so much left unsaid inside of me

[Chorus]

I just want to  be loved
I want to be loved [2x]
