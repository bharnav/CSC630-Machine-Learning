[Verse 1]
She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies
If you don't follow what I mean
I sure don't mean to be confusing
They say when she laughs she wants to cry
She'll draw a crowd then try to hide
Don't know if it's her or just my mind I'm losing

[Chorus 1]
Nobody knows a wildflower still grows
By the side of the road
And she don't need to need like the roses
Wildflower

[Verse 2]
That girl's sure put a spell on me
Yeah, her voodoos hidden right behind her pocket
If she's fire, I'm gasoline
Yeah, we fight a lot but neither wants to stop it
Well, she'll tell you she's an only child until you meet her brothers
Swear she's never met the man she couldn't make into a lover

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Yesterday's a memory
Tomorrow's accessory
That's her favorite quote about regret
Well, she'll tell you about her pedigree
With a sailor's mouth he'd have left at sea and it ain't over yet

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Nobody knows [x3]
That's right
She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies
