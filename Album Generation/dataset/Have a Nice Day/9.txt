[Verse 1]
Take a look around, this is what I see
Is there anybody else that feels like me?
You sweat, you sweat
You bleed, you bleed
What you get ain't what you see
Up is down and black is white to me

[Chorus 1]
I'm complicated
I get frustrated
Right or wrong, love or hate it
I'm complicated
Can't sudate it
I heard that song, but i won't play it
It's alright
It's okay
You wouldn't want me any other way
Momma, keep on praying, cause I ain't changing
I'm complicated

Complicated, Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm smart enough to know what I don't know
I'm fool enough to stay when I should go
You work, you work
You cry, you cry
You watch your whole life pass you by
Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to see

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Complicated
