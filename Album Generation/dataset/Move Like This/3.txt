Too many screamers
Wearing a mask
Too many dreamers
Looking for the ones that last

Too many eyes
Looking for hope
Too many tears
Looking for a way to cope
It's no joke

It's just a sad song
That pulls you along, yeah
It's just a sad song
And it won't take long

Too many thoughts
Breaking your stride
Too many Jekylls
Feeling like a Mr. Hyde

Too many clouds
Darken your day
Too many raindrops
Falling on your thunder bay
Everyday
Yeah

It's just a sad song
That pulls you along, yeah
It's just a sad song
And you're getting it on

It's just a sad song
That pulls you along
It's just a sad song

And it won't take long

Too many heartaches
Waiting to strike
Too many clowns
Saying everything's alright

Too many fires
Scorching your mind
Too many preachers
Saying what you should find
Just see the signs

It's just a sad song
That pulls you along, yeah
It's just a sad song
And it won't take long

It's just a sad song
It pulls you along
It's just a sad song
And it won't take long

It's just a sad song
A sad song yeah

It's just a sad song
And you're getting it on

It's just a sad song
Sad song
It's just a sad song
And it won't take long
