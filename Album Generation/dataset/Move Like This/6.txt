I was sucking on the sorry stights
I was watching out for things that bite
I was tripping on my own two feet
I was feeling like I got on sleep
And my thoughts were getting unrestrained
And I was looking like Ichabod Crane
I was looking for some serious fun
Cause a bad excuse is better than none
Then it hits me

It hits me
I gotta just get through it
And I'll be fine
Yeah, it hits me
I gotta just get through these changing times

Oh, I was paranoid about the signs
They say it's just another dangerous time
I don't answer, I just decompose
And I'm running with a painted rose
I don't relate to the things they say
And I don't want to be like them today
I know it's useless dumb and it's crass
But I guess I'm just a real outcast

You could talk me into bitter sweet
You could grab me off the bright night street
You gotta keep it really tight and warm
You gotta keep me laughing in the storm
Well, the roads are feeling hollow and steep
And I want to sew what I reap
I keep forgetting what I just forgot
And I' don't know if I'm ready or not
