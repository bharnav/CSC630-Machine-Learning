Hey there, stand in line
Read the Times, check your dimes
Ensign what a wind, keep on trying
Anywhere sublime paradigm, oh, oh

You go back in time
Fix it good fit it fine
You go back in time
Just to say you decline

Free to step outside your dark world
Free to pound the lost streets
Free what a strain it is to stay curled
Free to turn up all the heat

Hey now, plug it in, pull a grin genuine
Tremble fast on the verge, you're the last
Avenue Accelerator Permacast

You go back in time
Fix it good fit it fine
You go back in time
Just to say you decline

Free to step outside your dark world
Free to pound the lost streets
Free what a strain it is to stay curled
Free to join the obsolete

Free, Free, Free, Free

You go back in time
Fix it good fit it fine
You go back in time
Just to say you decline

Free to step outside your dark world
Free to pound the lost streets
Free what a strain it is to stay curled
Free to turn up all the heat

Free to step outside your dark world
Free to pound the lost streets
Free what a strain it is to stay curled
Free to turn up all the heat
