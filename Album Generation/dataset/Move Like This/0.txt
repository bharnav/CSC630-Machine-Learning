You believe in anything
They tell you how to think
Simpletons a-circling
The raging roller-rink

Trading in the alley
Bucking up a storm
Forget about reality
'Cause nothing is the norm
Yeah, yeah

So what can you do?
You say
They owe me a few, yeah
Blue tip me a cue, yeah

You got that look on your face
You'd like to be in the race
You cannot hide your disgrace
You leave without a trace

Sanctuary your heartland
Black and white TV
Stroking all the gun heads
To the 9th degree

You hear the screamers coming
They clamour in disguise
They think that you'll be running
To the other side
Yeah, yeah

So what can you do?
You say
They owe me a few, yeah
Blue tip me a cue, yeah

You got that look on your face
You'd like to be in the race
You cannot hide your disgrace
Can't fill an empty space

(Ahh)
You stupify the thinkers
(Ahh)
You're hugging all the flakes
(Ahh)
And all the things you think are true
(Ahh)
Only mystify the fakes

Keep your hat on backwards
And keep your lips tucked in
The world is full of quackers
And bellybutton rings

I know you'd like to be immune
To the things they say
You're hung up on your heroes
And upon the beast you pray
Yeah, hey

What can you do?
You say
Well, they owe me a few, yeah
Blue (Blue) tip me a cue, yeah

You got that look on your face
You'd like to be in the race
You cannot hide your disgrace
You leave without a trace

You got that look on your face
You'd like to be in the race
You cannot hide your disgrace
You leave a bitter taste
