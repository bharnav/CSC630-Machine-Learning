I could dream about
Things that never end:
Wishes on a star
Something round the bend
I remember times
Things were pretty clear
I felt the pressure pulse
Threw away the fears...

I believe in you
On your salty side
And I would never jump
Your never-ending ride
My feet are on the ground
I'm maybe lost and found
Not much weighin' tip [?]
But never jumped that ship

[Refrain 1]
I'm never gonna get that crazy
I'm never gonna be shot down:
You know it takes a lot to phase me
Whenever you're around

[Refrain 2]
And you say
It's too late
All the storms in life you've got to contemplate
And you say
It's too late
When the morning's right you gotta celebrate, yeah yeah

Well, you may cross the line
Or suck the clementine
But I know for sure
I need you nevermore
There's dreamers on the fringe
There's lovers on the binge
Nobody really knows:
That's just the way it goes

[Refrain 1]
[Refrain 2]

Well I could take a fall
Or hang it on the wall
No matter what you think
I'm always on the brink
But you can throw a twist
And I can move like this
They give you lots of slack
Then something pulls you back

[Refrain 1]
[Refrain 2]
...Ah yeah yeah
