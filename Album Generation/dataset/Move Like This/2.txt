Oh well the long street goes
For miles and miles
And it's picking up some strangers
And it's picking up some smiles
And the half breeds holler
They're educated guesses
And they got a lot of cheers
You guessed it, you guessed it

They keep you in follow mode
They keep you in follow mode
Take the streets you never rode
They keep you-

They keep on knocking
Like the party's on
They keep on knocking
Like the party's gone

I got some friends
In random places
All kinds of ideas
And all kinds of faces
They keep their ready shoes on
They keep their shirts on ice

And they're looking to the future
To loosen the vice

They keep you in follow mode
They hold up their signs
They keep you in follow mode
Most of the time

They keep on knocking
Like the party's on
They keep on knocking
Yeah from dark till dawn

They keep you in follow mode
They hold up their signs
They keep you in follow mode
All of the time

They keep on knocking
Like the party's on
They keep on knocking
Yeah from dark till dawn
