I go outside
Ask the air if it would like to hide
Take a deep breath
Walk inside my prize

In my lungs I still feel young
But my body won't play along
I'm thinking this must not be where we belong

And the world
Split in two from the throng
Of every living soul
Screaming at the top of their lungs

Singing this is my word
But somehow we never get heard
It's just an echo
From a lost and lonely world

[Chorus]
And I dare you to survive
Being grown for the rest of your life
From adulthood, no one survives

Ten billion feet
Pounding at the ground each week
Every secret, every burden they keep

Each one's waiting on the chance
To be lifted off the ground but then
To discover that we'll all be dust again

[Chorus]
And I dare you to survive
Being grown for the rest of your life
From adulthood, no one survives

[Chorus]
And I dare you to survive
Being grown for the rest of your life
From adulthood no one survives

From adulthood, no one survives
