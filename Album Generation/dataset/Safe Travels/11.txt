You were never a soldier
You were never a prize
You were never a song in my eyes
Yeah, you are childhood
Twisted and disguised

Oh, I am drowning
In a world that's always been dry
You're the sun I never see rise
Yeah, it is midnight but my day
Only just arrived

I never breathe the air without you
Somehow entering my mind
I only breathe the air to keep you inside
So you would always be mine

Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows

Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let it go
Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let it go

You were never a stranger
You were never unkind
But I had fiction on my side
Yeah, I had fiction
Strongly on my side

I never kept you like a secret
I never tried to make you hide
I only ever meant to keep you inside
So you would always be mine

Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows

Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let it go
Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let it go

Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows

Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let go
Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let go

Should have never let you go
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Three years and, baby, don't you know
It's time to let go
