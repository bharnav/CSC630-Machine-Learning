(Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh)

'Cause I'm the ghost of your past and mine
Slowly combine
And I am the one with whom your memories you can reside
Come back at any time

And I am the one who you can call at any time
Where are you? Where am I?
When are we gonna escape?

Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say-

And aren't we all alone?
Well and far behind like I am sometimes
Don't treat me like the past
Don't let me fall behind

'Cause I'm the one who you've been waiting for
Please don't pass me by
I'll wait, I'll say that I'll do what it takes

Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say-

And aren't we all alone?
Well and far behind like I am sometimes
Don't treat me like the past
Don't let me fall behind
Don't let me fall behind
Oh, don't let me fall behind

I'll scream the agony just one more time
(Don't let me fall behind.)
I'll scream the aaa-
Don't let me fall behind

Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say now
Say-

And aren't we all alone?
Well and far behind like I am sometimes
Don't treat me like the past
Don't let me fall behind
Don't treat me like the past
Don't let me fall behind
