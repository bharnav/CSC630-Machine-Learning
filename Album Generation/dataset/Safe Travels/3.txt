Expensive tickets to a crowded place
Someone who you can't relate to calls your name
Fires at the after-party much too late
The DJ finished spinning all the songs you hate
And the people that you love
Are always hating on the people that you love
Everyone against each other
Each one against the other
I'm feeling sick
Like the nightmares never ending
I'm sick of all the small-talk
If you're sick of pretending
You can hear them speaking
Just the rhythm of your breeding
If you've had enough
Say when
Say when
If you've had enough
Say when
Dumb horns blasting in the techno break
Hiding in the corner by the wedding cake
An image of your face distorting on the plate
Congratulations on your ugly dinner date
And the people that you love
Are always hating on the people that you love
Everyone against each other
Each one against the other
I'm feeling sick
Like the nightmares never ending
I'm sick of all the small-talk
If you're sick of pretending
You can hear them speaking
Just the speakers overheating
If you've had enough
Say when
Say when
If you've had enough
Say when
Don't say when until you've tried it
Don't say uncle unless you don't like it
Because every good reason
You've had so far for leaving
Is just another weakness
That brings you closer to me
Closer to me

Expensive tickets to a crowded place
Someone who you can't relate to calls your name
Fires at the after-party much too late
The DJ finished spinning all the songs you hate
Say when
