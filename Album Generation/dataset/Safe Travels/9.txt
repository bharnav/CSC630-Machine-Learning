No one knows
Why you save
All your lows
For the days

Well you were quite
The love interest last night
Last night
Ohhh

And it's all for love
Yeah, it's all for love
Alright

You've spent many nights
Sleeping
Face down again
For fear
For fear

That your heart might live clear
That you heart might live clear
And you'd die

And it's all for love
Yeah, it's all for love
Alright

Bathed by firelight in this town
