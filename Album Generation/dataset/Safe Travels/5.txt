Maybe it was just the sleeping pills
When I went to bed last night
Maybe I just never made it home
What if this all was been a tiny, tiny
Hole inside my heart
Leaking very very, very very
Slowly

And if you're dead
How do you know if you are really dead?
Or stuck in a dull dream
About nothing that never ends?

I was staring out the window when
I could've sworn that I heard a voice
What if there was someone calling me
Or what if it was just the sound of my soul
Slipping out last night
Sliding in between the cracks in my bedroom door

And if you're dead
How do you know if you are really dead?
Or stuck in a dull dream
About nothing that never ends?

We all at minimum
Deserve a unique exit from this world

So if you're there, God
See to it, God
See to it

And if you're there, God
See to it, God
See to it [verse sung 8x]

So if you're there, God
See to it, God
See to it
