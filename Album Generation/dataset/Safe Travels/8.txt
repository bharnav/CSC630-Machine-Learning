With devils on our side
What's the use of lying?
The truth itself will speak
Volumes when we're dying

We spoke to ourselves when
All was bathed in silence
We spoke to ourselves with
The lies that lay beside us

We kissed on the mouth then
All was bathed in firelight
We kissed on the mouth when
Nothing else felt right

With an angel by my side
I caught myself crying
For fear that I had died
Or worse that I was dying....
