Don't you find it curious how we can disagree
How two of us in one place can see two different things?
Don't you find it strange how we never coincide?
Such a massive heartbreak, neither of us survived

Spring turns into summer turns to fall
You have changed but I don't change at all
Fall turns into winter turns to spring
You have changed but I don't change a thing

Oh Emily, you’re a funny girl and I didn’t mean to break your heart
But I’m lost and in love with everyone, and so now’s as good as any as a place to start…

Grass that bursts through concrete and wolves out in the wild
Roots below the old streets break through after a while
Everything will crumble like rocks inside a stream
But will we ever find out what’s buried underneath?

Spring turns into summer turns to fall
You have changed but I don’t change at all
Fall turns into winter turns to spring
You have changed but I don’t change a thing

Oh Emily, you’re a funny girl and I didn’t mean to break your heart
But I’m lost and in love with everyone, and so now’s as good as any as a place to start…

When I think I don’t miss it I miss it…

Fall turns into winter turns to spring
You have changed but I don’t change at all
Oh Emily, you’re a funny girl and I didn’t mean to break your heart
But I’m lost and in love with everyone, and so now’s as good as any as a place-

Oh Emily, you’re a funny girl and I didn’t mean to break your heart
But I’m lost and in love with everyone, and so now’s as good as any as a place to start…
