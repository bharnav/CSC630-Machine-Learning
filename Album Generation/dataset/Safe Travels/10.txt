The face in the moon
I can see it in the water too
I can see it just the same as you
But I can't be there with you

Sleepy eyelids
I can write a song for you
I can buy you roses too
But I can't be there with you

Water leads to water
Water leads to rivers, leads to oceans, leads to you
Are you in love with someone?
Are you in love with someone new?

Oh, you
Such a funny girl but oh so blue
And what are you supposed to do
When I can't be there with you?

I'm the man in the moon
I'm far away and can't be true
And I could say the same for you
And why on earth would you...

Water leads to water
Water leads to rivers, leads to oceans, leads to you
Are you in love with someone?
Are you in love with someone new?

Are you in love with someone?
Are you asleep with someone?
Are you in love with someone new?
