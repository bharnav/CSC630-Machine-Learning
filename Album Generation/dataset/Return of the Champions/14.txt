[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

[Chorus 1]
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Verse 2]
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

[Chorus 2]
Because these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

[Chorus 1]
Those were the days of our lives - yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you
