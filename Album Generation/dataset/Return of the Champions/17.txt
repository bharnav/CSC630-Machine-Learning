[Intro: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future. Move out of my way."

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People do you hear me? Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (and I'm giving it all, ooh)

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

I want it

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
