[Verse 1]
All the way home, stay close to me
Blanket of stars in the neon bars in the city's beat
All the way up, try to get stuck
Try to lean in for a secret kiss for a secret touch
Matter stretched tight
Under black light
Under black light
You move into me

[Chorus]
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all

[Verse 2]
Curtain of bones, curtains of bones
All the way home--there are stepping stones to another world
Window in space, window in space
Holes in your face to another time to another place
Muscles pulled tight
Under black light
Under black light
You move into me

[Chorus]
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are glowing, your spine is alight
The ghosts are moving, the bodies moving
Bright curtain of bones sway hard in the dark
The world is moving, the whole world moving
Matter stretched tight
Under black light
Under black light
You move into me

[Verse 4]
I may not know you or I may know you too well
The question lingers in the air the seconds swell
If I can glue myself, the past and future killed
If I can lose myself then lose myself I will

[Chorus](x3)
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters at all
