She embodies an antelope
Elegant, she got plastic stripes
Bites the open sky
Comes in the hope
Of the majesty of the night
She can fight with the big cats
Lions and tigers
And all things rain down
Tiny ants underneath her skin
Sending messages to her mind
Speak a language of light not sound
Spark a fire in grey blue eyes
Fickle fate and the same dice
That they threw when the Big Bang banged big

Rides the matterhorn in the park
Friday magnet and car head lights
Stumble into the sequin suits
Any taxi that stops will do
She can sew up the whole sky
Lions and tigers
And all things rain down

Hard harder she comes
Hard harder she falls
Hard harder she runs
Loud louder she roars
Take the bullet and sing
Of its delicate wings
Take the comet instead
To its beautiful end
