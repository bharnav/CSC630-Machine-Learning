There's a wall in the great divide
Which wire do they cut to blow it
It's a sleep worm inside the skull
Soft mouth on your brain stem

And it dreams about falling dust
Swirl like an old plastic snow globe
And I dream about the snow as well
Safe locked in your room

Get closer reverse and stop
Fly silent to the icy mountain
Make circles with the lions there
Soft paws and steel blades

This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's on wires
Deep gulp bright eyes
This night's all night

Neon pinball in my running shoes
Computer in my rib cage
Dancing like honest fools
Fireworks for your rage

And the lions came to the valley
To drink from your perfect lake
If it's wrong to be here like this
It's the perfect mistake

This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
Quick gulps of fire
This night's all night

Tilt over hit like the rain
This heart spits little bolts of lighting
This room gets lost in the burst
Light and dark twist in the rush

This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
This night's all night
Quick gulps of fire
This night's all night
