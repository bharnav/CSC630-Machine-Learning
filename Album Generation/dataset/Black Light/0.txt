On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night

In the morning light
I was baking up bread in the afterglow
Of a long night spent in your motorcade
Of intense red words
And you're drinking hot tea
With your hot shark fin soup

A broken whisky bottle
Is all you've got to show
For losing your control

On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit fight night

Turn around
We are swimming in milk
For the second time
We are killing ourselves
With the softest smiles
And the motorbike seat
Is a shiny black window to somewhere else

So open up the throttle
And we'll get in the space between the molecules

On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit fight night

On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit fight night

On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit night
On a ghost lit fight night
