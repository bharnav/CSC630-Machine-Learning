There's a man in the street
Who tells me that he loves me
God is everywhere
He says he lives above me
I know more about this man
Than i know about you
Further than we go
In what we go through

We are small
We are small people (x4)

There's a day in a month
When I know why we're here
And no one drags us down
When you flip my gear
My mother doesn't love you
Even though she tries
I told her so many things
I forget the lies

We are small
We are small people (x4)

You will take the whole of me (x8)

The whole of me
