Where's the bone, where's the sack?
Where's these things of mine?
Pack them up, put them out
Coz there's not much time

Oh, I didn't know
That you had feelings, too
Oh, I never thought
That I was king of you

Where's the shame in my case
As I've fallen down?
To the drug, to the floor
In an eager pout

Oh, I didn't know
How alone you'd be
And I never knew
How much I'd have to need
