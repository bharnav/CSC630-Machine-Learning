Hello
Get out the abacus and count this
A funny story with a dark twist
The target so big that you can't miss
Me

Composing
And every page I turn I want more
I never know the next thing in store
'Cause you excite me like a locked door
Does

Like a liquid
I want to take your voice and drink it
There doesn't seem to be a limit
To all the things that I could do

I know how I want it to go
I know how I want it to be
Don't make me think before I speak
Or make me hold my horses

Hold tight
We saddled up if you can ride light
If you just think it then you'll be fine
Fingers crossed that it's the right time
This time
Through a fat swamp
We can visit for a fun romp
I really want to do the high jump
Taking a risk will do us all some good

I know how I want it to go
I know how I want it to be
Don't make me think before I speak
Or make me hold my horses

I've got my eye on the prize
(Look at my eyes)
My beady eyes are alight
(They're alight)
And though I don't know what comes next
I will not hold my horses

Hello
Get out the abacus and count me
A funny feeling says I won't be
The target so big that you can't miss
Me

I know how I want it to go
(I want it to go)
I know how I want it to be
(I want it to)
Don't make me think before I speak
Or make me hold my horses

I've got my eye on the prize
(Look at my eyes)
My beady eyes are alight
(They're alight)
And though I don't know what comes next
I will not hold my horses

I know what you're thinking
I know how you see me
Although it hurts
You're probably right
