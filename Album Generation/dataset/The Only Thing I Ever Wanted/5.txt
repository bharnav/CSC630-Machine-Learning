You know and I know
How we work and how we hope
We get all tied up

You made some magic
You didn't even try
Fell out of your eyes
Then I did too

You counted ten on one hand today
My fingers get in the way
I get all tied up

You know and I know
How we work and how we hope
We get all tied up

I drag my feet and drag us down
Don't want me around
To tie you up
