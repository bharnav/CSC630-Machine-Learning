Come now, come and mourn me
It's so easy
Now I'm gone
My old bones are growing new bones
All the moments
That you send

I say that I don't need you
Don't come and tell you
What I should
And I'll break all our babies
Before they happen
Before they would

Do not fret 'cos I won't come back
I know my place
And it's not here
Come now, come and mourn me
It's so easy
Now I'm gone

Will I do?
