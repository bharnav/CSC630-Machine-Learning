Eat up your shame
You did not choose to be this way

These names live on your lips
But you can't help how bloodlines slip

I could never fall for an empty page anyway
I wouldn't like it

You can't haggle with your mother
You cannot choose her love, oh no

Come and fight your corner
There's no one doing it for you

There would be nobody if we all stayed all alone
I wouldn't like it
