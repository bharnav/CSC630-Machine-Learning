I don't feel it
Your so-called confession
That taste of simple truth
Has bled you dry

A heart to trade-off
A love repressed
Yes all your lies
Add up to regression

There are so many things
I need to say
There are so many things
I need to say to you
It never was easy
Throw it all back
And I'll tear it all down
In front of you

But you will never understand
What I went through for this
All the twists and turns
Have left me silent

My constant decadence
Hanging over
Always making promises
I'm destined to destroy

So many things
I need to say
There are so many things
I need to say to you
It never was easy
Throw it all back
And I'll tear it all down
It never was easy

My constant decadence
Hanging over
Always making promises
I'm destined to destroy

But I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
With honestly needing
And always forgiving

I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
With honestly needing
And always forgiving

I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
Honestly needing
Always forgiving
Forgiving
Forgiving
Forgiving
