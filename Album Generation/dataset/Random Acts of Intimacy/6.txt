If I could I'd leave you here
Alone is no disgrace
A love without a name
In a cloaked city

And all that I do wrong
I trade in for a song
Knowing that sometimes it's called
Passion not pity

But the words
Break my back

All the sinners' sing along
Let the devil take us home
We're sorry
We're sorry
It's just another one
Lost to emotions
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

For every false attack
I promise to come back
With answers
Not just excuses

My expense in return
I paid to watch you burn
But I truly loved you
I truly loved you

For every false attack
I promise to come back
With answers
Not just excuses

My expense in return
I paid to watch you burn
But I truly loved you
I truly loved you

All the sinners' sing along
Let the devil take us home
We're sorry
We're sorry
It's just another one
Lost to emotions
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
