Don't make me lose my temper
I hurt myself too much
Deliberately losing
With an unfair advantage

Open to suggestion
Always misinformed
We don't fear or worship
Hate fake ideals
Fake ideals

Hurtful
Cynical
Loveless space
Ungrateful
Out of place
Softly
Quickly

Cynical
Loveless
Don't wish for less
Don't wish for less

Your wandering opinions
On everything you loathe
Moves me to tears every time

I don't hate it
I accept it
Your ignorance equals my disbelief
I don't hate it
I accept it
Your ignorance equals my disbelief

Ungrateful, hurtful, cynical
That cold and loveless space
Tread softly
Think quickly
Don't wish for less
For less

I don't hate it
I accept it
I don't hate it
I accept it
I don't hate it
