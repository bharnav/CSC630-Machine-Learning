I left out
With the severance
Imagined myself
On a daily basis

To be sorry
For everything I said
Visceral not taking

And the days fall slow
Like summer rain
Hell I don't feel
Without this pushing

Breaking ever
I'm just trying to return
Time distills all
Negative memories

We tried to reach back to you
But you were running out the opposite way
Transcending our illusions
The energy
Energy

And the days fall slow
Like summer rain
Hell I don't feel
Without this pushing

Breaking ever
I'm just trying to return
Time distills all
Negative memories

With controlled chaotic direction so inviting
With controlled chaotic direction so inviting

And the days fall slow
Like summer rain
Hell I don't feel
Without this pushing

Breaking ever
I'm just trying to return
Time distills all
Negative memories
Negative memories
Negative memories

Time distills all
Negative memories
Time distills all
Negative
