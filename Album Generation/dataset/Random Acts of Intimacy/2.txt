I can twist the fabric of time
It's like it's real magic
Reflecting on the words you said
It's like it's real
Waiting on a life I could borrow
It's like it's real magic

Tried understanding the apex
Only I'm fuckin' over the edge
Do you think you can face it
Unbalancing the eventide?

Run, carrying over the broken
They're in and out and afterwards
Then every someone like a winter
With distant visitors upon

Yeah

Thank you
For showing me
Anything is possible

All the dreams
I once lived for
Were ultimately shallow

Tried understanding the apex
Only I'm fuckin' over the edge
Do you think you can face it
Unbalancing the eventide?
