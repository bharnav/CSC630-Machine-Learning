The crushing
Of the little people
The insignificant
Among us

Our hurts light
Dynamite
Led to the ultimate
Dismissal

Lock us in the background
Our big ambitions smothered and incited

We won't forget this
We won't forget this
We won't forget this
We won't forget this

Before the panic
Before ignition
Before the beating
Down of your judgement

Another carnival queen
On permanent surrender
With all the pleasure kings
On constant attack
On constant attack

Fuck you don't dare think I'll take your shit again
Fuck you don't dare think I'll take your shit again
Fuck you don't dare think I'll take your shit again
Fuck you don't dare think I'll take your shit again

The crushing
The crushing
The crushing
The crushing
