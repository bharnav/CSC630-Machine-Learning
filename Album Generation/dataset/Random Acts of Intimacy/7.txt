A list of all the problems
That i can't feel
You can't sleep for worries
And i dont want to feel
Yeah you never cared about me
You can't take care of yourself
This is not about me
Yeah this is about the world

Its all your careless chioces
Your fucking constant derision
Suspicions lead you here
I'd love a distant echo
Dark and slow and distant
Forever leading me back to you

Please embrace this and give love
And give time to others
Please embrace this and give love
And give time to others
