Is my life
An expression of my love?
Is my love
An extension of my loneliness?

A futile search
For innocence
To no end

It's all that I dream of
Had all I can take
She fucking haunts me
She fucking haunts me
She fucking haunts me

Kill me now fuck me later
Kill me now fuck me later
Kill me now fuck me later
