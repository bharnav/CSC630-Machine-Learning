I'm risking the let go
In return for constancy
Consoling my freedom with desire

Persuasion arrives
Trailing my uncertainties
Keeping me awake and restless

Climb down
I'm here
Averting
Shadows
Discarded
Between silence and scream

Watch as
My patience unravels
And while I sleep I'm kicking down

And all our upset
And all our tears they fall like blame
On me, on us

I'm honoured with your faith
Only truth and time prevails

Climb down
I'm here
Averting
Shadows
Discarded
Between silence and scream

Watch as
My patience unravels
And while I sleep I'm kicking down

The authority, the transition
Trust will bring me home
Belief will give me courage
I know in myself
Trust will bring me home
Belief will give me courage
Trust will bring me home
Trust will bring me home
Trust will bring me home
