Turn back to it
They called it heresy
And burned the books and
Imprisoned innocents
And buried the truth
An argument for attack

I am stupid
I have a basic understanding of nothing
I have a simple way of dealing with problems
And human nature is ever dissolving

We spin around in the unknown future
A constant race with fear of failure
A sense of guilt for all that was taken
Sucking away at these beautiful things

Maintain an order of privilege
Do they endanger your morals or doubt you?
It's more significant than numbers
Religious standing
Eternal apathy still equals inaction

I am stupid
I have a basic understanding of nothing
I have a simple way of dealing with problems
And human nature is ever dissolving
