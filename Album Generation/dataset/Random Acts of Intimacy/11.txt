Wow
You got me down for the crime
Hey man I'm stuck at the scene
It's not my victim but a river of blood runs down my face

Scratch
The surface of your blue skies
You have a saints' alibis
It's just a front for a river of blood runs down your face

I've made mistakes
So have you
We all do

Dear
I want to fuck it all out
Turn all bright colours to grey
I'll go away when a river of blood runs down your face

Sing, sing
Fuck all the haters like you
Afraid of facing the truth
But we all know that a river of blood runs down your face

I've made mistakes
So have you
We all do
My heart you've cut
I'm opened up
With a river of blood running down my face

I want to fuck it out
I want to fuck it all out
I want to fuck it out
I want to fuck it all out

Of my mistakes the worst was you
You fucked me up but I fucked you
Of my mistakes the worst was you
You fucked me up but I fucked you

Of my mistakes the worst was you
You fucked me up but I fucked you
Of my mistakes the worst was you
You fucked me up but I fucked you
