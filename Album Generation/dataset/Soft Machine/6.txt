[Verse 1]

When I was a little rude boy
I run around the neighborhood
And I can still remember
When we set the sound on fire
I want to be a big shot
And I'm on to play the game
And it won't be long now
For all the people know my name

[Chorus]

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

[Verse 2]

When you listen to the radio
Everywhere they play my song
See me on your TV
I rock it all day long
Super let me on the sunboy
Come from every way around
But I allways kill them
With a mighty teddysound

[Chorus]

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one

When I was a little stereo
I listen to the champion
And I always wonder
When will I be the number one
