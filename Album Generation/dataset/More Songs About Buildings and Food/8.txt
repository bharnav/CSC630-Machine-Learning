[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is an ocean that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me

[Bridge]
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
'Til I can't, 'til I can't, 'til I can't take no more of it

[Chorus]
Take me to the water, drop me in the river
Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I, the biggest fool of them all

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down
