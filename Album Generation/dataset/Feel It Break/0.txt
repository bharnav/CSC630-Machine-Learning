[Verse 1]
Ride her darken horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's always the same
It's always the same
A customary trend
The course is laid to play
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...

[Interlude]
Shoot into the darkness with your hands
Shoot into the darkness with your hands

[Verse 2]
Ride her darken horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's all insane
It's all insane
A monster for a friend
A liar to depend
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...

[Chorus]
Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

[Refrain]
Nothing stable, nothing patient here

[Verse 3]
Ride her darken horse
The pathway to the end
She's all alone
She's all alone
Her trust was never there
It's yours she needs to hear
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...

[Chorus]
Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

[Chorus]
Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

[Refrain]
Nothing stable, nothing patient here
