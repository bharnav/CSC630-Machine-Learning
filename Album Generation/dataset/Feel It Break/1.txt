[Verse 1]
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
I never knew you, I never knew
I never knew you, I never knew
Your body's harmful, the very shape
The cracks are deeper, on every plate

[Non-lyrical Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
I get impatient, with every word
The more you ask me, the more I've heard
This is a thirst that I've never had
I've never bled for another man

[Non-lyrical Chorus]

[Interlude]
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
My face screams
My face screams
My face screams
Without an emotion

[Bridge]
In the darkness comes, another, another
Hold her by the thumbs, the other, the other

[Non-lyrical Chorus]
