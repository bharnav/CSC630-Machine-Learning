[Verse 1]
I can't sleep at night
The noise, the noise
My eyes they open wider
The noise, the noise
I came to relate
The noise, the noise
Help me compensate for
The noise, the noise

[Chorus 1]
But I wouldn't do anything
The thundering that throws me away
I wouldn't do anything

[Verse 2]
I won't go to church
The noise, the noise
The preacher wouldn't care for
The noise, the noise
I don't know what's real from
The noise, the noise
I can't hear a thing for
The noise, the noise
The noise
The noise
The noise

[Chorus 2]
I wouldn't do anything
The thunder that throws me away
I wouldn't do anything
There's something that keeps me away

[Chorus 3]
I wouldn't do anything
Something that begs me to stay
I wouldn't do anything
Something that throws me away
