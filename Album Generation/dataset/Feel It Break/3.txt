[Verse 1]
Hundred angles lost
Fleeing from the beat and the pulse
Loving like a fool
Play it full of heart and the soul
And the soul

[Verse 2]
Capture something red
Paste it to the edge of your bed
Someone will be there
Someone who will know what it says
What it says

[Chorus]
Feel it break
Feel it break
Nothing's a mistake, or you
Feel it break

[Verse 3]
Elevate your fingers
Motion makes it hard to write
Steel words are abrasive
Yours are making me feel right
Feel right

[Chorus]
Feel it break
Feel it break
Nothing's a mistake, or you
Feel it break
