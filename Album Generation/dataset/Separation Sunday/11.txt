Some nights it just takes like a smile and shake
And I've been with the bodies
And I've met with the blood
And I went with Hallelujah and she didn't say a thing
She just wiped at her nose and then she winked
And I've met with the cops
And I've been with all the squares
And I went with Saint Deborah of defeat and depression
She put her hand up on my shoulder and then she just kinda stood there

She said call me 212 Margarita
Cause I'm green and I'm misleading and I've had too much tequila

And I've been with short tempers
I've been behind the sharp knifes
I believed the shots in the distance to be cold hard facts
Ringing out against the radio and the speaker stacks
And I've been with the hoodrats
I've been with all the hangers-on
I stayed out 'till dawn at some raunchy magazine launch
I hit the open bar and I got myself all turned on, right

And she said call me 612 Bloody Mary
Cause I'm nice and I'm spicy and I'm your only sure shot at recovery

Yeah so call me 212 Margarita
I'm green and I'm misleading and I've had too much tequila

Leave a message at the Motel 6
Let me now if you still feel sick
I'll be in town on a three night stick
Yeah maybe if you're feeling better then maybe we can get some soup together
We've been sick together before

And I believe in the bodies
And I believe in the blood
I believe on salt along the rims of the glasses
Cause that makes us thirsty
And when we drink then we all fall in love

I believe in the bodies
And I believe in the blood
I believe in salt on the rims of the glasses
Cause that makes us thirsty
And when we drink then we all fall in love
