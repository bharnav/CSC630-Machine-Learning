[Verse 1]
On the path of life, I wish you well
With urgent chariots, we will meet again in Hell
I kept my head down and moved on
'Til every friend I'd known was gone

[Chorus]
Then one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed
Everything was strange
Everything had changed
Everything was strange

[Verse 2]
When in rags and when in wealth
A solemn promise never to give too much of myself
Despite the hopeful words I've said
I've lived my life inside my head

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I hold my breath and count to ten
I hate it now, hated it then
Seen it all before
A failure and a bore
That's what friends are for

[Verse 3]
So it seems I must have won
As I survey the ashes of the damage that I've done
Everyone I've ever known
Is just as closed off and alone

[Chorus]
