[Verse 1]
It was often talked about
It was often raised
But nothing was ever done about it
To hear the way they talked about it
Noone could be saved
But nothing was ever done about it

[Bridge]
Shall I take back everything I've ever said
And live my whole life in silence instead?

[Verse 2]
It was oversimplified
It was underthought
And nothing was ever done to stop it
Everything was fortified by
All the lies we bought
And nothing was ever done to stop it

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Shall I take back everything I've ever said
Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?
And live my whole life in silence instead?
All my mistrust, we never discussed anyone's reservations

[Verse 3]
There was a time
When a crime was a crime
Now I think I'm losing my mind
Or taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard

[Bridge]

[Chorus] x2

[Outro] x2
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
But I don't think so
