I left you in the rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Your reflection in the pane
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

Apples, pears, prunes, and plums
His favorite food, I told his mum
Wait for him at the end of the slide
When he climbs the stairs, stay by his side

I heard you got some rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Looks like we're in for the same
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

I'm going early, won't wave good-bye
Tell him I love him; look him in the eye
I've learned how to mourn; I've learned how to miss
Let me disappear with this kiss

Tuesday
A mix of sun and clouds
With a forty percent chance of showers
Early morning then sunny
Wind west twenty kilometers an hour
Gusting to 44
High of 22
UV index 50 and moderate

Bird, book, and basketball
Squirrel, dog, and learning how to crawl
I found my heart when he came
Let my leaving leave like rain

I watched you from the train
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
When I come back I'll see you again
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

I'll listen for you every morning
I'll listen for you every morning
I'll listen for you every morning
I'll listen for you every morning
