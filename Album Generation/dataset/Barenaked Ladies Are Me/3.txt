What's a boy to do
When you tell your tale
And, it never fails
I just end up feeling bad for you

With your hangdog eyes
You can bring me down
Now I'm wrapped around your whole hand
Stop looking so surprised

[Chorus] x2
You make it easy

I've been burned before
You're not fooling me
There's no mystery
You've forgotten what you're hiding for

Call it self-defense
You can obfuscate
And manipulate
But it's only at your own expense

[Chorus] x4

Easy to be with you
Easy to obey
Easy to forgive you at the end of the day
Easy now to judge you
Easy to betray
Easy to adore you, though you want to run away

It's easy

Look what you have done
I can do the same
Two can play this game
You'll no longer be the only one

[Chorus] x3
