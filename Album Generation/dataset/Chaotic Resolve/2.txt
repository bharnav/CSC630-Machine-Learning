[Verse 1]
You ran around inside my head
When you passed out, I felt dead
And I realized you make me live
And when my world starts to cave in
You jump inside and take my hand
No matter where, you are there

[Pre-Chorus]
Will I ever see what you could see in me? I do, I just believe that we will always be in dream, yeah
Well, I will never be the sign that we must see, that you and me were meant to be so just believe why we are together

[Chorus]
You are my light, you are my star
You are my sunshine and my dark
You are the everything I dreamed about
You are the guy who stole my heart
I am the girl you're always smiling for
We have a love people dream about
A real life fairytale

[Verse 2]
I thought that I would be alone
You caught my eye and I was home
And I realized that this was love
I see the world through different eyes
I look at you by my side
No matter where, you're always there

[Pre-Chorus]
Will I ever see what you could see in me? I do, I just believe that we will always be in dream, yeah
Well, I will never be the side that you will see, that you and me were meant to be so just believe why we are together

[Chorus]
You are my light, you are my star
You are my sunshine and my dark
You are the everything I dreamed about
You are the guy who stole my heart
I am the girl you're always smiling for
We have a love people dream about

[Bridge]
Dream with me
Make me believe
That this is a real life fairytale!

You are my light, you are my star
You are my sunshine and my dark
You are the everything I dreamed about!
You are the guy who stole my heart
I am the girl you're always smiling for
We have a love people dream about
A real life fairytale
A real life fairtytale
A real life fairytale
