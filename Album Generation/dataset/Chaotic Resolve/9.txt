Well naked I showed up here
With nothing to my name
Pure and crazy, blameless
Completely unashamed

And naked I will leave here
With nothing left to say
My pockets full of empty
And now I'm not to blame

I have nothing (I don't want it)
I have nothing (I don't need it)
I have nothing (You can have it)
I have nothing
Nothing, nothing

Well, catch me when I'm falling
To a stranger, sustain
And kick me when I'm stingy
Take everything away

'Cause yesterday is gone now
And tomorrow isn't sure
Today is all I'm given
And what I have is Yours

'Cause I have nothing (I don't want it)
I have nothing (I don't need it)
I have nothing (You can have it)
I have nothing
Nothing, nothing

Oh why do I put so much time
In things I leave behind
That were never mine?
Oh why?
Oh why?
Oh why?
Oh why?

I have nothing (I don't want it)
I have nothing (I don't need it)
I have nothing (You can have it)
I have nothing
Nothing, nothing
