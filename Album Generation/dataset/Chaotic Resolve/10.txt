You remind me of a cigarette
You burn up slowly and then go out like that
You make it harder for me to breathe
You make my head hurt you make my skin stink

So why don't you leave me alone
Or say you were wrong

'Cause I don't wanna hide
I need the tears inside to dry
I want more than just to try and love you
Jekyll and Hyde

Well it's not easy for me to be
Somebody different somebody else but me
But you're the actor the extraordinaire
You make it look like I am the crazy one here

So why don't you leave me alone
Or say you were wrong

'Cause I don't wanna hide
I need the tears inside to dry
I want more than just to try and love you
Jekyll and Hyde

I am willing to forgive
Are you willing to take ownership
Cause I am so willing to forgive
We're only given one chance to live

'Cause I don't wanna hide
I need the tears inside to dry
I want more than just to try and love you
Jekyll and Hyde
