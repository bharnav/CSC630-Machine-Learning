I can't dance here next to everybody
But I want to dance with you

I'm not sophisticated
I'm not your average girl
I don't like to wear makeup
I like my matted girls
Do I make you feel unstable?
Do I put you in a whirl
Because I do not fit your ideal of a beautiful girl?

Chorus:
I can't jump in next to anybody
Let me jump right next to you
I can't dance here next to everybody
But I want to dance with you

You're so illuminated
Your heat could melt the world
You're so wrapped up in last week
You make them toss and twirl
Do I make you feel uneasy?
Do I break your steel bad world
Because I do not fit your ideal of a beautiful girl?

Chorus x2

We're all different
We're all strange
Who really cares
Let's just keep dancing

Chorus x2
