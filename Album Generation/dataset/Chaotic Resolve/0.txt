When you look at me I start to blush
And all that I can say is you and us
Oh baby I'm so afraid to be in love
With you
With you...

I wanna be in love with only you
I wanna watch the sky turn gray and blue
I wanna know the kiss that's always new
I wanna be in love with only you
Just you

When stars are falling dark
We'll light the way
We'll hit the ground and fall
Into the shade
I'll light the night with fire
And run away with you
With you...

I wanna be in love with only you
I wanna watch the sky turn gray and blue
I wanna know the kiss that's always new
I wanna be in love with only you

I wanna be in love with you
I wanna be in love (I wanna be in love)
I wanna be in love with you
I wanna be in love (I wanna be in love)

I wanna be in love with only you
I wanna watch the sky turn gray and blue
I wanna know the kiss that's always new
I wanna be in love with only you

Just you yeah
Just you yeah
Just you
I wanna be
Just you yeah
I ain't got no more words for you...
