Oh I feel so tired
I cannot hardly keep open my eyes
My thoughts are scattered and I cannot say a word
And I can?t seem to remember anything
I've learned

Well do you have some of those days
When you can't be who you want to be
When you just need to close your eyes
Pull the covers up so high and drift away

And sleep so soundly
And dream profoundly
Cast all your cares on the
Only thing that you really need
And sleep so soundly

Now I feel so alive
A sense of movement slowed and somehow my tongues tied
My thoughts are shattered and they?re making the stars in the sky
And I?ve never felt so speechless in my life

Well do you have some of those days
When you just need, you just need to be
When you just need to shut your mouth

And close your eyes and breathe in and out and drift away

And sleep so soundly
And dream profoundly
Cast all your cares on the
Only thing that you really need
And sleep so soundly

Sleep, yeah so soundly
And dream, just dream
Profoundly (sleep)
So sleep so soundly
And dream profoundly
Cast all your cares on the
Only thing that you really need
