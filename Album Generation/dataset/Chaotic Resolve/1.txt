I woke up late, guess I'm never really early
I hesitate, only to fail
I get so tired, of procrastinating
I need a change

I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help

I'm standing still, moved so peaceful
I can't pretend, that I'm fine
I get so ill, Crazy agitated
When I'm not really dying

I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help

Press into me (Press into me)
Breathe the air (Breathe the air)
Bask in me (Bask in me)
You'll be free, to do anything

I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
