(Manic manic manic manic...)

She breaths in
She breaths out
She wakes up
And lays down
She can hardly speak
And so she screams

I won't give again
Because she takes so often

Nothing I say will wash it away
I'm standing in the pouring rain
You say it won't happen again
You're manic, manic
There's a chemical in your brain
It's pouring sunshine and rage
You can never know what to expect
You're manic, manic

She loves you
And hates you
You break down
She feels good
She will bleed from insecurity

When will she heal from this
I love her still

Nothing I say will wash it away
I'm standing in the pouring rain
You say it won't happen again
You're manic, manic
There's a chemical in your brain
It's pouring sunshine and rage
You can never know what to expect
You're manic, manic

She's got everything you want
She's every little thing your not
Yeah-

Nothing I say will wash it away
I'm standing in the pouring rain
You say it won't happen again
You're manic, manic
There's a chemical in your brain
It's pouring sunshine and rage
You can never know what to expect
You're manic, manic

Nothing I say will wash it away
I'm standing in the pouring rain
You say it won't happen again
You're manic, manic
There's a chemical in your brain
It's pouring sunshine and rage
You can never know what to expect
You're manic, manic
