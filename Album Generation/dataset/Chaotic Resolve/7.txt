I was frozen in a fragile world
Of make believe and empty lies
Twisting the rules
Of a virtuous game

And captured by the thought of fear
And loneliness afraid to cry
Suffocating trying to scream

Chorus
Cause I wanted out
To find myself

Cause perfect only makes you crazy
There is now way that it could save me
I'm sick of feeling like a traitor
Is this the price for good behavior?

Oh my naked skin
Feels the warmth of the sun
My eyes are open
To the brightness of life

I'm driven by a force so free
To live this life not paralyzed

But with reckless abandon
So now I can breath

(Chorus)
Don't do this
Don't do that
You will be
Out abandoned

Cause perfect only makes you crazy
There is now way that it could save me
I'm sick of feeling like a traitor
Is this the price for good behavior?
