Well, here you are, the final attraction
Awaiting direction
From somewhere above
Your finest performance
Approaching perfection
I know what you're making
It's some kind of love

Somewhere in your lifetime
You were dared into feeling
So many emotions that tear you apart
But they loved you so badly
For sharin' their sorrow
So pick up that guitar
And go break a heart

You can do it one more time, son, we're with ya
Pick up that guitar
Go break a heart
You can do it this time just for Hank Williams, can't ya?
Go break a heart
Maybe one time for Otis Redding
Go break a heart
And one time for Janis Joplin
Yeah, that's right. go break a heart
OK, yeah, one more time for James Dean
Go break a heart
God bless George Jones
Go break a heart
And maybe one time for me
Go break a heart
