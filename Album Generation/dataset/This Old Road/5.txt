I stand on the stairway
My back to the dungeon
The doorway to freedom
So close to my hand
And voices behind me
Still bitterly damn me
For seeking salvation
They don't understand

Chorus:
Lord, help me to shoulder
The Burden of Freedom
And give me the courage
To Be What I Can
And When I am Wounded
By those who condemn me
Lord, help me forgive them
They don't understand

Their lonely frustration
Descending to laughter
Erases the footprints
I leave in the Sand
But I'm free to travel
Where no one can follow
In search of the kingdom
They don't understand

Chorus:
Lord, help me to shoulder
The Burden of Freedom
And give me the courage
To be what I can
And when I have wounded
The last one who loved me
Lord, help her forgive me
I don't understand
