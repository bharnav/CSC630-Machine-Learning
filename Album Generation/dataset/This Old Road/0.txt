Look at that old photograph
Is it really you
Smiling like a baby full of dreams

Smiling ain't so easy now
Some are coming true
Nothing's simple as it seems

But I guess you count your blessings with the problems
That you're dealing with today
Like the changing of the seasons

[Chorus:]
Ain't you come a long way
Ain't you come a long way
Ain't you come a long way down
This old road

Looking at a looking glass
Running out of time
On a face you used to know

Traces of a future lost
In between the lines
One more rainbow for the road

Thinking of the faces in the window
That you passed along the way
Or the last thing you believed in

[Chorus]
Say you tried to chase the sundown
And you let it slip away
And the holy night is falling

[Chorus]
Look at that old photograph
Is it really you?
