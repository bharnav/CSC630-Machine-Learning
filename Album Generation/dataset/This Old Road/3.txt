John Tradoe
Wild American
You're the one they never tamed
'Cause you stood your ground
And they could not make you change
You're the warning they still don't understand
Watch your back, now
They'll kill you if they can

When they burn your brother down
In the name of Freedon
I don't care if that's left or right
It's wrong
If that's all they can do
Then you don't need 'em
You're the one, wild American

Steve Earle
I remember
It was somethin that you said
Put your picture in the paper and a price upon your head
You said, brother, if you really give a damn
Just remember
We're all sons of Abraham
Sing a sadder song of freedom
Slowly sinkin' with the sun
Waitin' for a burning star to lead'em
You re the one, wild American
Sing a sadder song of freedom
Merle Haggard
Slowly sinkin' with the sun
Willie Nelson
Heroes happen when you need'em
You're the one, wild American
