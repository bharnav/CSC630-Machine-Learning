Too many years on the rinks of Montreal
Too many years in the lofts of old TO
Too many nights in the bowels of Avenue B
Too many days in the arms of Lady T
Or maybe I'm just getting old
'Cause, fuck, I hate the cold

Too much time in the bed of a petty thief
Too much time in the arms of a failed conceit
He told me how he love the best about me
And then he told me what was best
And maybe I'm just getting old
But, fuck, I hate the cold

Too much fun on the roads of the USA
Too much fun plugging in and starting to play
Too much time on this winding trail
Of a tale yet to be told
Baby, I'm getting old
And, fuck, I hate the cold
I fucking hate it
I hate the cold
I fucking hate the cold
