He says, You will never know
There are no rhymes to do you justice
And he will sit there, outside
Until you no longer doubt his purpose

So, I let him in
I opened the door, and let him in
Yah, I let him in Opened my heart

Some wounds will never heal
Loneliness becomes an expectation
But you stretched there by my side
And you whisper those foolish incantations

So, I let her in
A crooked smile and I let her in
Opened the door, she walked right in
I opened my heart

It came to me wrapped like a gift in a dream
But then the dream disappeared
And the gift went too
And ever since I've been searching
For me and you
Ever since I've been searching for you

He said, "You will never know
There are no rhymes to do you justice"
And he will sit there by your side
Until you no longer doubt his purpose

So, she let me in
She opened the door, I walked right in
Yah, she let me in

Yes, she let me in
She opened the door, I walked right in
Yah, she let me in Opened her heart
