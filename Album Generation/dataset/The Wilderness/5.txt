There's a rock and a field and a dirty sky
I'm still as corpse, I'm content as a bride
Thoughts of you and those flyin' shoes
All around me

One wrong step and it's a long way down
So I triple check the hand holds, stand on firmer ground
But it's not so easy when the whole mountains
Coming down on you

So we wait for the morning when we'll stumble on the truth
Probably fail to recognize it, as we're digging at its roots
The sorrow and the anger that we've sown
In the fields all around us

Hey little princess, hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me
Yah you're the fairest one in the land
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand

There's a rock and a field and a collapsing sky
I'm precious as a snowman, fragile as a lie
Thoughts of you and those flyin' shoes
All around me

I'm afraid of the anger of the hard twisted heart
That beats in the chests of those that are caught
In the ruins of the lives of those
All around them

I'm sick of the blood and I'm sick of the bleeding
The effort it takes just to keep on dreaming
Of better days, and better ways
Of living

Hey little princess, hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me
Yah, you're the fairest one in the land
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand

Hey little princess, hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me
Yah, you're the fairest one in the land
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand
