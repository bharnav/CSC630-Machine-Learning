Here's a man of sorrows, children
As constant as the sea
Searching for a heart
That's lost it's stone

She moves like a serpent, baby
Through time she drags her tail
Of all the broken hearted
Left behind

Let's just sit here a little bit longer
With these bruised and battered hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start

There they go like shadows, darling
Between this world and that
Never knowing where the light
Will shine

But I can tell you one thing, sweetheart
We share a place in time
Nothing more is needed
'cause you're mine

Let's just sit here a little bit longer
With these bruised and battered hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start

Such a perfect pairing, dear one
The Pacific and it's rock
A battle weighed on scales
We can not know

Let's just sit here a little bit longer
Oh how we broke each others hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start

Let's just sit here a little bit longer
These scarred and healing hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start
