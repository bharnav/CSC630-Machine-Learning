Are there angels in the wilderness? I don't know
I've got my doubts, but if you say so
But I've got a feeling we're doing ok
We're doing our part, to make the brambles seem less sharp

When you ask for bread, will I give you stone?
Will I make you confess it, or leave it alone?
If it consoles you will I take it away?
Hold my hand Help me to understand

You break my heart again and again
I'll never get use to that sensation
All those locusts just trying to get out
Devouring with tiny bites, all that lies in site

Fly forgotten like a prayer
Fly forgotten like a dream
Fly forbidden Fly unseen
Fly, fly, fly away from me

Are there angels in the wilderness? I don't know
But I will give you my love and watch the bitterness grow
And then will I take it and hide it away?
And wait on the day when the balance tips your way

Fly forgotten like a prayer
Fly forgotten like a dream
Fly forbidden Fly unseen
Fly, fly, fly away from me

Are there angels in the wilderness?
I don't know
