I live only here,between your eyes and you
But I live in this world What do I do?
Collect no interest, otherwise what I can
Above all I'm not that staring man

I move like a spirit, between this world and that
The weight of them both square on my back
Collect no interest, and I shed what I can
Above all I'm not that staring man

You sit in your tower, straight and tall
Your kingdom around you beginning to fall
You close your eyes and you hold your tounge
And every night you check
On the damage you've done

I live only here between your eyes and you
Caught in your world, what do I do?
Fear in the air, I made my stand
Prove once again I'm not that staring man

You hold your ground, and you take what comes
And ever night you check on your desire to run
You hold your ground and you take what comes
And every night you check on your desire to run

I live only here between your eyes and you
But I live in this world What do I do?
