He sits alone in his perfect shack
The lake beside him freezing
The sun no longer shining
Much past four o'clock

We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones

She falls asleep, the book on her lap
All things change to something new
Something strange

We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones

We walk along with my hand on your back
The days behind receding
Forward to a day when all we love will pass

We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones

He sits alone in his perfect shack
The lake beside him freezing
The sun no longer shining
Much past four o'clock
