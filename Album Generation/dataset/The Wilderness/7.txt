The air in here smells like piss and beer
The sweet cycle of life, Georgie E would say
Thirteen grandchildren gathered around
Looking down into the ground

A slow descent into darkness
I deserve no less
His last words carried like an offering
Upon his dying breath

The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be

I live, like in a dream, among the ruins
Of what has been
The slow descent into madness
The churning swell of love and chaos
What was once at hand was now
Forbade to touch

The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be

Annie won't you sit and have another drink with me?
I'll keep them waiting while you sip your tea
Annie won't you sit and list them one more time
The reasons why I failed to to keep you mine?

Regret is for your those with choices
Those will voices
Those with reasons to stick around
So cast me deep into those black depths
With the reassurance that Death gets
The sons-of-bitches too
(and they won't be coming back for you)

The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and me
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be
When we were free
How I long to be
