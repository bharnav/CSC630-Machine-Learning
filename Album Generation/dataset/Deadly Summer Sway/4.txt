You know that I'm your perfect lover
And you know that I'm your perfect lover
I'm not going to lift a finger to make you call
Dance with me baby
I know you want to dance
I know because it's in your eyes
Yeah, you don't make me wait
You don't make me cry
You don't make me fall out
I want to know where you are
You know that I'm your perfect lover
And you know that I'm your perfect lover
I'm not going to lift a finger to make you call
Drive with me baby
I know you want to drive
I know because it's in your heart
Yeah, you don't make me wait
You don't make me cry
You don't make me fall out
I want to know where you are
California be our sky tonight
In this super stardom
Its a blood ring
You couldn't be better
You should be calm
And you should be home
You should be home
Dancing with me so alone
You should be home
Dancing with me so in love
You know that I'm your perfect lover
And you know that I'm your perfect lover
And I'm not going to lift a finger to make you call
Dance with me baby
Smile with me honey
I just smiled in the streetlight
With all the electronica
