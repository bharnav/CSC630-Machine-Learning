If you know what you want
And you know what you need
But you say what they want
Then be free
I'm going to tell it to them
See how it feels
And now your words are on wheels
They will just push you along
So what you're gonna kill it for me?
Do you want to get by with us
Do you want to get high with us
Every night when we get home
We get drunk and we get stoned
The fight is never far away
You make it good
You may get saved
If you go it alone
Their going to say that you're not
When they don't let you know its too much
You will end up working on it
Know what you want
Know what you need
But you say what they want
Then be free
You gonna kill it for me?
Do you wanna get by with us
Do you want to get by with us
Every night when we get home
We get drunk and we get stoned
The fight is never far away
You make it good
You may get saved
Look at the sun
It sits there for me
But I just want to fire
