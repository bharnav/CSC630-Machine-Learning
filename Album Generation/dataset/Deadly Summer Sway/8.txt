We're going to run the night girl
We're going to run tonight
Run the whole night down girl
Down to the morning light
Meet me by edge of the town
Down by the apple tree
You know the one I mean girl
Where I first laid eyes on thee
Cadet plane wanted me
Jet plane
Meet me by the edge of the road girl
Down by the apple tree
You know the one i mean girl
Where I first laid eyes on thee
Meet me by the edge of the train girl
Don't make me wait no more
You know the one that's going up
The one that I'm taking off
Cadet plane wanted me
Jet plane
Cadet plane wanted me
Jet plane
Jet plane
I got it in my brain
Jet plane
I got it in my brain
