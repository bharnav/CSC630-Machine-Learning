Candyman shimmer
Candyman turn
Look at the sun
It's in a honey jar
We spin for the people
We spin for the people
The highway is in my
Blue over coat
Blue turtle neck
Pulled way above my blue eyes
We spin for the people
We spin for the people
Oh oh yeah i shimmer
I shimmer oh x4
Shimmer in the rain
The car is on fire
With evergreen ghosts
The dreams i had
When i hit the coast
We spin for the people
We spin for the people
Candyman shimmer
Candyman turn
Look at the sun
It's in a honey jar
We spin for the people
We spin for the people
Shimmer in the rain
We are heading into the stars tonight
It's alright
We are heading into the storm tonight
It's alright
