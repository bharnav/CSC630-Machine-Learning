The killer is the only thing
That's in your heart
The wings are all in your teeth
My jaw is cash
Look at me i am hollow
Your step is in behind the night
It leans on my mind
The battle axe swings from your eyes
And into mine
Look at me i am hollow
Did you watch me from a far
How could you feel that i held heart
What ties us all is life
We never roll away
What ties us all is life
We never roll away
The only thing we ever had
Came from our heart
Everything is on my side
Till i meet you cold
What ties us all is life
We never roll away
What ties us all is life
We never roll away
