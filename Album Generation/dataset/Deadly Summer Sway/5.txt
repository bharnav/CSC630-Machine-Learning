You don't lean back on anyone
You disappear but I don't mind
You're waiting for the winter sun to change
You hollow out and see the light
Real freedom is hard to find
You're waiting for the winter sun to change
If I was the radio and you were truth
You know you couldn't trust me
I really couldn't trust in you
Underneath the denim sky
You disappear but I'm just shy
You're waiting for the winter sun to change
You're lying by the river side
Every lie goes with its tide
Both waiting for the winter sun to change
I am the radio and i am the truth
You know you shouldn't trust me
I really wouldn't trust in you
I want to be the one
In the morning by the setting sun
Waiting for the winter sun to change
If I was the radio and you were truth
You know you couldn't trust me
I really wouldn't trust in you
