All the others
Kiss my brother
On his head
I was wishing
I was kissing you instead
So I wanted summer
And I cut that rope
I went to the room
And I locked that door
She told me to loud knock
On her door
You know you're really one soul
She told my brothers
That I was trouble
And I was
I started thinking
I was sinking in my beer
So i reached for the light
But the light was low
So you know about your gun
But not from the floor
She told me to loud knock
On her door
You know you're really one soul
