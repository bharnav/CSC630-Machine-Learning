Well if it's true what they say about ya
You got me and I'm down for what ever now
If you dance like a Paris heart
I'll go and find the funk and I'll come right back
Oh girl I'm ready to die
Fly like inside a tiger
You got me and I'm down for what ever now
When the wind comes tan I'll surprise you
I follow every moon way down off the track
Oh girl I'm ready to die
I know the things that you do
It makes me hurt
I know the things that you say
It makes me
I know the things that you want to do to me
I know you think it's okay
You in high river style
The only way is blue on the borderline
When the stars come on high beam halo
The boys are coming in to enslave your brain
Oh girl I'm ready to die
