There are spiders inside your neck
But you won't admit to it
There are crows up inside your head
But you won't understand or give a damn
Well its getting late
But I will wait
There are crows up inside of your feet
But you won't admit to it
There are spiders in your hair
But you don't even care
Who put them there
Well its getting late but i will wait
On and on we roll like death in a can
Comfort in silence love and violence
And its getting late
But I will wait
There is ink up inside of your brain
But it all looks the same
On and on we roll like death in a can
Comfort in silence
Love and violence
Ink in your eyelids
Crows and spiders
