Now this is a song with a message

I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know

I didn't know

You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
But I found out
What it's all about

And I still don't know

You never know
You never know
You never know
You never know
I thought I knew
Just what to do

And I'll never know

How could I know?
How could I know?
How could I know?
How could I know?
I'm hear to say
Til my dyin' day

I really don't know

Next time I'll know
Which way to go
Next time I'll know (yeah, sure)
Next time I'll know
Some do it right
They do it all night

And they still don't know

I didn't know
I didn't know!
I didn't know
I didn't know
I really don't know
You gotta know
You never know
Next time I'll know
I didn't know
We'll never know
