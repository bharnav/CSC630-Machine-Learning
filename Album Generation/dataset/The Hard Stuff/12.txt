Give me back my wig
Honey let your head go bald
Give me back my wig
Honey let your head go bald
I really had no business
Honey, buyin' you no wig at all

Takin' you downtown
There â€“ four forty nine
When I get down there
I swear, nine ninety nine

Give me back my wig
Honey, let your head go bald
I really had no business
Honey, buyin' you no wig at all

And your mama told me
And your good friend, too
When you get that wig
That's the way you is gonna do

You just give me back my wig
Honey, let your head go bald
I really had no business
Honey, buyin' you no wig at all

Goodbye little woman
All I got to say
Give me back my wig
And be on your merry way

Give me back my wig
Honey, let your head go bald
I really had no business
Honey, buyin' you no wig at all
