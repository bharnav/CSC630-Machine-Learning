Well, I feel so lonesome
Baby, hear me when I moan
I feel so lonesome
Baby, hear me when I moan
Mmmm, who been drivin my Dynaflow, mama
Woo hoo since I been gone?

I flash my lights mama
My horn won't even blow
I flash my lights mama
My horn won't even blow
Gotta bad disconnection baby
Woo hoo somewhere down below

Coils won't even buzz mama
Generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition, baby
Gotta have my batteries charged
I'm cryin' please
Please don't do me wrong

Who been drivin' my Dynaflow, baby
For you since I been gone?

(mumbled words)

Mr. Highwayman
Please don't block my road
Mr. Highwayman
Please don't block my road
It registerin' a cool one hundred, boy
And I'm booked and I've gotta go

I'm gonna get deep down in this connection
Keep on tanglin' with your wires
Deep down in this connection, baby
Woo hoo keep on tanglin' with your wire
Mmmm, when I mash down on your little starter
Then your spark plug will give me fire

(squeeze my lemon til the juice run down my legâ€¦)
