Hello Josephine
How Do You Do?
Do You Remember Me Baby
Like I remember You?
You used to laugh at Me
And holler 'Hoo-hoo-ooo'

I used to walk You Home
I used to hold Your Hand
You used to use My Umbrella
Ev'rytime it rained
You used to cry so much
It was a cryin' shame

You Used To Live Over Yonder
By the railroad tracks
When it rained You couldn't walk
I used to tote You on My Back
Now, You try to make believe
It wasn't no days like that
