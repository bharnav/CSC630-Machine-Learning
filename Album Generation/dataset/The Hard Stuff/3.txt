Whoa, I
I got my eyes on you

Well you came along and knocked me out
When I saw you there was no doubt
I got my eyes on you
Yes, I, I got my eyes on you

When I saw you get on the floor
I knew right then I had to see some more
I got my eyes on you
Yes, I, I got my eyes on you

You know it's true!

Well, I don't know
Where you came from
You hit me like an atomic bomb
I got my eyes on you
Yes, I got my eyes on you

Well I saw you
And you saw me
You stung me
Like a honey bee
That's why, woo!
Got my eyes on you
Yes, I, I got my eyes on you
You know it's true
