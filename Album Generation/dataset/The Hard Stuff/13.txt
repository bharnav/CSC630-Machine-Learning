I gotta gal lives a way cross town
She don't stand no foolin' around
My baby told me we could make it somehow
Well there ain't no time like there is right now

I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
You know I'm takin' care of business
I'm takin' care of business right now

Well you put a five right in my hand
If I don't show then you'll understand
I don't want to duck when the bill man' due
If I can't give five then a two will do

I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
You know I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business right now

You see me duckin' and I can't come out
I'll be right inside just a lookin' out
The law man's got his eye on me
I'll be makin' that scene like a one, two, three

I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Yes I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business right now

Yeah, I gotta gal lives way downtown
She don't stand no foolin' around
Baby told me we could make it somehow
There ain't no time like there is right now

I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
I'm takin' care of business
Takin' care of business

You know I'm takin' care of business
I'm takin' care of business right now
