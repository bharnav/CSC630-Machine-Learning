It's three in the morning
What happened last night?
Did I treat her sweet
Or did we fuss and fight?

Fear like a hammer
Poundin' in my head
Drownin' in my own sweat
Afraid to get out of bed

If that ain't bad enough
You'd think I'd had enough
Of the Hard Stuff
The Hard Stuff

Five o'clock shadow
The walls are closin' in
Starin' at the ceiling
Can't get out of my skin

If that ain't bad enough
You'd think I'd had enough
Of the Hard Stuff
The Hard Stuff, yeah

Stumble out of bed
Shakin' in my bones
Is she still with me
Or am I all alone?

Thought I was tough
Yeah, but I ain't tough enough
For the Hard Stuff
The Hard Stuff

Nine o'clock at night
Here we go again
Get it together
Drownin' in my sin

The Hard Stuff
The Hard Stuff
Ain't tough enough
Yeah, for the Hard Stuff
It's the Hard Stuff
The Hard Stuff
Ah, The Hard Stuff
