I'm going to leave this town
And I'm going back down south
I'm going to leave this town
And I'm going back down south
Where the women treat me like a king
Eat chicken in every house

I drink wine every night
And go fishin' everyday
I drink wine every night
And go fishin' everyday
Pray in church on Sunday
Go and lay in the sun and play

I'm still a backdoor man
But I ain't gonna tote my .44 no more
I'm still a backdoor man
Ain't gonna tote my .44 no more
I'm still built for comfort
And my name reign everywhere I go

My name reign in Mississippi
Reign in Georgia, too
My name reign in Mississippi
Alabama and Georgia, too
I'm going back down south
Where the women sure no what to do

I'm going to leave this town
And I'm going back down south
I'm going to leave this town
And I'm going back down south
Where the women treat me like a king
Eat chicken in every house
Hooo, Lawd
