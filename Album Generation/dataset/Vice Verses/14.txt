[Verse 1]
I hear you breathing in
Another day begins
The stars are falling out
My dreams are fading now, fading out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been keeping my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my eyes wide open

[Chorus]
Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Your love is a song

[Verse 2]
The dawn is fire bright
Against the city lights
The clouds are glowing now
The moon is blacking out, it's blacking out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So I've been keeping my mind wide open
I've been keeping my mind wide open, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Oh, your love is a song
Your love is a song
Oh, your love is a song
Your love is strong

[Pre-Chorus 3]
With my eyes wide open
I've got my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my hopes unbroken
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Your love is a song, yeah, yeah
Your love is my remedy
Oh, your love is a song
