[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
The static comes in slow
You can feel it grow
Our stream of conscience flows
Under the streets below
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The rivers made of sound
Still running underground
Runs like a silent flood
We run as thick as blood

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Can you hear it rise
Up from the ground?
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down

[Verse 3]
The static comes alive
Beneath the broken skies
John Perkins said it right
"Love is the final fight"
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Rise above
There is no song
Louder than love

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down
Down!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Up from the ground
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our fallen condition
We are the voice of breaking down

[Outro]
This is the sound, this is the sound
