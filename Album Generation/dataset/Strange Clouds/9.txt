[Intro: Ryan Tedder]
1,2,3

[Chorus: B.o.B]
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
As she takes the stand
By the look in her eyes I can tell that’s she knows
That she’s holding the fate of my world in her hands
Damn, fo’ real
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up the defendant
And I guess it just happened by chance
Damn, and you hope
You hopin’ that a miracle happens
You prayed that the Judge doesn't bang that gavel
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand
Like the last note of the saddest song
We’re like the last word at the end of the poem
You know, sometimes there's nothing worse than being alone
It’s funny how you never know what you got ‘til it’s gone

[Chorus]

[Hook: B.o.B]
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
What’s the one thing in this life that you live for?
Who do you know in the world you would die for?
Who would lie for?
Who if they committed a crime you would stop on a dime and do time for
Cuz it was me she would lie for
And that was her that I cried for
Now I’d give it all away to get her back
Cuz she ain’t free, no, this ain’t no July 4th
Yea, no, it don’t sound logical
But there’s some things in this life that you gotta do
Brother, one thing in this world that got to you
I’d let it all go but I ain’t dropping you

[Chorus + Hook]

[Outro]
It might be wrong or it might be right
But there’s no looking back and we won’t sleep tonight
We’re living while we’re young and this is worth the fight
Even if I lost it all

[Chrous + Hook]
