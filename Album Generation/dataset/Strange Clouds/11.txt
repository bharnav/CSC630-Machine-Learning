[Verse 1]
But she the type of girl drive the whole hood crazy
Little Red Riding Hood riding M80’s
The type of girl that will probably be famous
Hollywood superstar, magazine pages
Apparently she had a thing for a nigga
Unfortunately the nigga wasn’t me
Nowadays she’s the life of the party
Glamorous and glossy, taking photos in the VIP

[Hook]
Now I’m like damn, wow look at you now
You got the whole world chasing you down
Miss Marry mack, mack, mack y'all
Dressed in black, black, black
With a rude attitude-tude-tude
And tattoos down your back, back, back

[Hook 2]
But still you run circles through my head (circles through my head)
Circles through my head (circles through my head)
There she goes again (There she goes again)
And there she goes again (There she goes again)
I just wanna get to know ya
But you turn the other shoulder
And there she goes again (There she goes again)
Running circles through my head (circles through my head)

[Verse 2]
Running circles through my membrane
Top speed, she don't shift gears, switch lanes on it
I haven’t seen ya in a minute
But the hands of time show me it’s some good thangs for ya
Like a A list celebrity, they ain’t gotta see ID
Cuz nowadays she’s the life of the party
Glamorous and glossy, taking photos in the VIP

[Hook 1]
