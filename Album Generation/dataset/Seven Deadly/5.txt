Call my brothers I will be there
Call my mother t offer off the pray
I hear the rack of shame
We I'll be. before the
Down in the. the king I want for nothing nothing to gave
She has the power of a mystical art
She has a crossed... I am a last stone rider
And I will do this for the. speaking

And my sleep this boos come down
She is the last man standing
Solid as a rock just as she is breathing...
I have a power and... I through my fingers in your curly hear
. come down I got my feet on the ground
Time to go on sum me up now hey hey
Farm me up
