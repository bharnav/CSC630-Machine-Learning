Hey, hey! Ah... yeah...
If I could just one night
Stay within your soul
What I found - something special
Or just one bed more
Burn your captain
Wish I could've stayed
I'm burning your heart, babe
It wasn't only for a day
Goin' on down, goin' round (round)
Going now - mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going by mojo town
I'm going down babe
Now I'm (in) mojo town
And it would please me greatly
If time stood still
For i'd be walking backwards
And that's my own will
When I'm hidden in fire
I will roll like a funeral pyre
With a memory that won't fade
I'm left with a burning blade (blace?)
Goin' on down, goin' round
Going now - mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going down to mojo town
(solo)
I'm burning your captain
Wish I could have stayed
I'm burning your heart babe
Is (was?) it only for a day
Goin' on down, goin' round
Going now - mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going down to mojo town
Hey yeah! I'm going down now
I'm gonna run to town, hey!
