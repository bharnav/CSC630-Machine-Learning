I got small whisky and little Cadillac's
Got A. With a wheel tape
No one of those. With the man in his head
Feel the gun now yeah yeah
Fear the gun now
There is no mercy and no miracle...
Godfathers'. Ain't move forma little town rush
This over reaches. Sector over our last and found
I am gonna burry it 60 under the ground
Year of the gun coming over mountain
Give me more he looks so cute
Year of the gun Year of the gun
I stop breathing 2 45 angel. Coming undone
Some bloody hell with a seal
Save their prayers. Lost and found
I need your. Under the ground
Year of the gun Year of the gun
Year of the gun Year of the gun
Year of the gun Year of the gun
Year of the gun Year of the gun
