Now get out a message, let my mother know
I'm held captive in a freak show
Tell my friends back in old Calcutta
The cat is dead and i'm living in the gutter
Cleopatra's running with the Turks
Karl Marx put a spanner in the works
Oh sweet mary, i,m soaked and dim
Squeeze me up from the bottom of a tin
It's a fight night, here on Mexican TV
I'm long gone, no no no no
Get some help right over here
Oh sweet Lord, I can smell the fear
Hmm Hmmm Hmmm...
Everybody has a story to tell
Everybody has a story to tell
Turn off the TV, put the radio on
I'm the star who is still long gone
Cleopatra's running with the Turks
I'm going to hit her, right where it hurts
Oh sweet Mary, I'm soaked in sin
This is above obedience, I will win
It's a fight night, here on Mexican TV
I'm long gone, hey hey hey hey
Get some help right over here
I can smell this kind of fear
Long long walk, right down to (what I'am) coming for
To the tingle jangle now of the bar room door
This has an err of something very strange
I'm 22 and I'm on a shooting range
It's a fight night, here on Mexican TV
I'm long gone, hey hey hey hey
Get some help right over here
I can smell this kind of fear
It's a fight night, here on Mexican TV
I'm long gone, no no no no
Get some help right over here
Oh sweet Lord, I can smell the fear
Hey, hey, yes
