It's long road that takes me back to you baby
It's a long time I have you on y mind
She is from a broken arrow. took a wrong turn
An took my home to you baby
Steal yourself on cheap talk of. kill yourself for one of your lies
You know you are gonna kill yourself
Watch the buffalo feel this whole beat
Watch the. blow turn a hole in my,.
With your black... took a long time to get you off my mind
You steal yourself for one of. again kill yourself for just one lies
Steal yourself on cheap talk and. kill yourself for one of your lies
You steal yourself for one of. again kill yourself for just one lies
Steal yourself on cheap talk and. kill yourself for one of your lies
You steal yourself for one of. again kill yourself for just one lies
Steal yourself on cheap talk and. kill yourself for one of your lies
