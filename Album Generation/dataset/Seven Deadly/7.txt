There is a sunset close behind
There is a blue ,light calling me
Trouble of the heart tonight I am so blind
I can see I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
Could be too long of this where the shoulder
..of new pretenders wanting to be heard and shout out loud
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
Sometimes I take out this gun on the motion boulevard
I put it on my mouth … here it comes and I don’t know
Feeling is gone and I wanna .. in this life I call it tight
Drop the … I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
