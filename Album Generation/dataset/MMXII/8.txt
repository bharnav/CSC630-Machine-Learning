Recognition, anamnesis, déjà vu, oblique psychosis
Familiar faces, signs & sigils – crossing point, magnetic fields
Music based on cyclic collapse – calendars that mark the moon
Nocturnal emissions wax – transmission from the Vortex room

A trance (in the fields of light)

Wonder and amazement at the synchronized coincidence
Binding us through all the decades – predetermined providence
Souls fed by a cosmic fire
Earthly delights – all of sense
Gather at this crossing point
(I'm overcome with reverence)

A trance (in the fields of light)

Implanted upon this planet (starseed was our genesis)
Pyramids & obelisks unconsciously reminded us
Sky beings & balls of light
Myth & legend learned anew
Geometrical creation hidden from the common view

A trance (in the fields of light)
