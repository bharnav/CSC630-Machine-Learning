Rapid inhuman advance of nano-computer technologies
It's changing our emotional development for the lure of immortality
If a virus counts as life in a post-human dream
The future doesn't need us - beloved Mother intervene!

Colony Collapse

A rupture in the fabric of human history
Self-assembling nanobots and human fallibility
Misprogrammed to replicate us - a grey goo of nano sea
The future doesn't need us - beloved Mother intervene!

Colony Collapse
