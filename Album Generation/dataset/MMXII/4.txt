Grand masters pulling strings
Wet dream of a new world order
Neo-feudal blueprints rise
We all got fooled again

It's an ADD generation
Everyone accepts
The re-introduction of slavery
By a corporate elect

Tyrant of me and mine
Dominion over our lives
Condemned of Solomone's mines
We all got fooled again

It's an ADD generation
Everyone accepts
The re-introduction of slavery
By a corporate elect
It's an ADD generation
Everyone accepts
The re-introduction of slavery
By a corporate elect

This is the fight back now
Free speech put the test by
Immoral psychopaths
We all got fooled again

It's an ADD generation
Everyone accepts
The re-introduction of slavery
By a corporate elect
It's an ADD generation
Everyone accepts
The re-introduction of slavery
By a corporate elect
