Nothing is real
All is illusion
Escape from flesh
Transcend the earthly
With fire and chants
Purification
Between the worlds
In this state of bill

Rapture

Revitalize
To the ecstatic
Re-energize
Recharge batteries
Liberations of incantations
Liberate with
Spasms convulsions

Rapture

Free me from all
Materialism
Let every breath
And act have meaning
Leap Icarus
O great grain of sand
With certainty
Into the abyss

Rapture
