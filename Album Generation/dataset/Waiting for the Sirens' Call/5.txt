One time didn't do it
Two times didn't feel quite right
I didn't know where I was going
I just knew that I would be alright
I woke up in a drunken haze
The sun shone through my window pane
I said that I would never do it again
What kind of fool do you think I am?
It happens, it always seems to happen
Morning, night and day I just want some action
Give me satisfaction, send me to my fate
Morning, night and day
I had a good time late last night
I didn't think it would ever end
I walked home in a broad day light
Couldn't get a cab at half past five
One drink wouldn't do it
Two drinks are far too much
I didn't know what I was doing
I hit the floor in a pile of dust
It happens, it always seems to happen
Morning, night and day I just want some action
Give me satisfaction, send me to my fate
Morning, night and day
So if you think that it won't get you
Well, think again friend 'cause it's not true
In my case, it was not my fault
Other people made that call
One time didn't do it
Two times didn't feel quite right
It happens, it always seems to happen no matter what I say
Morning, night and day I just want some action
Need some satisfaction, before it gets too late
Send me to my fate, morning, night and day
