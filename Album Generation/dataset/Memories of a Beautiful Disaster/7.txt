My parents said it wouldn't last forever
And I'm still waiting to get better
Liars and they're lying to me now

I always knew that I wouldn't fit in
Kicked out but I never caved in
Liars and I'm dealing with it now, now

I'm screaming
(Screaming for my losers)
Screaming
(Scream at the abusers)

Show 'em that we're fed up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh

We're screaming
(Everybody hates us)
Screaming
('Cause they could never break us)

We're not gonna give up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh

Got a lot of friends worth losing
I've got a lot of friends just using me
So can you hear my battle cry?

I'm screaming
(Screaming for my losers)
Screaming
(Scream at the abusers)

Show 'em that we're fed up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh

We're screaming
(Everybody hates us)
Screaming
('Cause they could never break us)

We're not gonna give up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh

The world said it wouldn't last forever
But we're done waiting to get better
Liars, they're all liars

I'm screaming
(Screaming for my losers)
Screaming
(Scream at the abusers)

Show 'em that we're fed up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh

We're screaming
(Everybody hates us)
Screaming
('Cause they could never break us)

We're not gonna give up
Come and throw your hands up
Oh, oh, oh
