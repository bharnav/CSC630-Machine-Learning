A cigarette fills an empty room
Smell of heartbreaks and cheap perfume
Photos scattered across my wall
Maybe someday I'll take them off

But I miss you, yeah, I still miss you, yeah, and in the middle of the night
When I feel you by my side well, it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye
If I never made you cry, baby, this is killing me

So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah, love me bad again

All those words I never said on my lips taste like regret
Promises like fake tattoos
After all that we've been through
Well, I miss you, yeah, I still miss you

Yeah, in the middle of the night
When I feel you by my side well, it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye, if I never made you cry
Oh, baby, this is killing me

So love me bad, love me bad, yeah, love me bad again and again
And again and again and again, again and again and again
And again and again
Love me bad, love me bad, love me bad

And in the middle of the night when I feel you by my side
Well, it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye if I never made you cry
Well baby, this is killing me

So love me bad, love me bad, yeah, love me bad again
So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah, love me bad again
And again and again
