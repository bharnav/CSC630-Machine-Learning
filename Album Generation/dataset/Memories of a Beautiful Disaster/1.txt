[Verse 1]
You showed me love
And I wasn't quite sure just what to do with it
You saw my pain and you took me in with open arms
I'm not sure just what you saw
Maybe the better parts of me
All I know is that what I have
Is all I'll ever need

[Chorus]
Now I'm livin' a life worth livin'
It's bright enough to see
That all I want, yeah all I want is you

[Verse 2]
Took your time
And you didn't give a damn just what they thought of it
You eased my mind
And I never been sure how to do that myself
I don't know where you came from
Did you fall right out the sky?
All I know is what you fell upon
It finally feels alive

[Chorus]
Now I'm livin' a life worth livin'
It's bright enough to see
That all I want, yeah all I want is you
And even if the world was in my hands
Well, I'd just want you to know
That all I want, yeah all I want is you, is you, is you

[Bridge]
There was only so much I could take
You opened up and made me change
Yeah, you always held me through
And I'll do the same for you
I'll do the same for you

[Chorus]
Now I'm livin' a life worth livin'
It's bright enough to see
That all I want, yeah all I want is you
And even if the world was in my hands
Well, I'd just want you to know
That all I want, yeah all I want is you, is you
Yeah all I want, all I want is you
