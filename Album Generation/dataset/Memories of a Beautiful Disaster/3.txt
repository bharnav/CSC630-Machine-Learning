Something so familiar
It's like I met you somewhere before, before
I can finish your sentence
I can feel you behind the door, the door
Turn off the headlights
I'll do the pedals and you can steer
Into the darkness
Trust me there's nothing to fear, to fear

Close your eyes
Fall backwards
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you
Close your eyes
Just let yourself go
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you

You don't have to say it
It's like I know when you're gonna call, and you call
I was unconscious
I could see that you were not far, not far
You can kill the headlights
I'll do the pedals and you can steer
Into the darkness
Trust me there's nothing to fear, to fear

Close your eyes
Fall backwards
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you
Close your eyes
Just let yourself go
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you

You gotta trust me
You gotta trust me
Do ya trust me?
Do ya trust me?

Close your eyes
Fall backwards
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you
Close your eyes
Fall backwards
I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you

I won't let you die
I'll be right behind you
