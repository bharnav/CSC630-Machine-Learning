I see your eyes
You know they never change
Oh, the way they look at me
I see they're lookin' for a better way
Longin' to be free
'Cause ya know we been here before
And ya know we'll do it again

Oh, what are we doin'?
Look at our love in ruins
Let's not get misunderstood 'cause this is good
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground

This time this one blew up in my face
Don't forget, forgive me, please
You want everything to fall in place
But surrender is the key
'Cause ya know we been here before
And ya know we'll do it again

Oh, what are we doin'?
Look at our love in ruins
Let's not get misunderstood 'cause this is good
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
Love in ruins, love in ruins, love in ruins

'Cause ya know we been here before
And ya know we'll do it again

Oh, what are we doin'?
Look at our love in ruins
Let's not get misunderstood 'cause this is good
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
And you're pickin' all your pieces off the ground
