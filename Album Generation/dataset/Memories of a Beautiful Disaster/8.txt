Not easy enough
The way I am makes it tough
Come get your phone
Don't wanna be here alone
Someday I will be fine
Be able to see the sunshine
Appreciate what's mine
Appreciate that I'm one of a kind

I still believe
Though I'm on my knees
Yeah, I still believe

You're the outcast
You cry when we all laugh
I'll be the one that you want to be the outcast
You're the outcast
I cry when you all laugh
Outcast!

Someday we will be fine
Be able to see the sunshine
We won't go into it blind
We'll appreciate that we're one of a kind

I still believe
Though I'm on my knees
Yeah, we'll still be free

You're the outcast
You cry when we all laugh
I'll be the one that you want to be the outcast
You're the outcast
I cry when you all laugh
Outcast!

You're the outcast
You cry when we all laugh
I'll be the one that you want to be the outcast
You're the outcast
I cry when you all laugh
Outcast!

You're the outcast
You cry when we all laugh
I'll be the one that you want to be the outcast
You're the outcast
I cry when you all laugh
Outcast!

You're the outcast
You cry when we all laugh
I'll be the one that you want to be the outcast
You're the outcast
I cry when you all laugh
Outcast!
