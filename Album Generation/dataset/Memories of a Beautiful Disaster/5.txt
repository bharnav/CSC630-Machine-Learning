I lost myself again
Like the dead of the night, the dead of the night
I'm on a chase of fate, as the world rushes by
I'm bound to collide
Now I won't wait to walk away
My last mistake
Every time I go under I'm running from this

And I try so hard
But I can't wake up
I'm speeding up the meter and the sirens echo on
And it's all too wrong
But I can't let go
I'm falling even deeper but it's better than before

I found myself again
With the dead of the night, the dead of the night
It takes me to a place
That I wish I could find a way out of my mind
Too much to think
Too late to stay
I try to break
But again and again I'm calling for help

And I try so hard
But I can't wake up
I'm speeding up the meter and the sirens echo on
And it's all to wrong
But I can't let go
I'm falling even deeper but it's better than before

It hurts to go
So why do you need?
So why do you need to see me walk right out the door?
I'm on my way
Help!

And I try so hard
But I can't wake up
I'm speeding up the meter and the sirens echo on
And it's all too wrong
But I can't let go
I'm falling even deeper but it's better than before
