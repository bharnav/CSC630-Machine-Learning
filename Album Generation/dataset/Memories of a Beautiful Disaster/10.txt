Tonight, I'm okay
When the lights go down
And I hit the stage
I'm alive, there's no way
You can stop me now
It's in my veins
I can't wait
Let's start the show!

It's time to see you stand up
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
(Come on)
Tell me if you want it
Stand up!
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
Tell me if you're ready to go
Ready to go!

Turn it up, let it grind
Just plug me in, I'm amplified
Can't stop me, block me!
Don't care if it's the death of me
Tickin' like a time bomb
Ready to blow
Now it's time
Let's start the show!

It's time to see you stand up
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
(Come on)
Tell me if you want it
Stand up!
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
(Come on)
Tell me if you're ready to go
Ready to go!

Time won't wait for anyone
Cause we don't live forever
And if you think I've had enough
I'm only getting started now
You'll see
The lights are shining on me
Yeah yeah

Wanna see you stand up
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
Yeah!

Stand up!
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
(Come on)
Tell me if you want it
Stand up!
Let me see your hands up
Wanna hear you shout it out
(Come on)
Tell me if you're ready to go
Tell me if you're ready to go
Tell me if you're ready to go
