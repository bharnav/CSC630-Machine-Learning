She sits in a corner
Singing herself to sleep
Wrapped in all of her promises
That no one seemed to keep
She no longer cries to herself
No tears left to wash away
Just diaries of empty pages
Feelings gone astray
But she will sing

'Til everything burns
While everyone screams
Burning their lies
Burning my dream
All of this hate
All of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger rains
'Til everything burns

Walking through life unnoticed
Knowing that no one cares
Too consumed in their masquerade
No one see her there
And still she sings

'Til everything burns
While everyone screams
Burning their lies
Burning my dream
All of this hate
All of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger rains
'Til everything burns

Everything burns
Everything burns
Everything burns
Watching it all fade away
Everything burns

Everything burns
While everyone screams
Burning their lies
Burning my dream
All of this hate
All of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger rains
'Til everything burns

Everything burns
Everything burns
Watching it all fade away
Everything burns
Everything burns
Watching it all fade away
