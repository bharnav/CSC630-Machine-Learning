Does temptation have you lead astray?
Or counting them every day
'til your fool comes home
'til your fool comes home
Can you stand to be alone
'til your fool comes home

Does separation make time stand still
Or time to kill
'til your fool comes home
'till your fool comes home
Can you stand to be alone
'til your fool comes home

I said now hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Behave yourself when I'm gone

Well have patience and just be strong
Because it won't be long
'till your fool comes home
'till your fool comes home
Can you stand to be alone
'til your fool comes home
