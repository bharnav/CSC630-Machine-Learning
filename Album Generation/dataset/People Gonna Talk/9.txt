It's so easy to say I'm sorry
When the harm has already been done
But what about my nights spent crying
I still remember every one

It's so easy to say I love you
It just trips off the tongue somehow
But what about your endless lying
For all I know you're lying now

Well it's easy to fool with a heart that's true
But so hard to let go, don't you think I know

It's so easy to say forgive me
But the words of forgiveness won't come
Now don't you know how hard I'm trying
It's so much easier said than done
