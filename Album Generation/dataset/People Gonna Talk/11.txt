They tell me I'm wrong
To want to stand alongside my love
Whoa I'm talking 'bout my my my love
If only they knew
What I wouldn't do for my love
I'm talking 'bout my my my my love

No kind of praise
Could ever turn my gaze from my love
Whoa I'm talking 'bout my my love
The darkest night
Could never dim the light from my love
I'm talking 'bout my my my my love

Long have I prayed
That I could end my days with my love
Whoa I'm talking about my my love
Times gonna come
And I've told everyone but my love
I'm talking 'bout my my my my love

I'm taking 'bout my love
I'm talking 'bout my my my my oh

My love
