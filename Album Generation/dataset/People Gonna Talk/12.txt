Troubles came a calling
Like they did before
I finally got around to
Showing them the door
This time I put my foot down
Said come back some other time
Cause I'm all through cryin'

Since I met you baby
I'll never be the same
The bridge that brought me over
Is going up in flames
From this day on I know
The sun is going to shine
And I'm all through cryin'

Got to thank somebody
For bringing you to me
For sending me the love
I thought I'd never see
Cause it was only tears
That had me blind
And I'm all through cryin'

You know I'm all through cryin'
