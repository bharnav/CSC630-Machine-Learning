I live three days to your one
The world won't owe me a thing
By the time I'm gone
Whoa, well now
Yeah Yeah

Chorus:
Baby don't you know
There's a riot going on in my heart
Now baby in my heart
Baby don't you know
There's a riot going on in my heart
Baby in my heart
I said don't you know
It's tearing me apart

Just put yourself in my shoes
Let me know if the world
Looks the same to you
Whoa, well now
Yeah Yeah

Chorus
