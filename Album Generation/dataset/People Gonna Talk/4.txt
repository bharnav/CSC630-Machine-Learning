I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Can't you see it in my smile
I'm in heaven when you hold me
You make my mind go wild
I could fall into a whole world of trouble over you

Mollena you're an angel
I've got heaven in my hand
Mollena sometimes I wonder
If they'll ever understand
I could fall into a whole world of trouble over you

Mollena before I met you
I'd always walked the line
I know you'd leave me
If I let you
The blame's entirely mine
Cause I could fall into a whole world of trouble over you

Oh Mollena don't go
