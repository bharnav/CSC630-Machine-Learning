You got me so I can't help but fail
I can't watch both my head and tail
Well I can't win baby
I can't win with you
Strike me dead if I don't love you
And I'll be damned if I do

Now how'd I show you I still care
If I'm to mind my own affairs
Well I can't win baby
I can't win with you
Strike me dead if I don't love you
And I'll be damned if I do

Now I'm not sure just how much more I can take
Ain't I suffered long enough for one mistake

Now baby I aim to please and I always will
If you just hold the target still
Now I can't win baby
I can't win with you
Strike me dead if I don't love you
And I'll be damned if I do
