Darling if ever you refuse me
Like I know you will one day
I won't let the change confuse me
I'll know that my cue to walk away

When I feel my chances growing slimmer
And there's every chance they made
When the lovelight in your eyes grows dimmer
I'll know that's my cue to walk away

I won't hang around where I'm not wanted
Wouldn't make no sense to stay

When I feel my chances growing slimmer
Cause there's nothing left to say
When the lovelight in your eyes grows dimmer
I'll know that's my cue to walk away
