You didn't know my heart would mend
And you'd take my place on the receiving end
Now I won't even stop you leaving I'll be helping you to pack
So baby don't come back
Don't come back

Now I didn't mind being left alone
But I got tired of you bringing your business home
Now I'm making alterations to the welcome on the mat
To baby don't come back
Don't come back

Would never have revenge in mind
Cause an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind
But forgiveness is the business of some other diplomat
So baby don't come back
Don't come back

Don't come back
