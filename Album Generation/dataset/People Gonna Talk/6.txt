All my love
Belongs to you
If I had money baby
You could have it too

All my time
Is yours to claim
But I won't be led around
By the watch & chain

Chorus:
So c'mon c'mon c'mon baby
My love's the strongest in the land
I don't want to hear no maybe
You got my future in your hand

Pride may come
Before a fall
But darling I could only climb so high
On no pride at all

So I'll keep my pride
If it's all the same
And I won't be led around
By the watch & chain

Chorus

If the world
Was mine to give away
You'd have had it signed, sealed
And delivered yesterday

Along with anything
You'd care to name
But I won't be led around
By the watch & chain

Chorus
