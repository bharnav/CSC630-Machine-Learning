[Verse 1]
Every morning when I wake, a feeling soon begins to overtake me
Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain; it finally surrounds me
There is fire, there is life, there is passion, fever and fury
There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I have a flame, feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

[Verse 2]
If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me; I keep myself so close to my side
No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea
Because every day, your fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
It is burning
It is burning

[Verse 3]
You can trust me, we can laugh. Together we can share our sorrow
I will give you secrets too, an attitude that you may borrow
Gypsy woman said to me, one thing you must bear in your mind
You are young and you are free, but damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
