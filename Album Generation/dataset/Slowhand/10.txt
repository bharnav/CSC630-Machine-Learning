[Chorus]
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been gone

[Verse]
Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Come home this morning
Clothes don't fit you right

Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
I've had no loving
Such a great long time

[Chorus]
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been gone
