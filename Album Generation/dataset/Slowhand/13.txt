[Chorus 1]
You speak to me in sign language
As I am eating a sandwich in a small cafe
At a quarter to three

[Verse 1]
But I cannot respond to your sign language
You are taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?

[Chorus 2]
It was there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
This is my story, still I am still there
Does she know I still care?

[Verse 2]
Link Wray was playing on a jukebox, I was paying
For the words I was saying, so misunderstood
He did not do me no good

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
