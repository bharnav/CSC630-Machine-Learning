[Verse 1]
She's got everything a man could ever ask for
She is lovely, brighter than a morning star
She is so beautiful, portrait of a sunset
She got everything, including my old car

[Chorus 1]
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to warn you that you're bound to get hurt
I couldn't be her last love, so how could you be her first?
I want to tell you, buddy, things are bound to get rough
I know that she's only flirting, but I think that I've had enough

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
