[Verse]
Early this morning
You knocked upon my door
Early this morning
You knocked upon my door
And I said
"Hello, Satan I believe it's time to go"

Me and the devil
Were walking side by side
Me and the devil
Were walking side by side
I'm going to beat my woman
Until I get satisfied

She said she doesn't see why
That I will dog her around
(Now baby, you know you aren't doing me right)
She said she doesn't see why
That I will dog her around
Well, it must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in the ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
(I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone.)
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
Oh, my old evil spirit
Can take a Greyhound bus and ride
