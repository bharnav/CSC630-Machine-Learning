Taking my time, taking my time
Do you feel like I feel when your all alone
Taking my time, taking my time
You know how it feels 'cause your on your own
Broke down wasted
Talking to you, you don't give a damn
Broke down face it
Talking to you, why don't you understand
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Wasted
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Just wasted
Yeah
Yeah
Taking my time, taking my time
You know I gave it all and you wanted more
Taking my time, taking my time
You know You took it all and you left me torn
Broke down faded, my minds slippin down in sin
Broke down jaded, ain't no saint inside this skin
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Wasted
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind
No more wasting time
Take a shot you could never never hurt me
Take a shot you could never never get me
Take a shot you could never never hurt me
Take a shot
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Wasted
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Wasted
Just wasted
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Wasted
I've been waiting so long
I've made up my mind, all of this time
Just Wasted
Ain't no saint saint inside this skin
Tounge tied and twisted
I've givin' in
