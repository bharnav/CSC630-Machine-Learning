Yeah, I'm black and blue from head to toe and face the street
Yeah, I don't give a damn about who you are or what you need

We are the perfect face with a perfect smile
Plastic underneath
But I can pluck the world like an apple and
Strip it down with my teeth

Well I ride, and I ride
And I move when I move
And I'll make it on my own

I could be with anyone
But I'd rather be alone
(be alone, be alone)

Yeah, tripping over tounges
But my mouth's left open wide
Yeah, take another piece
But the rest of me will never die

Throw the words away, from breath to breath
You know how I feel
It's like my friends? are a second skin
And my second skin just won't peel

Well I ride, and I ride
And I move when I move
And I'll make it on my own

I could be with anyone
But I'd rather be alone

Well I ride, and I ride
And I move when I move
And I'll make it on my own

I could be with anyone
I'd rather be...
Yes, I'd rather be...

Well I ride, and I ride
And I move when I move
And I'll make it on my own

I could be with anyone
But I'd rather be alone

Well I ride, yeah
And I move, yeah
And I make it on my own

I could be with anyone
I'd rather be, I'd rather be alone
