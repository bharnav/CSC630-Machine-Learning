[Intro]
If you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder, could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine?

[Verse 1]
Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns
Then, my friend, you've used my dimes

[Verse 2]
If there's water in the pitcher
And we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darling
I'd need less water than you'd think

[Verse 3]
My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh, yeah
Listen to this

[Verse 4]
Some people want
But they don't want to give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me

[Verse 5]
Starting today
Tomorrow and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door
Baby
I want you to be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo, baby
I don't think that's asking you too much to do

[Verse 6]
Listen
Don't you walk around here
Feeling like you can treat me any old way
Using my love, my time, my heart
Day, day after day

[Outro]
Oh baby, baby
Be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo, whoo
Baby
