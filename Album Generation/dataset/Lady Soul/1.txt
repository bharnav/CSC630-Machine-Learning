[Verse 1]
Told my darling that I had to go
It's your body, I don't care no more
Although you had me, time to get along

[Chorus]
Money won't change you, money won't change you
But time will take your own do

[Verse 2]
Then you know, how to be treated
Hold me, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman, my only girl

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know you're happy
To know you're happy, and to know you're gone
Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you own

[Verse 3]
I said, put a smile as good as gold
But that smile now can't be sold
You said, baby, that you had to go
Back to somebody, I don't care no more
Told your friends I was a fool
The trouble's, woman, that you've got to go through
Other lover won't take me home
I have a[?]
Even in the street, even in the car too
Mashed potatoes and boogaloo
Come on baby and let yourself go[?]
It's your body, I don't care no more
Come on baby, come on baby, everybody, everybody
Need your hand, need your hand
Let me tell you I, I, I[?]
I'm down so long[?]
