[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There is no place I'd like to be
Instead of grooving

[Bridge]
Groovin'
On a crowded avenue
Groovin'
Anything we like to do

[Verse 2]
There is no place I'd rather be
Imagine all the people that we'd like to see

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh darling, you send me
You
You
