Now can't you feel my love a'growin'
Can't you see it ain't a'showin'
Oh, you must be knowin'
I got a big big love

It's not the kind to be concealin'
It's the type to be revealin'
Oh, you must be feelin'
I got a big big love

I think it's time we done some walkin'
I think it's time we done some talkin'
There's a great big moon above
Honey, I got a big big love

This is not infatuation
It's true love sensation
It's not my imagination
I got a big big love
For you

I think it's time we done some walkin'
I think it's time we done some talkin'
Oh, there's a great big moon above
But honey, I got a big big love

This is not infatuation
It's true love sensation
It's not my imagination
I got a big big love

Now can't you feel my love a'growin'
Can't you see it ain't a'showin'
You must be knowin'
I got a big big love
I got a big big love
I got a big big love
For you
