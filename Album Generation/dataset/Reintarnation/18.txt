All this time thinking I was right
Tried to keep my love from open sight
But you Changed my mind

I was trying to be the one to coax
Even tried to tell myself love was a joke
Wakin' up and rakin' up a nights worth of dreams
Sweeping them away so they wouldn't be seen
I was tying up my wishes so they wouldn't unwind
But you changed my mind

Used to work real hard at stayin' alone
Afraid a mountain of love would be left as a stone
But you changed my mind

I even talked to myself
Tryin' to keep the voice in my heart inside asleep
But you changed my mind

Wakin' up and rakin' up a nights worth of dreams
Sweeping them away so they wouldn't be seen
I was tying up my wishes so they wouldn't unwind
But you changed my mind

Thinking all the while I had to control
The place that burns deep in my soul
Never woulda thought it would feel so cold
After spending my nights alone
Oh my mind
Wakin' up and rakin' up a nights worth of dreams
Sleepin' them away so they wouldn't be seen
I was tying up my wishes so they wouldn't unwind
But you changed my mind

You changed my mind
You changed my mind
You changed my mind
You changed my mind
You changed my mind
You changed my mind
