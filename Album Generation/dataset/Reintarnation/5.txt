What you see on TV
All them sparkles
It ain't me
I am givin' what I can
What I can

Things that I may tell you
Honey, I ain't lyin'
It ain't me
All this talkin' is how I feel
How I feel

I'm not asking for the world
I just wanna be an ordinary girl
Might not be all you want
But it's all you get, it's me

On them shiny pages
All that hairdo
It ain't me
I am showing just what I am
What I am
