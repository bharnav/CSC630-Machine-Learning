I'm gonna ring my baby tonight
We'll go downtown, done up right
Tap out toes
Shuffle those heels
When we dance I know it's real
I'm in love, L-o-v-e, Love
Dippity-do my hair to style
Study the mirror for a while
Take you home to wine and dine
Put on the Hifi some Patsy Cline
I'm in love, L-o-v-e, love
Swing your partner
Swing em up high
Alleman left and leave em sigh
Two steps round and round the floor
Promenade right out the door
Lead you to your corners all
Huggin, Kissin
Love, L-o-v-e, Love
Swing your partner
Swing em up high
Alleman left and leave em sigh
