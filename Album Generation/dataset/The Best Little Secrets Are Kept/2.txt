Ah bang a gong or get it on
We don't need to take off our clothes to get it on
Pull your skirt up a little bit
Pull down your top and show me a little tit
I said, "Hey short girl, you're like a midget
You can turn a phone cord into a widget"
She said, "You son of a bitch you little bitch
I ain't gonna show you my love without a hitch"
I said, "Hey hold up sugar just one at a time
Show me yours baby I'll show you mine"
She said, Oh you're so pathetic
Yeah well so...you're so magnetic"
I said, "Hold up girl I know your game
Ah you want a sugar daddy you can tame"

I said sing, sing me a song
And bang me like the girls in Hong Kong
I know I know I ain't correct
But politics are so much better when there's sex

I said, "Rollover do me a trick
Do it with your shoes on it'd be a kick
Ah tell me the horse that you pick
Let me buy you a lollipop you want to lick"
She said, "Does that shit work with other girls
If it does, why don't you find one of them to give you twirls
My love cost pearls"
Ah does it baby - you don't say
She said, "Hold up I know your game
You want a paper doll that you can tame"
I said, "Sing, sing me a song"
She said, "Well
Touch me like the boys
That did me wrong"
You know it's ok, it's alright
If you want clean fun go fly a kite
