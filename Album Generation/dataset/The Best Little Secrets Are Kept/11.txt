Well a party just isn't a party
Without me
So for all who gather
Without yours truly
I offer you up my sympathy
For all the girls who think they've got me made
I'd be straight with you but games
Are just so much fun to play

My reflection of us
A lovely solitude
While my body stabs you
With all my attitude
And you're all invited guests
Of the grand apartment

Well a party just isn't a party without me to start it

Is life without me merely interlude
While you dream of my body stabbing you
With all my attitude
And you're all invited guests
Of the grand apartment

A party just isn't a party without me to start it

Yeah

My reflection of us
A lovely solitude
While my body stabs you
With all my attitude
And you're all invited guests
To the grand apartment

A party just isn't a party without me to start it
