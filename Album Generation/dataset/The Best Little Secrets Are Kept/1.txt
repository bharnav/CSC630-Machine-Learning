Ah chocolate girl, well you're looking like something I want
(finding out true love is blind)
Ah and your little Asian friend, well she can come if she wants
(finding out true love is blind)
I want all the self conscious girls who try to hide who they are with makeup
(finding out true love is blind)
You know it’s the girl with a frown with the tight pants I really want to shake up
(finding out true love is blind)

Hey, carrot juice, I wanna squeeze you away until you bleed
(finding out true love is blind)
And your vanilla friend, well she looks like something I need
(finding out true love is blind)
I want miss little smart girl with your glasses and all your books
(finding out true love is blind)
And I want the stupid girl who gives me all those dirty looks
(finding out true love is blind)

Wind you up and make you crawl to me
Tie you up until you call to me
[X2]

Ah brown girl with those with the hot pants shaking that thing on the street
(finding out true love is blind)
Yeah and the short girls with the way they crawl knocks me off my feet
(finding out true love is blind)
And all the tough girls who never want me to see them cry
(finding out true love is blind)
And the girls who straight treat me like a dog until the day I die
(finding out true love is blind)
