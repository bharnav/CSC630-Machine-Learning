I'll take a ball of twine and I'll twirl ya
Like a yo-yo on the ground
Ya come up before ya come down

To a ball of twine you're like a yo-yo
Running on the ground
You come up before you fall down

Well God saved the Kinks
From the music and the big pinks
Cause sonny boy, well he's better than ya think

And there are things that I hear on the radio
Where they're singing all the same music fablio
I'd rather listen to the jets from the kitchen sink
So God save the music, and God save the pinks
