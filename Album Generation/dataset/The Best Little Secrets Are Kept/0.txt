Well I'm a weapon of mass destruction
Got no apologies for a hyper concussion
I might swipe your identity
Take your love and turn it into obscenity

You say that I don't care about
All the little things that you care about
Oh, you think that I don't care about
All the little things that make you want to shout

Oh, me me me me is all you say that I care about
Me me me me is all I ever want to talk about
Me me me me is what you think that I care about
Me me me me is all I really want to talk about

I'll steal your soul
Put you in a club in Cleveland

Well I'm a portal into blue collar human psychology
I need a fix, I don't need no apology
And all the kids on the street
They think I'm neat, neat, neat, neat, neat, well

Ah, me me me me is all you think that I care about
Me me me me is all I ever want to talk about
Me me me me is what you think that I care about
Me me me me is all I ever want to talk about

Who's your daddy?
It's me
