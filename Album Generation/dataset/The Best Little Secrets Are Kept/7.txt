You keep on telling me these pretty lies
Well I’m just a man and want you instead of the drugs that get me high
You keep on telling me these pretty lies
Well I’m just a man and want you instead of the drugs that get me high

You’re all around me like a freight elevator
You put things in me and say I’ll see you later

Every time I raise the courage up to talk
My teacher says go to the board with a piece of chalk
I’ll never talk out of turn again in class

Will it be alright if I see you tonight
Well, I feel like a bird in a cage
For you to notice me, Well I’d take out a knife
Suicide right on the stage

I’m like a fish on a hook
Water splash into the brook
Well, teacher says she’s twice my age
Hey teacher could you ease my pain

I can only watch you so long
I can only watch you so long, so long

You keep on telling me these pretty lies
Well I’m just a man and want you instead of the drugs that get me high
You keep on telling me these pretty lies
Well I’m just a man and want you instead of the drugs that get me high

I’ll never talk out of turn again in class

Will it be alright if I see you tonight
Well, I feel like a bird in a cage
For you to notice me, Well I’d take out a knife
Suicide right on the stage

I’m like a fish on a hook
Water splash into the brook
Well, teacher says she’s twice my age
Hey teacher could you ease my pain

I can only watch you so long
I can only watch you so long, so long
I can only watch you so long
I can only watch you so long, so long

Who’s your teacher’s pet?
