Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV

Dear Dominique I wrote to tell you you're delightful
Still I know want a strangle or a mouth full
Of gasoline or to be tied up and stoned
I wrote to tell you that I hope you're feeling better
Self addressed stamped envelope stuffed with your own death letter
Written in blood and in your own handwriting
There's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone

Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV

Well 13524 Park and East Boulevard
Your last stroll down the block was in the trunk of a car
I must admit that we never thought you'd go this far
Dear Dominique well I hope you're feeling better
You look so cute writing out your own death letter
Well now there's no one to watch your TV

Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone

Dear Dominique you have a bold imagination
The countless ways you thought to die no hesitation
Fantasize long enough, you know it just might come true

Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone

Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone [Repeat x6]
