You were born out in the fields
Way back when your life was real
Now you look at those you despise
With your catwalk eyes

From the wrong side of the tracks
Swore you were never ever going back
Nature gave you the perfect disguise
Catwalk eyes

Princes and poets and congressmen
At your feet they stand in a long line
They want to meet you as you walk by
Flashing those catwalk eyes

Born in the fields
Way back when your life was real
Now you look at those you despise
With your catwalk eyes
