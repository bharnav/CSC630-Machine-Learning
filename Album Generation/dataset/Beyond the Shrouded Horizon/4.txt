Waking to live learning to love
Like the rising tide quickening the blood
Glide of the falcon flight of the dove
Saw you in my dreams telepathy of love

And I've never seen your face before

Clouds like fountains in the air
Run to earth they soak the ground
A mountain range your glistening face
Monsoon falls a heart that pounds

And I've never seen your face before

Moon and Earth two are in one
Like the rising tide taken at the flood
Ancient mud red walls of clay
Kissed by sun at break of day
The singing moon that fills the room
Silent call of sand dunes

And I've never seen your face before

Waking to life
