She stops to remember a gentler time
With layers of pastel and blue tinted eyes
She's dating a guy who's half her age
Who vaguely resembles a young Jimmy Page

She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy

While trying out perfumes in Peter Jones
A fragrance reminds her of a time in Kings Road
In an open top car the Kennedys passed by
To this day she swears that Jack gave her the eye

She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy

She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy

She tried Karl Marx and Reverend Sun Moon
A Californian commune and Tuscany too
Somewhere in Time, A Walk in the Clouds
With Women in Love, Far from the Madding Crowd

She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy
She's only looking for fantasy
