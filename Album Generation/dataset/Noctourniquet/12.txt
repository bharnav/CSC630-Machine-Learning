[Verse 1]
I’m not breathing any better
My lips crack with every grin, yeah
I hear a scraping plea of branches
Against my broken window
Why do I let you in?
The silhouette holds me under
Can't poke me with these pins, yeah
Flotsam drip of nectar
The nexus bean sprouting
When she says

[Chorus]
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher

[Verse 2]
Antidote claps of thunder
From a gash of staple rain
This bed will never rest you
The answers in the sermon
Why do I let you in?
The stoking fits the crown and
A wasted gust of kin, yeah
Repulsion turns to nectar
When the pigment leaves the body
When she says

[Chorus]
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher

[Bridge]
Last born pray and first born caught
Crawling like an animal
Hold your breath it’s feeding time
In this zed and two naughts
In this zed and two naughts

Painted a fulcrum of caves
Piled with dreams of
Phantom masses made of pastures
Labyrinths turning, Cystic maze
I’ve been hanging wreaths of cancer
On every door where children sing
Watch it all blister
Watch it all blister!

[Chorus]
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
Don’t go wandering
With no one left to save
Cause no one’s at the wheel
Saint Christopher
