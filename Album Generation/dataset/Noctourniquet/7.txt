[Verse 1]

My anguish told you
A persistent lie
The parasitic psychics that you push by wheel
Were spoken to me every time

[Chorus]
And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time
These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought

[Verse 2]
My torment adores you
When my strings are tied
Out of compulsion I must decimate
The sapless embryonic miles

[Chorus]
And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time
These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought

[Bridge]
My knives are burrowed voices
Glistened by the handles so they won’t let go
These limbs are out of reaches
Extensions of a spirit that is not controlled
My heart is trapped inside
And I refuse to accept this throne

[Verse 3]
My night’s unfolding
Reads like a page of test results
This sterile codex
Is missing all my last resolve

[Chorus]
And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time
These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought
