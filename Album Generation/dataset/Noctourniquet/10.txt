[Verse 1]
Here it comes again
Mesh of arms travels up my neck
Morning dawn declares itself
And mirrors stare back at my reflection

[Chorus]
When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I want winter to fall on me
And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
I am free of equity
Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that I’m under
A kindred connivance
I’m written in runes

[Verse 2]
Here it comes again
Malady of Veda in your ears
Flood the class adorns your lips
I can’t stop myself because

[Chorus]
When I'm alone, I’m alone at night
I will set my father free
And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key
Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over
A kindred connivance
I’m written in ruins

[Bridge]
Long way patience to drown
Little prayers that you won't say for me
Long way patience to drown
Spin through my spiral, I dance dwindling
Long way patience to drown
You call me, I answer and all I can do is obey
Long way patience to drown
I can’t hold my breath for this long

[Chorus]
When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I wanna set my father free
And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key
Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over
I won’t let you, I won’t let them
Set me to repeat
