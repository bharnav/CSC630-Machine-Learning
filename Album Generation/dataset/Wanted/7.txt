Every day I get a brand new show
Off TV, record and radio.
I breeze with the sleaze on my cassette
Cause I got the affirmative
I know you, man

C30 C60 C90, go
C30 C60 C90, go
C-3-0, C-6-0
C30 C60 C90, go
C90, go
3-0 6-0 9-0, go

A bit-bam-boogie and a booga-rooga
My cassette's just like a bazooka
A bligger, a blagger, a bippity-bop
Well I'm going down to the record shop.

And the boss said
"LP, single, picture cover or plain?
I've got all the hits and all the big names
Give the biggest discounts in my store
If you buy three records, I'll give you four"

C30 C60 C90 go
Off the radio I get constant flow
Hit it, pause it, record and play
Turn it, rewind and rub it away.

C30 C60 C90, go
C30 C60 C90, go
C30 C60 C90, go
C-3-0, C-6-0
C30 C60 C90, go
C90, go
3-0 6-0 9-0, go

It used to break my heart when I went in your shop
And you said my records were out of stock
So I don't buy records in your shop
Now I tape them all, cause I'm Top of the Pops.

Now I got a new way to move
It's shiny and black and don't need a groove.
Well, I don't need no album rack
I carry my collection over my back.

C30 C60 C90, go
Off the radio I get constant flow
Hit it, pause it, record and play
Turn it, rewind and rub it away

Policeman stopped me in my tracks
Said "Hey you, you can't tape that!
You're under arrest cause it's illegal"
So I shoved him off and he blew his whistle
I'm a pirate and I keep my loot,
So I blew him out with my bazooka

C30 C60 C90, go
Off the radio I get a constant flow
Hit it, pause it, record and play
Turn it, rewind and rub it away

You're rich enough to have a record collection
I'll bring my bazooka round for inspection

Sometimes it better get a hit twice as fast
So I press my playback to make it last
I breeze with the sleaze on my cassette
I've got the affirmative, I know you now!

C30 C60 C90 go
Off the radio I get a constant flow
Hit it, pause it, record and play
Turn it, rewind and rub it away

C30 C60 C90, go
C30 C60 C90, go
C30 C60 C90, go
C-3-0, C-6-0
C30 C60 C90, go
C90, go
3-0 6-0 9-0, go!
