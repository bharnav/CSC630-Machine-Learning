Nobody ever held a gun to my head
When you and I jumped into bed
I was not forced to kneel and pray
To worship at the temple between your legs
Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones
Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones

I'm so far from the shinin' light

I left you baby twenty times before
Now I'm back scratchin' at your back door
Look watcha done to the man don'tcha realize
Ooh child got my nose open wide

Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones
Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones

I'm so far from the shinin' light
I wandered far... what shall I do
I'm so far from my God...
...So close to you...

Lord have mercy on my soul
Your tongue in my mouth makes my blood run cold
Lord have mercy on me please
I'm infected with this ol' heart disease

Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones
Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones

I'm so far from the shinin' light
I wandered far... what shall I do
I'm so far from my God...
...So close to you

Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones
Look at me now... I gotta Kingsize Jones
