I been down that country road
I been down that highway too
I been lost in the woods
I ain't got no blues man shoes
I been down I been up
I slept in abandoned trucks
I been lost, lost in love
But I never, never did give up

I have dreamed of making love
I have dreamed of money too
I have seen a gambling man with his gold
And golden tooth
I been that
I been this
I have slept in a soggy ditch
I been lost, lost in love
But I never, never did give up

My cherie, my bon cherie
My Alabama Queen
You have stolen my poor heart
And my dreams

I have danced and I have fought
I've been told brother you've been caught
I have some broken vows
And I have broke some vows myself
I been crazy from the strain
But I got back up on my feet again
I have drank the oceans love
But I never, never did give up
