Well I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
Well I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more

Lord I went to the merchant, asked him for some meal
Lord, you go away from here now boy, you got boll weevils in your brain
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more

No sugar for my coffee, no flour for my bread
Red Cross store wen't help me fix my ailing head
I was on the floor a bleendin' I almost cought my death
No Red Cross store gonna save my life when I'm down to my last breath
Well I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more

Don't talk to me 'bout no war, if you can't tell me what I'm fighting for
I would go all the way to hell, before I give my Soul to that Red Cross store
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more

I told you once, I told you twice, a thousand times before
If I could get a job, I wouldn't go to that store no more
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
Lord I ain't goin' back to that Red Cross store no more
