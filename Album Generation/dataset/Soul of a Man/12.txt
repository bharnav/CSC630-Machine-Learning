If you've laughed, if you've cried
Then you've lived the Life â€¦ you have died
I don't mind if the Sun don't shine
And the Winds don't howl

So the blues carried me away
Into the dreams of naked slumber
I don't mind if the World decdes
To fall asunder

If I see you again, and you should favour me
Don't give in to the thought of pulling me behind
Cause I don't mind if the fire don't burn
In my soul

Should the space of the Universe
Be collected in one room
It would not fill all the emptiness
Left by you

I can see in your eyes that lonely paradise
Watching me, helplessly, as love goes rolling by
I don't mind
I can sing a song to ease my pain

Should I seek lover's revenge
Should I weep over the end
No, I don't mind if the fire don't burn
In your soul

I don't mind if the world decides
To let you go
