My Papa left and the war went on
Got no rest since he ain't come home
Bet the wind heard his mighty roar
I'm gonna kill you cause I can't go home

Damn devils are running
I can't shoot anymore

Devil run I can't shoot anymore
Go on home 'cause your asking for more
If the storm brings hell upon you
Blame yourself I won't let you through

Damn devils are running
I can't shoot anymore
Damn devils keep running
I won't let you through

Fires burn as you look away
You've been lying to use everyday
Still you follow the devil's run
You can't unite the world with a gun

It's no joke we're a mad universe
No one to trust to make it work
If the war don't make it alright
We burn in hell and we loose the fight

Damn devils are running
I can't shoot anymore
Damn devils are running
I won't let you through
