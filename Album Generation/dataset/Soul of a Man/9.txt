I was standing out back as the sun sank on down
I was thinking to myself about a long distant sound
How the fury and the flame burned so bright
Then blew out and left town on a slow moving train

On a slow moving train, from the West to the East
With the hopes of a nation of salvation and peace
All the people came out and they stood by the tracks
As the slow moving train took him back

It was the end of the road of a time and a place
The end of a dream and sweet youth'ssmiling face
The beginning of a lesson we're still learning today
Since he left on the slow moving train

On that slow moving train, as he rested in peace
'cross the mountains and plains from the sea to the sea
All the peoplecame out, the men took off their hats
As that slow moving train took him back

I wonder where would we be, if the bullets had failed
If the young men with dreams had somehow prevailed
Just a shot from the darkness and the whole world was changed
They sent him home on a slow moving train

On a slow moving train, from the West to the East
With the hopes of a nation of salvation and peace
All the people came out and they stood by the tracks
As the slow moving train took him back

He went home on that slow moving train
