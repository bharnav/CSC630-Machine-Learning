In Biloxi Mississippi on a street called Waterloo
At the roadhouse where the highway
Doe's a little number there with a 42
On a chasin' for some lovin'
On a humid afternoon
She's delightedhe's a quitter
He probably never will deliver
So she leaves him with his rock 'n' roll tunes

But he's still got the GTO
And he still loves to drive that road
He's still got a GTO mighty good
It's kind of gold
GTO

On the blue team in Virginia
Another weekend maneuver
On a weekend with per diem
A lot of work there for democracy
There's a governor from assembly
Reciting good poems from his memory
And all of his money in his money jar
He traded for one muscle car

But he's still got the GTO
And he still loves to drive that road
He's still got a GTO mighty good
It's kind of gold
GTO

In Malibu California
There's a surfer do you remember
He used to ride the big kahuna
With Robin and Finesse
They used to call him super hooter
He used to rock there to wooly bully
He's the one you can see him on the beach
They call him old man
Checking out the girls and their cars

But he's still got the GTO
And he still loves to drive that road
He's still got a GTO mighty good
It's kind of gold
GTO
Hahaha
My GTO
