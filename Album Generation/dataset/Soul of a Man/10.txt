You might slip and you might slide
You might tumble and fall down by the road side
But don't let nobody drag your spirit down
Remember you're walking up to heaven
Don't let nobody turn you around

Walk with the rich, walk with the poor
Learn from everybody, that's what life is for
And don't let nobody ever drag your spirit down
Well be walking up to heaven
Don't let nobody turn you around

Some say yes, some say no
Some wait and see which way the wind blows
Don't let nobody ever drag your spirit down
Well be walking up to heaven
Don't let nobody turn you around

Well the things I say might sound strange to you
And I might preach the gospel and I believe it's true
And I won't let nobody drag my spirit down
I'll be walking up to heaven
And I won't let nobody turn me around

You might slip and you might slide
You might tumble and fall down by the road side
But don't let nobody drag your spirit down
Remember you're walking up to heaven
Don't let nobody turn you around

I won't let nobody turn you around
