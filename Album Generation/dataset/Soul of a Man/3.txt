Como se llama mama
Baby whats your name
Mi vuelve loco baby
You driving me insane
A diga diga diga diga
Baby whats your name

Is it mary Lou is it Peggy Sue
Loretta, Marianna let mi get to you
What is your go by
Don't tell me no lie
I got it bad for you

Every Romeo in the barrio
Every Conio, Hermano and Lothano
They're all the same
Trying to run their game
I'm the one who's rap is true

Baby give me your 411
I ain't go nothin' but I'm nothin' but fun

Como se llama mama
Baby whats your name
Mi vuelve loco baby
You driving me insane
A diga diga diga diga
Baby whats your name
