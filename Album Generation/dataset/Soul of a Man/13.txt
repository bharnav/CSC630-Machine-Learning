Don't you cry for me mama, cause I can't stay
I'm a circuit rider and I'm on my way
I got to roll, down the highway
I got to roll roll roll down the lonesome highway
Well a bird got a nest and a fox got a hole
Well the cc rider just got the roll
With a beat up bible and a bottle of wine
I'm travelling light and testifying
I got to roll down the highway
I got to roll roll roll down the lonesome highway
I got a slow ass mule, and cold blue steel
The sword of the spirit and, and a soul like the wheel
I got to roll, I got to roll
I got to roll roll roll, yeah I got to roll
Don't you worry bout me mama, I'll be back in town
Girls the cc rider got to spread the world around
I got to roll down the highway
I got to roll roll roll down the lonsome highway
With a slow ass mule, and cold blue steel
I got the sword of the spirit and, and a soul like the wheel
I got to roll roll roll, I got to roll roll roll
I got to roll down the lonsome highway
