[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, I'm really a mess right now
I'm trying my best to get it together somehow
I can't see this way, light up in this pain that you left me
I'm unraveling, looking for things that'll never be

[PreChorus]
Stars fade away they just crash into space
Disappear from the light like you and I

[Chorus]
Tell me where love goes when it's gone
Tell me where hearts go when they go wrong
Suddenly someone is no one I've come
Undone, undone, undone
Undone, undone, undone

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, I let me fall for you
I can erase you and forget you but I can't undo you
You're the hand I can't hold, the words I'm not told when I'm lonely
And I don't want you back, I just want to have what you took from me

[PreChorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'll come around again
I know it's not the end
But right now I've got nowhere to begin
To begin

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Nothing but emptiness inside
Love leaves a black hole where it dies
How can I ever love again, I'm done
Undone, undone, undone
Undone, undone, undone
Undone, undone
