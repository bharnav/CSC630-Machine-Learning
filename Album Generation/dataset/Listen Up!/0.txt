[Verse 1: Haley Reinhart]
Hot hot heat between you and me
I'm burning up inside
You shock me with your ways
Ain't polite for me to say
Like a firecracker blowin' up the sky

[Chorus: Haley Reinhart]
You don't know (you don't know)
You don't see (you don't see)
All this static electricity
And every time you touch me right it's like
Oh-oh-oh-oh my
Oh my
Oh my

[Verse 2: Haley Reinhart]
Sticky skin in the summer night
All this tension is mad
You rock me with your touch
And I'm liking it so much
Cause you're the best thing I ever had

[Chorus: Haley Reinhart]

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Well, these are the facts
She likes the phrases I make up from scratch

She likes my raps
She like my racks how they hold up my slacks
She saw me when I snuck in the back- relax
Slapped a couple daps, took a couple photos
Took a snaps like that, soon she turned as her back
I was gone in a flash, in the blink of an eye
Got a speeding ticket for living my life too fast
I said, sorry sorry pretty lady, its a race against the clock
And I don't like contracts
So let's make it a night to remember
Before last call, 'nother round, two glasses
Shaken not stirred, this is my word
All I need is one night and you 'gon call me
Fantastic! ha

[Chorus: Haley Reinhart]
