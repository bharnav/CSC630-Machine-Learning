[Chorus x2:]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Wonderland

[Verse 1:]
We've been through everything
For the last year and a half
Going everywhere
Seeing the world
Being my man
Being his girl

[Hook:]
Come on, sister (come on, come on)
Stand up for love (come on, come on)
Everybody (come on, come on)
Ease up the love (come on, come on)

Come on, sister (come on, come on)
No more crying
It's around the corner
Ain't no denying

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
You will be lying there in the sun
Waiting for shade
It's cool when your coat is
By someone who really cares
And to be his girl

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Fairy tales
(As if none of that's real)
Do come true
(Gonna make you feel)
If you want them to

Whoa, oh
As if none of that's real
Gonna make you feel
Whoa, oh
Wonderland

[repeat x4:]
(Come on, come on)

Come on, sister (come on, come on)
No more crying
It's around the corner
Ain't no denying

Whoa, oh
As if none of that's real
Gonna make you feel
Whoa, oh
Wonderland

Fairy tales
As if none of that's real
Do come true
Gonna make you feel
As if none of that's real
Gonna make you feel

Whoa, oh
As if none of that's real
Gonna make you feel
Whoa, oh
Wonderland
