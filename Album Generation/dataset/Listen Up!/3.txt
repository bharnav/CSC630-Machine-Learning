[Verse 1]
Left all alone
I'm not ashamed to say I had to cry
Been lookin’ back
I lost my head but I don’t know why
Turns out that every night ohhh I cried
Those wasted tears yeah

[PreChorus]
I can't erase, can't get back into the yesterday
If I knew then, what I know now, I would've walked away
It's so hard to breathe when love's buried alive, alive, alive

[Chorus]
Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I’ve been crying wasted, wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
‘Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying wasted, wasted tears

[Verse 2]
I swear the earth the universe was falling from the sky
You built me up to let me down like a broken lullaby
I kinda want you to feel what it's like to break, break, break

[Chorus]
Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I’ve been crying wasted, wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
‘Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying wasted, wasted tears

[Bridge]
Had me crying
You were lyin'
Hmmm, I was dyin’
Well that’s not love, that’s not love
Had me cryin’, cryin’
You were lyin’, lyin’
Oh, I was dying, dying
Well that’s not love, that’s not love

[Chorus]
Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I’ve been crying wasted, wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
‘Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying wasted, wasted tears

[Outro]
Turns out that every night, ohhhh
I cried those wasted tears
