I can't be held in chains
I ain't your slave
I got this wild heart
And it can't be tamed
If you think that I'm sweet
Sugar in your teeth
You better watch your mouth boy
'Cause I don't miss a beat

And you don't know a thing about me
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me
I hit the ground running running running
I hit the ground running running running
You can't hold a rebel down
'Cause I'll be breaking out
This spirit's gotta be free
I hit the ground running running running
So don't go following me

I know you're falling so deep
Just like a bomb
'Cause you can't hide your love
No, no, with camouflage

But you don't know a thing about me
Baby you don't know a thing about me, yeah
I hit the ground running running running
I hit the ground running running running
You can't hold a rebel down
'Cause I'll be breaking out
This spirit's gotta be free
I hit the ground running running running
So don't go following me

Things aren't always what they seem, to be
I know who you're thinking
But she isn't me
It's crazy obsession
Have you lost you mind
Baby don't hold your breath
Mmm, ooh

I hit the ground running running running
I hit the ground running running running
You can't hold a rebel down
'Cause I'll be breaking out
This spirit's gotta be free

Don't try and stop me now
Ain't coming back around
This spirit's gotta be free
I hit the ground running running running
I hit the ground running running running
I hit the ground running running running
So don't go following me
