[Verse 1]
You told me everything I wish I never knew
Now I can't get past the truth
Now I just wish I could go back to loving you
Can't get back to loving you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a right side, and a wrong side
Whenever any love goes wrong
But you can't lie, so I can't hide
Maybe happiness is blind

[Chorus]
I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm... not... calling... you a liar)
They say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
I'm... not... calling... you a liar
(I'm... not... calling... you a liar)

[Verse 2]
You gave me chills, not scars, left me with
Nothing to hate
Just a perfect bitter taste
Wish I was still in the dark but now I'm bur
Dened by the weight
Had to watch you walk away

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't want apologies
I don't need your sympathy
But this honesty is killing me
I learned my lessons well
Ooooo
So let me keep lying to myself
Let me get lying to myself

[Long Chorus/Outro]
I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm... not... calling... you a liar)
They say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
I'm... not... calling... you a liar
I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm... not... calling... you a liar)
They say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
I'm... not... calling... you a liar
