She left him a note
On the dining room table
She finally had the last word the day that she went away

She left him a note
Yeah, she hated confrontation
It was impossible to say to him everything she had to say

I'm losing my mind, nothing seems right
I do not know who I am anymore
Losing the fight, I hate my life
I wish that it was easier to be in love

She cries herself to sleep
On the floor of her apartment
She found herself a new place about a half a mile away

She drinks herself to sleep
She gets lost inside the darkness
She is making up for lost time every night and every day

Losing my mind, nothing seems right
I don't know who I am anymore
I'm losing the fight because I hate my life
I wish that it was easier to be in love

You make me want to scream sometimes

No more drama, no more pain
Don't we argue about the same things over and over again
No more drama, I can't take the constant strain
I don't understand why being with you is so goddamned hard
So hard

He found the note
Yeah, when he came home to the empty house
He knew that this was coming the first time he had seen her face

He walked right out the front door
In no particular direction
He had to find the reasons why these things always end this way

Losing my mind, nothing seems right
I don't know who I am anymore
I am losing the fight because I hate my life
Yeah, I wish there was an easier way to be in love

I'm out of my mind, nothing seems right
I don't know who you are anymore
Yeah, I'm losing this fight because I hate my life
And even though I'm leaving, I'm still in love with you

I'm still in love with you
Oh, I'm still in love with you
Oh, I'm still in love with you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
