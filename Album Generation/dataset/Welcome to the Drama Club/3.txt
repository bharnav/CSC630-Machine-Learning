"Yeah, live and let live motherfuckers. I'm going to do me, you do you
You're all a bunch of haters."

I don't like the way that you talk to me
When you tell me how it's going be
And I don't like the way that you smile at me
When you tell me what is wrong with me

Sometimes I wish you would go away
Go away and never ever come back
I don't like the mean and vindictive things you do
It makes me want to hate on you

Yeah, it's got me sad, I'm kind of stressed
You got me feeling anxious, I'm always depressed
And I don't want to play this game of tug of war
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore

I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
No, I don't want to be with a hater
You are such a hater

I don't like the way that you never took the blame
For absolutely anything
And I don't like the way that you put me through hell
For all those things you do yourself

Sometimes I wish I could disappear
Fade away into a happy, new life
I don't like the way that you're always telling lies
You talk about me all the time

I hear you talk, you a such a bore
I see the way you look, I think you look like a whore
I know you know I know the way your working for
I don't won't to be with hater like you anymore

No
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
No
I don't want to be with a hater like you

Hater, hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you
Hater, hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
(Anymore) Anymore, anymore

I don't want to play this game
No I don't want to play these games

Your a hypocrite, yeah you lie to me
You use words you don't understand
You embarrass me, yeah your beautiful in a ugly way
Hey the sex was never that good anyway

Its got me down, I'm super stressed
I'm taking medication, I'm always depressed
I don't want to fight you in this tug of war
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore

Woah
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
Woah
I don't want to be with a hater like you

Hater, hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you
Hater, hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you

Hater, hater
Hater
