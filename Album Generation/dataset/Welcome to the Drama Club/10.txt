I wish I could push a button and make the pain all go away
I wish I had the magic words but I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the wasted years and throw 'em all away

It might sound easy for me to say
You are going to find a way to fix what's broken
Fix what's broken

You say you like people with fire, but you don't like it when you get burned
Broke about a thousand hearts, now you don't like it when it's your turn
You wonder when you're going to figure out all the lessons that you need to learn

It might sound simple for me to say
You will learn someday that all you need is love
All those big dreams that were so important
They don't mean anything now, all you need is love
All those hard times when people hurt you
They don't mean anything now, all you need is love

Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need to fix what's broken

You turn sunshine into chaos everywhere you go
Now your girl's got a brand new life with a guy you used to know
She got tired of the drama you make when life gets too slow

It might sound simple for me to say
You will heal someday, now all you need is love
All those big dreams that were so important
They don't mean anything now, all you need is love

All those hard times when people turned on you
They don't mean anything now, all you need is love
All those happy endings that never happened
They don't mean anything now, all you need is love

Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need
Now, enough is enough, oh
Yeah, enough is enough, oh yeah yeah

Yeah, the time is going to come when you stop feeling sorry for yourself
Yeah, you were broken when you were young and you never got over it
Yeah, you were damaged when you were young, and now you take it out on everyone

The time is going to come when you say that enough is enough
Yeah, the time is going to come when you stop beating yourself up
Stop beating yourself up
Stop beating yourself up

The time is going to come when you see that all you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Oh, the time is going to come
When you see all you need is love
All you need is love
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
