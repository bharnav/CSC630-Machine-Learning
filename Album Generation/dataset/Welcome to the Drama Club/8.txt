"You're gonna burn in hell for this one..."

He was rolling in the rumor
That he was the loser king for a day, yeah
Aw, she was kinda cross-eyed
She was damaged in a beautiful way, yeah

He was addicted to her body
When she opened up her legs and her heart
She was good at all the simple things

She was addicted to the subtle
Way he'd rip her apart
It was a shameless use of charm

She was delighted with the promise
Of a life of being bored and annoyed, yeah yeah
He was happy with the pictures
That he painted with distortion and noise, yeah yeah

He was a sex-addicted user
With a certain kind of flair
He did really not care
That she was dumb and unaware

She was strong when they were naked
And alone in the dark
It was a shameless use of charm

Everybody says they're looking for the fairy tale
No, they are just looking for a way to fall
Everybody says they're looking for the true love lost
Yeah, true love lost

He was big, bigger than the life she knew
Back when she was good with being slow and confused
She was clean, the best thing he had ever seen
She looked just like those girls he saw in Playboy magazine

They were lost, they were looking for the easy dream
Living high on borrowed time and running low on self-esteem
They were dead, they were helpless to the rush
It felt just like a white drug

Everybody says they're looking for the fairy tale
No, they are just looking for a way to fall
Everybody says they're looking for the happy ending
No, they are just looking for a way to fall soft

Just like anyone, they're just like everyone
They were looking for the easy way to have it all
Everybody says that they are looking for their true love lost

True love lost
True love lost
True love lost
