You were shining in a white light
Like a fairy-tale movie star
Never really thought I would find Snow White
Drinking in a downtown bar

You were underneath the white light
Like a vision in a deep, dark place
Never really thought I would fall for a country girl
With an angel's face

Everything fades away
The world changes every day
When I think about you
It makes me want to say

Glorious
Yeah, glorious
You are glorious

We were walking in the white sun
We were growing up and throwing down loud
There was silver in our eyes and we didn't know why
The power of the north so proud

We were lost inside a long dark summer
We were running down a nowhere road
We were looking for a light in the middle of the night
A place that felt like home

I know everything fades away
The world changes everyday
When I think about you and what we had
It makes me want to say

Glorious
You are to me (Glorious)
Yes, you are to me (Glorious)

I know this glorious life
Has never been what it seems
I was asleep when I was living the dream
Living the dream
I know I was living the dream
Oh, woah, woah

I think about the time in the city
We were running away trying to feel free
I could never believe
That you wanted to be with me

We would wait in the cold for the last bus home
Sleeping with your arms around me
The truth is never what it seemed to be
I was living the life
When I should have been living the dream

(Glorious)
Should've been living the dream (Glorious)
I know I should've been living the dream (Glorious)

Yeah, I know I never understood how much you would mean to me
Now I know that I was living the dream (Glorious)
I know I was living the dream (Glorious)
I know, I know I was living the dream (Glorious)

I know this glorious life has never been what it seems to be
I was walking through life asleep when I was living the dream
