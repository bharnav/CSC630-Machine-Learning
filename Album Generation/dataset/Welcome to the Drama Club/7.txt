I stand out breaking in the Portland rain
I see the end there in your eyes
As I watch you drive away

I walk back blind into my cold dream house
And I think about the damage
As I put the big light out

I sit down smoking on my basement floor
I hear footsteps up above me
And they're right outside my front door

The only place that I want to be
Is watching you move up on top of me
The only sound that I want to hear
Is the rain against my window as you whisper in my ear

Baby, you know I love it when you call me baby

I go upstairs and find my twelve year old
She's got tears running down her face
Sitting sad at my piano

She sings soft words from that old Beatles song
And I think about my yesterday
And all the things I did wrong

The only place that I want to be
Is watching you sweet dream in bed right next to me
The only sound that I want to hear
Is the rain against my window as I pull you near

Don't give up on me
Baby, can't you you see?
We could make this be
The way it used to be, woah

Don't give up on me
I wish I could make you see
That I am changing everyday
Trying to build a better me

We could make this be
The way it's supposed to be
Don't give up on me
Ooh, don't give up on me

Na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na
Na, na, na

I stand out in the rain
Where I watched you drive away
I never thought I would live to see this fucked-up day

I stand out in the rain
In the middle of the night
I wish that it could wash away the beast inside

The only thing I want to do
Is kiss you when I'm coming deep inside of you
The only sound that I want to hear
Is the rain against my window as I hold you

Don't give up on me
Oh baby, can't you see?
We could make this be
The way it used to be

Don't give up on me
I wish I could make you see
That I am changing everyday
Trying to build a better me

We could make this be
The way it's supposed to be
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me, no
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me, woah
