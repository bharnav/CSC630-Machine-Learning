Shine
Open up your life and shine your light
Oh, shine
Open up and show the freak inside

Words don't mean nothing
His words don't mean nothing
He has no shame
He will say anything just to get what he needs

He says he needs the right girl
To heal his hurt and change his world
He will say anything to make her think
He is the man she wants him to be

Shine
Open up your life and shine your light
Oh, shine
Open up and show the freak inside

The girl had a good plan
To find herself a good man
The kind of guy that you hear about
But you never seem to meet

She hides behind those bright eyes
Fake smiles and sex and white lies
Yeah, she is trying too hard
To be the way that she thinks she's supposed to be

Come on, shine
Shine, shine
Let me see you
Shine, shine
I want to see you
Shine, shine

Come on, let me see you
Open up and shine your light
Open up and show the world the freak inside

You are afraid to shine
To see what's deep inside
Go find your freak and let it drive
Yeah

You are afraid to shine
To see what's deep inside
Go find your freak and let it glide

You sing the same old song
Been in the dark too long
There's so much more than meets the eye
Yeah

Don't be afraid to shine
Go find out who you are inside
Just go and find your freak and let it fly

Let me see you
Shine, shine
Yeah, let me see you
Shine, shine
I want to see you
Shine, shine
Come on let me see you
Shine, shine

Oh, come on let me see you
Shine, shine
Let me see you
Shine, shine
Yeah, let me see you
Shine, shine
I want to see you
Shine, shine

Let me see you
Open up and shine your light
Open up and show the world the freak inside
