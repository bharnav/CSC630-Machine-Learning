Oh, yeah

I want you to stay the way you are
Skinny legs and all
I know the time is coming
When the boys will begin to call
I wish that I could hurt for you
When you're learning how to fall

You are the reason that I am alive today
You are the reason that I've changed my life
In a wonderful way

I can see the passion that is growing inside of you
Oh, I can see the sadness
That throws a shadow down on everything you do
I wish I was the man you thought I was
Back when life was new for you

You don't know what it's like
To feel a love like this
You don't know what it's like
To feel this kind of helplessness

You don't know what it's like to be weak
I hope you never know
I don't want you to be like me
I want you to be clean, clean

Gonna find a reason to hate me someday
Gonna find a reason to push me away
You are gonna find reasons to blame me for your pain
Oh yeah, oh woah woah, yeah

I hope you never lose the magic that is big inside of you
I hope you never do the ridiculous things that I used to do
I hope you never know my disease
No, never being good enough

I don't want you to be like me
Yeah
Yeah, I want you to be clean
I want you to be clean
