Paint the stars in the sky
On the ceiling above our bed
Roll through the night with your blood
Beating hard like a drum inside my head

Paint the stars in the sky
That were shining on the night we met
If we can do this then we can do anything

Throw the clothes in a pile
In the corner on the dirty wood floor
Open up the big windows
Throw a chain on the double locked doors

Open up to the flame so strong
It feels so good even though we know it's wrong
When we make love I feel complete
Yeah, like I can do anything

We can lose ourselves to the far away sound
Of the noise of the boulevard
Yeah, we can lose ourselves tonight
Underneath the western stars

The wind sounds just like the ocean
Blowing big through the trees in my backyard
I sit alone in a dark room smoking
And wondering where you are

You went away when the truth came down
The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around
You said that I made you feel weak
I made you feel like you couldn't do anything

I try to sing myself to sleep
To the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars
I lay awake with my eyes wide open
Underneath the western stars, woah

Hard promises broken
That should have never been made, woah
You were cold in your anger
I was warm in the shame, woah

I don't have any illusions of the good old days
If we make it through this then I know that
We can do anything
We can do anything

I'm going to walk all the steps
And find a place where I can lie
Lay on my back in the grass
And stare at the stars in the warm night sky

I'm going to find me a new blonde girl
Hungry for the things that don't come easy in the real world
She will let me be myself
I know she will let me do anything

We can lose ourselves making love all night
On a blanket in the neighborhood park, oh
We can lose ourselves making love all night
Underneath the western stars
Yeah, we can lose ourselves tonight
Underneath the western stars

Hard promises broken
Should have never been made, woah woah
You were cold in your anger
I was warm in the shame

Woah, I don't have any illusions of the good old days
If I can make it through this then I know
That I can do anything
Yeah, I can do anything
