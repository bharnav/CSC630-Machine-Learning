White witch fever, the only way you know
Night time creeper, need somewhere to go
Schizoid, paranoia running through your mind
Everything is closing in, you're running out of time

Gotta push it to the limit
Gotta push it to the limit
Gotta push it to the limit
Gotta push it to the limit

Psycho liar, do anything for cash
You'd cut your grandma to make this feeling last
No sense of reason, the ecstasy you chase
Every second bringing you closer to your grave
