This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you

I'm writing from the bedroom
I'm ennui and in my cups
All the kids are kissing in the bathroom
Licking bags to get their ups
I've gotten 3 proposals since I left home
And none have left me impressed
It's getting much harder to say no
And even harder to say yes

This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you

You met a naf annihilator
Oh whose treasure was her trap
And when she wrapped her legs around your head
You knew you wouldn't get it back
It's been 16 days since I've left home
16 days too long
And what she does feels oh so right
So you know it must be wrong

This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
Whoa

Now I'm writing cause I miss you
And I'm writing cause I'm stuck
All these strangers all around me
They don't seem to give a fuck
And I'm tired of sleeping in strange beds
And I've done more than you allow
I've had enough of jetsetting
And I want to come back now

I want to come back now
I want to come back now
I want to come back now
I want to come back now

This is a jetsetter music letter
This is a jetsetter music letter
This is a jetsetter music letter
This is a jetsetter music letter (from me to you)
This is a jetsetter music letter (from me to you)
This is a jetsetter music letter (from me to you)
This is a jetsetter music letter (from me to you)
This is a jetsetter music letter (from me to you)
This is a jetsetter music letter
Wow
