Hey you, wake up
Don't let those kiddies get you down
It's true, I know
You been kicked and pushed around
Thinking bout not waiting for tomorrow?
Thinking of a way to end your sorrow?
What happens now?
You just gotta hold your ground

Hey you, get up
Don't let the man keep you down
Breakthrough, breakout
Do anything but don't break down
Thinking bout not waiting for tomorrow?
Thinking there's a better place you can go?
What happens now?
Now that you've become unwound
