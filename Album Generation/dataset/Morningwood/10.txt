[Verse 1]
Remember our first love?
We will always have Zack Rice
We would both lift up our shirts
Kissed him once you kissed him twice
Tell me stories of myself
That I don't remember
I was too drunk or too young
Of that I can be sure

[Chorus 1]
And when you come to see me
You will ride the lights alone
And you'll turn with every change
(Doo doo doo)

[Verse 2]
And I can't wake you up
Due to your perscriptions
Tell them all you were on track
To distract your addictions

[Chorus 2]
And when you come to see me
You will ride the lights alone
And you'll turn with every change
(Doo doo doo)
When you burn all your bridges
You will have to fight alone
It's a good thing you can swim

[Chorus 2]
And when you come to see me
You will ride the lights alone
And you'll turn with every change
When you burn all your bridges
You will have to fight alone
It's a good thing you can swim

[Outro]
And when you come to see me
You will ride the lights alone
And you'll turn with every change
