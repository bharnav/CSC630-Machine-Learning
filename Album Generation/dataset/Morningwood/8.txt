Hey where you from?
I'm from New York
I really like your style
Huh, what? You like the way I walk?

N-N-N-New York Girls
Come on you know you're hot
A-A-A-Attitude
And that's what makes you rock

In your tight black jeans
And my high heeled shoes
God, I think you're hot
I got to get with you

N-N-N-New York Girls
They really mess me up
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chelsea Pearls
Sound like a buttercup

N-N-N-New York Girls
Come on you know you're hot
A-A-A-Attitude
And that's what makes you rock

Come on girls
Tell us where you're really from
Florida, England, Oregon, I'm Polish
I a come from Chile, I come from Sicily, I love it
Colombia, China, Miami, I'm from Sweden
Phoenix, Jamaica, Korea
I'm from Japan, arigato, Utah; I'm from New York City!
Even if your not, we love you all

N-N-N-New York Girls
N-N-N-New York Girls
Come on you know you're hot
A-A-A-Attitude
A-A-A-Attitude
N-N-N-New York Girls
They really mess me up
Let's dance!
