Close the door behind us
Don't open it to strangers
You know where to find us
Sure I got your numbers
(Don't you) You gotta start sometime (wanna sit next to me?)
Show me as I show you mine
(I'll show) Can you keep a secret? (you a secret, or two, or three)

Baby, Baby, (your such a) Baby, Baby
And one thing I chose to admit
Is that your momma momma momma
Shouldn't let me baby-sit

Can I crawl in bed with you?
I'll let you stay up real late
And do what you wanna do
If I can be a playmate
(Don't) You can be my boy scout (you need someone to tuck you in?)
But you gotta turn the lights out

Baby, Baby, (your such a) Baby, Baby
And one thing I chose to admit
Is that your daddy daddy daddy
Shouldn't let me baby-sit

You gotta start sometime
It might as well be now
I wanted you to be mine

Never let me baby-sit (x4)

Baby, Baby, (your such a) Baby, Baby
And one thing I chose to admit
Is that your momma momma momma
Shouldn't let me baby-sit

(Never let me) Baby (sit), Baby, (your such a) Baby, Baby (never let me)
And one thing I chose to admit
(Never let me) Is that your daddy daddy daddy
Shouldn't let me baby-sit

(Never let me) Baby (sit), Baby, (your such a) Baby, Baby
And one thing I chose to admit
Is that your momma momma momma
Shouldn't let me baby-sit...
