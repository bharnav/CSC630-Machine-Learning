You want somebody to care
You want somebody to know
You wanna live the lie
The lie that's in your head

(It's so easy)
You want it easy
(When you're gone)
Easier said then done
(It's so easy)
You want it easy
It gets easy when you're gone

You want some money to spend
You want somebody to share
You want somebody to see
That life ain't treatin you fair

(It's so easy)
You want it easy
(When you're gone)
Easier said then done
(It's so easy)
You want it easy
It gets easy when you're gone

You
Want
It
All
Time is gonna get you if you like it or not
Waiting round the corner or around the block

I know you know you want it all
You want it all
I want it easy
You want it all

(It's so easy)
You want it easy
(When you're gone)
Easier said then done
(It's so easy)
You want it easy
It gets easy when you're gone

(It's so easy)
You want it easy
(When you're gone)
Easier said then done
(It's so easy)
You want it easy
It gets easy when you're gone
