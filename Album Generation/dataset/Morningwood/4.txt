[Verse 1]
When I see you baby
I wanna take off your clothes
Just rip off your clothes
Just take off your clothes

When I see you I want you to
Take off my clothes
Just rip off my clothes
Just take off my clothes
Well, make yourself at home and take off your clothes
We'll get naked, we'll see how it goes

[Chorus]
I know baby you're frustrated
(Uh-huh)
But I'd like it if we waited
(Mm-mm)
Get a little more acquainted
(Alright)
It's better when anticipated
(Oh, just take off your clothes)

[Verse 2]
I wanna touch your little
Your little hip bones
Your collar bones
And all your other bones
And your happy trail
It's my happy trail
Your treasure trail
Let's see what goes down

[Chorus]
Come on baby you're fixated
(Uh-huh)
I think I'd like it if we waited
(Uh-uh)
Get a little more acquainted
(Alright)
It's better when anticipated
(No, it's not, just take off your clothes)

Just take off your clothes

[Verse 3]
So come on, baby, don't be shy
And let's begin
And I'll take off your clothes
'Cause everyone knows
You like me, it shows
And you know how it goes
If you take off your clothes
We'll see how it grows
I just wanna know

[Chorus]
If you take off your clothes
(You take off your clothes)
And if you take off your clothes
(I'll take off my clothes)
And I take off my clothes
(I'll rip off your clothes)
Rip off my clothes
(I'll rip off my clothes)
Rip off your clothes
(I'll take off your clothes)
Take off your clothes
(I'll rip off my clothes)
Rip off your clothes
(I'll take off your clothes)
Come on, just take off my clothes

I know baby you're frustrated
(Uh-huh)
But I'd like it if we waited
(Just take off your clothes)
Get a little more acquainted
(That's right)
It's better when anticipated

Oh, just take off your clothes!

Please
