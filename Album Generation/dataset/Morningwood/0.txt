Hey little pretty with the tattooed skin
The past is repeatin' yeah it's gonna begin
I said hey little pretty with the tattooed skin
The past is repeatin' yeah it's gonna begin
All you little kids that love the rock n' roll
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul

Come on get over it
Come on get into it
Come on get over it
Come on get into it

Hey little baby with your studded belt
When you hear the music right it's gonna make you melt
I said all you little kids that love the rock n' roll
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul

Come on get over it
Come on get into it
Come on get over it
Come on get into it
Come on get over it
Come on get into it
It starts right now

Well let's go
1-2-3
Come on let's go
It's a rock n roll revolution
It's a rock n roll evolution
Come on let's go

Sweet little honey with your hair cut right
When you get the sonic beat you're gonna see the light
I said all you little kids that love the rock n' roll
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul
All you little kids that love the rock n' roll
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul
All you little kids that love the rock n' roll
You sure got the style but you ain't got the soul

Come on get over it
Come on get into it
Come on get over it
Come on get into it
Come on get over it
Come on get into it
It starts right now
