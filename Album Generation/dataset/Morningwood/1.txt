I been building blocks since I was a baby
I been putting up bricks since i was a kid
When I'm kissin' I wanna see over your shoulder
You said I never showed you but I know I did

And I want it
And I need it
And I love it
Cause it's mine all mine
(you can't shut your eyes)
And I want it
(keeps you satisfied)
And I need it
(by filling you with lies)
Cause it's mine and no one can take it from me

I'd like to think our lives were like a movie
Too bad I can't think outside of the box
Sometimes I see in x ray colors
And I can only hear it when it talks

And I want it
And I need it
And I love it
Cause it's mine all mine
(you can't shut your eyes)
And I want it
(keeps you satisfied)
And I need it
(by filling you with lies)
And I love it
Cause it's mine all mine and no one can take it from me

It's my night time and I want it
It's my night time and I need it
It's my night time and I love it
It's my night time and I want it
It's my night time and I need it
It's my night time and I love it
It's my night time and I want it
It's my night time and I need it
It's my night time and I want it
It's my night time and I love it
It's my night time and I need it
It's my night time and I love it
It's my night time and I want it
NO ONE CAN TAKE IT FROM ME
