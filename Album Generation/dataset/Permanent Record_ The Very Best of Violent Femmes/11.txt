Breakin' up, breakin' up
Now every once in a while, there's a crack in my smile
Dark voices are talking to me, dark voices tell me the way
It's supposed to be, they said "Breakin' up", they said "It's hard to do"
But what they say about breakin' up you know it's just not true
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Why if you know, why did you have to go and leave me on the floor?
About as sick as a dog, I'm feeding my face like a bleary-eyed hog
Why'd it have to stop when it's just begun?
Why'd it have to stop with so much good undone?
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Y'know I break up every time
I break up with you
Now every once in a while, there's a crack in my smile
Dark voices are talking to me, dark voices tell me the way
It's supposed to be, they said "Breakin' up", they said "It's hard to do"
But what they say about breakin' up you know it's just not true
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Y'know I break up every time
I break up with you
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, it's easy to do
Breakin' up, breakin' up
Breakin' up, breakin' up
Breakin' up
