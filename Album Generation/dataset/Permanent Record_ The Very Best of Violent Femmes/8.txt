I'm gnawing on the knowledge that I have been burnt
And I'm learning things that I should've already learnt
Everyone I ever knew was so kind and coy
I was with a girl, but it felt like I was with a boy

I can't even remember if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to
But I held her in my arms, I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you

I will not kill the one thing I love
In this world of wreckage, I look above
Help me, Lord, help me understand
What it means to be a boy and what it means to be a man

I can't even remember if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to
But I held her in my arms, I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you
