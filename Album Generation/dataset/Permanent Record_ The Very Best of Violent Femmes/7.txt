You can bump and grind
Have a good time
You can twist and shout
Let it all hang out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can tell a plane, in the falling rain
I got a Rolls Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can bump and grind
Feeling fine
You can twist and shout
Knock yourself out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you can't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you can't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can bump and grind
Have a good time
You can bump and grind
Have a good time

Bump and grind
Have a good time
