It seems that the problem is very deep
'Cause every time I try to sleep
I have nightmares
Thinking about
Getting together with you

No, no, I wouldn't say so
I would not call it a curse
But what worries me then
Is when I wake up if it might be worse

It seems that the problem is very deep
Cause every time I go to sleep
I have nightmares
Thinking about getting together with you
Thinking bout getting back together again with you

Nope nope I wouldn't say so
I would not call it a curse
But what worries me then
Is when I wake up It might be worse

Every time I take my sleeps
Then you come and you give me the creeps
In my nightmares
Thinking about getting together with you
Everytime I fall asleep
Then you fuck her I'd like to creep
In my nightmares
Thinking about getting together with you
Thinking bout getting back together again with you

Nightmares (in my)
