[Intro]
Can I-can I put in something like, American music take 1? 1-2-3-4
Do you like American music?
I like American music
Don't you like American music, baby?

[Verse 1]
I want you to hold me
I want your arms around me
I want you to hold me baby
Did you do too many drugs
I did too many drugs
Did you do too many drugs too baby

[Chorus 1]
You were born too late
I was born too soon
But every time I look at that ugly moon
It reminds me of you
It reminds me of you
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I need a date to the prom
Would you like to come along
But nobody would go to the prom with me, baby
They didn't like American music
They never heard American music
They didn't know the music was in my soul baby

[Chorus 2]
You were born too soon
I was born too late
But every time I look at that ugly lake
It reminds me of me
(Do you like American music?)
It reminds me of me
(Do you like American music?)

[Verse 3]
Do you like American music?
(We like American music)
I like American music, baby
Do you like American music
(We like all kinds of music)
But I like American music best, baby

[Chorus 2]

It reminds me of me
((I can hear American music))
(Do you like American music?)
((Sweet,sweet American music)) [x14]
