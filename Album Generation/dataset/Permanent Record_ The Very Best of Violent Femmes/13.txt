I danced before I had two feet
Sang before I had a tongue
I laughed before I had two eyes
Loved before my heart was young
I swam before I had two hands
And held the distance in my toes
Before I heard the stars I knew
The wild compulsion of the rose
I bore the fruits of many lies
Before I came into this day
I knew before my grave was made
The worms eat only death away
I danced before I had two feet
