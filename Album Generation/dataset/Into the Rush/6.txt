[Verse 1]
When something's pure
How can peope just say we're not meant to be?
And when something's true
How can people just keep me away from you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Suddenly, I'm all alone
Pushed away from nothing wrong
Don't you have the guts to say how you feel about me?

[Chorus]
Out of the blue
They said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
Been givin' no choice
We have no voice
Out of the blue

[Verse 2]
I can't even call on the telephone
Don't even know if you're at home
'Bout to control
Just how we feel between you and I
Not for one to steal

[Pre-Chorus]
Suddenly, I'm all alone
Pushed away from nothing wrong
Don't you have the guts to say how you feel about me?

[Chorus]
Out of the blue
You said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
Been givin' no choice
We have no voice

[Bridge]
Just wanna hear what you've gotta say
Are you feelin' the same?
'Cause I'm not okay
Thought when we met there was somethin' more
But the others said "no", they shut the door

[Chorus]
Out of the blue
You said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
Been givin' no choice
We have no voice
Out of the blue
We knew we should of been together
I don't wanna get over you
Love makes a choice
It has a voice
Out of the blue
