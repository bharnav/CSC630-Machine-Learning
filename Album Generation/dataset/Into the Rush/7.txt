[Verse 1]
Don't know where you are
Wish I just could be near you
I would sail oceans to get a glimpse of how you feel
You're all the things I'm looking for
Everything, and so much more

[Chorus]
What I think
You are just perfect
Could it be that I am worth it?
Is this thing an open door?
Walk right through to something more
You and me
My life would change in a second
In a second

[Verse 2]
Don't know how you feel
You seem to keep it to yourself
Would you climb mountains
To show me this is something real?
You're all the things I'm looking for
Everything and so much more

[Chorus]
What I think
You are just perfect
Could it be that I am worth it?
Is this thing an open door?
Walk right through to something more
You and me
My life would change in a second
In a second

[Bridge]
Could it be?
Could it be?
You and me
You and me
Do I see?
Do I see clearly?

[Chorus]
What I think
You are just perfect
Could it be that I am worth it?
Is this thing an open door?
Walk right through to something more
What I think
You are just perfect
Could it be that I am worth it?
Is this thing an open door?
Walk right through to something more
You and me
My life would change in a second
In a second
