[Verse 1]
Do you see me?
Do you care?
You talk about me
Like I'm not there
Don't get a word in
When you're around
I bet you don't know
What I'm about

[Chorus]
'Cause I will, I will speak for myself
What you see isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, I will speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared, you'd listen

[Verse 2]
You suffocate me
You drown me out
I'm tired of waiting
Without a doubt
I feel I'm fading
I flicker out
My heart is screaming
Without a sound (yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I will, I will speak for myself
What you see isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, I will speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared, you'd listen

[Bridge]
I'm not sorry for who I am
Take it or leave it
It's my time to take a stand
Throw it or keep it
Now that I don't need to understand
Won't say it again

[Breakdown]
(I will, I will, I will)
You know I will

[Chorus]
'Cause I will, I will speak for myself
What you see isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, you know I will (I will) speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
(So much you're missing)
If you cared, you'd listen

[Outro]
If you cared, you'd listen
I will, I will speak for myself
