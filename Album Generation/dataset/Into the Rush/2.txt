[Verse 1]
You were the one
That I couldn't find
Hidden away
In the depths of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I let you go?
You're too good to be true
I messed it up, and now I don't know what to do
We ran in circles and wasted time
From right to wrong
From right to wrong

[Chorus]
If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now it's all collapsed in my lap

[Verse 2]
I overthought
So I locked up my heart, yeah
There you stood
Your blue eyes hidden underneath your hood

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I let you go?
You're too good to be true
I messed it up, and now I don't know what to do
We ran in circles and wasted time
From right to wrong
From right to wrong

[Chorus]
If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now it's all collapsed in my lap

[Bridge]
My mind is blank just like a clean slate
Will I meet another guy with the same blue eyes?
And the same name with the converse shoes I gave?
Will he have the same laugh?
Wear my homemade hat?
Bet I'll make another mistake
And think that he's just another fake
If I...

[Breakdown]
Wish I could erase the past now
Wish I could bring you back

[Chorus]
If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now it's all collapsed in my lap

[Chorus]
If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now it's all collapsed in my lap
