[Verse 1]
I used to think maybe you love me
Now, baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day
When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox
Gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me
You're coming around

[Chorus]
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now, yeah

[Verse 2]
I used to think maybe you love me
I know that it's true
And I don't wanna spend all of my life
Just waiting for you
Just waiting for you
And I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
I say, "Baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay"
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine

[Bridge]
I feel the love
I feel the love
I feel the love, that's really real
I feel the love
I feel the love
I feel the love, that's really real
I'm on sunshine, baby, yeah
I'm on sunshine, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa, oh
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now
And don't it feel good, hey
All right now

[Outro]
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
