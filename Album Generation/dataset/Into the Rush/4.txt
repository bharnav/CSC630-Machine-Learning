[Verse 1]
We don't have to try
To think the same thoughts
We just have a way
Of knowing everything's gonna be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

[Chorus]
Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great, feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on
Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great, feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain were on
The feeling's so clear, and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

[Verse 2]
We don't wanna sleep
Just wanna stay up
There's so much to say
Not enough hours in the day

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

[Chorus]
Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great, feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on
Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great, feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain were on
The feeling's so clear, and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

[Bridge]
No time to be lazy
The journey is perfect
The place is so crazy
The race is so worth it
I will be with you
We'll do this together
Always together

[Chorus]
Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great, feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on (mountain we're on)
Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Never coming down
Never coming down
Never coming down (from this)

[Chorus]
Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain were on
(Never coming down from this mountain we're on)
The feeling's so clear, and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

[Outro]
The place so is crazy
The race is so worth it
Life is amazing with you on the ride
