[Verse 1]
Sitting in my room
Feeling sorry for myself
I can't feel worse
But what else?
I wonder what I could say
To stop the voices, taunting and laughing
The way they're acting I wish they'd just disappear
The joke is always on me
It's always on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't they understand
That we are all the same?
And we all feel lost at time
Why don't they understand
That someone else's pain
Is not for gain?

[Chorus]
Sticks and stones won't break my soul
Get out of the way, I'm invincible
Throw them down
'Cause the one you want's not around
Not around
It's not your place
Honestly

[Verse 2]
In the end
You'll be the victim
You're the one who has to live with yourself
And when you're reaching for help
There'll be no one
There's no one

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you understand
That we are all the same?
And we all feel lost at times
Why don't you understand
That someone else's pain
Is not for gain?

[Chorus]
Sticks and stones won't break my soul
Get out of the way; I'm invincible
Throw them down
'Cause the one you want's not around (not around)
Not around (not around)
It's not your place
Honestly

[Bridge]
I won't live in chains
I've got something to give
I won't play these games
Yeah, I'd rather live
You know I've come too far
To be like you are

[Pre-Outro]
Why don't you understand
That we are all the same?
Sticks and stones won't break my soul
Get out of the way, I'm invincible
Throw them down...
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la

[Outro]
Throw them down 'cause the one you want's not around (not around)
Not around (not around)
Not around anymore
It's not your place
Honestly
