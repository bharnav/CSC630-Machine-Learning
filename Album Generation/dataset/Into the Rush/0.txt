[Verse 1]
Into your head, into your mind
Out of your soul, race through your veins
You can't escape, you can't escape
Into your life, into your dreams
Out of the dark, sunlight again
You can't explain, you can't explain

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Rushing through your hair?
Rushing through your head?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you try

[Verse 2]
Pulling you in, spinning you 'round
Lifting your feet right off the ground
You can't believe it's happening now

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Rushing through your hair?
Rushing through your head?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you try

[Bridge]
It takes you to another place
Imagine everything you can
All the colors start to blend
Your system overloads again
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you try

[Refrain]
Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you try

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
