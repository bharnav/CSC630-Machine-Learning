[Verse 1]
Do you believe in magic?
In a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts
And it's magic
If the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old time movie

[Bridge 1]
I'll tell ya about the magic, it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout a rock n' roll

[Verse 2]
If you believe in magic
Don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen
It'll start with a smile, it won't wipe off your face
No matter how hard you try

[Bridge 2]
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

[Verse 3]
If you believe in magic
Come along with me
We'll dance until morning, 'til it's just you and me
And maybe
If the music is right
I'll meet ya tomorrow, so late at night

[Bridge 3]
We'll go a-dancin', baby, then you'll see
All the magic's in the music and the music's in me

[Verse 4]
Do you believe in magic? Yeah
Believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
I'm talkin' bout magic

[Outro]
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?)
Do you believe in magic?
