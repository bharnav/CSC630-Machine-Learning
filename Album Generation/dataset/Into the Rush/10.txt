[Verse 1]
You
You're always there for me
When I need you most
Day and night
You're by my side
Protecting me
When I feel like crashing down
You seem to be around
There you are
You're not that far
'Cause

[Chorus]
Whenever
Wherever baby
You'll protect me
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
And you'll never let me go
Protecting me

[Verse 2]
You listen to me when
I speak of of love and doom
You know when my heart's been bent
When my life's tumbling around
You take me off the ground
You tell me everything's okay

[Chorus]
Whenever
Wherever baby
You'll protect me
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
And you'll never let me go
Protecting me

[Bridge]
You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
When it's my turn
(My turn)
To help you out
(Help you out)
I gladly lift you up
Without a doubt

[Chorus]
Whenever
Whenever
Wherever baby
You'll protect me
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
And you'll never let me go
Let me go
Whenever
Wherever baby
I'll protect you
No matter what
Hold you tight
With all my might
And I'll never let you go
Let you go

[Outro]
You
You're always there for me
When I need you most
Day and night
You're by my side
Protecting me
Protecting me
