[Verse 1]
I need a little time
To see what you're made of
I know what's on your mind
You're headin' straight for love

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not rush, you're movin' way too fast
We can figure it out, we can make this last
We don't have to be so serious
You need to

[Chorus]
Slow down
I'm not goin' anywhere
Slow down
If you care, I need a little time for air
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
If you slow down

[Verse 2]
I want a little space
A little less attention
You see it on my face
Don't need an explanation

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not rush, you're movin' way too fast
We can figure it out, we can make this last
We don't have to be so serious
You need to

[Chorus]
Slow down (slow down)
I'm not goin' anywhere
Slow down
If you care, I need a little time for air
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around (I'll stick around)
If you slow down

[Bridge]
Keep callin', you won't leave me alone
(Keep callin' you won't leave me alone)
Proclaiming love like it's a joke (love's no joke)
Leavin' flowers at my door
Have enough don't need anymore
Believe in what we have right now
Have to slow down

[Breakdown]
I'm not goin' anywhere

[Chorus]
Slow down (slow down)
I'm not goin' anywhere (I'm not goin' anywhere)
Slow down
If you care, I need a little time for air
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
Slow down

[Chorus]
I'm not going anywhere
Slow down
If you care, I need a little time for air
(I need a little time for air)
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
(Give me air)
You have to slow down, yeah

[Outro]
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
Not goin' anywhere
Slow down
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
Not goin' anywhere
Slow down
If you just let me breathe
Maybe I'll stick around
Not goin' anywhere
If you slow down
