[Verse 1]
I didn't know what was in store
When I walked right through the door
Then I saw you over there
Our blue eyes locked in a stare

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't know quite what to say
Sometimes words get in the way

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said
"Let's go for a ride"
I didn't want the night to end
Would we be more than friends?
Yeah, little did I know before
We would be something more

[Verse 2]
In black and white, I read the screen
All your lines and in between
Then your message on the phone
I save to hear when I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I know just what to say
This doesn't happen everyday

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said
"Let's go for a ride"
I didn't want the night to end
Would we be more than friends?
Yeah, little did I know before
We would be something more

[Post-Chorus]
Something more, something more
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah)
We would be something more
Something more, something more
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah)

[Bridge]
I know we're both young
But we know how we feel (know how we feel)
We know what is false
And we know what is real (know what is real)

[Breakdown]
I remember the night you said
"Let's go for a ride"
I didn't want the night to end

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said
"Let's go for a ride"
I didn't want the night to end
Would we be more than friends?
Yeah, little did I know before (little did I know)
We would be something more

[Chorus]
I remember the night you said
"Let's go for a ride"
I didn't want the night to end (want the night to end)
Would we be more than friends?
Yeah, little did I know before
We would be something more

[Outro]
Something more, something more
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah, we would be something more)
Something more, something more
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah)
Something more, something more
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah)
