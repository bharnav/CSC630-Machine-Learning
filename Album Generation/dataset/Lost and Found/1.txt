Rip the womb
Feeling so sorry, selfish and sore...
Wish I wasn't born!
Piece by piece, I can carry it all
Strength to be driven!
So unforgiving, anything is possible...
Like leaving you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small!

Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through this: My law
Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through this, through you!

Salt the wound
Cut through a conscience I've failed to explore...
The calm before the storm!
Speak your peace and prepare for the fall
Words have been chosen
Tainting the gift - Lying truths, so incredible...
So fuck you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small!

Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through this: My law
Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through this, through you!

Spread the word: The killing is over!
Spread the word: The killing is over!

Severed more than I am, more than I ever was
Blindside, threatened my worth - Sequestered deliverance
You stole a part of me... You've taken a part of me

Try! You wanted to be, wanted to have a
Life! You wanted to fight, wanted the right
Lies! Spoken to me without a conscience: No right!
Why?! Breaking a mold - Breaking the trust
Child! Innocence lost - Ultimate cost
Loss! Life so undone: Deserted the seed...
You buried the bottle!

Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through this: My law
Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through this, through you!

Step by step, I will push you through!
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through!
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through!
Push it through! Push it through!
Push it through! Push it through!
Pushing! Pushing! Pushing! Pushing through!
