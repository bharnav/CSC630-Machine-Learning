[Chorus]
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, you better believe it, confidence
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, spit out all reason, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of holding all the weight
All the weight of the motherfucking world
All I want to do is just get right here right now
We struggle and fight just to get into the grave
That's overflowing
Clock's ticking on my fifteen minutes of fame
Come on and one two three

[Chorus]
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, you better believe it, confidence
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, spit out all reason, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm flushing the trust of everyone
Stabbing in the back and thinking they can break me
Set my sight, can't die 'til I'm done, mind endurance
Never wanted anymore than what I deserve
Better bring it, I'm taking it all
Fuck an inch, cause I'm bringing a mile
It's on now, one two three

[Chorus]
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, you better believe it, confidence
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, spit out all reason, yeah

[Bridge]
This fire, is growing, is burning, deep inside of me
Focused, driven, certain, the way it's got to be
Fire, growing, burning, deep inside of me
Focused, driven, certain, the way it's got to be
Crooked (no trust)
Liars (conman)
Drunk with (power)
Mentor
Taught me everything that I know
So wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
One two three

[Chorus]
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, you better believe it, confidence
Go, so fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, spit out all reason, yeah

[Chorus]
Go, I'm fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, you better believe it, confidence
Go, I'm fucking determined, yeah
Yeah go, spit out all reason, yeah
