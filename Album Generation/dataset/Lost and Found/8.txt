Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!

Silence, quiet... Need a little peace of mind
After all this... After all that you do
Shut it up, zip it... Need a little time to think
Without all this... Without all that you do!
Keep it, don't want it... Think I'll just go away
Away from here... From you
Time out, walk it off... Think I need to throw a flag
Just a little break from the games that you play!

Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
Away from this... It's never ending!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!

Beat up, whip it... Topped with a little scream
All that you are, for all that you do
Crush it all, kill it... Calling out my enemy
Don't want anything... I want nothing from you!
Dry it up, baby... Turn around and walk away
Cry your tears, pussy!
Lift it up, destroy it... Build it up to tear it down
All the little things that make me run away!

Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
Away from this... It's never ending!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!

Stop talking... Stop botherin' me
Just walk away... I've had enough today
I have a life too... I've had enough of you
Feel like screaming... So go the fuck away
Go away!... Go away!... Go away!... Go away!

Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
Away from this... It's never ending!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!
