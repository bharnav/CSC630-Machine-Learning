[Verse 1]
What have I done?
Where have I come from?
When I burnt the backs
With the sun through a glass
Did I seal the loss
That's become me?
Feeling undone
What have I become?
When I turned my back on you
I turned my back on myself
And became this machine
Thoughtlessness
Selfishness
Hopelessness
Arrogant

[Chorus 1]
I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

[Verse 2]
Shadows in the sun
Filter through us
Still wrestle the demons
That arrested me as a child
Confession rejected
We grow up
To give up
People step on the cracks
For wounds owed paid back
Through the words of surrender
Emptiness
Loneliness
Listlessness
Worthless

[Chorus 2]
I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

[Interlude]
Can you save me?
From myself
From these memories
Can you save me?
From myself
From these memories

[Bridge]
Surrender
To the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
Surrender to the secrets...inside
Lies within you

[Chorus 3]
I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?
Can't feel you on the inside
Set down the bag and left it
Lost memory has left me
One again
Open up the inside
Admission for the cleansing
Now that I've forgotten to remember

[Outro]
Surrender
To the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
