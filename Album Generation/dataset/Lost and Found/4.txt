[Verse 1]
Dreams of earthquakes
Dreams of hurricanes
Dreams of the pouring rain
Dreams of tidal waves...to wash us all away
Dreams of guns blazed
Dreams of fire rage
Dreams of swollen graves
Dreams of hollow pain
All gone

[Pre-Chorus]
No more fallen
No more enemy
No more casualty
No more dream

[Chorus]
Fall into sleep
Fall into me
I have a dream
But nobody cares
Nobody wants to listen
Fall into sleep
Fall into me
Hang onto a dream
That nobody wants
Nobody cares anymore

[Verse 2]
Dreams of mourning grief
Dreams of disbelief
Dreams of tragedy
Dreams of our disease...to take us all away
Dreams of fidelity
Dreams of inner peace
Dreams of loyalty
Dreams of unity
All gone
All gone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The angels are injured
Fall with broken burning wings
Are we dead inside
Are we blind
We can't keep moving forward
Backwards with closed eyes
We're losing sight
All lost inside

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All gone
All gone
All gone
All gone
