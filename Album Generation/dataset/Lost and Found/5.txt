Leaders are guilty of nothing
They're perfectly insane
But if they point the finger at themselves
Who would be left to blame?

Lead into grace or lead to corruption
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
Truth or lie has to be spoken
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
King or con has to be chosen
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
Way of life, complete or broken... broken!

Choices!... (No more) Choices!
(No more) Choices!... No more choices!

Leaders are guilty of nothing
They're perfectly insane
But if they point the finger at themselves
Who would be left to blame?

Follow truth or stutter through a lie
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
Will to push or give up and fall behind
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
Live with peace or nurture your tragic life
{Eni-Meni-Miny-Mo}
Bite the bullet, or swallow it whole!

Leaders are guilty of nothing
They're perfectly insane
But if they point the finger at themselves
Who would be left to blame?

Point the finger at yourself
There's no choice, anymore, anyway

We don't have a choice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a voice, anymore, anyway
There's no choice in freedom...
There's no voice in freedom...

We don't have a choice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a voice, anymore, anyway
There's no choice in freedom...
There's no voice in freedom

Leaders are guilty of nothing
They're perfectly insane
But if they point the finger at themselves
Who would be left to blame?

Their lost system of destruction
(They're guilty of nothing)
Flush all hope down the drain
(All hope down the drain)
But if they point the finger at themselves
(At themselves) Who is left to blame?!
(Who is left to blame?)...

We don't have a choice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a voice, anymore, anyway
There's no choice in freedom...
There's no voice in freedom...

We don't have a choice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a voice, anymore, anyway
There's no choice in freedom...
There's no voice in freedom...

We don't have a choice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a voice, anymore, anyway
We don't have a reason, anymore, anyway
We don't have control, anymore, anyway
We don't have opinion, anymore, anyway
There's no choice in freedom
There's no voice in freedom!

Freedom: Buy-in!... Freedom: Sell-out!
Freedom: Betray!... Freedom: Lay down!
Freedom: Corrupt!... Freedom: Opinion!
Freedom: Give up!... Freedom: Give in!
