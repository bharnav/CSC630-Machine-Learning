[Intro]
Repeating in my head: Betrayal
Repeating in my head: Insecurities
Repeating in my head: Diffidence
It's not your fault...
The well of thought and trust has run dry
Don't be afraid to let go...
Don't be afraid to start over when it's over
Let go... Let go... Let go... Let go...

[Verse 1]
Let go of feelings... Let go of compromise
Hollow trunk for shelter, so dark and cold inside
I always seem to find myself alone
Jaded shell of being... Porous as a stone!

[Pre-Chorus]
Calloused!... Rigid!... Empty!... Because of you!

[Verse 2]
Let go of trusting... Lost thought for family
Let go of living... No more concerns of demise
I never seem to find rhythm for life's harmony
Contorted, twisted, broken... Without a reason!

[Pre-Chorus]
Calloused!... Rigid!... Empty!... Because of you!

[Chorus]
It's all me, all you are
Without me: There's nothing else, there's no one!
Brainwash all you are
Without me: You're by yourself, there's no one

[Verse 3]
Hope is out of season
Lost sight... No hint of light
Get busy livin'... Or get busy dyin'!

[Pre-Chorus]
Calloused!... Rigid!... Empty!... Because of you!

[Chorus]
It's all me, all you are
Without me: There's nothing else, there's no one!
Brainwash all you are
Without me: You're by yourself, there's no one!

[Bridge]
Save me... This loss...
Closure, my answer... So grant it!
You owe me all that you are
Without me: You're nothing, you're no one!
Terrified!... Petrified!...
Nothing!... You're no one!...
Do you care, because I don't?!
Nothing!... You're no one!...
Nobody cares, so just go!
Nothing!... You're no one!...
By yourself... All alone!

[Chorus]
It's all me, all you are
Without me: There's nothing else, there's no one!
Brainwash all you are
Without me: You're by yourself, there's no one!

[Outro]
Save me... This loss...
Closure, my answer... So grant it!
You owe me all that you are
Without me: You're nothing!
