You've finally made it, a winner
For all of the world to see
A long time caught in the winter
Is worth all the pain
Nothing comes easy you know-one
Can take it away from you
'cause when you're a winner
You know you can do it all over again

Yeah, you can't do no better
Yeah, no better than that
Yeah, you can't do no better
Yeah, no better than that

There's something about you that tells us
You're gonna go all the way
We knew it was coming, a winner
Right from the start
No need to feel lonely
That's only a natural part of you
'cause when you're a winner
You know you can do it with all of your heart

Yeah, you can't do no better
Yeah, no better than that
Yeah, you can't do no better
Yeah, no better than that
