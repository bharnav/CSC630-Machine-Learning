Calling out to anyone who wants to know
We're ready for the road it's nearly time to go
Rocking 'round the world like a band on the run
I like it, I like it, yeah we're gonna have fun

Gonna shout it from the rooftops
Gonna play it from the heart
Now it's getting to the moment when the lights go down
And the magic's about to start

Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock 'n' roll all night long
Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock until the morning comes
Singing yeah, yeah, yeah (let's rock!)

We're gonna take it to the limit, take it to the top
Pull out all the stops and give it all we've got
Getting down, down, down, getting into the groove
Yeah, all you gotta do is shake your body and move

We're gonna shout it from the rooftops
We're gonna play it from the heart
So you better get ready when the lights go down
'Cause the party's about to start

Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock 'n' roll all night long
Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock until the morning comes
Singing yeah, yeah, yeah (let's rock!)
We're singing yeah, yeah, yeah

We're gonna shout it from the rooftops
We're gonna play it from the heart
So you better get ready when the lights go down
'Cause the party's about to start

Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock 'n' roll all night long
Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock until the morning comes
Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock 'n' roll all night long
Let's rock, let's rock it
Let's rock until the morning comes
We're singing yeah, yeah, yeah (let's rock!)
We're singing yeah, yeah, yeah
