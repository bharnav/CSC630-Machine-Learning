I'm standing in a crowd on a one way street
See me howling at the moon
I can't decide to park or ride
I never know what the hell to do

Can't be going slow, better make a move
I better show I'm in, no time to lose
Whoa, it looks like nothing I can do

And I remember what you said
Back in December, it messed my head
And every day, in every way
It's all about you

I've been in a strange place for someone new
It doesn't make me feel so good
I can't hide the hurt inside
I never knew it could be this way

I mustn't let it show, keep it to myself
No-one really cares I'm with someone else
Whoa, it looks like nothing I can do

And I remember what you said
Back in December, it messed my head
And every day, in every way
It's all about you

I mustn't let it show, keep it to myself
No-one really cares I'm with someone else
Whoa, it looks like nothing I can do

And I remember what you said
Back in December, it messed my head
And every day, in every way
Oh I remember when we met
And we surrender, we soon forget
And every day, in every way
It's all about you
