Welcome back in town
I hear that you are available
Did anybody tell you lately
That you're delectable?
Everywhere I turn
It seems like you are all I see
I swear that we have
Total compatibility
What do I have to do
To get you alone with me?
It's written in the stars
That I will always be with you
I don't care whatever it takes
Whatever I have to do

You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking

I am your prime number
The one that you need to, me
I am the magic drink
You never got to drink
It's written in the stars
That you will always be with me
One word in your head baby
Confidentially

You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking

Unlock your freezing door
'cause I can't stand the heat
We should be walking on
The bright side of the street
It's written in the stars
That I will always be with you
I don't care whatever it takes
Whatever I have to do

You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking

You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
You just can't see for looking
