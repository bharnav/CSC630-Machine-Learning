A lotta love, a lotta luck
And you and me it seems
Will always be together
It took a while, a little smile
In the good times, bad times
Any kind of weather

It doesn't matter what the funny people said
All that matters is the trouble up ahead
I didn't ever see it come into the way
The Sunday papers as I'm lying in my bed

Why why why
Why couldn't we see
My old ways
Keep troubling me

I gotta look, I wanna see
And if the heebie-jeebies
Have it all together
I caught a bug and you believe
You know the Bee Gees
Said it wasn't very clever

Another day, another night, another call
Another way, another fight, another brawl
It doesn't matter 'cause I know we've got it all
Another day, another shop, another mall

Why why why
Why couldn't we see
My old ways
Keep troubling me

It doesn't matter what the funny people said
All that matters is the trouble up ahead
I didn't ever see it come into the way
The Sunday papers as I'm lying in my bed

Why why why
Why couldn't we see
My old ways
Keep troubling me
