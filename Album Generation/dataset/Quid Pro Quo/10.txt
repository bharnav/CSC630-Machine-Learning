You're stalling on this you got nothing on me
Now we only got history
I'm playing my cards with an unmarked deck
Cashing in my chips with a reality cheque
Cashing in my chips with a reality cheque

Could have had everything but you're moving on
Now you will know a lot of nothing at all
Before I turn into a nervous wreck
I'm paying my bill with a reality cheque
I'm paying my bill with a reality cheque
With a fat reality cheque
With a fat reality cheque

There's nothing worse than a woman scorned
I'm telling you baby, you're ill informed
Lucky for you I'm not feeling mad
Believe I specialise in being bad

You're stalling on this you got nothing on me
Now we only got history
I'm playing my cards with an unmarked deck
Cashing in my chips with a reality cheque
Cashing in my chips with a reality cheque

I sold your clothes and I cancelled your cards
I changed the lock on the house and the car
And didn't I tell you, the diamonds are fake
I must admit, that's the icing on the cake

It wasn't me that got you into this mess
I wanted to try and make it all a success
But now you're hanging on around my neck
Shaking you off with a reality cheque
Shaking you off with a reality cheque
With a fat reality cheque
With a fat reality cheque
With a fat reality cheque

Paying my bill with a reality cheque
Paying my bill with a reality cheque
Paying my bill with a reality cheque
