Another night, another night
Another night with the the big fat zero
Another night, another night
Another night for the frozen hero

It's getting tight, it's getting tight
It's getting tight for the mis-fit no-no
You gotta light, give me a lucky light
You got a light for the midnight promo

Another night down in the hole
With all the weirdos
Another day, day in the life
Of a hero

'cause we're up there beggin'
Over down here rotting in a hole
Do they call this living
Do they call this rock and roll
They say it's well good money
But it just don't feed the soul
My soul

I get a fright, I get a fright
And every hour is a nightmare daydream
I gotta hide, I gotta hide
I gotta hide in the human smokescreen

It isn't right, it ain't right
It isn't right that it's all in my face
Another fight, another bloody fight
Another fight it's an urban rat-race

Down at the tube, stuck in the queue
Here at the station
What might he do
How could you change the situation

'cause we're up there beggin'
Over down here rotting in a hole
Do they call this living
Do they call this rock and roll
(call this rock and roll)
They say it's well good money
But it just don't feed the soul
My soul

Another night, it isn't right
Another night for the big fat zero
It's getting tight, awful tight
It's getting tight for the mis-fit no-no

You got a light, give me a light
You got a light for the midnight hobo
Another night, another freaking night
Another night for the frozen hero

Another night down in the hole
With all the weirdos
Another day, day in the life
Of a hero

'cause we're up there beggin'
Over down here rotting in a hole
Do they call this living
Do they call this rock and roll
(call this rock and roll)
They say it's well good money
But it just don't feed the soul
My soul
