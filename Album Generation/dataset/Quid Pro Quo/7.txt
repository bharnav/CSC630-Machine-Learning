Remember back, when you were young
Your mother said "that's quite enough"
So sleep tight don't let the bedbugs bite
Goodnight my child

You didn't know true or false
The star is heard when the darkness falls
And under your door, creatures would squeeze
And you always had to shout "Mama please..."

Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me

So in love, couldn't ask for more
A hungry romance hey, you know the score
It was destiny, we had to meet
And I could hardly walk for one whole week

Coming up, she looked outta town
Miles from nowhere, broken down
In the wind and rain lost without a clue
Searching for a phone so I could tell her too

Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me

When I get old, it's time to go
What body and ailments
Still playing shows
I'll be safe and sound for eternity
So Mr God, when you're ready for me

Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me

Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
Leave a little light on
A little light on
Leave a little light on for me
