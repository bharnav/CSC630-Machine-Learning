Work work fizzy busy bang bang
Twenty-five hours a day
Feels like working on a chain gang
And never seems to get away
Money to burn, money to burn
A black noon call for show
Where does it go, how should I know?

And it's two way traffic
On a one way street
All the voices in the air
Are stuck on repeat
It's a two-horse race
In a one-horse town
Like a house of cards
It's gonna fall down
War plays out
Getting ready to rumble
Survival of the fittest
The law of the jungle
Fold back, hold back
Get yourself a seat
The two way traffic on a one way street

Superman, where are you?
We need you to pave the way
Feels like an alien invasion
Trouble coming everyday
War of the worlds
You get the girl
They really don't
Sound that mad
Fighting the snow
Way to go

And it's two way traffic
On a one way street
All the voices in the air
Are stuck on repeat
It's a two-horse race
In a one-horse town
Like a house of cards
It's gonna fall down
War plays out
Getting ready to rumble
Survival of the fittest
The law of the jungle
Fold back, hold back
Get yourself a seat
The two way traffic on a one way street

And it's two way traffic
On a one way street
All the voices in the air
Are stuck on repeat
It's a two-horse race
In a one-horse town
Like a house of cards
It's gonna fall down
War plays out
Getting ready to rumble
Survival of the fittest
The law of the jungle
Fold back, hold back
Get yourself a seat
The two way traffic on a one way street

Two way traffic
On a one way street
All the voices in the air
Are stuck on repeat
It's a two-horse race
In a one-horse town
Like a house of cards
It's gonna fall down
War plays out
Getting ready to rumble
Survival of the fittest
The law of the jungle
Fold back, hold back
Get yourself a seat
The two way traffic on a one way street
Two way traffic on a one way street
Two way traffic on a one way street
Two way traffic on a one way street
Two way traffic on a one way street
