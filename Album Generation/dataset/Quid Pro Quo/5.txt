Home is bringing you back
That feeling is back
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that

While I'm in for the ride
While I'm hangin' on in
You ain't got nothing to hide
Yet you fly through the line
I have a dream what somebody said
And now I'm waiting, waiting

Oh we're bringing it back
The feeling is back
Like mama said the other day
But better than that
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
You know it could be something good
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that

Getting ready to go
No waiting around
I wanna tell you something I know
Simplify, demystify you know
It's all been there all along
But now I'm waiting, waiting

Oh we're bringing it back
The feeling is back
Like mama said the other day
But better than that
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
You know it could be something good
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that

So now that you know
And taken it in
And it'll feel like living I know
It's flying high, my oh my
And when this song has
Come to an end
I'll be waiting, waiting

We;ll be bringing it back
The feeling is back
Like mama said the other day
But better than that
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
You know it could be something good
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that

We're bringing it back
The feeling is back
Like mama said the other day
But better than that
We're bringing it back
We're bringing it back
You know it could be something good
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that
All over the world
It's gonna be a remedy
But better than that
