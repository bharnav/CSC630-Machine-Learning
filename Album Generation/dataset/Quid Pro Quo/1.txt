Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
Is all I wanna do
All I every knew
Is rock 'n' roll 'n' you

No fancy plans
No dinner and dance
12 bar blues give me half a chance
That'll do give me rock 'n' roll 'n' you

Yeah yeah your looking at the right one
Yeah yeah it's got to be done
You know you really turn the lights on
This is gonna run and run

Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
Is all I wanna do
All I every knew
Is rock 'n' roll 'n' you

No fancy plans
No dinner and dance
12 bar blues give me half a chance
That'll do give me rock 'n' roll 'n' you

Yeah yeah your giving up the young boys
Yeah yeah your wifi's on
Tune in to a natual born good guy
Every loving mother's son

Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
Is all I wanna do
All I every knew
Is rock 'n' roll 'n' you

No jaguar no la de da
A hole in my shoe and my old guitar

No fancy plans
No dinner and dance
12 bar blues give me half a chance

Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
Is all I wanna do
All I every knew
Is rock 'n' roll 'n' you

Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
Is all I wanna do
All I every knew
Is rock 'n' roll 'n' you

Rock n roll
Rock n roll
Rock n roll
Rock 'n' roll 'n' you

Rock n roll
Rock n roll
Rock n roll
Rock 'n' roll 'n' you
