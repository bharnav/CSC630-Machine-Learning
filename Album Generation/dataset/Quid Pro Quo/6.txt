It's been so long since I met you
Never leaving you alone
I bet you thought "it's going nowhere
I could do this on my own"

But it doesn't really matter
Who is right or who is wrong
Just as long as we're together
And we keep it movin' on

More, more, more
Sure I'm sure I'm movin' on (I'm movin' on)
Short for a show
I'm through the door, I'm movin' on
(movin' on, movin' on)

Don't make mountains out of molehills
Don't look down on someone else
Don't take anything for granted
Now to you and no-one else

Ain't no use in compromising
Let it out and let it go
If someone says they got your number
Well there's something they don't know

More, more, more
Sure I'm sure I'm movin' on (I'm movin' on)
Short for a show
I'm through the door, I'm movin' on
(movin' on, movin' on)

Now you know just how I'm feeling
How I need to get along
Guess there's something I should tell you
There is really nothing wrong

More, more, more
Sure I'm sure I'm movin' on (I'm movin' on)
Short for a show
I'm through the door, I'm movin' on
(movin' on, movin' on)
