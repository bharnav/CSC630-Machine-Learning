Any way you like it
Is the way it's gonna be
Any way you like it
That's a guarantee

I've had my way so many times
I always got to choose
For me to win this loving game
I always had to lose
Now it's black and white, night and day
And it's always up to you

Any way you like it
Is the way it's gonna be
Any way you like it
That's a guarantee

You set it up
You make the rules
You've got the final say
And what you say is cool

Any way you like it
Is the way it's gonna be
Any way you like it
That's a guarantee

I mend your will into my own
And see my way to go
I've no desire to compromise
But these days I just don't know
I've fallen for the star return
She that runs the show

Any way you like it
The way it's gonna be
Any way you like it
That's a guarantee

You make the place
You place the bets
You get to roll the dice
And it sure isn't it

Any way you like it
The way it's gonna be
Any way you like it
That's a guarantee

Any way you like it
Any way you like it
Any way you like it
Any way you like it
