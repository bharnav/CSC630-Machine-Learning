I drive a three county highway
And every one of them town's got a firework show
It's 4th of July and I'm just now getting home
On the horizon I can see them all unfold

It's been a warm winter and a cold spring
Everywhere I've been has felt wrong to me
Everything I kept
What I never should have thrown away
I wanted you for all those yesterdays

I was wishing for you one Sunday morning
Walkin down the road in some debtor's town
From every church a hymn came blendin' in
And everyone of them wantin' to be found

Did you say it took a long time to find
A lot less man and less harm done?
Did you say it took a long time to find
A handsome one to keep you young?

One day I'm gonna make it up to you
One day we're gonna laugh instead of cry
One day I'm coming home to stay, it's true
And baby, that's the last ticket I'm ever gonna buy

It's been a warm winter and a cold spring
Everywhere I've been has felt wrong to me
So put your head on my heart and lay down in the crook of my arm
Everything's okay, I've been found again
I've been found again
