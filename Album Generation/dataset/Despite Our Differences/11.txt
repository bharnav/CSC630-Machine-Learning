They won't have me, but I love this place
The rural life is broken, the farmlands gone to chaff
My hands are idle, my mind needs rest
The toil of the decent and the sleep of the best

I sit in diners with the old men
They talk of work cause it's all they ever did
They gave their hearts to Jesus and got serious
They gave up their drinking and worked for this nothing

All this love to offer, all this love to waste
All this love to offer, all this love to waste

There's a lame dog on the highway
Where the old road used to be
Now you know what divides us
Is just a difference someone made
Some got tired of trying, some were just too scared to stay
We gave ourselves to nothing and we let 'em have their day

Now who's gonna do the planting?
Who's gonna pray for rain?
Who's gonna keep the farmland
From the sub-division man?

All this love to offer, all this love to waste
