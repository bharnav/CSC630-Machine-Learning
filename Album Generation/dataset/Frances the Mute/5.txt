Tarantism

[Intro]
I think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
Think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
I think I've become... one of the others, oh, oh, yeah yeah

Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream

[Interlude]
There was a frail syrup dripping off his lap danced lapel
Punctuated by her decrepit prowl she
Washed down the hatching gizzard
Soft as a mane of needles
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged by combing her torso to a pile
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse
She was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels

[Verse 1]
Bring me to my knees, read the sharpened lines
All my arms bled me blind
Faucet leaks in shadows, spilling from morgue lancet
Caressed your fontanelle
I've sworn to kill every last one
Every last one
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids

[Chorus]
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches

[Verse 2]
All your dreams splintered off
Leech by leech on this catafalque
Anyone will tell you, yes, anyone
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm
Your mother flirted with disease
When she skinned that costume by it's navel strings
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids

[Chorus]
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches

[Verse 3]
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah!

Faminepulse

[Verse 4]
Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep on nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste
Oh, oh, oh

[Refrain]
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

[Verse 5]
If you should see the dice
Charmed with it's snaked choked eyes
You'll wear the widows weeds
Because they're just your size

[Verse 6]
Behind the snail secretion
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs
A limbless procreation
Let the infant crawl deformed
A bag replace the breath
Of these suffocating sheets
And now when the craving calls
I'll scratch my itchy teeth

[Bridge]
And soon
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know

[Refrain]
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more

[Verse 7]
She fell for the whispers
Sister flooded deaf tears
That night tore a river
In her baron womb mirror
And his multiple sons
With their mandible tongues
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Let it burn
I want, I want, I want, I want to let it burn

[Verse 8]
And the owls they were watching
And the owls didn't care
Then the owls came a' knocking
Placenta in their stares
They will feed on all the carnage
Leftover from the flood
And in the corner of their eyes
Fled sister L'Via
Sister L'Via

[Verse 9]
Now the pieces went floating
Reflecting all at dusk
Conceived from the stabbing
Was Vismund Cygnus

[Bridge]
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight

[Verse 10]
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks coming on the marble shrine
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks coming, coming tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks coming on the marble shrine
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
25 snakes are drowning
Drowning
Drown
Drowning
Drowning
25 more
25 more
25 more
25 more
Woahaoh
Woah, woah

[Verse 11]
You can't bend your crooked arms
Or fold your punctured proof
The air is growing cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And there's nothing you can do
Soon there'll be no gauze
Inside the confessional
Only rows of crows
Defrocking every breath, breath, breath, breath

[Verse 12]
One day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
I said one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
You've always had a family
In the burial of your home
In the burial of your home
Burial of your home
Burial of your home, ffffph

[Verse 13]
Not forevermore
Not forevermore
Not forevermore
Not forevermore
Not forevermore
And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin

Multiple Spouse Wounds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep on nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste

[Refrain]
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

[Chorus]
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie)
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, you ain't got-)

Sarcophagi

[Outro]
The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens
A depth perception languished in the night
All my life, I've been sewing the wounds
But the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud
Ooooh...
