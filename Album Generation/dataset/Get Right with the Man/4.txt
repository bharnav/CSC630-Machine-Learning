I swear I gave up drinkin';
Sometimes I have no choice
After singin' hard, six nights straight
A little sip sure helps my voice
Don't get me wrong, I love these songs
An' I know I've got it made
Sometimes my mind starts driftin'
When I'm up here on the stage

To that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
To those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most

Yeah, the hardest bthing I have to do
Is hang up this telephone
There's so much left to talk about
An' I been gone so long
So put them kids on one more time
Before they go to sleep
And, baby, no, no matter where I go
All that I can see

Is that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
To those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most

The things I miss the most
The things I miss the most
An' it's killin'me:
I hate to leave this family that you've given me
God only knows, I hate to go
So hold me close and let me let you know
About the things I miss the most

Instrumental Break

People always ask me
After every show
"Of all the places that you've ever been
"What's your favorite place to go?"

It's that last half-mile of dirt road
An' that oak tree on the hill
An' those dogs out, barkin' in the yard
An' that ol' tractor in the field
An' them kids up on the front porch
Screamin': "Mamma, Daddy's home!"
When I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
'Bout the things I miss the most

While I'm out here, I'm just thinkin'
About the things I miss the most
