Written by Blair Daly, Donnie Van Zant and Johnny Van Zant

I've seen the devil
Stared him straight in the eyes
Danced in his fire on my darkest nights
Laid in his garden an' I drank his wine
Slept with temptation till I found salvation:
It almost ate me alive

Oh, I've been there done that, had my thrill:
Ain't goin' back again
I was the life of every party
It nearly did me in
I was the baddest man you've ever seen
Lord, I wrote the book on sin
Yeah, I been down that road
I ain't goin' back again

I caused more damage than a hurricane
I broke your heart an' didn't feel a thing. (I walked.)
Then walked away and cursed your name in vain. (Cursed your name.)
But with you as my witness
You gave me forgiveness
Now I've got a second chance

Oh, I've been there done that, had my thrill:
Ain't goin' back again
I was the life of every party
It nearly did me in
I was the baddest man that you've ever seen
Lord, I wrote the book on sin
Yeah, I been down that road

He's knockin' at my door
Ain't walkin' round here no more
Been there, done that
Ain't goin' back again, no!

Instrumental Break

I was the baddest mother that you've ever seen
Lord, I wrote the book on sin
Been there, done that
Ain't goin' back again

I was the life of every party
It nearly did me in
I was the baddest man that you've ever seen
Lord, I wrote the book on sin
Yeah, I been down that road
I ain't goin' back again
Oh, no!

Been there, done that
I was the life of the party, yeah
(Been there, done that.)
