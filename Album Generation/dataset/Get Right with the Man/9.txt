Ah, tell 'em about it Darlin'
Here we go

She's a waitress at her corner
Always dancin' nine-to-five
Well, she ain't no supermodel
But I'm here to tell you, she's fine, (Ha, ha.)
She's so fine, Johnny
She's like the classic girl next door
There's somethin' 'bout her walk:
There's somethin' that goes off inside
Each time she starts to talk

Plain Jane
Oh, I love her name
She drives me insane
She's my plain Jane

She always gets my business
I can't wait to ring her bell
(Ah, I bet you can't Donnie.)
She puts a quarter in the jukebox:
Says she don't kiss an' tell
Is that right, brother
The way she wears that dress, (Yeah.)
It's time that I confess:
The music starts an' my heart stops
An' I become a mess

Plain Jane
Oh, I love her name
She drives me insane
She's my plain Jane

Nothin' fancy: she's just got everything
She's so addicting; she's so amazing:
Can't think of anything

Do, do, do do
(Whoa, talk to me, plain Jane.)
Do, do, do do, do, do
Whoa, yeah
C'mon

Plain Jane
Oh, I love her name
She drives me insane
She's my plain Jane. (Jane, Jane.)

Plain Jane
Oh, I love her name
She drives me insane
She said just call me plain Jane
(That's right, buddy."

Plain Jane
She's my plain Jane
She's my plain Jane
She's my plain, (Jane)
Whoo, she's my plain Jane
(No, she's mine.)
