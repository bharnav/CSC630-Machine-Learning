I been lost in the darkness for so long
I can't see the light
I been strung out, burned out, left out
An' hung out to dry
So I say to myself that I wanna get better:
Hidin' from the truth, I can't last forever

Jesus, help me;
Obviously, I can't help myself:
I've got nobody else
Send me an angel: someone to strangle
That old demon that's hauntin' me there on the shelf
I can't help myself

An' my excuses are so old an' tired:
Hell, I forget 'em
I keep fallin', an' crawlin', an' drownin'
Down here on the bottom
Yeah, I've pushed back my brothers, said goodbye to my friends:
When you get in this deep, the hell never ends

Jesus, help me;
Obviously, I can't help myself:
I've got nobody else
Send me an angel: someone to strangle
That old demon that's hauntin' me there on the shelf
I can't help myself

Gimme a reason to live an' show me a sign
I'm on the edge goin' out of my mind
I'm down on my knees: I'm beggin' you please
Make me somebody else: I can't help myself

Instrumental Break
(No!)

I need something stronger:
Pour it all over me

Send me an angel: someone to strangle
That old demon:
'Cause you know that I never will
I can't help myself
