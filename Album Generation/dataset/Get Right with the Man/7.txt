Whoo!

I got a spot in the country
I got a dog in the yard
I got a beat-up Chevy:
Runs kinda rough but she starts
I got my Grandaddy's shotgun:
I can shoot pretty good
I got a nice little garden of weeds
Tucked back up in the wood

An' I'm doin all right, livin' my life:
You got yours an' I got mine
Yeah, it may not look like much to you
But it's simple an' it suits me fine
Yeah, the sound of the rain an' a lonely old train:
Listen to that engine whine
'Cause I am what I am an' I sleep good at night
An' I'm doin' alright

I got a front porch for pickin'
I got a Nice ol' guitar
I got some lightnin' for sippin':
I've had about a jar
I got a pretty old lady
She's good at stretchin' a dime
In this little corner a-heaven mister
We have a helluva time

An' I'm doin all right, livin' my life:
You got yours an' I got mine
Yeah, it may not look like much to you
But it's simple an' it suits me fine
Yeah, the sound of the rain an' a lonely old train:
Listen to that engine whine
Yeah, I am what I am an' I don't give a damn
An' I'm doin' alright

Instrumental Break

All the rats in the city
Are livin' out of a box
They look down their nose, at my life, I suppose
An' I just laugh my country ass off

Yeah, I'm doin all right, livin' my life:
You got yours an' I got mine
Yeah, it may not look like much to you
But it's simple an' it suits me fine
Yeah, the sound of the rain an' a lonely old train:
Listen to that engine whine
'Cause I am what I am an' I sleep good at night
An' I'm doin' alright
Yeah, I'm doin' alright
