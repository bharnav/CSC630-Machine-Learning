That Friday night seemed just like any other
Friday night, Jimmy wasn't gonna play
Sittin' on the bench chompin' at the bit, knowin' he was better
5'6", goin' on six eight
A man went down, Jimmy went in:
Third an' long, first an' ten
Crowd went wild: "Touchdown."
Jimmy said: "I came to win."

If you're gonna go, go all the way
If you're gonna stay, stand your ground
If you can't run with the big dogs
Big dog, Let me walk you out
If you can't lead, let me by you
If you won't follow, get out the way:
You're takin' up space

Shelly had her Daddy's money waitin'
All she had to do was share his chair
She had a dream that he didn't want her chasin'
She was a night-school millionaire
She worked two jobs to pay her way:
Stayed up late to make the grade
Graduated, Summa c** Laude
Phd the hard way

If you're gonna go, go all the way
If you're gonna stay, stand your ground
If you can't run with the big dogs
Big Dog, Let me walk you out
If you can't lead, let me by you
If you won't follow, get out the way:
You're takin' up space

Instrumental Break

Life's too short to live in caution
Life's too long not to live it all

Oh, if you're gonna go, go all the way
If you're gonna stay, stand your ground
If you can't run with the big dogs
Big Dog, Let me walk you out
If you can't lead, let me by you
If you won't follow, get out the way:
You're takin' up space
Oh, you're takin' up space
