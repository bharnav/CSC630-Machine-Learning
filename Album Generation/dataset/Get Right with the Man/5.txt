Mmmmm, Yeah

I was a freckle-faced kid with a buck tooth grin
I was cuttin' her grass when she asked me in
Learned everything that I needed to learn
When I was sixteen, know what I mean
Whoo, ooh, ooh, grew up fast
Fin'lly found somethin' I was really good at
When it comes to love
I know what I'm talkin' about

I know my history, but good lovin' gets me
It ain't no mystery, just kiss me: kiss me, baby
I never learned my lesson: I'm pretty good at guessin'
I been down that road a time or two or three:
I know my history
Come a little closer, let me show you what it's all about
Oh, I know my history, baby

You can second guess me all night long
Make yourself believe that it's all wrong
Sooner or later, girl
You're gonna see you can trust me
Once again there, whoo, ooh, ooh, step into school:
Let me show you a thing or two:
When it comes to love
I know what I'm talkin' about

I know my history, but good lovin' gets me
It ain't no mystery, just kiss me: kiss me, baby
I never learned my lesson: I'm pretty good at guessin'
I been down that road a time or two or three:
I know my history

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, come along girl
Got his own road on a right cool world
Take my hand, it's just you an' me
Tonight's the night we're makin' history

Instrumental Break
(A little, little history.)
(Whoo, ooh, ooh.)

I know my history, yeah, good lovin' gets me
It ain't no mystery, just kiss me: (Kiss me.)
Come a little closer, let me show you what it's all about
