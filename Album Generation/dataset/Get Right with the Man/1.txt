Shoulda seen the look on the face of the boss of the second shift
When I threw my hard hat at him
An' suggested the box where he could stick it
I walked downstairs an told 'em I was leavin' Bethlehem
Like I'd seen the Saviour, had tears in my eyes
Holdin' my hands up an' shoutin': "Amen."

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
I spent most of my life a-wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do

We buried Daddy just last week at the church to save his soul
Man, he dreamed of pilot's wings:
Spent his whole life diggin' coal
I got a guitar under my bed, but I've been too scared to fly
But that's enough of that stuff, I'm packin' up my truck:
They can just kiss my butt goodbye

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
I spent most of my life a-wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do

'Cause there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
(Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do.)
I spent most of my life wrapped up tight
In somebody else's hand-me-down old shoes
Startin' today, I'm someone I'd be proud to know:
You might tell me where to go
But there ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
