Sitting on a boat decrepid
Gently rolling with the waves
From tankers and grey ships they're miles away
Watching fog came rolling over
Upthrust bits of inner earth
Juniper and ancient live oak trees

Seagulls swoop for bits of flotsam
Drifting on receding tides
I am only miles but lives away
Miles away and lives away
Can't you hear me Ariadne
Bring to me your golden skin

Driving down a burning highway
Underworlds and gold dead grasses
Vineyards laid with opulence and curves
Vineyards laid with labyrinths
There stalks the minotaur
Come to take our youth with ancient times

I grow old and bitter grey
And all I know it slips away
Except the memory I have of you
True love is our only shield
True love is our only shield
And true love is our sword

Last time
