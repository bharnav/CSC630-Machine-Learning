I can see you standing by that riverside
I can see you standing by that riverside
I see your younger face
I see your hair grown all-a-red
See you on chalky cliffs
The ocean breeze, you run against

Orpheus

Orpheus

I can see you standing by that open door
I can see you standing by that open door
See you on Roman roads
Aqueducts, matadors
See you on Moorish walls
Alhambra, Sevilla!

I can see you standing by that riverside
I can see you standing by that riverside
Wearing aviators
Sitting on stones in the Andalucian sun
Galaxy 500
Country tunes, travel to...
