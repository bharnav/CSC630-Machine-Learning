I was drifting down the coast
With the girl I love the most
But it's not what you might think
It's a long and tragic history

When will this shit end
I need better friends
But for now it's fine

And I was smoking lots of weed
Trying to forget what you meant to me
Hanging out with folks just half my age
Buying things which ain't a lot ......?

Sometimes baby shoes ???
Sometimes real shoes
Of those we ditch six ????

And I was drifting down the coast
With the girl I love the most
From Pojolina??? to Stinson Bay
From Akela??? to Bodega Bay

When will this shit end
I need better friends
But for now it's fine

And I was drinking jasmine tea
When the goon squad came to me
It was all my drunken friends
They kicked down my front door again

I need better friends
But for now it's fine
