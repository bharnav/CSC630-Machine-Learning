Hm-hmhm-hm-hm
Do-dodo-do-do
Whoohoohoo

Lay me down
And pull the arrows out
Let night fall again

So love is everywhere
But you're not with me dear
Let night fall again

I saw you there
I saw you waiting on that boulevard
For great parades
And motorcades
They never pass

I see you there
My heart cannot contain its misery
It comes right out
Of my mouth
Like butterflies

The car she used to drive
I thought it passed me by
Let night fall again

Saw you cross Governer's Square
A chill was in the air
Let night fall again

I saw you there
While I was dancing with some stranger
I'd taken comfort in
You had the same
You understand

We're in the hall
My heart cannot contain its misery
The mirror ball
Spits broken light
Upon the wall

Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Whoo-hoo-hoo

Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Whoo-hoo-hoo

I saw you there
I saw you waiting on that boulevard
For great parades
And motorcades
They never pass

I see you there
My heart cannot contain its misery
It comes right out
Of my mouth
Like butterflies

Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Whoo-hoo-hoo

Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Da-da-da-da-da
Whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo
