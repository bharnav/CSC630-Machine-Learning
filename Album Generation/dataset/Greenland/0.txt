Well the first dance cost me a quarter
And the second dance cost me my heart
Now I'm here on this barstool
Like a circle it ends where it starts
And it goes something like this
Always a swing and a miss

Well I ain't seen you since I drank all night
Now my eyes are black 'cause I fought all night
I come stumblin' home to sleep alone but it's alright
Yeah it's alright
And it's hard to tell what it is and what it's not
Until it is something that you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got

Well I woke up hung over in the squalor
Where I make my home
Ate my heart out for breakfast
Then I met the day stoned
And it goes something like this
Always a swing and a miss

Well I ain't seen you since I drank all night
Now my eyes are black 'cause I fought all night
I come stumblin' home to sleep alone but it's alright
Yeah it's alright
And it's hard to tell what it is and what it's not
Until it is something that you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got

(Guitar Solo)

Well I ain't seen you since I drank all night
Now my eyes are black 'cause I fought all night
I come stumblin' home to sleep alone but it's alright
Yeah it's alright
And it's hard to tell what it is and what it's not
Until it is something that you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got
It's something you ain't got

'cause it's alright, yeah it's alright
