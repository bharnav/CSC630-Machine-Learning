Lazybones, c'mon get your beautiful ass out of bed
It's half past noon, and I been calling you since 11 a.m

You're everything I ever wanted
But I'm half of what you need
You knew that I was damaged, so come on Maggie
Don't break my heart
Come on Maggie, don't break my heart
Don't break my heart

4 a.m., bar time at the Scottish gates of dawn
Aberdeen, Glasgow there's a piper playing on the cemetary lawn

You're everything I ever wanted
But I'm half of what you need
You knew that I was damaged, so come on Maggie
Don't break my heart
Come on Maggie, don't break my heart
Don't break my heart

You're everything I ever wanted
But I'm half of what you need
You knew that I was damaged, so come on Maggie
Don't break my heart
Come on Maggie, don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
