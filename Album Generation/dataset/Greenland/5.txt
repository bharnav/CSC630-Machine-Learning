Come on little darling give me one more chance
Come on little darling give me one more chance
Come on little darling give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

I like 'em big, I like 'em tall
I like that girl from down the hall
But most of all, I want you
I want you

I like 'em nice, sometimes maligned
I like 'em mean, jealous eyes are green
But most of all, I want you
I miss you

Where have you been lately?

Come on little darling give me one more chance
Come on little darling give me one more chance
Come on little darling give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

I like 'em true, with eyes of blue
I like 'em vain, these girls from Spain
But most of all, I want you
I miss you

I like 'em high, high as kites
Girls that party, stay out all night
These girls make Sam green eggs and ham
I can't help myself

Where have you been lately?
Yeah
