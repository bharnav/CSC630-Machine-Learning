Darling we're out of time
The sweet days of spring are gone
The wine that pours from the keg
Is bitter and dregs

Some say we gave it our best
So let's not bring up the rest
No sense in talking
We know where we went wrong

CHORUS:
Darling we're out of time
All of the flowers are dead and they're dying
And leaves are tumbling down off of the trees
Darling we're out of time
So pack up that old circus tent
Even the animals know this is the end
Darling we're out of time
Darling we're out of time

Our best days have come
Our best days are gone
It's already hard
Let's not make it harder

Darling we're out of time
So put on that dirty red lipstick
You dress like a chick
Drawn by an outsider artist

Darling we're out of time
All of the flowers are dead and they're dying
And leaves are tumbling down off of the trees
Darling we're out of time
So pack up that old circus tent
Even the animals know that this is the end
Darling we're out of time
Darling we're out
Darling we're out of time
Darling we're out
Darling we're out of time

Darling we're out of time Darling we're out of time
Darling we're out, we're out of time
We're out of time
Darling we're out of time
