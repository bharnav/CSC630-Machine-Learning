Saw my baby at the autumn dance
Dancing with her new boyfriend
Saw my baby in her new beau's car
She's the pride of any man

Now I don't mind and I don't cry
Cause I'm living on a mountain top
The wind might blow through the cracks at night
And I know she ain't never coming back

I don't mind and I don't cry
I'm living in a log pine shack
My shotgun keeps me warm at night
And I know she ain't never coming back

Saw my baby at the autumn dance
She was dancing with a big ring on
Saw my baby in her new beau's car
She's the pride of any man

Saw my baby at the bridal shop
She was looking for a wedding dress
Saw my baby at the dry goods store
I'm so glad she ain't never coming back

Now I don't mind and I don't cry
Cause I'm living on a mountain top
The wind might blow through the cracks at night
And I know she ain't never coming back

I don't mind and I don't cry
I'm living in a log pine shack
My shotgun keeps me warm at night
And I know she ain't never coming back
