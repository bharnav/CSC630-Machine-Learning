Ooh, the first time that I saw you
I said, "For goodness sake, that man's got the power
He's a charmer with a snake"
I was thrilled and fascinated but somehow liberated
When you took me to a place I'd never been
You showed me lots of things I'd never seen
You set me free as if you'd taken me
Halfway up the Hindu Kush
And I love you for showing me the view
From halfway up the Hindu Kush
The next time that I saw you, you looked into my eyes
I was sitting on your carpet when I felt it begin to rise
I kinda got the feeling, I was floating to the ceiling
Instead of looking at the sky
You picked me up and showed me how to fly
You set me free as if you'd taken me
Halfway up the Hindu Kush
And I love you for showing me the view
From halfway up the Hindu Kush
From halfway up the Hindu
From halfway up the Hindu
From halfway up the Hindu Kush
You set me free, as if you'd taken me
Halfway up the Hindu Kush
And I love you for showing me the view
From halfway up the Hindu Kush
