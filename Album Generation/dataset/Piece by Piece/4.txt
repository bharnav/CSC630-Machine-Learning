My mamma done told me
When I was in pigtails
My mamma done told me
"Hon, a man is a two-face
He'll give you the big eye
And when the sweet talking's done
A man is a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night"
Now the rain's fallin'
Hear the trains callin', "Whooee"
Hear the lonesome whistle
Blowin' across the trestle, "Whooee"
A-whooee-ah-whooee, clickety-clack
Comes echoing back
The blues in the night
From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I've been in some big towns
And heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man is a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night
My mamma done told me
When I was in pig tails
My mamma done told me
"Hon, a man is a two-face
He'll give you the big eye
And when the sweet talking's done
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night"
