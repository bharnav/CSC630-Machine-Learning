[Spoken Intro]
Now looka' here
I ain't got no fear
Who's scared? Who's scared?
Let me talk to you girl

[Song]
If you're in love with a woman
She don't understand
Boys, don't get angry
Just send her to some other man
Then go walkin'
Then go walkin'
Yes, go walkin'
Yes, go walkin'
Boy, just walkin'
Walk your blues away

Sometimes I will
Sometimes I won't
When I know I should
Well, that's when I don't
I go walkin'
I wanna walk
Don't you wanna walk
Come on now walkin'
Well, let's go walkin'
Walk our blues away

Look here darlin'
Your mind is not the key
I don't want you runnin' round
Stay where I can see
I'm goin' walkin'
I'm goin' walkin'
Don't you wanna walk
Come on out walkin'
Yes, I'm goin' walkin'
Walkin' my blues away

I'm here to tell you
These are the words I say
Yes, I'm crazy about a girl
Here name is Wilamene
I'm goin' walkin'
I'm goin' walkin'
Yes, I'm goin' walkin'
I'm goin' walkin'
Well, I'm goin' walkin'
Walkin' my blues away

Every night in bed
This is on my mind
I just sit right down
And I hang my head and cry
I'm goin walkin'
Yes, I'm gonna walk
Better come walkin'
Goin' out walkin'
Well, I'm goin' walkin'
Walkin' my blues away
