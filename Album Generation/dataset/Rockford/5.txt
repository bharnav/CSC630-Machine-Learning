Yeah
Yeah
If I knew wish I knew
I coulda seen what I'm goin' thru
When I first laid my eyes on you
You blew me away
Yeah, yeah

If the times are so right
I'd feel for you every night
It blew me away yeah yeah

Every sin seems to fade away
Disappeared poof you're gone
Thought I'd lost the key to you
Lookin' for notes in the song

This time we got it (yeah)
What I been lookin' for
Reached down and got it
I shouldn't ask for anymore
If you could ask for anything more
You could be king for a day
You could be queen for a day yeah
'Bout time you got it (This time we got it)
This time we got it
Let's take it away

Now I tried for something new
Wasn't rich enough to pay my dues
Was I aimed in the right direction
I was aimin' at you, yeah, yeah

If the times are so right
I'd feel for you every night
It just blows me away yeah yeah

Thought I'd lost the key to you
Lookin' for notes in the song

This time we got it (Yeah)
What I been lookin' for
Reached down and got it
I shouldn't ask for anymore
If you could ask for anything more
You could be king for a day
You could be queen for a day yeah
Bout time you got it (This time we got it)
This time we got it
Let's take it away

Can't lose it can't have enough (have enough)
Won't lose it can't get enough (get enough)
Don't lose it can't have enough (have enough)
Won't lose it I can't get enough

This time we got it (Yeah)
What I been lookin' for
Reached in and got it
I shouldn't ask for anymore
If you could ask for anything more
You could be king for a day
You could be queen for a day yeah
This time you got it (This time we got it)
'Bout time we got it
Let's take it away-ay-yeah yeah
This time we got it
'Bout time we got it
Let's take it away
