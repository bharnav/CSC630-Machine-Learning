You know I feel the deep blue??
You won't hear me cry
See me die
What am I going to do?
I can see your face everytime

Anytime you want I'm here for you
Now my heart cries

All those years (all those years)
It's a lonely lonely night
A lonely lonely lonely night
All those years (all those years)
It's a lonely lonely night
A lonely lonely lonely lonely night

I close my eyes
I can see your face everytime
How can I say to you
I'll do anything you want me to?

Anytime you want I'm here for you
Now my heart cries

All those years (all those years)
It's a lonely lonely night
A lonely lonely lonely night
All those years (all those years)
It's a lonely lonely night
A lonely lonely lonely lonely night

Right from the start
I gave you my heart

Anytime you want I'm here for you
Now my heart cries
