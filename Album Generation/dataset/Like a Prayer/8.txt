[Intro]
One, Two, Three, Hit It
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

[Verse 1]
I got brothers
I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger
City life can get to you
People can be so cold
Never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be loved for who I am
Not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Refrain]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be loved for who I am
Not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Refrain]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Outro]
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
