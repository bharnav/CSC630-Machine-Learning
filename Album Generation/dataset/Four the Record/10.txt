[Verse 1]
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running’ around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running’ around with your rag-top down
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

[Verse 2]
Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushing’ that wedding gown
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running’ around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

[Bridge]
I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

[Verse 3]
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running’ around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now
Yeah, I want do right but not right now
