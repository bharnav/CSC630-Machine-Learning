[Verse 1]
How long has it taken me to find you
Five hundred years, five hundred thousand miles
It don't matter now
Love's always on time
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky

[Verse 2]
Lightning flashed, everything went silent
A feather could have knocked me to the floor
Missing piece was found
I was finally alive
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky

[Bridge]
With the speed of sound
I'm homeward bound mhmm

[Verse 3]
All our sorrows swept away forever
Each and every tear washed out to sea
There ain't no goodbye
With your hand in mine
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky
Oklahoma sky
