[Verse 1: Miranda Lambert]
Cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
One more down, to drink you off my mind
Lord knows I’ve tried a thousand times to give you up
But its closing time and we both know why

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Blake Shelton]
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
We’ve been driving down this highway
Now we’re out of gas, too far outta town
Oh here we are all tangled up and sideways
You’re all broken down, yeah I’m breaking down

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Blake Shelton]
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run

[Bridge: Blake Shelton]
Oh maybe somewhere a little down the line
I’ll get a little better leaving us behind
Maybe someday, oh I’ll be fine

[Interlude: Miranda Lambert]
Oh and you’ll move on and I will too
But still I don’t see getting over you
Oh, no, no, no

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Blake Shelton]
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run

[Outro]
In the long run
Oh, in the long run
In the long run
In the long run
