[Verse 1]
The weather man
Says rain today
We'll saddle up and be on our way
What's a little rain to a high riding' rebel or two

[Chorus]
Cause it's easy living
Easy loving you

[Verse 2]
People keep searching' for a reason why
They say life's a bitch and then you'll die
But I can't see
A reason for their point of view

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Talk shows talking how it's near the end
Of the one man woman
And the one woman man
We might fight like dogs
But hey we love the making' up at the end of the day
Tomorrow that old sun will rise
I'll be laying here by your side
A coffee cup and a good morning kiss or two

[Chorus][x2]
