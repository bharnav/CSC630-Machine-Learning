[Verse 1]
One more night with the same neon lights
And I'll find my place at the bar
One more dance so I'll buy one more round
And I'll try to drown out my heart

[Verse 2]
He'll walk in and make every head turn
And he'll always be dressed to kill
Day I left is my only regret
And now it's become his biggest thrill

[Chorus]
All my friends say "hey don't you know him"
And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say he's nobody
And me, well I'm nobody's fool

[Verse 3]
Won't take long and he'll find him someone
And then pull them out for a dance
Every note tells me that's all she wrote
And reminds me how I missed my chance

[Verse 4]
When he's done he'll have a little more fun
And he'll let her act like she's smooth
As they walk out while I'm learning about
What it is to have nothing to lose

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
And me, well I'm nobody's fool
