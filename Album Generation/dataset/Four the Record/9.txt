[Intro]
Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

[Verse 1]
Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Bridge]
Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid

[Verse 2]
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Break]
It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

[Chorus]
Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you
