[Verse 1]
He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
He'd never change

Tight fisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
He'd never change

[Pre–Chorus 1]
And so she yelled at him

[Chorus]
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time

[Verse 2]
She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
She'd never change

Overtly individual, covertly traditional
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
She'd never change

[Pre–Chorus 2]
And so he yelled at her

[Chorus]
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, is it real? I don't know
But I'll act as if it is
What's oue deal? I don't know
But I'll act as if it is
What I think that it is, if it is
Then this might just work

[Verse 3]
They were in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
They'd never change

[Pre–Chorus 3]
And so they yelled out loud

[Chorus]
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time, yeah
I know what I should get this time
