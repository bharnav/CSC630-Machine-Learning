Everybody is waiting for everybody to get out
I'll join 'em talking 'bout the people everybody talk about
And all the pretty people party while the petty people pout

Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down

We could have given up early when it was dark still, not light
Now it's the 48th hour of a two-day night
And all the pretty people party while the petty people fight

Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down

A jack-of-all-trades and a master of none
Why do I have to be bored with being foolish and young?
The show isn't over, but I'm long since gone
I feel like I let them down when I don't wanna trade my sunshine for a cloudy night

But everybody's pretending the sun won't ever come out
I'll join 'em talking 'bout whatever everybody talks about
And all the pretty people party while the petty people shout

Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
