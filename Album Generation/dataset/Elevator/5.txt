Watch your children around the abandoned well
Don´t ask me to tell if they slipped and fell
I´m just a salesman with my suitcase in hand
And the perfect plan that should pull me out

Another day, another night, another year
Another smile, another lie, another tear
This better not be all I got
I never thought I´d end up here

Jingle jangle that´s the sound of coins
Spent on useless toys made for useless boys
I´m just a salesman with my suitcase in hand
There´s a piece of land that I got my eye on

Another day, another night, another year
Another smile, another lie, another tear
This better not be all I got
I never thought I´d end up here

Friday night I´ll raise my glass and say
"Tomorrow things will change! I can´t afford to wait."
But by Monday morning my alarm clock knows
How this story goes and the ending´s the same as the start

Another day, another night, another year
Another smile, another lie, another tear
This better not be all I got
I never thought I´d end up here

Another day, another night, another year
Another smile, another lie, another tear
This better not be all I got
I never thought I´d end up here

Watch your children around the abandoned well
Don´t ask me to tell if they slipped and fell
I´m just a salesman with my suitcase in hand
And the perfect plan that I´m working on
