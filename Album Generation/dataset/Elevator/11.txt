I found a soldier in a box
A souvenir that someone lost at such a cost
The cemetery gates were closed
Only the humming birds would smell the flowers brought for ghosts
There's not much fame or fortune
For the fortuneteller selling fortunes to the broke

Soldier in a box... he's mighty lonely
Soldier in a box... he's nothing special

He's serenading himself cuz nobody's there
He's celebrating himself cuz nobody cares
He's serenading himself

"No need to say this letter better get to where he lays his head!" she said
Seventeen months of wondering why she forgot to send her thoughts was all he got instead

Her soldier in a box... he's mighty lonely
Soldier in a box... he's nothing special

He's serenading himself 'cause nobody's there
He's celebrating himself 'cause nobody's there
He's serenading himself

He's serenading himself 'cause nobody's there
He's celebrating himself 'cause nobody cares
He's serenading himself 'cause nobody's there
He's celebrating himself 'cause nobody cares
He's serenading himself 'cause nobody's there
He's celebrating himself 'cause nobody cares
