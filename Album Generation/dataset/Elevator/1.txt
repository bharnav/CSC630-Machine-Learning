Witless, humorous conversatoin
Has filled me up like an old gas station
I'm wallowing in a pool of gasoline

Self appointed sherrif of a popular ghostown
I'm open to bribes but I've arrested no one
I'm galloping to meet my bride to be
She'll woo the saloon then sing us both to sleep

But... I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I've run out of time

Drop dead gorgeous art history drop out
Thought of her fatherought to pay her to clear the whole shop up
She carries her cameras in hand to complete the look

Screenplay players co-writing screenplay
Cotton candy fot the eyess but cotton balls for the brain
He thinks to himself, "Thank God the bar's not too high"
Just look at his face and then you'll see why

But... I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I've run out of time

Hollywood waiter with a chip on his shoulder
Only break has been his back and yet he's just getting older
He's washing his clothes in a sink of self pity

Retired ball playerguest hosting a talk show
Earned a trophy and a wife and twice he's won the lotto
I'm running aways but don't know who from or why
Just look in his eyes and then you'll see why

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I've run out of time

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I've run out of time
