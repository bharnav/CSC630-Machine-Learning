I feel funny
Is it over?
Am I dead or asleep on the sofa?
Made in China for the masses
I'm cheap and plastic
There's millions of us, yeah
You can buy me
You can break me
You can laugh but you'll see it's so easy
What the fuck
It's a miracle I'm even here
You're over me
But I'm alive
What do I care
Do you miss it
Doing dishes
I'm amazed you don't find me delicious
Look at me there
I'm a rock star
In my ??? you can see my blah blah
Can you take it when I break it
Give it back to the poseurs who fake it
Suck the milk out of the lilacs
You look so innocent you can't go back
What the fuck
It's a miracle I'm even here
You're over me
But I'm alive
So what do I care
Standing in the cement
Standing in the cement
Standing in the cement
Buried in that moment
Standing in the cement
Standing in the cement
Standing in the cement
Buried in that moment
What the fuck
It's a miracle I'm even here
You're over me
I hate New York
What do I care
