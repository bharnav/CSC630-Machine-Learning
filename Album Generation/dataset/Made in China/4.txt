There's a hole in the sky
I stood and stared
I feel it inside
What isn't there
The children are lost
We can't find them anywhere
Hole in the sky
I'm crying for, still crying for you
Hole in the sky
I'm crying, still crying for you
There's smoke in our eyes
It's all over town
Your power and your money
It won't help you now
You've unleashed the sun
'Til now and forever burns down
Hole in the sky
I'm crying, still crying for you
Hole in the sky
I'm crying, still crying for you
Everybody look up with funeral eyes
Wish you had one more chance to say goodbye
Or I'm sorry
La da da da
La da da da
Hole in the sky
Uh huh huh
Hole in the sky
I'm coming, I'm coming with you
