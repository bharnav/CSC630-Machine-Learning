Na na na na na na
Baby baby baby
I don't want nothing
Means I want something
Millions of diamonds
Sparkling and shining
Singing stupid songs
I'm going blonde
Bleaching my brain
I dig the pain
Firing squad pointed at the sweet spot
I'm turning myself on
I'm going blonde
Never want to be forgotten
I'm speaking American
I need some attention
Tell you my problems
What's going on
I think I'm going blonde
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Na na na na na na na na
