I stand at the window looking out
Waiting for something
I don't know what
They don't see me
So they're not scared
But they tread lightly everywhere
Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand
Sunset's pink and orange and lavender and grey
There's a bird on a branch at the top of a tree
We wanted the world to give us a chance
Now we're pushed out to the edges
If we stand still blinded by the lights
Is it murder or suicide?
Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Over the sand
Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand
