I don't wanna go to school today
I don't wanna go
I just wanna play guitar all day
You act like you're the only one who has problems
You act like you're the only one who's ever gotten strung out on pills, pills
I don't wanna have to do the things that people have to do
I'm not a person I'm just an object to you
Like books and shoes
You act like you're the only one with a chemical imbalance
You're not the only one who's ever looked into a flash
Stay awake
Stay awake
I don't wanna stay awake
Don't wanna stay awake
Stay awake
Stay awake
I'm gonna go to sleep
Stay awake
Stay awake
I'm gonna go to sleep
