It's a basic need
To lie and be believed
Step out of line
And you have arrived
Oh, tell me something
Oh, don't say nothing
I'm gonna wait 'til it rains
Then I'm gonna burn everything
I'll sing to the clock
Because no one came
Oh, tell me something
Oh, don't say nothing
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to be perfect
What it's like to shine a light on a sob story
Shine it on the dust
This is the age of boredom and deadly weapons
Oh, flip a coin
Oh, to live or die
Why are you so surprised
No one knows what it's like to be perfect
No one knows what it's like
Why are you so surprised
Flip a coin
Live or die
