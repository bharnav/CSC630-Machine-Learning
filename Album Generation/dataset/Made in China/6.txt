There's a moment
In everyday
Right before
It's too late
Innocent child
Sees the truth
But your mother
Never knew

You snuck downstairs
And doused the flames
All in vain

Can't hold on
Gotta let go
Can't hold on
Gotta let go

You know just what you want
You want ice cream and bags of chips
And chocolate and blood and guts
And drugs and sex and cigarettes
I got tricks
To keep me in line
Like being good for a wine ???
I sit on my hands
My heart speeds up
So I just do it â€“ huh fuck

I can't hold on
Gotta let go
I can't hold on
Gotta let go

Make me wild
Let me melt

Inside a house
On stormy seas
The roof is leaking
Under the waves
There is no light
And everyone's sleeping
I'm so afraid
I'm not in control
It's out of control
Rip me to shreds
And spit it out all over the world
Make me wild

There's a moment
In every day
Just before
It's too late

I can't hold on
Gotta let go
Can't hold on
Gotta let go
I can't hold on
Gotta let go
