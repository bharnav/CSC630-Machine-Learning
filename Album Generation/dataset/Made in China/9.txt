Will you get me when I was ashore
Bring the nightgown I left on your floor
If it's snowing and the truck gets stuck
I'll get out and help you dig it out
I want you
It's nine degrees
Without you I will freeze
If you take me to a party
And everybody knows the songs but me
I'll sing: la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
The snow is dirty in the city
People faking going crazy
Shiny girls with no opinions
Bring the dogs to them so they can choose
There's too much noise here
I can't hear music in my head
Are you contemplating white lines?
I can save you from the spider bites
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
You're my island boy
Come and live with me
You don't have to pay, got my own money
There's a time to work and a time to play
It's the perfect place for the end of side one ??
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
