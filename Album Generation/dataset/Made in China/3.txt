Baby there's no way you can lie your way out of this one
It's on video
You're looking so transparent
You got no skill at seduction, no
All the money you've bought
And the money you won
And the money you've got
And the money you love's not enough
It's on video
Now all the bleeding hearts have finally got their proof, yeah
It's on video
Just cause you say you're a good man doesn't make it true, no
All the money you've bought
And the money you won
And the money you've got
And the money you love's not enough
It's on video
It's on video
All the favors you trade with the cops
And all the people you've paid off
All the money you've bought
And the money you won
All the money you've got
And the money you love
All the money you've bought
And the money you won
All the money you've got
And the money you love's not enough
