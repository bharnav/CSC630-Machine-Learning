When you talk to God
Tell him I said Hi
But he don't need to bless me
Because I am alright already
Would you kill for Jesus
When you've never met
The man you've only read about
I want proof because I'm full of doubt
Save yourself
Save yourself
If you want to pray for me
Tell God to send me some money
Save yourself
Save yourself
If you want to pray for me
Tell God to send me some money
Don't I wish you could do my thinking for me
But it doesn't work that way
And this marriage is not officially ordained
We just love each other
And I am an unwed mother
I love the world
I love my beautiful girls
Save yourself
If you want to pray for me
Tell God to send me some money...
