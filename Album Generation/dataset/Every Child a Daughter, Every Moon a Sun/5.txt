{Chorus}
Take me out
Take me anywhere, I'm around
I'd meet you anywhere at all
I'd meet you anywhere at all
I'd meet you anywhere
Oh I wanna see everything you've seen
I know how long these nights can be
Wires dangling at your feet
Oh and please, take me someplace I've never been
Someplace you run to in your dreams
Someplace that's just for you and me
Just for you and me
{Chorus}
In a dream, your light came dancing through the trees
Singing songs that I believe
Might come and wake me from my sleep
Oh but there may come a time
When I'm lonely here at night
And you won't let me know
But hands, touching hands
Reaching out towards your man
We won't let them tumble together though
{Chorus}
