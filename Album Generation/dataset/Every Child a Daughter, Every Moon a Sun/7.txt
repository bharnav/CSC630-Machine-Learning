She bowed on my window
Laid their arms in a room
Prayed to them I'd set you free
And tonight you could be a ghost
Stumbling through the darkness
So glad to be all alone
Wasted hours might haunt still
But she tries not to let it show
You saw me on the TV
Saw the life I chose
Say you don't believe me
And you'll be glad it's in the show
Why don't you come up and see me?
We could be alone
Wasted hours might haunt me still
But I try not to let it show
But all I ask is some forgiveness
I was young and I did not understand
Wonder why you would live
While I was sleeping
Well, I know you're just trying to be the one
Now, it all looks the same to me
You're body's painted with ghosts
There were times I felt cheated, baby
But in that, I'm not alone
Sure, it ain't easy
Don't do me no good to know
Wasted hours might haunt me still
But I try not to let it show
I know you're just trying to please your man
