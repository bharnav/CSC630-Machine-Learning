Lay your body down awhile
I see you're tired
You've been running all around me
You never seem inspired
If I unload the night awhile
I see the wires
Put your arms around me
And we'll act like you rely
But it gets old
To be alone
I can't even be at home
And be alone
You wrapped yourself up in some gold
And silver wires
Came to me so softly
I never asked you why
You hid your voice behind some
Convoluted cry
I wrote your name across my arm
But you still won't come inside
It gets old
To be alone
I can't even be at home
And be alone
It's so cold tonight, so please
Come back inside
Lay your body down on me
And tell me that it's fine
There's a world outside, so darling
Close the blinds
Every time that we get drunk
Well, it could just be you and I
But I'm too old
To be alone
I can't even be at home
And be alone
