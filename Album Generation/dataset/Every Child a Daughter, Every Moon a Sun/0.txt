They came all the way from town to see us
And I know how you’d hate to let them down
But I’ve been thinking about the times since they saved us
And wondering why you ever stuck around
You were born a fair child of the valley
Low times felt you were tethered to the ground
You’re not a stone
You’re not a stone
I came to know the names of all my neighbours
Made a home in a valley of my own
And I took a night the audience were strangers
Though not one could ever calm me down
But I felt alone
I felt alone
Just flesh and bone
Just flesh and bone
And I came home to find you at my table
Said the worries that had plagued you now were few
And I’d been wondering if I had the strength to face it
Son if I found mercy surely you can too
But you’re not a stone
You’re not a stone
You’re not a stone
Just flesh and bone
Just flesh and bone
And now you hold the hand of one who named you
Turned to me and said you must make these words your own
