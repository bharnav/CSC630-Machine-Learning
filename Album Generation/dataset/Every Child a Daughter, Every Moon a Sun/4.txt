How could I ever really know
How you feel when you're alone?
I'm out working on the road
Trying to send a little money home
Are you wearing different clothes?
If I saw you would I know
That you've been flirting with a ghost?
I'll let your reasons be your own
I wouldn't blame you if you go
Back to someplace that you know
We'd keep you warm when you get cold;
You know that I'd respect your choice
You've been worried about your bones
Living so far from your home
Ain't it sad what life becomes
When all you know is what you do?
