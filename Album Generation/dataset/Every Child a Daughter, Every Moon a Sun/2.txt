They were dancing at my window
When you awoke to me and said
You'd been wondering what it meant
To have these dreams where you were dead
Under cover of the night
You took shelter in my mind
Hung your name over the fire
You were lovely dear, but hard to find
Drifting further from the light
There were signs on every corner
Was the last month of the year
I'd been struggling to find my voice
When I heard your steps draw near
You cried out against the night
I should've run to you
But how could I?
I was lost most of the time
Yeah but I got bored and left you
There lying on your side
Saving all the pieces you could find
Sometimes it gets so dark
I wonder how I'll find the light
So I lay back and I try to put it out of mind
I remember feeling older
Found it hard to see myself
Guess I found some place to hide
Watch the whole thing crumble down
You cried out against the night
I should've run to you
But how could I?
I was lost most of the time
Yeah but I got bored and left you
There lying on your side
Saving all the pieces you could find
Sometimes it gets so dark
I wonder how I'll find the light
So I lay back and try to put it out of mind
