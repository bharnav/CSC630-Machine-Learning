Well I dreamt last night you were makin love
To a bird you sworn you'd given up
Oh oh woo oh oh
I woke up shakin
And the wolves kept a watch on the wind outside
I kept my eyes towards the wooden sky
Oh oh woo oh oh
And no escapin
Oh oh woo oh oh
And no escapin
And the rent we'd sworn would be enough
To find a love had some how fallen short
Oh oh woo oh oh
It was over due
So I held your breath tryin to get you high
Heard your lovers song as it filled the night
And fired two shots into the sky and kept one for you
Oh oh woo oh oh
Kept a one for you
I know, know
Oh oh woo oh oh
I kept a one for you
I know, know
Oh oh woo oh oh
Kept a one for you
Well the fire burned bright right above our beds
It kept us up all night tryin to make a mends
Of a child that calls in vain and I'm on to you
And I awoke to find that the time had come
To leave behind this mess that we once called home
Well tonight this child with god with be forced to choose
Oh woo oh oh
Be forced to choose
I know, know
Oh oh woo oh oh
Be forced to choose
I know, know
Oh oh woo oh oh
Be forced to choose
Now the sign of the hands of a working man
Outside my window
And the voice in my head spoke of makin clense
So clear and simple
Oh
Oh oh woo oh oh
Kept a one for you
