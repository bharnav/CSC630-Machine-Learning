[Verse 1]
Oh my God, I think I'm lost at sea
And these silent waves are my company
And I lost the line between the sky and sea
And I'm wondering will the wind ever come for me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know
I don't know where I am
Can you tell me
Will I break or will I bend?
Will the wind ever come again?

[Verse 2]
I feel the sun coming up, rising from the East
And I see the Empire falling to her knees
And I lost the line between her and me
But my troubles are gone if the wind ever comes for me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know
I don't know where I am
Can you tell me
Will I break or will I bend?
Will the wind ever come again?

[Bridge]
Dreamed, I found the shoreline
You were standing there
I dreamed I found you waiting
You were waiting for me, waiting for me
Tried to kiss the emptiness
Lost the line between sky and sea
I feel the sun coming up
Coming up, coming up, coming up

[Outro]
But I don't know, I don't know where I am
I will break or I will bend
Will the wind ever come again?
