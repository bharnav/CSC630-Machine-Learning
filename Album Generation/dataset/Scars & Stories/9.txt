From Denver to California
By way of Mexico
We're lost and we're finding each other
And we may never see the West Coast
We may never see the West Coast

We're taking it slow
But for now we're two down
And 48 to go

Missed an exit in Albuquerque
But we don't seem to mind at all
We pull over, the sun is burning
And we lay down to feel the rainfall

We're taking it slow,
But for now we're two down
And 48 to go

The desert winds blowing your hair back
Window down, town after town
Where will be in half a century
Two down and 48 to go

The sun rises in Bernardino
Sometime after 6 am
You take 27 up old canyon road
Sometimes you win before you run
Sometimes you win before
We got 48, 48 to go
48 to go
48, 48

Come on, baby
Come on, darling
48 to go
