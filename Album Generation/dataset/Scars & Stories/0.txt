[Verse 1]
We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We got to keep on running 'til we see the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fire and it's burning in the rain
Thought that it went out but it's burning just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same
I feeling your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to put it all back together
I got a story and I'm trying to tell it right
I got the kerosene and the desire
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you got a fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same
I feeling your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I know the memory is rushing into your mind
I want to kiss your scars tonight
You got to try, you got to let me in
Let me in

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same
I feeling your heartbeat

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Heartbeat
