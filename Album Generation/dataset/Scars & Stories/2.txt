[Verse 1]
There's a sentence on my father
On my sister, on my brother
There's a terror in the corner
That'll make your blood run cold
And it goes back in my bloodline
And we tried to walk away
But I want you as my lover
You are where I want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what it is, what it is, what it is about you
What it is, what it is but oh

[Chorus]
The way you're moving, oh
You turn me on
I want to touch you 'til we're burning
Oh, you turn me on

[Verse 2]
I see you rising and you're falling
And I try to look away
But I'm frozen in the darkness
You're a burning cabaret

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what it is, what it is, what it is about you
What it is, what it is but oh

[Chorus]
The way you're moving, oh
You turn me on
I want to touch you 'til we're burning
Oh, you turn me on, come and turn me on
Oh, the way you're moving, oh
You turn me on
I want to touch you 'til we're burning
Oh, you turn me on, come and turn me on

[Outro]
I want to feel, I want to feel you, love
I want to feel, oh I said I want to feel the way you're moving
Oh, you turn me on, come and turn me on
