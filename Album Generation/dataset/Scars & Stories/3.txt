[Verse 1]
Seventeen years by her side, broke the same bread
Wore the same clothes and you said
"We're sisters with nothing between, if one of us fall
The other will soon be following"

[Verse 2]
Both of you fell the same day and you don't know why
But one of you never woke up
You lay your body down on the floor, you're desperate to hear
Her footsteps again, but this house is on fire
And we need to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

[Chorus]
Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
I will be close behind, run for your life

[Verse 3]
She had a fire inside and that terrified you
You swore that you'd never lose your control
Baby, let yourself go, 'cause part of you hides
And I know the hunger inside of you is strong
You can only hold back the river so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

[Chorus]
Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Run for your life

[Bridge]
Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone

[Chorus]
Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Run for your life
