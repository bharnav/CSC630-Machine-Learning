You love to run
Into the arms of anyone
Take off your shoes and socks
And stay awhile
You like the adrenaline rush
Just a little too much
You go from day to day
Hand to mouth
And wonder why you're unsatisfied

'Cause love is a marathon
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Slow down and pace yourself
'Cause when it's good
It's a long open road

You think still
You'll find a soul behind a thrill
You're just a cat chasing your tail
Round and round
But if you relax
Something might last

'Cause love is a marathon
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Slow down and pace yourself
'Cause when it's good
It's a long open road

You're exhausted always coming down
While trying to come up for air
Trying to act like you just don't care

'Cause love is a marathon
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Slow down and pace yourself
'Cause when it's good
It's a long open road
