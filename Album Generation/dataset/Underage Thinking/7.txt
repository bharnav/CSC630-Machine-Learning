Well love, life, one speaks for the other one here
And love life one speaks for the other one now
We'll try to get by
Chorus
Did anyone try too hard, Well I guess I did
I guess I did alright, She'll break my heart
Did anyone try too hard, Well I guess I did
I guess I did alright, She'll break my heart

Cause ever since the minute I saw your face
Well I knew I wanted to be in that place next to you, yeah
And now I spend my whole life tryin
To be the one that's in your arms
And I'll try to get by

Chorus

Well isn't it alright
Why can't it be just this once alright
It will be you and me

Chorus
