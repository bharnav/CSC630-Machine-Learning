(Verse 1)
So soon to say it's over
Lets see what happens later on
I'm 16, my world just opened wide
I've got a pocket full of change
I'm tired of thinking underage
Just cut this string and let me fly
Say goodbye, say goodbye

(Chorus)
Forgive me mom and dad
If the music makes you sad
Nothing can prepare us for the day
When little boys grow old
And don't do as they're told
But I will find my way
I'm just tired of thinking underage
Tired of thinking underage
I'm not thinking underage anymore

(Verse 2)
I'm first in line at the DMV
I'll sweet talk you, just give me the keys
I don't have a curfew in my mind
Little Katie and me like Rolling Stones
She keeps me still by letting go
It's not like were running out of time
'Cause you will find, yeah you will find

(Chorus)
Forgive me mom and dad
If the music makes you sad
Nothing can prepare us for the day
When little boys grow old
And don't do as they're told
I will find my way
I'm just tired of thinking underage
Tired of thinking underage
I'm not thinking underage anymore

Just like gravity, the ups and downs
Will always be okay with me
I am over all that underage can be soâ€¦

(Chorus)
Forgive me mom and dad
If the music makes you sad
Nothing can prepare us for the day
When little boys grow old
And don't do as they're told
I will find my way
I'm just tired of thinking underage
Tired of thinking underage
I'm not thinking underage anymore

And I'm not thinking underage anymore
Underage anymore, no, yeah
I'm not thinking underage
I'm not thinking underage anymore
