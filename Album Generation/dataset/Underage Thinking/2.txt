The night air breathes
But not so easy as before
Did you notice, did you take the time to listen
To my breath or to my words
When I spoke, explained my feelings
And my reasons for the way I love you
I'm getting to the point

And I feel like I do
Even more now that I'm leaving
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you

And she's so sweet and I'm leaving
Thinkin how I'm barely breathin'

Notice how your every look gives me tingles
And I wonder if your listening to what I'm thinking
We won't fade away

And I feel like
I do even more now that I'm leaving
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you
And I feel like I do even more now that
I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
So what am I to do

My feelings have not fallen away
You're my every thought, yeah
Everything will go on its own way
Everything is ok, we're gonna try to make it
Everything will go, it's all right baby
It's all right baby, it's all right baby girl why don't you stay
My feelings have not passed away
You're my every thought here, everything will

And I feel like I do
Even more now that I'm leaving
And I feel just like I do when I'm with you
And I feel like I do
Even more now that I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
So what am I to do
