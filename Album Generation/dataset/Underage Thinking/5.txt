Well, I kissed the rain, I waited up
You're pouring dragons in my cup
Done trying, I can't cope with it
Well get over it, yeah I'm over it
I'm tired of night air, I can't breathe
You blew me off so easily
It's different between you and me
And I'm over it, you'll get over it

I'm not the jealous type that doesn't sleep at night
You've got your karma, I know I've got mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time
Air dry

Well, I heard you played behind my back
Was I a fool to not react
Let's go to tape and play it back
I was out of it, I was under it
Your little spells worked quietly
Your good-byes left me wondering
Now that I'm gone you contemplate
If you're over me, well you used to be

I'm not the jealous type who doesn't sleep at night
You've got your karma, I know I've got mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time
Only wanted it once I was over it
You go your way, I know I'll go mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time

How was I supposed to know
You never told me baby what you want
I can't read your mind
You never bothered to look inside of mine
I used to wake up every morning
And all I could do was think of you
It was all a lie, it was all a lie

I'm not the jealous type who doesn't sleep at night
You've got your karma, I know I've got mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time
Only wanted it once I was over it
You go your way, I know I'll go mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time
Just a little time
To air dry
