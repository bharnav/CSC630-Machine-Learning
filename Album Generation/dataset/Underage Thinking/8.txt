Caught up in what's in
Caught up in the things that everyone wants
Caught up in what's out
Caught up in the things that you could do without
Well what if I was one of them?
So I will say

If I lived for a million years
I would be right there to catch your tears
Will you get over it this time?
And is this the last time?

On this night we breathe air
What makes it so different?
What makes you not care?
Well I wish that we could be the same
And I wish that you could give up this game
Don't wanna be one of them
And so I will say

Well if I live for a million years
I would be right there to catch your tears
And will you get over it this time?
If this the last time?

Will you say goodbye before you leave?
Will you say goodnight?
Just one more time please
And will you call my phone out of regret?
And will you love again?
With other than me
Other than me
Will you speak of me?
With other than me
And will you remember me?
And will you remember me?
And will you remember me?

If I live for a million years
I would be right there to catch your tears
Will you get over it this time?
And is this the last time?
Is this the last time?
Is this last time my dear?
Is this the last time?
Is this last time my dear?
Is this the last time?
Is this the last time my dear?
Is it the last time?
I think its the last time for us
