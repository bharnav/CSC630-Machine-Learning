Major competition, don't go switchin' games now that I'm hittin'

Light moving, time moving, the earth moves
And opium, but I'm moving faster
Niggas got another thing coming
If they anticipate that I'm just some rapper
Traditions and customs, life can't come customized
Fuck what you accustomed to
Like gaps in skylines I find it you'll get used to
And continue what you used to do
Old head try to school me on something useless
I'm truant, if his two cents worth more than a nuisance
I'd be rich off of loose change
I'm congruent now, explain
Simeon and Levy, Spank Rocks with twin power
Prepped to change things when the minute matched the hour
Popped a collar, rolled dollar on the nightstand
Got a plan, to pick up and dick down Roxanne

Major competition, don't go switchin' games now that I'm hittin'
Major competition, don't go switchin' games now that I'm hittin'
Major competition, don't go switchin' games now that I'm hittin'
Major competition, don't go switchin' games (games)

Stand with my gun up
Protecting the children in my yard
The fruit on trees, fertile soil, spring well
Library, artwork, family hymns, that's right
I'm so committed, hit it
Puff and bubble and blow
UF, H2, XOX, or Hall and O
B-boys want to take up the whole dance floor
Like they showing something that we never seen before
That's pure shit bull, ain't no good
Triple X triple plat, knock on wood
Lived on, mixed on, fixed on, hood
Niggas always can't won't don't but should
How can we protect what's good
Die for the message I will and would
Big Bad Spankrock, Big Bad Spankrock
Rap like a rap nigga should...

These hipsters think they slick
Let the drum put the rhythm in your hip
Bitch chill with that you know I'm too cool for that sugar
Shake that nasty shit
I got soul, let me know if you want some
Oh these hoes don't want none
They just want to ride it, can't deny it
Banging their back to the kick drum, figure
Don't start none won't be none nigga
Don't fall for that black, snap the bigger picture
Come back to my lair
Strip down to your underwear
Let yourself go

[talking]
Come here and act like you're all cool and shit
Think you're all cool and shit
I wouldn't be so sure about that nigga
Spank Rock
