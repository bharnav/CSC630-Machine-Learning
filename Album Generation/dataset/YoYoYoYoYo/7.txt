I've got that chilly will
Let's get some Baltimore beats
Swing down round to the hill
Ghetto blasting ten speeds
This life up north got thrills
But few are focused like me
So let's go do it to the ill face hum
Night life with the night life flowin
Ass drop low to the beat that's goin
That sounds nice we already did it twice
But we still got to make it to three
I don't think you should have worn them shoes
Not round here cause right here we get loose
Imagine going back to the slums and bumpin some stones over djembe drums, come on

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
Until the sun rise twice with all the chalk I got
They got damn chasin cops in the parking lot
Thought they got the best of s dot rock
Ess-scape I'm stoned and stopped
With cold buds, watch us watch when I'm in a million
If you're willin to feelin you can cease to chillin and consume a new villain

Bumping some stones
Bumping some stones
Bumping some stones
Bumping some stones
Over djembe drums
