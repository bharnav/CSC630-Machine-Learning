Bump, gangster

[Refrain]
Honey, honey see me
Behind my Gameboy, I got game girl it comes easy
Let go your shoulders
My popsicle is so sweet, see
Slam back that sparks
Don't hesitate and you'll believe me
Ya bitch believe me, ya
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump

Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Hey there you go, there you go, we're fine by

[Interlude]
Bump, too much rump in the trunk
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump
Itâ€˜s rainin' it's pouring, the typical girls ain't snoring
Bump-Bump, typical
Bump-Bump, bump-bump
Rump in the trunk
Bump-Bump, bump, bump-bump
Rump in the trunk, typical
Rump in the trunk

[Verse 1]
Now mingle, shake from every angles
Regroup the hood, gonna start by the spangle
Like Kama Sutra, I hit from every angle
Free to speak but first cause your thoughts untangled
What's the look why your face all menaced
Let me to stand still
But your whole crew's tangles
Cut them off shangle, dangle
Fuck you, get me, got it, got it
It comes straight from the hood
Critique my music
Call it pop/rap/rock/funk/fusion
It's too confusin'
I do what I like
So the little pop tight
We used to call it Spank Rock, right from the middle
That's right Spank Rock
From the bottom, to the middle, to the middle, to the top
The hottest mother fucker in the whole damn block
Do my thing and the girls watch

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Hell you can date me, take me down to the picture show
Lets rock, yo and I'd even let you hold my hand so the whole damn world can know
If you have more of my time we can wind
To the grand old rock and roll
Things get better yet
Two-step to the dipset
Let me know when you're ready to go
I just be here with my feet up free
Rollin' this weed up, me and my martini ain't changin'
We just stayin' the same man and while you spritzin' and teasin'
I'll just catch up on my readin'
Fresh offa work, button down shirt
Bad ass mother fuckin' cool jerk

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Amanda Blank]
Hey yo, it's me and Spank Rock
We always poppin' it hot
He gets the ladies in line, I got you ridin' my jock
I keep it dirty, not like Fergie ain't the Black Eyed Peas
This shit ain't happy, I'm a trashy, boastful bitch MC
My rhymes are painful and fresh, my pussy's tastin' the best
I'm face scratchin' weave snatchin'
If you're ready to step
Cause I'm a throw down kinda bitch, I don't play around
See I cut the fuck up and I knock the fuck down
Pussy power's got my back, they all over the place
You can't get it so you sweat it, we keep that shit laced
Two one five triple eight, we never sleep it on the beat
Can't help it if we roll, we get the players in heat
My get 'em girls, take it, take it grab your man up like a thief
My get 'em girls, hate it, hate it grip your bitches on a leash
My get 'em girls, shake it, shake it break it like a dime piece
My get 'em girls, fake it, fake it if that dick ain't sweet
See I roll my Dutch thick, I can spit my verse quick
Don't trip for this Philly shit, we keeping' it sick
We got the fly buy
I'm on the hustle and grind
And if you get us at the right time
You get it from behind
In just Chanel pumps, throw my legs up
And if you ready you can get it anytime you want
I'm the midnight dropper, I'm the body rockin' rocker
Workin' tight all night
An Yo I'm never getting tired
Just a dirty little grin when you dig it dig it in
Have you switch us like a stripper, when you stickin' it in
Track your system when we kissin'
Flippin' dick in when you dippin'
Lick your lips and I be drippin'
Think my shit is straight addictin'
Or in the bathroom break you off in the bed
Thigh squeezin', pussy teasin' cock, rockin' you head
See I like my ass sassy, I keep my man happy
Cause I ride like Kelly Bundy, yo I keep that shit, nasty
Nasty

Typical
