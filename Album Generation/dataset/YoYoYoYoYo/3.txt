I'm that, new arrival (Rick Rubin, Rick Rubin, Rick Rubin, Rick Rubin)
You're the key to my species survival (Rick Rubin, Rick Rubin)

I'm that, rebel musician
Putting stale MC's out of commission
I'm that, new tradition
Now that you're in tune with my position
I'm that, rebel musician
Putting stale MC's out of commission
I'm that, new tradition
Now that you're in tune with my position

So, is it some good shit
Is it just not slick
Is it off key, is it just too hip
Well is it, too funky for your regular riffs
Is it the very reason that you're on my dick
Well is it, is it rocking
Is it simply shocking
Is it done too well, now you're locked and watching
Is it awfully gnarly, hops and barley
Ooh child who are we, darkly sorry
Is it not enough, is it just too much
Is it out of touch, or is it the touch
Is it that creation you've been patiently waiting for
Bloody as fuck raw, soulfully hardcore
Does it get you moving, is it too confusing
Am I losing you with these theories I'm proving
Is it...

I hope you didn't think that I was shucking around
I bet you ain't nobody trying to fuck with me now
I'm trying to ensure I'm ruling this town
Like Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike, I hope you're cooling it now
Rappers act like we owe them something these days
Thinking they're legendary when they're merely a craze
Tell mothers not to worry because it's simply a phase
Like baseball card collecting or fright on stage
Might just raise a fist to ignite this rage
Extend the devil horns to engage
In an insane exchange, lines from this brain
Jolt into your system like some raw cocaine
Slain tracks and leave them hanging like a runaway slave
For young eyes to gaze, a permanent image to raise them
In my foot steps, revolutionaries to hood rats
Hand clap, don't hold back cause I rock that
