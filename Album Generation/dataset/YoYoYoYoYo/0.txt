[Yeah, yeah, bang it, bitch]

Ass shakin' competition champ
Oooh, that pussy gets damp
Bump bump bump hump back, fuck that
Bump that bump that amp

(Ass shakin' competition champ
Oooh that pussy gets damp
Bump bump bump bump that bump that
Bump that bump that amp)

[Hook [x3]]
Banging 'til the bells stop ringing
Strip the angel of its wings
Slip into some real bad things
Let's get into some real bad things


[Verse]
(Alright, you can turn me up a little bit)
Back-backyard Betty blowin' everybody's minds
She can make a star out of that behind
Betty's bad, ass and boobs
Talks all the jive in her interviews
Whoa now suck better wait your turn
She got stock in her box to make your pockets turn
She drives fast cars to the bars
We all try to hit but never make it far
In her stilletos and pantyhose
I step to the bitch professional
I tapped the ho and gave it a go
She said I was way too fast
She went out of control
Shocked and amazed when she took the stage
She dipped and swayed as the music plays
Shook that thing that her momma gave
And twerked all the fine pussy to an early grave

She was the ass shakin' competition champ
Oooh that pussy gets damp
Hump back hump back tramp
Fuck that, fuck that
Bump that, bump that amp

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang [x3]

Hook [x3]

Back-backyard Betty blowin' everybody's minds
She can make a star out of that behind  [x2]

Back-backyard Betty blowin' everybody's minds
Shaking ass and boobs  [x2]

I'd tap the ho
I'd tap the ho
Tap the ho
I'd tap the ho
