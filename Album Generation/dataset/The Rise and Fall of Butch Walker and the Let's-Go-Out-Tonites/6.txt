I can only keep this feeling for a minute
Can only stare at a polaroid so long
Before the chromofilm blurs and the smiles
On our faces are gone
I crossed a line 5 yrs in the making
That the biggest eraser can't clear
And i'm rewinding everytime
I whispered that in your ear
As i laid on you
And your naked body
Looked just like i wanted it to
And i wanna be the inspiration
For your room going silent
I wanna feel you erupt
When i play your song
I wanna move you to tears when i say
Its over.. goodnight
And the rest of your life
I get mad at myself for not acting myself
I get jealous at the thought of you out
I don't want you to think that its all that i'm
Thinking about
But goddamn i do
And everytime that i hear someone laugh
It sounds just like you
