I got a girl that lives at the mall
She dances on the dark side of the disco ball
Drives a silver mercedes
Made in the 80s
Swears and stares at the buckhead ladies
She straddles me lovely
While she scratches my back
While she sings all the words
To my hidden tracks
From my heart of a record, far as i can tell
Sounds like heaven and feels good as hell
B-b-b-b-baby yer so hot
Ya g-g-g-g-g-give me everything i got
C-c-c-c-c-c-can ya tell me how to not
Love a hot girl in a good mood
Back before i ever even knew how you felt
When i was just a teenage bullet belt
Making really heavy music
In a bandana band
Playing spring break parties
In the redneck sand
Your lips are like a work of art..
God i wanna tear them apart..
