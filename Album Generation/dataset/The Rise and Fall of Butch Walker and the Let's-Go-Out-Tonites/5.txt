[Verse 1]
Well, I tripped and I fell
Into a hole I know so well
And I don't think I'll be leaving for a while

And this lump beneath my skin
Is a hole I let you in
All it took was took was just your red lip-biting smile

[Chorus]
And damn, damn, damn I love you
Like the stars that shine above you
Like the ground that you're laying on while looking up at me

[Verse 2]
[?] thoughts till they bled
Cause I love the taste of red
And you're stuck inside me like a splinter does

Drawing words on your back
Spelling you my heart attack
Cause your naked body glistens in the sun

[Chorus]
And damn, damn, damn I love you
Like the stars that shine above you
Like the ground that you're laying on while looking up at me

And oh, good god, I need this
Just a chance to show your weakness
So I can come inside of your kiss and just leave you on your knees

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Damn, damn, damn I love you
Like the stars that shine above you
Like the ground that you're laying on while looking up at me

And oh, good god, I need this
Just a chance to show your weakness
So I can come inside of your kiss and just leave you on your knees

[Outro]
Woo-ooo (X6)
