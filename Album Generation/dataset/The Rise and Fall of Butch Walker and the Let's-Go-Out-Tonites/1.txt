Hey little party girl
Where do you wanna go?
I didn't come from your scene
So many people I should know

Like every door guy in this city
Only lets you in 'cause you're pretty
And the boutique girls and theme night druggies
Take you in the back

(You put your head on the mirror)

And ooooh, baby keeps it with her
Ooh, baby's got a hand full
Of things she calls excuses
You're real, pretty, pretty
You're pretty strung out for a girl

Maybe there's a gas station open
And a little money on my card
So I can buy some half and half
'Cause even mornings they seem so hard

And look at you, you never fell to bed
You're still typing on your phone
With your cigarette
Saying I should stop being so cynical
'Cause we're hotter when we don't give a damn

(So smash your head on the mirror)

And ooooh, baby keeps it with her
Ooh, baby's got a purse full
Of things she calls excuses
You're real, pretty, pretty
You're pretty strung out for a girl
