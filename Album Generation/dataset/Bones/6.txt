Got my head out of the window
I can taste the summer air
Hangs heavy with the promise of nights beyond compare
We start we stop we break and then we mend
What's a little bit of blood loss between friends

You say you don't need love
I say you ain't so tough
Come on and let me in

Brother in arms
Together we
Spill our blood
On foreign streets
Worlds apart
And in too deep
My brother in arms
I wouldn't change a thing

We celebrate our sickness as it starts to spread
Cut my heart out it's not over until you take my head

You say you don't need love
I say you ain't so tough
Come on and let me in

Brother in arms
Together we
Spill our blood
On foreign streets
Worlds apart
And in too deep
My brother in arms
I wouldn't change a thing

All hands on deck we live or die
Together
No matter
How far we fall apart
We bleed together

My brother in arms
Together we
Spill our blood
On foreign streets

Brother in arms
Together we
Spill our blood
On foreign streets
Worlds apart
And in too deep
My brother in arms
I wouldn't change a thing
