[Verse 1]
Down under the night sky I lay in wait
Praying to whoever will listen to me
I'd fashioned my own cross
Been crushed by its weight
There's no stronger message
Than dirt in your face

[Chorus]
I've seen down the end of the road
I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones, bones [x2]

I'll do this on my own, own, own, own
Bones, bones

[Verse 2]
They say the spirit's willing
But the flesh is always weak
I found everything I needed
Right beneath my skin, oh

[Chorus]

I'll do this on my own

We're all architects of our own private hell
No one can hurt us like we've hurt ourselves

[Chorus]

I know I'm not alone
