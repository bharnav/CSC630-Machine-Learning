Lonely, lonely
Undefined
You say you take your time
I say you hide away
Lonely lonely
Hard to shine when they don't notice you at all
Sink further every day

You're only  so lonely
And i never had a doubt
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd
You're only
Lonely so lonely
Like everybody else

Lonely lonely
Little fly
You say they pay no mind
I say there's no better way
You hang yourself in your web
Drawn and quartered out
The more you hurt
The more you heal
The more you'll figure out

You're only  so lonely
And i never had a doubt
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd
You're only
Lonely so lonely
Like everybody else

You are not a diamond
You are not a shining star
Doesn't mean that you're not perfect
Exactly as you are

You're only  so lonely
And i never had a doubt
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd
You're only
Lonely so lonely
Like everybody else
