I had a conversation with a dying man
He said son make sure you live while you still can
Thought I could write down the rules of war and
I could swim the seas
He said boy
Oh you know not what you have

Now I lay on my bed waiting
Those words resound in my head
Well I remember he told me
You'll see when everything ends

I had a conversation with a dying man
Said life passes by in the blink of an eye
The gold will rust
And empires will follow
Swallowed by the sea
Do you sleep sound?
Well enjoy it while you can

Now I lay on my bed waiting
Those words resound in my head
Well I remember he told me
You'll see when everything ends

Everything ends
Everything ends
Everything ends

Here I lie
Falling asleep on my death bed
And i don't think they're worthless
Anymore

Now I lay on my bed waiting
I was too proud to listen
Now I remember he told me
You'll see when everything ends

I had a conversation with a dying man
He said son make sure you live while you still can
