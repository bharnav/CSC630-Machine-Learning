Hello again
My dear old friend
Is it that time again?
Is this the end?
The beat goes on and on
With such sweet grace
But I'm just out of time
I'm out of place

I found rebellion in self destruction

I need to find a place to lay my head


I walk then I crawl
I'm thankful to be moving at all
Considering all the places
I've been on the way
Some people build towers
I just dig holes
On my way down again

Hey
On my back in the gutter and i've seen this place before
How
Do you make it look so easy when the wolves are at the door?
Contrition is
A bed fellow of mine
In my defence
I'm wasted
The beat goes on and on and on
I couldn't stop it even if I tried

I found rebellion in self destruction

I need to find a place to lay my head

I walk then I crawl
I'm thankful to be moving at all
Considering all the places
I've been on the way
Some people build towers
I just dig holes
On my way down again

I walk then I crawl
I'm thankful to be moving at all
Considering all the places
I've been on the way
I walk then I crawl
I'm thankful to be moving at all
Considering all the places
I've been on the way
