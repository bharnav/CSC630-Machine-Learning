I
Am a wavering candle light
I remain but I’m ever slight
Through all my years
I sit
In my room in the fading light
Righting back all my wrongs tonight
Cos I’m still here
_
Boarded up all the doors
And I swallowed all the keys
I’m still haunted by
All the things I’ll never be

To live
Is to learn
Oh the heart’s a heavy burden
So I take
I don’t wait
Nothing ever is for certain
And I hold my hands up high
On my knees tonight
I’ll take
Won’t wait
I will live and learn my lesson here tonight
_
I
Never knew it could be so cold
But I burnt all the things I used to hold so dear
Still I fight
With my pen in my hand held tight
Writing protest songs tonight cos I’m still here
_
Boarded up all the doors
And I swallowed all the keys
I’m still haunted by
All the things I’ll never be
_
To live
Is to learn
Oh the heart’s a heavy burden
So I take
I don’t wait
Nothing ever is for certain
And I hold my hands up high
On my knees tonight
I’ll take
Won’t wait
I will live and learn my lesson here tonight

I’ll get off my knees and fight
Kick down the doors let in the light tonight
Tonight
