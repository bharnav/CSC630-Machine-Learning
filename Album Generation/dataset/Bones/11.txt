I used to hear the melody
The voice of the unknown
The rhythm in the rain
Beating down my window
Now it's clear to me
And I can see
Through each and every pane
That I grew up
And I forgot
How to feel that way again

I've been lost by the city
Drowned by the sea
I've been up on the rooftops
Still i'm caving in
You can scream bloody murder
Loud as you want
I'm not listening now

Sing me something
To bring me down
Cos I can't find anything
Like that sound
I don't need it any more
I left my heart back in the broad fields

Used to look between the fences
My hands out to the breeze
I swore that I would understand
The whispers in the trees

But the older I got
The more I found I lost
Now i'm run through with rot
Covered in frost
I have wandered so long
And now that i'm here
I just want to go home

Sing me something
To bring me down
Cos I can't find anything
Like that sound
I don't need it any more
I left my heart back in the broad fields

Rain ,rain, rain
Carry me home
Wash away the pain, blame, shame
That i've come to know

Rain ,rain, rain
Carry me home
Wash away the pain, blame, shame
That i've come to know

I think that it's time
Yes I think that it's time
That I went home
