OH DUST AND BONES
THAT I HAVE LEFT BEHIND
ARE MONUMENTS TO THOSE I USED TO KNOW
AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE I AM ON MY OWN

I WANNA BE THE LAST THING THAT YOU SEE
BE MY DEARLY DEPARTED
BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE THE ONLY THING
I NEED
BEFORE I GAVE UP
MY DEARLY DEPARTED
GAVE UP
MY DEARLY DEPARTED

YOUR STICKS AND STONES
ARE ALL THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN
I'M BRUISED BUT I'M NOT BROKEN AND I KNOW
AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE I AM ON MY OWN

NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO COULD MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY
I'LL GLADLY DO MY TIME
I FOUND YOU
UNBOUND YOU
AND TRIED TO
EXPLAIN THE ONLY WAY
THAT I KNEW HOW TO SAY

I WANNA BE THE LAST THING THAT YOU SEE
BE MY DEARLY DEPARTED
BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE THE ONLY THING
I NEED
BEFORE I GAVE UP
MY DEARLY DEPARTED
