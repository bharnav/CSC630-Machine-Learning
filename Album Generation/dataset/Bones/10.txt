Yeah I need meaning
As much as I need air to fill these old lungs of mine
I didn't notice but i've been holding my breath as long as I've been alive
The spots behind my eyes they glitter in the dark
As they get closer they illuminate their mark

Everybody stares
Into the headlights bearing down
But we don't care
Standing in the glare
We didn't see them coming
Headlights closing in

Everybody stares

Through my fingers everything was
Monotone and weak
Now all the colour brings me too my knees
I was so afraid of repeating myself
That I never said anything at all

The spots behind my eyes they glitter in the dark
As they get closer they illuminate their mark

Everybody stares
Into the headlights bearing down
But we don't care
Standing in the glare
We didn't see them coming
Headlights closing in

I found you
You give me meaning
In everything you do
I found you
Now I've discovered
What I have got to do

I'm broken and I'm bruised
I'm beaten black and blue
Split at the seams
But so
Are you

I you take me as I am
Bitter and bland
I'd face the headlights
Side by side
With you
