Hear me, O' Thou that lieth dead but ever dreameth... Hear me, Lord of Dreams!
The Deep Ones knoweth Thy secret name, the Hydra knoweth Thy lair...
Dagon shall break Thy accursed bonds, and Thy kingdom shall rise once more."

Rise o' spawn of Chaos and elder night
With these words, I summon thee
Slumbering serpent, primal and serene
Great Old One, hearken to me!

Great Old One, hearken to me
Kutulu Fhtagn

When the stars align in the Chaosphere, then the time of awakening shall be at hand

"When death dies, Thy time shall be, and Thou shalt sleep no more..."
"Hear me, Lord of Dreams". "Hear, thy servant calleth thee."
In Thy tower they have sealed ye, dead yet ever dreaming
O' great Lord of the Deep, awaken from thy deathly sleep

And there fell a great star from the heavens burning
Older than the Sphinx or Babylon
O' mighty one, lord and master of the great abyss!
Cthulhu Fhtagn

Rise o' spawn of Chaos and elder night
With these words, I summon thee
Slumbering serpent, primal and serene
Great Old One, hearken to me!

Kutulu Atsu
Kutulu Normaddahu
Kutulu Atsu
Kutulu Normaddahu
Kululu, Kutulu Normaddahu
Kutulu, Kutulu Normaddahu

"Give forth Thy sign that I may know Thy will upon the earth..."
"Grant me the power to still the waves that I may hear Thy call."

"Hear me, Lord of Dreams". "Hear, thy servant calleth thee."
O' great Lords of the Deep, awaken from thy deathly sleep

In Thy tower they have sealed ye, dead yet ever dreaming
Kutulu, Kutulu Fhtagn

O great Lords of the Deep, awaken from thy deathly sleep
Kutulu, Kutulu Fhtagn

Rise O lord of the abyss

"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."
"Yet he shall rise, and His kingdom shall cover the earth!"
