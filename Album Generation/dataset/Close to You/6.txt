It's not the way you smile
That touches my heart
It's not the way you kiss
That tears me apart

Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home I cry over you

What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you

You should hear
What they say about you
They say you've never
Never, never been true

It doesn't matter what they say
I'm going to love you any old way

What can I do?
When it's true
Don't want nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you

Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home I cry over you

What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you
