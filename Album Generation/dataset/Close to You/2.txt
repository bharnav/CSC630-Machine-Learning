Maybe it's you, maybe it's me
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea
Maybe it's just that I have never been the kind
Who can pass a lucky penny by

Maybe it's wise, maybe it's not
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I forgot
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around?

Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me

Couldn't we stay or must we go?
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Only a fool

Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around?

Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me, love for me

Couldn't we stay or must we go?
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Only a fool
