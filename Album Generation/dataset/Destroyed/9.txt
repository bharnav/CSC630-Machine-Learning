[Intro]
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone

[Verse 1]
Stop the hands before they seem
To take us up to where we've been
You see the leaves are falling down
On the stones we walked upon
Watch the city fall away
Then it's born to rise again
My blue moon will fall soon
Over loss and lover then

[Chorus]
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone

[Verse 2]
Come take these things away
Help me up, the skies are grey
Blue moons are falling now
Through all the years we wondered how

[Chorus]
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
Oh my blue moon
I see it soon
Oh my blue moon and I promise you
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
