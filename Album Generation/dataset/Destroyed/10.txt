[Verse 1]
One day I know
Going to leave this all
Reach off to heaven
Lights flying across my eyes
Oh it seems like
This could be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on
It's time I do the right thing
Oh baby
Baby, gonna do the right thing

[Chorus 1]
One day I know
Going to leave this all alone
Going to leave this
Leave this all to heaven

One day I know
Going to leave this all alone
Going to leave this
Leave this all to heaven

[Verse 2]
Oh no
No life to live
Going to leave this
Leave this all for heaven

[Chorus 1]
One day I know
Going to leave it all alone
Going to leave this
Leave this all to heaven

[Chorus 2]
Oh Lord, save me
I want to do the right thing
Oh it's time

Oh Lord, save me
I want to do the right thing
Oh it's time

Oh Lord, save me
I want to do the right thing
Oh it's time

Oh Lord, save me
I want to do the right thing
Oh it's time

[Outro]
I want to do the right thing
This time
I want to do the right thing
