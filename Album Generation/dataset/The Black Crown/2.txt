We are violence
We are violence, at its finest
Human violence at its finest

We are the breed that grew with violence as a seed
Growing stronger with our roots destructive feeding power
Growing older and living as a slave, now we're vengeful and war is what we
All crave
And I know exactly what this is! More!
Human violence at its finest and I want more
Human violence at its finest! More!
Human violence at its finest and I want more!

So this is what you do...
So take your precious time and pick your enemy
Then you take the time to put them down on their knees
Now take a second look into their worthless eyes
Now pull the trigger back, click, surprise! Surprise!

We are the breed that grew with violence as a seed
Growing stronger with our roots destructive feeding power
Growing older and living as a slave, now we're vengeful and war is what we
Create
And I know exactly what this is! More!
Human violence at its finest, and I want more
Human violence at its finest! More!
Human violence at its finest and we want more!

Make sure you take the time... to put them down on their knees...
Make sure take the time and listen to them beg and plea
We are violence at its finest!

So take your precious time and pick your enemy
Then you take the time to put them down on their knees
Now take a second look into their worthless eyes
Now pull the trigger back, click, surprise!
Now you are the victim of, MY! My two hands!
Now you are the victim of more violent circumstance

We are violence

Now put them down on their knees, don't listen to all their begs and their
Pleas
Put your finger on the trigger, now all you do is squeeze
And peace the fuck out!
So put them down on their knees, don't listen to the begs and their pleas
Put your finger on the trigger, now all you do is squeeze

And now you're happy, as happy as can be, you're so very happy with
Everything you see
It all means nothing to me, human violence at its finest
Fuck you I want more!
