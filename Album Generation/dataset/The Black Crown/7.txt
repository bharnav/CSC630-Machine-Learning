This is my perception of what's going on
This is my perception of what's going wrong
With mind separation, as you float to the sun
With a psychedelic sidekick that's sparking in your mind
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it just fine

You're a crossed-eyed catastrophe, fumbling
Bumbling into the wall you see
And I'm here to watch you fall
I'm here to get you through this all

Confronting your demons and thoughts you've never had before

Intricate thinking, and thoughts you've never had before
This is what happens when you open that door, you're dwelling so
Deeply passed out on the floor, yeah!
Cross-eyed catastrophe , seeing things you've never seen before
You're passed out chasing the dream
Wake up and I'll decipher everything!

Confronting your demons and thoughts you've never had before

I watched you feel so good, you looked amazed
I watched you eyes get heavy and start to glaze

Cross-eyed catastrophe
Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before
You're passed out chasing the dream
Wake up and I'll decipher everything!
So meet your demons, they're here to stay
Meet your demons, they'll never go away

Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before
You're passed out chasing the dream
Wake up and I will help you decipher everything!
So meet your demons, they're here to stay
Meet your demons, they'll never go away

Ohhh!

So meet your demons, they're here to stay
Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before
You're passed out chasing the dream
Wake up and I'll help you decipher everything!
