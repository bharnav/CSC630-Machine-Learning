[Verse 1]
I'm still scared
Afraid of failing, anticipating
The ride to end
Before the wheels begin to move

[Chorus]
Run away, so I can hide
Run away, I've mastered feeling nothing
Run away, I'm dead inside
Run away, why don't I care?

[Verse 2]
Waste my time
Commiserating, self-medicating
It's my design
Although I know you don't approve

[Chorus]
Run away, so I can hide
Run away, I've mastered feeling nothing
Run away, I'm dead inside
Run away, why don't I care?

[Bridge]
The truth is that I'm not so good
At showing how I feel
Or keeping my mouth shut
When there's something to conceal
Or knowing how to love
Love's not in my memories
How can I rise above
All my insecurities

[Chorus]
Run away, so I can hide
Run away, I've mastered feeling nothing
Run away, I'm dead inside
Run away, why don't I care?

[Outro]
Run away, I fight the tide
Run away, the ebb and flow consuming
Run away, still by my side
Run away, why should you care?
