[Verse 1]
I am afraid, afraid of the truth
In the mirror staring back at you
The image is cracked, but so is the view, yeah
And the strength of a tree begins in the roots
That I tend to bury into you
At least now the storm can't blow me away

[Chorus]
So crawl inside
My head with me
I'll show you how
It feels to be
To blame like me

[Verse 2]
Should I be afraid, of this face that I see
In the mirror staring back at me
So cold were the days, when I listened to you
And you say that I'm weak, so show me the proof
Because I still exist in spite of you
But I won't compete, with you every day

[Chorus]
So crawl inside
My head with me
I'll show you how
It feels to be
To blame like me

[Bridge]
Schizophrenic conversations
That I'm always having with myself
I hear these voices in my head repeating
Maybe I could use a little help
I still have schizophrenic conversations
When there's no one else around to hear
And I long for solitude and peace within me
Void of all the anger and the fear

[Outro]
So crawl inside
My head with me
And I'll show you how
It feels to be
Fucked up like me
I'll show how it feels to be
To blame like me
Ashamed like me
