[Verse 1]
I can't believe, how far I've come
Now watch me stumble, and come undone
If you take away, these memories
Then all that's left, is just me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this
Anymore

[Verse 2]
So you choose, to break my heart
I should have seen this, from the start
I'm haunted by, your apathy
All that's left, is killing me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this
Anymore

[Bridge]
Do you believe, that the way you choose to be
I've always had to see, the brighter side of this so I don't lose my faith
Now the sun has gone away, it's getting colder every day
So before I freeze to death there's something I should say

[Chorus]
I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this
And though you say you understand
You still won't face this
Can't erase this
I won't embrace this
Anymore
