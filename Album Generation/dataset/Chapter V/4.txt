[Verse 1]
You, in your shell
Are you waiting for someone to rescue
You, from yourself
Don't be disappointed when no one comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't blame me you didn't get it
Don't blame me you didn't get it
Don't blame me you didn't get it

[Chorus]
I already told you that falling is easy
It's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
If you don't believe you can find a way out
You've become the problem, become the problem

[Verse 2]
You, all alone
Are you waiting for someone to make you whole?
Can't you see?
Aren't you tired of this dysfunctional routine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't blame me you didn't get it
Don't blame me you didn't get it
Don't blame me you didn't get it

[Chorus]
I already told you that falling is easy
It's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
If you don't believe you can find a way out
You've become the problem, become the problem

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I already told you that falling is easy
It's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
If you don't believe you can find a way out
You've become the problem, become the problem

[Outro]
Falling is easy
It's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
And if you believe you can find a way out
Then you've solved the problem, you've solved your problem
