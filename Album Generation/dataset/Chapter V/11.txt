[Verse 1]
I have seen
Too many sad eyes look at me
The eyes that set me free
All the places that I've been

[Chorus]
Thank you for, the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for, the times you chose to stand out in the rain
And wait
For me... for me

[Verse 2]
Your words
Your words help me to see
A little honesty
In a world that doesn't share

[Verse 3]
And your eyes
Tell the story of your pain
Severity of your disdain
In a world that doesn't care

[Chorus]
So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for, the times you chose to stand out in the rain
And wait

[Verse 4]
You
You understand my pain
From this I gather strength
In that we are the same

[Chorus]
So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for, the times you chose to stand out in the rain
And wait

[Outro]
The life I live would never be the same without you here
You here
You here
Without you here
