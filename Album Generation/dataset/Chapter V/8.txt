[Verse 1]
If you just walked away
What could I really say?
And would it matter anyway?
Would it change how you feel?

[Verse 2]
I am the mess you chose
The closet you cannot close
The devil in you I suppose
Because the wounds never heal

[Chorus]
But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn to feel

[Verse 3]
Sometimes the things I say
In moments of disarray
Succumbing to the games we play
To make sure that it's real

[Chorus]
But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn to feel

[Verse 4]
When it's just me and you
Who knows what we could do
If we can just make it through
The toughest part of the day

[Chorus]
But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn how to feel, and we could
Stay here together, and we could
Conquer the world, and we could
Say that forever is more than just a word

[Outro]
If you just walked away
What could I really say?
And would it matter anyway?
It wouldn't change how you feel
