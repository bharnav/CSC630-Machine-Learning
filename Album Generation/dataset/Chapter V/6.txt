[Verse 1]
She sits alone again and tries her best not to pretend
That all she used to live for was a love that wasn't there
And every time she needs to do the things that she believes
Will fill the void inside of her, 'cause he was never there

[Chorus]
And she said
I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil
And she said
I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil

[Verse 2]
He tries to sleep again and wonders when the pain will end
The cuts they may run deeper than his cracking outer shell
He looks with tired eyes at all the people hypnotized
And wonders what can save him from his self-created hell

[Chorus]
And he said
I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil
And she said
I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil

[Verse 3]
I always fantasy, the little things in front of me
The things that mean so much to you, a way to let you know
That I appreciate the way you always tolerate
But sometimes when I medicate, frustration in you shows me how you feel

[Chorus]
But I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil
And I scream
I swear I'm not the devil
Though you think I am
I swear I'm not the devil
