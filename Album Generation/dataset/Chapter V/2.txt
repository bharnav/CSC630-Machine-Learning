[Verse 1]
You take this all for granted
All the things they choose to feed you
By keeping you distracted
Just long enough to bleed you dry

[Hook]
A reason for your anger
It's what I need, it's what I need
To recognize the truth
It's what I need, it's what I need
So burn your paper Jesus
It's what I need, it's what I need
And own the things you do
It's what I need, it's what I need

[Verse 2]
Question what they sell you
All the lies that they are teaching
And they've made a corporation
Out of desperate people's feelings of fear

[Hook]
A reason for your anger
It's what I need, it's what I need
To recognize the truth
It's what I need, it's what I need
So burn your paper Jesus
It's what I need, it's what I need
And own the things you do
It's what I need, it's what I need

[Verse 3]
Somebody chose these words for you
Interpretations of the truth
Somewhere behind your fear they hide
To fill the holes inside
