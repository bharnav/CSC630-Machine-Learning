[Verse 1]
Twisting, turning
Crashing, burning
All this, just to
Break me, down

[Chorus]
You don't know me
You don't see me
You don't own me
'Cause I don't care
But I'm still here
Impatiently waiting
For you to disappear
Is this my cross to bear?

[Verse 2]
Faceless, faking
Pushing, taking
All this, just to
Bring me, down

[Chorus]
You don't know me
You don't see me
You don't own me
'Cause I don't care
But I'm still here
Impatiently waiting
For you to disappear
Is this my cross to bear?

[Chorus]
You don't know me
You don't own me
'Cause I'm aware
And I'm still here
Impatiently waiting
For you to disappear
Is this my cross to bear?

[Outro]
I'm still here
Reluctantly waiting
For you to interfere
This is my cross to bear
