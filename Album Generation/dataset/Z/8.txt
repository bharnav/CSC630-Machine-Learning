[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, can't you see that I'm smiling?
Can't you see there's a part of me that's brand new?
Used to be was a part of me felt like hiding
But now it comes through

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart
That's where the knot comes loose
Deep in my heart
I will remember you

[Verse 2]
All my lovely life I been waiting
Hot heels anticipating
Another love I found
Not to let it down, down

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart
That's where the knot comes loose
Deep in my heart
I will remember you

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, can't you see that I'm smiling?
Can't you see there's a part of me that's brand new?
Used to be was a part of me felt like hiding
But now it comes through

Now it comes through, comes through to you
