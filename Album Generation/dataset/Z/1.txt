[Verse 1]
Who could see and not believe
The heart that beats the wavelength
And who could say but never do
Things they've said to someone who
Through all that's been and all will be
So, in line so thoughtfully

[Hook]
In tune with you
So in time for me
New thoughts arrive
So in time for me

[Verse 2]
Who can count the time I'm beating with my hands?
Who can stop the smoke from breathing in my head?
Words will come and words will go
Make believe and overthrow
Just believe and you can do
You know my heart, it beats for you

[Hook]
It beats for you, oh
So in time, we beat
Your thoughts align
So in time with me
