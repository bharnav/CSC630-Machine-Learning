[Verse 1]
Gideon, what have you told us at all?
Make a sound, come down off the wall
Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young
Who are you? What have you become?

[Chorus]
Animal, come on
What does this remind you of?

[Verse 2]
Truly, truly we have become
Hated and feared for something we don't want
Listen, listen
Most of us believe that this is wrong

[Chorus]
Animal, come on
What does this remind you of?

What does this remind you of?
Animal, come on
