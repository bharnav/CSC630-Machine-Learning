[Verse 1]
He was leading us through the dark
He was saying that love goes on
I was wanting some ice cream
He knew exactly what I meant

[Verse 2]
From the driver's seat in the dark
He popped a tape in the dash of his car
And when the singer started to scream
I knew exactly what he meant

[Chorus]
I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
What a sensible man he was
What a wonderful man he was
I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
What a sensuous man he was
What a wonderful man he was

[Bridge]
Why do we love what is wrong?
Big devil told us to sing along
And like a loving flock we obey
Except him, he went his own way

[Outro]
I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
'Til the day I found out his cause
Was to do it for all of us
