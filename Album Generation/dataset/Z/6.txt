[Verse 1]
Is this climbing up to the moon?
Or is it bailing out too soon?
I hope we didn't, I hope we didn't wait too long
I hope we didn't, I hope we didn't wait too long

[Hook]
All that I wanted to say
Words only got in the way
But then I found another way
To communicate

[Verse 2]
Is this climbing up to the moon?
Or is it fading out too soon?
Oh, I know we didn't, I know we didn't wait too long
Cause any time's a good time to move on

[Hook]
Things I could say to myself
I could never say to anyone else
But what Madonna said really helped
She said, "Boy, you better learn to express yourself"

[Verse 3]
I know we didn't, I know we didn't wait too long
Cause any time's a good time to move on
