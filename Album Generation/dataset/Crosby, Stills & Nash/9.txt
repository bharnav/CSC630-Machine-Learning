Forty Nine reasons all in a line
All of them good ones
All of them lies
Driftin' with my lady
We're oldest of friends
Need a little work, and there's fences to mend

Steady girl, be my world
`Till the drifter come, now she's gone
I let that man play his hand
I let them go, how was I to know?
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please

Now it's over, they left in the spring
Her and the drifter, looking for beautiful things

Steady girl, be my world
`Till the drifter come, now she's gone
I let that man play his hand
I let them go, how was I to know?
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please

On my knees
Feeling wrong
Mama's gone
Bye bye baby

Write if you think of it, maybe
Know I love you (Know I love you)
Go if it means that much to you
Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong before too long it's crazy
And you're trapped, babe
And you know that's not where it's at, babe
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady

Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you
Who do you love?
Time will tell us
Who is trying to sell us
Bye, bye, baby
Write if you think of it, maybe
Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong, before too long, it's crazy
And you're trapped babe
And you know that's not where it's at baby
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady

Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you
Who do you love?
