I have kissed you
So I'll miss you
On the road I'll be wantin' you

But I have you
'Cause I love you
And you have me 'cause you love me too, yeah

Felt forsaken
You'll awaken
To the joys of livin' hand in glove

And then I will
Lend you my will
And your days will be filled with love

Don't run the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches

Felt rejected
As expected
You rejected all the thoughts of words

So I'll pray with
You to stay with
Me forever and we'll make it work

Elevated
You're elated
'Cause I've waited a year for you

If you're thinkin'
What I'm thinkin'
Then I'm gonna make my love to you

Don't run the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches
