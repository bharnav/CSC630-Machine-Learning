Its breaking in me
Its needless to say
(Now this part is done
When did I go wrong)
You're starting to fade
You're falling away
(Leave me standing still
On this windowsill)
And I'll make believe that its ok

If I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your mine
When I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your trying

It's needless to say
Your walking away
(why can't we rewind
What's been left behind)
I'm starting to fade
I'm running away
(Have you feelings gone

To another one)
And I make believe that its ok

If I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your mine
When I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your trying

When I find out
Where your minds at

If I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your mine
When I find out
Where your minds at
It can make me believe that your trying

You're starting to fade, you're falling away
(have your feelings gone to another one)
You're starting to fade you're falling away
