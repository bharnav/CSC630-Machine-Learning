Seasons change
And you remain to find me here
A parting gift
You woke me to how I can feel
Cause its in your hands I heal

Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin
Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin

So say the words
Say the words I want to hear
Oh yeah
Cause I've the faith
Even if my bloods unclear
I've no more desire to fear

Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin

Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin

I love it when you say and maybe
I love it when you make me crazy
I love it when you say and maybe
I love it when you make me crazy

Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin
Where the hell you been?
Wish I'd met you then Let you in
Lovers Start as friends hope this never ends
Lets begin
Ohh yeah yeah
Lets begin

I love it when you say and maybe
I love it when you make me crazy
I love it when you say and maybe
I love it when you make me crazy
