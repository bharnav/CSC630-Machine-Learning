It's exciting
In the beginning
The first four weeks
When you f*ck five times a day

But something happens
It all starts slipping
You chew off your own arm
Just to get away

It's not you
And it's not me
I'd rather play Halo on my t.v
It's no defence but it's all I've got to say

Well Tommy got tired of Pamela
Ed got tired of Selma
Puffy got tired of Jlo and Ben did too
Heff gets tired of the playboy girl
Someone's even tired of Miss Nude World
I'm just tired of you

I can remember
In the beginning
When you were Wonder Woman
With a cape
Then something happened
And the walls started closing in
And I would have shot myself just to escape

Its not you
And its not me

We're just not singing in harmony
It's no defence but its all I got to say

Well Tommy got tired of Pamela
Ed got tired of Selma
Puffy got tired of Jlo and Ben did too
Heff gets tired of the playboy girl
Someone's even tired of Miss Nude World
I'm just tired of you

Someday I'll find the one
She'll be my best friend
And make me com-
-plete
She'll love everything that I like to do
And when I find her
I'll take two

(bridge)
Well Tommy got tired of Pamela
Ed got tired of Selma
Puffy got tired of Jlo and Ben did too
Heff gets tired of the playboy girl
Someone's even tired of Miss Nude World
I'm just tired of you

(So tired of you
Tired of)
And I'm just tired of you
(So tired of you , tired of)
And I'm just tired of you
