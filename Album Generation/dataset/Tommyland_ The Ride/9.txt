The last of you is left of me
In my review a memory
A bridge you burned is meant to be
I can't rebuild the rest of me

And I need
Just to see
That's why I'm coming back to

Watch you lose
Cause I'm fighting broke and bruised
And I'm dying from the truth

You left me here hung out to dry
A thousand tears a thousand times
The shit you do is killing me
Since you've misused the best of me

And I need
Just to see
That's why I'm coning back to

Watch you lose cause I'm fighting

Broke and bruised
And I'm dieing from the truth
Oh untie me from your noose

I'll watch you lose
I'll watch you lose
You lose

(break)

Untie me from your noose
Cause I'm fighting broke and bruised
And I'm dieing from the truth
Oh untie me from your noose

Untie the noose
(watch you lose)
Untie the noose
(broke and bruised)
Untie the noose
(watch you lose)
Oh untie me from your noose
