Don't be afraid, I'm here for you
And the audience departed as I gave her heart away from me
I saw the suns expanded view
And I thought I heard the answers but I let 'em slip away from me

Sister Mary innocent lost her way
She stood up on the table, gave it away
Sister Mary innocent all I can say

What's wrong with you is all that's wrong with me

Once those skies, weren't they azure blue?
But the papers always seem to have the ugly things to say, we choose
Oh Jesus, Jesus, we still love you
Just as long as proofs a burden we don't ever have to bear for you

Sister Mary innocent lost her way
She stood up on the table, gave it away
Sister Mary innocent all I can say
What's wrong with you is all that's wrong with me
