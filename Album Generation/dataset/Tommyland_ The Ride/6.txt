I need you
I need so much
I need you
Get me out of this place
I need you
With the lightning this close
I can see
There so much in this world make believe
And this ticking clock isn't for me
And still nobody knew
I need you

I need you in my blacker days
I need you when the walls coming down
I need you
Through this hole in my chest I can feel
That so much in this world isn't real
And there's something that you cannot steal
Tell me what can I do I need you

And the sun would rise
In the jasmine skies
And I'm lying awake in your bed
Sometimes I don't remember
Why can't I forget
I need you

I need you there's so much in this world that is true
No not much I'm not willing to do
I can't be without you
I need you
I need you

I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
