Good Day
This is the english butler for young master Thomas Lee
Unfortunetly he is away presently but I will deliver your messege on my silver platter just as
Soon as I finish picking up all these soaked stockings, garder belts, panties and high heels
The visitors do seem to leave a lot of those behind
He mumbled something about rocking two years on the road with Motley Crue
But it also could of been (beep) two bits of gear on the roof with a shapely broom
You know these pop rock stars today
Anyway at the pop of a champagne cork leave your messege and your humble servant will make sure
That the real mr. rich and famous gets it
Cheers
