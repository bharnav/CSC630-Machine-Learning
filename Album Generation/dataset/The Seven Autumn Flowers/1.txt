Holding you in the morning
Listening to the rhythm of your breathing
Feeling such a need
You're everything to me

Don't worry what people say
Let them gossip, let them guess
No one should feel guilty
For finding happiness
(happiness, ooo...)

We're so fragile at times
Now there's no kissing goodnight
Back to back, lying awake
Instead of putting things right

When silence falls between us
All we do is miss each other
When the touch of lightness leaves us
All we feel's a lack of shelter
(a lack of shelter, ooo...)

But you're not going to lose me
I'm not going anywhere
This is not the beginning of the end

Feeling your fingers on me
Skin touching skin
If a defense is what we need
Look no further than what we're feeling

When I'm thinking of you
I hope that you can feel it
Don't worry what people say
Let them guess, let them gossip
(let them gossip, ooo...)

But you're not going to lose me
I'm not going anywhere
This is not the beginning of the end

Holding you in the morning
Listening to the rhythm of your breathing
