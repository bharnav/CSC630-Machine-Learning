How do I start to make things better, in the face of the worst thing ever?
This was never going to be pretty. I was always going to feel guilty
You can't stop crying, and why should you? Though selfishly I wish you could do
Sorrow has a way of stealing. This has got the better of you
But I can be there for you to come back to when you come back. Just come back
I don't want to replace her love. Oh I just want to do it justice

Let me live up to her love
If I can't love you as much at least let me love you more than enough. I'm so lucky to have won your love
Let me give you all you deserve
It's so easy to see why you were everything to her. You're so easy to love
You're so easy to love

Longing for some instant distance. But that's not how it works with grieving
Helpless to do anything but hold you. Through the tears and through the shaking
But I can be there for you to come back to when you come back. Just come back
I don't want to replace her love. Oh I just want to do it justice

Let me live up to her love
If I can't love you as much at least let me love you more than enough. I'm so lucky to have won your love
Let me give you all you deserve
It's so easy to see why you were everything to her. You're so easy to love
You're so easy to love
