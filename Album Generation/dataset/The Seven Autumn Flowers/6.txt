You don't know how close you came
You know, I think of you as mine
But what we had, you'll have again
And don't think that I won't mind

I waited at the airport gate
Til your plane began to move
Then I couldn't stand it anymore
So I walked away from you
That's when I walked away from you

And if you believe I'm gaining a friend
You'll believe anything
All I'm doing is losing
All I'm doing is losing

I loved being held on that corner
I miss the dream from which I've awoken
You made me feel both lost and home
Now all I feel is broken

All the places we had loved
All the places we let it flourish
All the rubbish that I spoke
Hoping you wouldn't notice
Hoping you wouldn't notice

And if you believe I'm gaining a friend
You'll believe anything
All I'm doing is losing
All I'm doing is losing

When you called me from new york
You sounded so far away
Wasn't distance put to good use
Like when we looked over L.A.?

At least I've had such moments
Being held to the sound of waves
Stars appearing over the ocean
But you were always slipping away
You were always slipping away

And if you believe I'm gaining a friend
You'll believe anything
All I'm doing is losing
All I'm doing is losing
