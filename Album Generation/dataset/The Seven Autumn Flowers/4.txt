[Verse 1]
Although there is now hope, embers of sadness still glow
Something hasn't quite flown
But I know you're there to catch me now
All eternal things, the moon, the sea, the turning leaves
Speak to something within
And you, ease the longing too
My reason, my sunlight, my lifeline

[Chorus]
All eternal things and you, how this frightened heart they soothe
You and the seasons will pull me through
Will calm and comfort, and always be beautiful
You and the seasons will pull me through

[Verse 2]
I know you won't let go of the string
I know you won't let this kite be taken
By the wind

[Chorus]
All eternal things and you, how this frightened heart they soothe
You and the seasons will pull me through
Will calm and comfort, and always be beautiful
You and the seasons will pull me through
