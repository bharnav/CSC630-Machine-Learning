We may be far away
We may be long ago
Still, I remember everything
- never think i don't

You come back to me
Over and again
In dreams and memories
You dance back in

Nothing will ever change all you are
Nothing could ever dim your star
I still think of you every day
You're still with me every step of the way

I remember whispering while you were sleeping
"I don't want you to go..."
Can't you see it's all for show?
I guess I hated you when you went away
Of course, I loved you all the same

Is it true your soul has seen too much?
If I was any help, i wasn't nearly enough
Should I have been the one to calm the storm?
Should I have been your last port of call?

Should I have shown you the eastern sky?
Should I have shown you first light?

We will never be together again
But we'll be alright in our new lives
I may not be yours, nor you mine
But a dance about on a winter's day
She will find her place
She'll be everything again
For who could fail to see what's blinding?

Should I have shown you the eastern sky?
Should I have shown you first light?

I remember the thrill I'd get
On my way to meet you
A pound in my chest I could hardly contain
Walking those london streets
Heading for euston
To see you step down from your train

Should I have been the one to calm the storm?
Should I have been your last port of call?

Your last port of call...
