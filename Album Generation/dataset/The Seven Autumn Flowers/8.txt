This heart has found its place
It's yours to keep, it's yours for always
And if you must it's yours to break
Just don't send me away
I always need to see your face
From the first I was lost
And to the last I'll be yours
There's not another soul out there
Not anywhere
I could belong to now we've met
What's the use of second best?

And if I need you more than is sane
Let that be the case

I need your touch, I need your kiss
I'm only OK when it's you I'm with
But with every good-bye
I waste a little more time
One person in the entire world
You don't need anything less
We're filling our pockets up
With moments that could turn on us
And that could really stain someday
Don't let our time be of the borrowed kind
Instead let us escape
Let's you and I escape

And if I need you more than is sane
Let that be the case

Just what is there apart from you and me
Save me, don't set me free
