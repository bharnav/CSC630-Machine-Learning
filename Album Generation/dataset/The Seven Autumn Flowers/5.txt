The loneliness of a single light in the distance
Everything bathed in blue
The sea and the night, and a heart that just might break in two
The North Sea meets the Atlantic
Lucky seashells, mermaid's purses
The sea and the night, and a heart that just might, face a little crisis

Don't let this spell be broken. This is nothing less than perfection
Don't let this haunting stillness lift
It's enough to make you believe
Enough to make you believe everything's alright with the world tonight, it's a place of good deeds
A place of good deeds

There's no betrayal of any sign of violence, but a small boat could get swallowed
And the music that this seascape makes could be blown away
The music that this seascape makes could be blown away

Don't let this spell be broken. This is nothing less than perfection
Don't let this haunting stillness lift
It's enough to make you believe
Enough to make you believe everything's alright with the world tonight, it's a place of good deeds
A place of good deeds
