Kensington Gardens fixes everything
When you're all I see
When the world slips away
Kensington Gardens fixes everything. Fixes everything. Always

You spend so much time away from me
But you're here with me
So let's give no thought to sorrow
We spend so much time wanting this
So let's forget we can't always have it

Everyone's looking for something that matters and we matter
To be known is everything
Everyone's looking for something that matters

Tell me again of the jukebox girl
And her dollar, and her ten plays
Waiting to hear her songs come on
I love her and all that she became

Everyone's looking for something that matters and we matter
To be known is everything
Everyone's looking for something that matters

I know you and you know me
Kensington Gardens fixes everything
Fall asleep with me with the sun on your face
