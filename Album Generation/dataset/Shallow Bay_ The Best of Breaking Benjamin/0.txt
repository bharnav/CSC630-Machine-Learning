[Intro]
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
The day has come to an end
The sun is over my head
My polyamorous friend
He got me in a mess of trouble again

[Chorus]
So just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

[Verse 2]
They've come to get me again
The cloud is over my head
My polyamorous friend
He got me in a mess of trouble again

[Chorus]
So just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

[Bridge]
Well, how do you know?
Well, how do you know?
Well, how do you know?
Well, how do you know?

[Chorus 2]
Just when you think that you're all right
I'm calling out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

[Outro]
Let's go
