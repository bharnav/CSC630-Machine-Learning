[Verse 1]
I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see the less I like
Is it over yet?
In my head

I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet?
I can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
So sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
Cause I will be the death of you

[Verse 2]
This will be all over soon
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet?
Let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
So sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
Cause I will be the death of you

[Bridge]
I'm waiting, I'm praying, realize, start hating

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
Cause I will be the death of you
