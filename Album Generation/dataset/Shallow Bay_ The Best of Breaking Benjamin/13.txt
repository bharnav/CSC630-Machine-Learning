[Verse 1]
What's all this talk of emotion?
I'd rather drink from the ocean
What did you mean when you said no?
I only want what is best for you

[Chorus 1]
But I won't ever let you drown
No I won't ever let you down

[Chorus 2]
Because I am my enemy
The water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothing from you
Yes I do [x2]
My engine's running on dry
My head's so fucked up inside
Shut up
I know
I said so

[Verse 2]
There is no way to recover
You told me there is no other
The surface is getting hotter
I'll shove your head under water

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro][x2]
Shut up
I know
I said so
