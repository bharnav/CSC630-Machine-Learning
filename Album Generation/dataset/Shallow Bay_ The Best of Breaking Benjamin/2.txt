[Verse 1]
I got something up my sleeve
(I know you will cover me)
Inside out and in between
(I know you will cover me)
I've got bruises on my knees
(I know you will cover me)

[Chorus 1]
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

[Chorus 2]
Run away
Make hate
And get laid [x2]
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

[Verse 2]
I'm already incomplete
(I know you will cover me)
Looking by your empathy
(I know you will cover me)
I've been lying here for weeks

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x3]
