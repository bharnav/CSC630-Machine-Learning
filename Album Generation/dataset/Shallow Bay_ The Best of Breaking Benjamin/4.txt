[Verse 1]
I want a normal life, just like a newborn child
I am a lover-hater, I am an instigator
You are an oversight, don't try to compromise
I'll learn to love to hate it, I am not integrated

[Pre-Chorus]
Just call my name, you'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins

[Chorus]
Sooner or later, you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw your life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw your life away

[Verse 2]
You're like an infantile, I knew it all the while
You sit and try to play me, just like you see on TV
I am an oversight, just like a parasite
Why am I so pathetic? I know you won't forget it

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Throw our life away
Throw our life away
