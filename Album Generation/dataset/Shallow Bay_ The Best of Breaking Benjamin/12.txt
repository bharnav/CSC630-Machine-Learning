Ben
They fall in line, one at a time, ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose, we've got to move, steady your hand
(I am losing sight again)
Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

Ben: Only the strongest will survive
Syd: Lead me to heaven when we die
Ben: I am the shadow on the wall
Syd: I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left, so save your breath, lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown, nowhere to go, holding your fate
(Loaded, I will walk alone)
Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

Ben: Only the strongest will survive
Syd: Lead me to heaven when we die
Ben: I am the shadow on the wall
Syd: I'll be the one to save us all

Ben
You wanted it back
(Don't make me beg!)

Syd
Don't make me beg! (Enough!)
Blow me away! (Die!)

Ben: Only the strongest will survive
Syd: Lead me to heaven when we die
Ben: I am the shadow on the wall
Both: I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
