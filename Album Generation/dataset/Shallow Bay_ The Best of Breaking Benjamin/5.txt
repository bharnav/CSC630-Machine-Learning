[Verse 1]
Take a photograph, it'll be the last
Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here
I don't have a past, I just have a chance
Not a family or honest plea remains to say

[Chorus]
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
All the world is waiting for the sun

[Verse 2]
Is it you I want? Or just the notion of
A heart to wrap around, so I can find my way around?
Safe to say from here, you're getting closer now
We are never sad cause we are not allowed to be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
To lie here under you is all that I could ever do
To lie here under you is all

[Chorus]
