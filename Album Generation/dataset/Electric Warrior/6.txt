[Verse 1]
Planet Queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head
Like an exploder
The Planet Queen

[Verse 2]
The world's the same
I am to blame
She used my head
Like a revolver
The world's the same

[Chorus]
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

[Verse 3]
Dragon head
Machine of lead
Cadillac King
Dancer in the midnight
Dragon head

[Verse 1]
Planet Queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head
Like a revolver
The world's the same

[Chorus]
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

[Verse 3]
Dragon head
Machine of lead
Cadillac King
Dancer in the midnight
Dragon head

[Verse 1]
Planet Queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head
Like a revolver
The planet Queen, yeah

[Chorus]
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter
Well it's all right
Love is what you want
The flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

[Outro]
Give me your daughter, give me your daughter
Give me your daughter, give me your daughter
Give me your daughter, give me your daughter
Give me your daughter, give me your daughter
Give me your daughter, give me your daughter
