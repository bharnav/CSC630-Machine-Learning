Our Little keepsake patterns the ones that leave us shaking
Take rest in sound pollution. Take rest in the vibration
A moment with our bodies exposed and decomposing

I'll stay awake to fight this fear were lost and losing
Hang onto whatever you believe in
This might mean the world to you
But as for me I've given up on our religion

A safe way - of letting go of nothing
And they'll ask - why must I do this to myself
What can you say - when you've asked yourself 1000 times before
At daylight I'll break commitments of the night before

I'll stay awake to fight this fear were lost and losing
Hang onto whatever you believe in
This might mean the world to you
But as for me I've given up on our religion

Nightfall and my liver floats into the stars
Baby, don't ask how it'll be when I'm 40
This song is a contradiction, I'm doing just fine

Someone save us from ourselves
Something to cut the ties
A promise we made to...
Ashtrays and empty bottles [x2]

I'll stay awake to fight this fear were lost and losing
Hang onto whatever you believe in
This might mean the world to you
But as for me I've given up on our religion
