Rain down the pavement
To line up in our metal coffins
Main line our stations
To ship out the mass destructions
Green eyes in fountains
From the toxins that pollute our insides

We're drowning (we're drowning)

We're watching sunlight burn
As it's slipping through the starlit canopy
(we're watching the world light up lifeless)
The daylight insults the beauty of her majesty
(the night is taking control) [x3]

"And this is life twenty years later after the dust and smoke have cleared, after you lost your wife and children, when the earth has a chance for revenge. The chance to recreate a species of solid existence. Perfection at its best. The only chance for pure anarchy"

Stained glass windows
The gluten that feeds to pass time
Impair this vision
That recreates perfection
Slow down transition
From the moon that's taking over

We're choking (we're choking)

We're watching sunlight burn
As it's slipping through the starlit canopy
(we're watching the world light up lifeless)
The daylight insults the beauty of her majesty
(the night is taking control) [x3]

And the moon is taking over
Moon is taking over
The moon is taking over (the night is taking control, the night is taking control)
The moon is... (the night is taking control, the night...)

We're watching sunlight burn
As it's slipping through the starlit canopy
(we're watching the world light up lifeless)
The daylight insults the beauty of her majesty
(the night is taking control)
Hold your breath and don't let go [x4]
