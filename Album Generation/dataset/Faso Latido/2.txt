This town of sober actors
Feel free to watch your city
Become more than a sitcom dependency
As they walk, her streets are bleeding
From the talent that they're bringing
The stars will pave your journey
To another, to another x-rated love story

The hills have become your idols
The hills have become your idols

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)
Stand up cause this town is failing us

This town of shifting power
Covered under Neilson ratings
Let's decide how to feed your children
Rise and fall to the sound they're scripting
Sit and smile at the pain you're buying
Will it hurt when we live in paradise?
We're washing up on sunset

Sit and smile at the pain you're buying
Sit and smile at the pain you'll buy

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)
Stand up cause this town is failing us

This might be your chance
And when you find them running with
Your gun in hand

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)

Stand up
We're falling back again
We'll find something better, we'll do anything
(This town has killed us both)
Stand up
