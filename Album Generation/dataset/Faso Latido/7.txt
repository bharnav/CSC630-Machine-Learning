Tickle me pink with laughter
Backwards we wind up spinning
Another shot of whiskey (another shot of whiskey)
To train our feet to move

We can't feel loved
We can't feel free
We can't feel at all
[x3]

(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves
(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves (once more we'll lose ourselves)

We think and drink our cocktails
Sit and watch the burning bridges
Throw me another one (roll me another one)
To train our minds to move

We can't feel loved
We can't feel free
We can't feel at all
[x3]

(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves
(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
Unloved, we'll lose ourselves

We're taking some time

Why can't you set the trucks to sunset and we forget
Ride the sun to make us whole

(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
We'll lose ourselves
(we're taking some time) we can't wait for..
(we're packing our bags) our bags, too full
We'll lose ourselves
