One day we'll crash this van
Wind up in your attic
And with what we learned last night
We can never take ourselves away

No self control
We are blown to the wind and we'll float
From state to wretched state
Crematories for past relationships
We separate ourselves

Can we push this any further, (Stand back)
And watch your family fall apart, (Much more)
Much more, then playing off of words but losing a piece of myself

I'm sure were all the same and we've found a way to
Associate ourselves for love of money and were glorified
We separate ourselves

Can we push this any further, (stand back)
And watch your family fall apart, (Much more)
Much more, then playing off of words but losing a piece of myself

Our lovers drink alone tonight
