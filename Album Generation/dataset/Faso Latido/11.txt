It's time we took this holiday
We thank you and send you our regards
The beach is great this time of year, fourth of June
We've seen our first sight of snow

And this was beautiful
And this is beautiful
And this was beautiful
And this is beautiful

And you might feel
That this is better way of saying
We trusted you
We trusted you, we trusted you

Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy

And maybe we're saying you lost your tongue
Behind your plate of lies
We know you're starving for
The chance to make this right

A silent song that's left of your
Important stories
But the honest have let you go for
Breach of your contract

And you might feel
That this is better way of saying
We trusted you
We trusted you, we trusted you

Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy
Praise, fuck, destroy

We trusted you
I trusted you

We've all played the part
We've all played the part

Played the part
Played the part
Played the part
