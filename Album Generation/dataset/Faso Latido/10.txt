Dont you cry, your about to lose your grip
Take your eye, take the stone off the pedal
Theres no time to be facetious
We meant every word we said

Last night i woke up cold of sweat
The bitter taste in my mouth
That has labeled me a weakness
Tonight we'll entertain our guests
With a glass of water
Yet a taste i won't miss

And you better get better
(you better get better)
So you can save our day
(we are are better)
And you better get better
So you can save our day

Dont you cry, your about to lose your grip
Take your eye, take the stone off the pedal

If time invites a light ahead
And its followed by your body
That is stapeled to the mattress
Tempt me with this broken purity

And you better get better
(you better get better)
So you can save our day
(we are are better)
And you better get better
We won't be the same

And you better get better
(you better get better)
So you can save our day
(we are are better)
And you better get better
So you can save our day
Thats been sitting in my pocket
I haven't lost my interest
