We'll light up the segway
We'll load them up and ship them out
Out! out!

Tonight this poet dies
It inkwell has spoken
Its last words
His thoughts were left in fiction
And his hope for substance
Had faded long ago

You and i both need to know
When we fall, you die, we die
Stand there, to get us get us now
If we fall, you die, we die
There out to get us now

Tonight the candle was left burning
And a shred of dignity is lost within the flame
And his fears were left unmentioned
His cry for silence had faded long ago

You and i both need to know
When we fall, you die, we die
Stand there, to get us get us now
If we fall, you die, we die
There out to get us now

Tonight this poet dies
Tonight this poet dies
Tonight, tonight, tonight

You and i both need to know
If we fall, you die, we die
Stand there out, to get us get us now
If we fall you die, we die

We'll light up the segway
We'll load them up and ship them out
Out! out!
