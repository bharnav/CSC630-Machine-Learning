The cash cow is feeding us
Someone we dont know is buying us
And we are temporary

Do you, want to feel
Like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)

Can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
We have nothing left to lose
Before we sleep together
(before we sleep together)

Maybe, a bullet or saint
And i guess were sent for motion
With conductivity whole

Do you, want to feel
Like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)
Do you, want to feel
A sleep soundly propostion?
(a sleep soundly propostion)

Can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
Im debonair, im debonair, so debonair
Can't complain, can't complain, can't complain
Im debonair, im debonair, so debonair

We are temporary
(we're temporary)
Temporary

Do you, want to feel
(do you want to)
Like the knife is in you?
(like the knife is in you)
Do you, want to feel
(do you, want to)
A sleep soundly propostion?
(a sleep soundly propostion)
