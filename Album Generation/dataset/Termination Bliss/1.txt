In your dreams, hearts shake
Nerves scream, minds break
Heavens turn, grounds crack
Prayers burn, burn black

And it's all there inside of you
It's deadly, dark, cold
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Blitzkrieg, boom
Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Blitzkrieg, boom

Hope fails, death shines
Long nails, Hell's vines
Terrors speak, walls fall
Addiction seek, seek it all

And it's all there inside of you
It's deadly, dark, cold
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Fuck the blitzkrieg, boom
Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Fuck the blitzkrieg, boom

This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
(As we trigger one last bomb)

Wounds bleed, tears ride
Demons feed, angel hide
Fathers sign, mothers weep
Children cry, crying deep

And it's all inside of you
It's deadly, dark, cold
Can you feel the explosion?
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Fuck the blitzkrieg, boom
Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg
Fuck the blitzkrieg, boom

Fuck the world with a gun and a broken blade!

This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
(As we trigger one last bomb)

This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
(As we trigger one last bomb)

This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on
(As we trigger one last bomb)
