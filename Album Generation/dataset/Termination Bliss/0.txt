No prayers can reach me here
No light can touch
Among reduced Bibles, cigarettes and drugs
I carve your name in my flesh

Listen, Listen
Then come and take my hand

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame

Innocence will never kiss me again
Never lick my stiched scars
Your lipstick's between the legs of hell
Mixed with speed and blood

Listen, Listen
Then come and take my hand

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame

The eggs grow in her open wrists
It has started nowâ€¦
Her taste is on my lips and tongue
The taste of white medicines

Listen Listen
I'll come and take your hand!

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame

Tongues, Tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, Tongues
Shame, shame
