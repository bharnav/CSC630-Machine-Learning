[Verse 1]
They calle me the man with the blood of Christ honesty
But tonight (Tonight we'll sleep as killers)
I drink with heathens and our, our finest blasphemies
(As we break the cryptic, as we break the cryptic)

[Verse 2]
In wine there's truth, but in silence there's surrender
A screaming for the silence in stunned suspicious terror
Built a temple in my life and used God to seal the pillars
After twenty years of fighting young heretics and killers

[Verse 3]
I watch my temple fall to pieces
(At the first signs of oncoming weather)
I fell to my knees, just like
Jesus in the cave
Jesus in the cave
Jesus in the cave
I knew I would die, but my lips could only say
"I'm not your son, so why have you forsaken me?"

[Bridge]
(There's a hole in my heart, but it just makes me unholy)
Crucified that night, and I walked away with alter-egos
Prison preacher preaches his dead and buried gospel

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
With my faith in ruins my duty still breathes strong
I'm a parrot in a cage just singing prayers to belong

[Outro]
Textbook of a crying, lying, dying history
Textbook of a crying, lying, dying history
Textbook of my crying
A textbook of my lying
A textbook of my dying
A textbook of my history
