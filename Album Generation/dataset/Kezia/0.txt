[Intro]
This should never be!

[Verse 1]
I'll burn all the lives of this angel illuminati
When St. Michael sized means find an end to justify
A belief to fortify this stained glass disgrace
Too beautiful to change, or perhaps too scared
The truth behind our lives will be erased (Will be erased)

[Verse 2]
A crusade in (In which to die)
Begging for a crusade in which to die
Where lead locusts pierce the heart of men
And tie the tongues of those who lie (Those who lie)
Cut the sinner, bleed redemption through the city streets
That resonate the prayers of "This should never be"

[Refrain]
This should never be!

[Verse 3]
Someone plunged a dagger deep into God's chest
And when he groaned it laid our entire civilization to rest
When he pulled out that dagger
And marveled in the pain he could create
We stuck another in his back and sealed Creation's fate

[Bridge]
So now we'll turn from wealth in the height of all our poverty
A call that renders me ageless, turning the pages of a belief
That's greater than us all, greater than us all

[Verse 4]
Amen to the fools and the Cossacks
And the pulpits (Amen!)
Amen
To the people who think there's still a way to help us
Amen to the people
Amen to the people
Amen to the people
Amen to the people

[Outro]
Amen to the people
Amen to the people who
Think there's still a way to help us
