[Verse 1]
We woke up as men, but tonight
Tonight we'll sleep as killers
As we break the cryptic morning
With a bullet and a prayer
The steel never seemed so cold and agile
And a life never seemed less vital and fragile

[Verse 2]
With a heart that's beating
Louder than my own
I watch a girl they call Kezia
I watch a woman that I know
My hope and my own future, blindfolded
To atone for a sin I didn't care for
But a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children
That burned my smiles and cigarettes

[Bridge]
And no one ever
Said that hope would be so beautiful
And no one ever
Said I'd have to pull the trigger, on her

[Verse 3]
I can't even still her trembling hands
That were locked up by the dutiful
And the obligated

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 4]
Five soldiers forever sedated
With the "No one's responsible"
Pathological drama of our
Social justice dribble, dribble, dribble

[Verse 5]
Her tiny steps tell lies
About the choice I have to make;
(Resurrect a static lifetime
Starve to death my own mistakes)

[Verse 6]
Pull the screaming trigger
And watch your carcass bleed me dry
Or drop the gun and try to shake away
The blindfold from your eyes?

Drop the gun, drop the gun, drop the gun
Drop the gun

[Outro]
Sin I didn't care for
But a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children
And burned my smiles and cigarettes
Sin I didn't care for
But a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children
That burned my smiles and cigarettes
