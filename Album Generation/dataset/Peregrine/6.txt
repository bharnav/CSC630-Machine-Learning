[Verse 1]
Sister's gone, a crown of red
You said, I missed, a mistake
In the dark, I thought her you, and shot
The room was tilting

[Chorus]
I hear your voice calling me
From a calendar anniversary
I hear your voice calling me
From a calendar anniversary

[Verse 2]
Wake up empty head, ringing bells
You said you heard her voice here
An eastern wind on branches bare
No moon, no stars, no passing time

[Pre-Chorus]
And all you ever wanted was my embrace
So why do you stay inside your hiding place?

[Chorus]
I hear your voice calling me
From a calendar anniversary
I hear your voice calling me
From a calendar anniversary

[Bridge]
It's February
You're two years gone
And I am lost
Yeah, I am lost
It's February
I can feel your hand
And here I come
Yeah, here I come

[Outro]
You cannot hide yourself
I'm everywhere
You cannot hide yourself
I'm everywhere
You cannot hide yourself
You cannot hide yourself
You cannot hide yourself
