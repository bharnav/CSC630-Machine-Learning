[Verse 1]
Everyone walks alone
We don't care, here we are
We proclaim the start of
With false fronts and shattered dreams
We don't care because all we are
All we are is watching

[Verse 2]
All we are is crazy
We are standing on a road
On a road to nowhere
There's a place for all of us
They don't care, we don't care
You can't break us down

[Verse 3]
Everyone walks alone
We don't care, here we are
We proclaim the start of
With false fronts and shattered dreams
We don't care because all we are
All we are is watching

[Verse 4]
All we are is crazy
We are standing on a road
On a road to nowhere
There's a place for all of us
They don't care, we don't care
You can't break us down
