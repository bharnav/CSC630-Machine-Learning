[Verse 1]
Common places, haunted past
With all the woods now gone, I knew it wouldn't last
And all the faces are question marks
Up and down the street, looking down the block

[Verse 2]
Common places, haunted rooms
Wandering inside, contemplating doom
It marks our faces when we don't smile
Don't get me out of bed, I want to lay here a while

[Verse 3]
So come another day
Today, I just can't
The faces are out there
This is your last chance

[Hook]
You must, you must come out
You must, you must come out
You must, you must come out
You must, you must come out
