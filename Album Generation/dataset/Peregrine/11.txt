[Verse 1]
The one that you love
The one that will hurt you
The one up above
Now a cold wind blows
Yeah, a cold wind blows
It's breaking down the line

[Verse 2]
The nail in your neck
The knife in your side
To which you're devoted
And you pay your tithe
The coins will reach your eyes

[Verse 3]
The one that is holding
The keys to your heart
That's bleeding and breaking
And there's no alarm
The claws are in your eyes

[Verse 4]
And you come back
And you wanted
You'd fight back, but you're haunted
And you wonder, "is this the one?"
I am not the one to follow
