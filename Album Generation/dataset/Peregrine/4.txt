[Verse 1]
Father now
Listen close
You have become
Another ghost
Just like me
Just like me

[Verse 2]
The flowers fall
From your glass
The bitter taste
The girl is back
In dancing lights
In dancing lights

[Verse 3]
In dancing lights
The flowers fall
The bitter taste
The glass is full
An empty hand
An empty hand

[Verse 4]
An empty set
Of colors crawl
Through the door
Into the hall
The knife is dull
The knife is dull
