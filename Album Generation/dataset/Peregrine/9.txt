[Verse 1]
Cold hunters knife
Washed in a silver rain
Washed in wings and pierced by those claws that cling
To the throats and hands of death

[Verse 2]
Bold brazen child
Who said you could do these things
Made from rain and light blowing in from space
Now, to kill, and fight, and hide your claim

[Verse 3]
Cold haunted heart
Your dream of my warm embrace
All the while carving with all your hate
Rage and bile, to turn me cold

[Verse 4]
But cold is home and I am winter
Blinding light and blasting horns
If you want warmth then I am summer
But choose the one you're wanting more
