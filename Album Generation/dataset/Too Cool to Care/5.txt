I might just let you meet my mom
Last week my mom said I had too many girlfriends
Come in her house, her house
She told me if I show her one more of my girlfriends
She’s kicking her out, her out, her out

But this girl, I got good feelings about
Not only is she a hottie, but she’s somebody
That’s why this girl got me, got me like

I might just let you meet my mom
I promised that I wouldn’t bring in no more video
Models or singers
You got me like ooooooooo

I might just let you meet my mom
You’re no model, no liar, no cheater
That’s why I’m taking you to meet her
You got me like ooooooooo

I might just let you meet my mom
I got a girl, her name is perfect
I lost the others, but I think she’s worth it
I did so many foul things in the past
Now I’m settling down
Man I’m so happy, I finally found someone my style

Now that I think about it
You exactly like me
Tell them haters bite me
Ima make you wifey
You’re my girl
I probably might even let you go inside
You got me like, got me like

I might just let you meet my mom
I promised that I wouldn’t bring in no more video

You got me like ooooooooo

I might just let you meet my mom
You’re no model, no liar, no cheater
That’s why I’m taking you to meet her
You got me like ooooooooo

My mom actually likes you
I don’t think you know how big that is
It seems like every girl that came around
She just kept kicking ‘em, kicking ‘em out
And it’s like you the last one

Aye girl, you bad, wassup
I might just let you meet my mom
Bet you wanna meet my mom
