Hourglass sands run through my veins like blood draining from a salty wound
Mad Mars forgets the cost of strife, serves no longer, purpose in my life
I lie in sweat, cry others' tears and write a letter to my Mum
My wife, my God unheard, unseen, Who never thinks to intervene

Oh, what pain and oh, what lie has called to us, from heaven on high?
This cruel and harsh sweet punishment for follies acted, leaves us spent
Long road to Baghdad, then Persian hordes?
Where will we stop to sheath our swords?
IEDs lie patient, sleeping, wake when soldier boots come creeping

Hourglass sands run through my veins like blood draining from a salty wound
Mad Mars forgets the cost of strife, serves no longer, purpose in my life
Down this dusty scorched wind-blast track, eyes facing forward, ne'er look back
As rain comes down on Wootton Bassett Town, black hearses crawl and church bells sound
Bikers, burghers line the kerbs; a politician, a Highness Royal
Chance shoppers, tradesmen, stiffly stand and shed their tears for the military man
