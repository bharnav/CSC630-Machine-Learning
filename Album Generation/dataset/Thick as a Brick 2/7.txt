Last lights wink out on this pale and sultry night
Stars signal long past two AM
I feel the lateness in the hour
And I'm fifty long years from home

A new dawn glimmers. Time for a change of horses
It's time to chart new courses
And head for safer houses
No more empty towers of this unholy Babylon
Some four hundred thousand hours have come and gone

I smell, in the air, a new meadow morning
Fresh-flowering grasses stirring
And no pressure free-falling
Thin mists to bring and light airs to call

And we treasure all, all that we left behind us
No pointed cold and dark regrets
No nameless blame to lay
Resolute, the optimist, I ride fresh horse and spur it on
Four hundred thousand hours have come and gone
