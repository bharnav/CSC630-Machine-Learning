We all must wonder, now and then, if things had turned out - well - just plain different
Chance path taken, page unturned or brief encounter, blossomed, splintered
Might you have been the man of courage, brave upon life's battlefield
Captain Commerce, high-flown banker, hedonistic, down-at-heel?
A Puritan of moral fibre, voice raised in praise magnificent?
Or rested in assured repose, knowing your lot in quiet content?
What-ifs, Maybes and Might-have-beens fly
Soft petals on a breeze
What-ifs, Maybes and Might-have-beens
Why-nots, Perhaps and Wait-and-sees
