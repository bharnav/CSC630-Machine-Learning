[Verse 1]
Ah, you can talk about the pit barbecue
The band was jumping, the people too
Ah, mess around

[Chorus 1]
They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

[Verse 2]
Ah, everybody was juiced, you can bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie with a sturdy roll
They mess around

[Chorus 1]
They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

[Verse 3]
Now ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg
And do the mess around

[Chorus 2]
I declare, do the mess around
Yeah do the mess around
Everybody's doing the mess around

[Bridge]
Now let me have it there boy
Now you got it boy
(Yeah, ah, mess around, go on mess around)
(Mess around, boy)

[Verse 4]
Now this band's going to play from, 9 to 1
Everybody here's gonna have some fun
Doing the mess around

[Chorus 1]
They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

[Verse 5]
Now you see that girl with that diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
Mess around

[Chorus 2]
I declare she can mess around
Ah, mess around
Everybody do the mess around
