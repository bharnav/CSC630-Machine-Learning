[Chorus 1]
You know the night time, darling (Night and day)
Is the right time (Night and day)
To be (Night and day)
With the one you love, now (Night and day)

[Verse 1]
Say now, oh baby (Night and day)
When I come home baby, now (Night and day)
I want to be with the one I love, now (Night and day)
You know what I'm thinking of (Night and day)

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
You know my mother, now (Night and day)
Had to die, now (Night and day)
And my father (Night and day)
Well, he broke down and cry (Night and day)

[Verse 3]
Whoa! whoa baby (Night and day)
When I come home baby, now (Night and day)
I want you to hold my hand (Night and day)
Yeah, tight as you can (Night and day)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Baby (Night and day) [x4]

[Verse 4]
Do I love you? (Night and day)
No one above you (Night and day)
Hold me tight (Night and day)
And make everything alright (Night and day)

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Tease me (Night and day)
Squeeze me (Night and day)
Leave me (Night and day)
Ah, don't leave me (Night and day)

[Verse 5]
Oh baby (Night and day)
Take my hand, now (Night and day)
I don't need (Night and day)
No other man (Night and day)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 6]
Oh, come on, baby (Night and day)
You know I want you by my side (Night and day)
I want you to keep (Night and day)
Oh, keep me satisfied, now (Night and day)

[Chorus 1]
