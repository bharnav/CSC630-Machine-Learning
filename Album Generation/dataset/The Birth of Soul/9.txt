[Verse 1]
My dear sweetheart, I'm writing you
Just a few lines to tell you that I'm low

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you

[Verse 2]
You went away, didn't say goodbye
But I still love you, Lord, I wonder why

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't know who was right or who was wrong
All I know is I'm so tired, so tired of being alone

[Verse 3]
But if you care, like I care
Catch the next stream line, bring yourself back here

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I miss your loving, you know what I mean
Remember how you used to make me scream

[Chorus]
