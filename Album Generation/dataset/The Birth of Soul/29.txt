Now when my heart (I want to know)
Right me pain (I want to know)
And my best friends (I want to know)
Scandalize my name (I want to know)
Yeah I wanna to know (I want to know)
Said I wanna to know (I want to know)

Now when I'm down (Yes yes yes)

And stand by me. (Oh oh oh stand by me)

Now I mean his wear (I want to know)

Now when I'm down (Yes yes yes)
Yeah, pick me up (Yes yes yes)
And stand by me (Oh oh oh stand by me)
