[Verse]
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand[x2]
Your ways keep changing like the shifting desert sand
While I was playing fair baby, you played a cheating game[x2]
I know you don't care, but I love you just the same
I thought I'd be your king baby, yes and you could be my queen[x2]
But you used me for your joker because I thought you're deal was clean
The way you did me pretty baby, I declare I never understand[x2]
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
