[Verse 1]
Went to see my sweetheart
Last night around about ten
She said, "Home sweet, Papa"
Squeeze me every now and then

[Chorus 1]
I'll keep rolling with my baby [x3]
'Cause she's sweet that way

[Verse 2]
We went out to a movie
Stop in the very last row
We hadn't been there a good five minutes
Before she's ready to go

[Chorus 2]
I had to roll with my baby [x3]
'Cause she's sweet that way

[Verse 3]
I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime
Can't buy me no whiskey
I guess I'll have to settle for wine
And then I can

[Chorus 3]
Roll with my baby
I know I can roll with my baby
I'm sure I can roll with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

[Verse 4]
She's such a sweet woman
I'll never let her go
'Cause deep down inside of me
Lord knows I love her so

[Chorus 1]
