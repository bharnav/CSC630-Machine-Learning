[Verse 1] [x2]
Tell me how do you feel
When your baby's loving your best friend?
I want to know

[Verse 2]
Do you feel like going crazy
Or do you feel you've always been?

[Verse 3] [x2]
Hey, hey, tell me how how do you feel
When your baby crosses your mind?
I want to know

[Verse 4]
Do you crack up with loud laughter
Or do you break down and start crying?

[Verse 5] [x2]
Tell me how do you feel, partner?
I want the truth and not a lie
That's what I said

[Verse 6]
Because if you feel good on the inside
I must admit you're a much better man than I

[Chorus] [x2]
Would you feel happy
Or would you feel sad
When you've lost the best girl
That you've ever had?
I want to know [x8]

[Outro]
It's alright [x4]

Oh baby, I wanna know [x4]
