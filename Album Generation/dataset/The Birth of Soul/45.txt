[Verse 1]
Early in the morning and I can't get right, now
Had a little date with my baby last night, now

[Chorus]
And it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning (early in the morning)
Hey, I am not got nothing but the blues (blues)

[Verse 2]
I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I went to her girlfriends house, but she was out
I knocked on her fathers door and he began to shout, "Get away from here boy"

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went to Dukie Chance's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me and said, "Ray, you sure look beat"

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I had a lot of money when I started out
Can't find my baby now my money run out, now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning, yeah)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues, now
