[Verse 1]
My Bonnie lies all over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies all over the ocean, well yeah

[Verse 2]
Why don't you bring (Bring her back) [x4]
You oughta bring back
Bring my Bonnie back to me (My Bonnie back to me)

[Chorus] [x2]
I said bring (Bring back)
Bring her back, right now (Bring back)
Come on and bring back
Bring my Bonnie back to me

[Verse 3]
Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
Last night as I lay on my pillow
Well let me tell you now

[Verse 4]
You know I dreamed (Yes I did) [x4]
You know I dreamed that
Dreamed my little Bonnie was dead
(My little Bonnie was dead)

[Chorus] [x2]
