[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me [x2]

[Verse 1]
Well if I've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you please
I used to have plenty of money, the finest clothes in town
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me, bound to get me down

[Chorus]
Please have mercy, lord have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
Well if i've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you please
Keep on working now, child
Lord every morning
Well if I've been a bad boy, baby, I declare I'll change my ways
I don't want bad luck and trouble to follow me all my days

[Chorus]
Please have mercy, lord have mercy on me

[Outro]
Well if I've done somebody wrong, lord, have mercy if you please
