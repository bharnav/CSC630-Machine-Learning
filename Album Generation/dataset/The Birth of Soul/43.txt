[Verse 1]
When I need company
I call on you to see about me

[Chorus 1]
I want to walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

[Verse 2]
When you're with me there's so much fun
You're all the good things all wrapped in one

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Woah, I want to walk, walk about
I want to talk, talk about
I want to tell, want to tell the world all about you
Ohh, I want to live, just for you
I'm going to give, love so true
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new

[Chorus 3]
Ohh, you're so fine and you're so sweet
You're better at love than a K.B.B

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
