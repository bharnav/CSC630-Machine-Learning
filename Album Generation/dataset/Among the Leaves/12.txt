I sit here and wait
On the banks of the Carquinez Strait
Watching pelicans swim
For a beak of sunning king fish
And I meditate
Up shore from the golden gate
Watching sea lions bask in sunshine
And find that my eyes
Can still be awed and surprised

All night I hear wails
Of the union pacific rails
Of ally cat scratch
Of lost baby humpbacks
Of incoming ships
In from their epic long trips
And of mother’s dying these sounds never leave
Be there for them
Spend every moment you can

And love your girl dearly
Look deep into her soul
And say that I love you
Before your body turns cold
I love my girl dearly
And also her little dog Boo
We’re a small pack
And hey we’re happy too
I sing her a song I write her a poem
I gave her my bed
And the keys to my home

Whenever we want, we’ll just pick up and go
Out to the forests, to the mountains of El Dorado
Take morning walks, along the rivers that shine
like old silver dollar
Buffalo Nickel and dimes
One day she may leave if I lie or I cheat
But I hope that she don’t
Because I need her so

I tie on my bait
On a pier on the Carquinez Strait
With others I cast
Sharing some time and some laughs
I come home so proud
When my stringer is heavy and full
When the night crickets chirp
And they shut down the old arsenal
And my wonderful love
She’ll cook my favourite dish
Dungeness crab
And a plate of pan fried kingfish
We’ll fall asleep when our stomachs are full
And in the morning I’ll wish for a bigger catch of king fish
