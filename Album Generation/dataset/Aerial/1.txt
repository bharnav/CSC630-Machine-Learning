[Intro]
Sweet and gentle and sensitive man
With an obsessive nature and deep fascination for numbers
And a complete infatuation with the calculation of Pi

[Chorus 1]
Oh, he love, he love, he love, he does love his numbers
And they run, they run, they run him in a great big circle
In a circle of infinity

[Verse 1]

[Chorus 2]
Oh, he love, he love, he love, he does love his numbers
And they run, they run, they run him in a great big circle
In a circle of infinity
But he must, he must, he must put a number to it

[Verse 2]

And they run, they run, they run him in a great big circle
In a circle of infinity
