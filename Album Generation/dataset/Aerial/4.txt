[Verse 1]
I found a book on how to be invisible
Take a pinch of keyhole
And fold yourself up
You cut along a dotted line
You think inside out
And you’re invisible

[Chorus]
Eye of Braille
Hem of anorak
Stem of wallflower
Hair of doormat

[Verse 2]
I found a book on how to be invisible
On the edge of the labyrinth
Under a veil you must never lift
Pages you must never turn in the labyrinth
You stand in front of a million doors
And each one holds a million more
Corridors that lead to the world
Of the invisible
Corridors that twist and turn
Corridors that blister and burn

[Chorus]
Eye of Braille
Hem of anorak
Stem of wallflower
Hair of doormat

[Bridge]
Is that the wind from the desert song?
Is that the autumn leaf falling?
Or is that you walking home?

[Bridge]
Is that the wind from the desert song?
Is that the autumn leaf falling?
Or is that you walking home?

[Interlude]
Is that a storm in the swimming pool?

[Outro]
You take a pinch of keyhole
And fold yourself up
You cut along a dotted line
You think inside out
You jump ’round three times
You jump into the mirror
And you’re invisible
