[Verse 1]
Here comes the sunshine
Here comes that son of mine
Here comes the everything
Here's a song and a song for him

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet kisses
Three wishes

[Chorus]
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely

[Verse 2]
The most wilful
The most beautiful
The most truly fantastic smile
I've ever seen

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet kisses
Three wishes

[Chorus]
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely

[Outro]
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
