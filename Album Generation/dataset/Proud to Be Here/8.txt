[Verse 1]
We've got a Styrofoam cooler in the back of my old Ford truck
And we're reaching over the side for brew because the tailgates stuck
A couple of lines in the water, hey, I think you've got a bite
I wonder what the Poor Folks are doing tonight?
We could have drove this old truck on into town and caught the 9 o'clock show
But I'd just as soon be sitting here with you listening to the radio
I've got your name on my left arm, and your body in my right
I wonder what the Poor Folks are doing tonight?

[Chorus]
The ones out there who have got nothing on us
They got everything else in this world, but it isn't enough
Wishing they were the owners of a love like yours and mine
I wonder what the Poor Folks are doing tonight?

[Verse 2]
The truth is, you and me, we can't buy a whole lot of fancy nice things
And we aren't on no first name basis with the folks down at the bank
But we know we've got it all when we turn out the lights
I wonder what the Poor Folks are doing tonight?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby, you know we got the life
