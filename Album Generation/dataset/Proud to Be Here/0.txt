[Verse 1]
If I were down to my last dollar
Sitting on an empty tank
I'd be a dollar richer than I was back-in-the-day
When I was playing for tips and compliments
And half my rent was always spent on beer
Had a thousand dollar stereo
In a two hundred dollar truck
A screwdriver and some cussing
Always made her start right up
But I tore it up one rainy night
Going round a curve when I hit second gear
And I'm just proud to be here

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just proud to be on the right side of the dirt
I've been loved and I've been lost and I've been hurt
I leave the hard stuff up to God
Try not to worry about a whole lot
And I have no regrets for what it's worth
I've been living on borrowed time for years
And I'm just proud to be here

[Verse 2]
I'd like to thank my guardian angels
God must have sent His best
Heaven knows they worked their wings off
Keeping whiskey off my breath
When I think of all I would have missed
My wife and kids and all that I hold dear

[Chorus][x2]
