[Verse 1]
I don't need to be sitting on the roof
Of a high-rise looking at the city below
I don't need to be on the beach
Watching that sun sink in the Gulf of Mexico
If I climb to the top of a Colorado mountain
I could see forever from there
But I don't have to go anywhere

[Chorus]
I've got a million dollar view
Right here in my living room
In this little tin roof house
Even with the shades pulled down
And the lights turned out
I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kinda thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
And I've got a million dollar view

[Verse 2]
When I see you laying there in that sexy nightgown
It burns me down deep in my soul
You're a living work of art
A sight that would inspire the likes of Michelangelo
If I took a telescope and pointed it to heaven
I wouldn't find nothing up there
That compares to what I got right here

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kind of thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
You know the truth is, I don't know if a million would get it

[Outro]
You're my million dollar view
Yeah, just looking at you
You're my million dollar view
