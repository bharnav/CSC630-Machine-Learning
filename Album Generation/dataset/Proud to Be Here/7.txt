[Verse 1]
The quarterback down at the school
Makes all the rules because he's super cool
And everybody wants to be just like him
There's a little girl in his homeroom class
Sits in the back because she thinks she's fat
Looking for a corner she can hide in
In life there isn't too many level playing fields
And it doesn't seem fair, but here's the deal
Brother, here's the deal

[Chorus]
You can walk on water
You can walk on the moon
You can walk through Memphis
Wearing blue suede shoes
When the walking is over
At the end of the road
It isn't what you've done, son
It's who you know
Yeah it's who you know

[Verse 2]
Meet the man who owns it all
That's him there on the lobby wall
Don't it look like he's been carved from granite
His hands are soft, his heart is hard
And he only smokes the best cigars
And you'll call him Sir
Because he's earned it, damn it
There's a little old lady
Cleaning up after him at night
And she prays someday that he'll see the light
Now I think she's got it right

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
At the end of the road
It's who you know

[Chorus]
