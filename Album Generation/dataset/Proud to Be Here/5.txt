[Verse 1]
You got a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear
The whole day depends on the mood of your hair
You got forty-five names for the color of red
She says boy when you going to get it through your head

[Chorus]
It's a woman thing, you wouldn't understand
Just adjust your mind because you're just a man
There's a whole lot going on that you don't get
In the complicated working's of the opposite sex
Don't strain your brain trying to figure out what it means
Baby don't you know, know it's a woman thing

[Verse 2]
Towels in the bathroom I better not use
Baby, tell me again why you got so many shoes
You go to Walmart, K-Mart, Neimans and Saks
You shop all day and then you take it all back

[Chorus]
It's a woman thing, you wouldn't understand
Just adjust your mind because you're just a man
There's a whole lot going on that you don't get
In the complicated working's of the opposite sex
Don't strain your brain trying to figure out what it means
Baby don't you know, know it's a woman thing

[Verse 3]
Maybe I should watch some Oprah
Bubble bath, sit on the sofa
Maybe take a Cosmo quiz or two
Maybe all I need's a hug from Fred or Bubba or Big W
Perhaps I'll come to see your point of view
No, it's a woman thing

[Bridge]
Yeah it's a woman thing, you wouldn't understand
Just adjust your mind because you're just a man
I'm a lady in red, I'm a daddy's girl
I'm a force to be reckoned with in heels and pearls
Now and then if I make you want to scream
Baby don't you know, know, it's a...

[Chorus]
It's a woman thing, you wouldn't understand
Just adjust your mind because you're just a man
There's a whole lot going on that you don't get
In the complicated working's of the opposite sex
Don't strain your brain trying to figure out what it means
Baby don't you know, know it's a woman thing

[Outro]
We don't understand
Because it's a woman thing
