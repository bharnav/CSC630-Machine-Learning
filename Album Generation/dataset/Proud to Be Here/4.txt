[Verse 1]
I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishing
I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, living

[Chorus]
And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’

[Verse 2]
She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is ticking
(Yeah it is)

[Chorus]
And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing

[Chorus]
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing
Yeah, aww, she thinks we’re just fishing
We aren’t only fishing
(This isn’t about fishing)
