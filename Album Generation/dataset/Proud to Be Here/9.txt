[Verse 1]
Summer turns this town to dust
When it don't rain, the farmers cuss
But they break the ground and they make the hay
And it's always going to be that way
The oilfield hands belly up to the bar
With new tattoos and football scars
They go on and on about the good old days
And it's always going to be that way

[Chorus]
And the young kids still spark up on the hill
About two feet under the stars
And the old men still take off their hats
And they hold them over their hearts
I still get chills down in my bones
Every time I see your face
And it's always going to be that way

[Verse 2]
That little white church is going to have a crowd
Every time a Sunday rolls around
Yeah we read the book and we all pray
And it's always going to be that way

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Some people leave and don't come back
Chase their dreams down a one-way track
Baby I'm all yours, I'm here to stay
And it's always going to be that way
Yeah it's always going to be that way
