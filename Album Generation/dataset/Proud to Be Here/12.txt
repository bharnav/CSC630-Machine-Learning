[Intro]
Blake, if I was a woman
Trace, if I was a woman
If I was a woman, I'd love a man like me

[Verse 1]
I got a strip in Oklahoma stretch as far as the eyes can see
Well, I got my own little mountain back home in Tennessee
(Oh hell, listen to this)
I got a jet airplane and I can fly you high and far
(Yeah well, check this baby)
I got my own helicopter, I'll pick you up in your front yard

[Chorus]
If I was a woman
Hey, if I was a woman
If I was a woman, I'd love a man like me

[Verse 2]
I'd want a man who had a sensitive side
Well, I'd want a man who ain't afraid to cry
Well, I'd love me a man who could love me all night long
Well, I'd love me a man who had the guts to sing this song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, if I
Oh, we ain't supposed to sing yet
You're too stupid to be a woman
Hey, kiss my

Yeah, if I was a woman
I'd be strucking on some beach somewhere
(Ah that's a good one right there)
In my [?], everybody stop and stare

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Uh, you sounded like a woman on that high note
