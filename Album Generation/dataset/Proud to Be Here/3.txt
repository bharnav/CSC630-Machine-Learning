[Verse 1]
On the way home, I thought better stop before it closes
And get some, pretty things for a pretty thing
Here I come through the door, bringing you more roses
Whatever else you want from me
Right now baby, I'm just here for you
I'll do anything you ask me to

[Chorus]
That's what you get for loving me
Two strong arms and a heart that won't stop for anything
The kind of man a woman needs
That's what you get
That's what you get for loving me
Yeah, for loving me

[Verse 2]
I know you've heard it all before, you don't like big talkers
Well, look who you're talking to
I ain't just carrying on, it's a promise, not an offer
I'll have your way with you
Honey I ain't leaving nothing out
Even things you've never thought about

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You want a man to hold you
Who’s never going to quit
Girl, I already told you
When you love me
That’s what you get

[Chorus]
