Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more, no more

They're killing for money
They're killing for power
They're killing for religion
They're killing for colour
Some say they're killing for peace
But the wars won't cease
When everyone one is wrong
No matter what kind of bomb, yeah

Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more, no more

You see, the grief is all the same
And the pain is like a chain
When rage is what remains
Then who are you to blame?
Let's stand up for the children
The motherless and fatherless
The world is just a mirror
Take a look upon yourselves

Cause heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
No, heaven can't take it no more
And heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more, no more

Now let's lift up all humanity
There's been too much tragedy
We can give each other love and respect
Now let's change our reality

Cause heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
(Zion train is coming our way)
Heaven can't take it
Heaven can't take it no more
(Soul train is coming our way)
Heaven can't take it
'Cause heaven can't take it no more
(Zion train is coming our way)
Heaven can't take it
No, heaven can't take it no more
(Soul train is coming our way)
Heaven can't take it
Say, heaven can't take it no more

(Zion train is)
A mother with her wolves
(Zion train is)
A child without a home
(Soul train is coming our way)
Refugees of war

A mother with her wolves
A child without a home
The refugees of war
