Want to play the game will try again and again
For myself to sell matches on reputation in human form
To suit the image you want portrayed so the people are still enslaved
You can not define what I do not put in a box for you

I go out, get out, get, get out, get out

I of the universe will not be prisoners of your little world
The mind is limitless where time does not exist
We travel far beyond the realms of expectations
And I refuse to be what you expect from me

I go out, get out, get, get out, get out

What you lose to win the price is high to pay
The desire to not be like them to follow the dream of sin
Blessed are the meek and humble spirit of my own
Cause music is a holy thing hey we give thanks for blessings

I go out, get out, get, get out, get out
My mom can go get papa
He said I'm gonna knock it down, said I would kick down
I go out, get out, get, get out, get out
