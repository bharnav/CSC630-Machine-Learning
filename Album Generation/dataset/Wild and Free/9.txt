I tell you everyday no don't walk that way
Do you hear a word I say
'Cause you keep going on and you keep living wrong
There's a price to be paid

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry

Go on walk out the door just remember the seeds you sow
Are the fruits that you reap
Now you been told before don't act like you don't know
When the truth speaks

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign
Maybe you need to maybe you need to maybe you need to cry

I tell you everyday please don't walk that way
Do you hear a word I say

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign
Maybe you need a maybe you need a maybe you need a sign
