[Intro]
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing

[Verse 1]
Stare into my Kodak Rome
Jack-hammer ice eyes
I never thought you'd see the
Asphalt crack, crack, crack like black eggshell

Don't ever say I never warned you from the start
Don't ever say I never warned you from the start
You're not a shovel and I'm not your dirt

Is there any way to unswallow my pride?
Can I fuck myself down?
Why die when you can kill the father?
Dad is missing an 'E'

Now Macbeth confessed Oedipus
No longer present tense
Now Macbeth confessed Oedipus
No longer present tense

No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason

[Chorus]
High and overneath
High and overneath

[Verse 2]
I won't regret letting you live
Even if you forgot what you never saved me from
So I say whatever or fornever

For, for, for, for, for, fornever
For, for, for, for, for, fornever
For, for, for, for, for, fornever
Whatever

The rape of Persephone
Was choreographed by all the wrong Greeks
The rape of Persephone
Was a marketing scheme

Rape, rape, rape per so phony
Rape, rape, rape per so phony
Rape, rape, rape per so phony
Rape, rape, rape per so phony

[Chorus]
High and overneath
High and overneath

[Bridge]
Overneath, overneath
Overblown, unbeloved, cannot be low
From the top of my lungs
To the bottom of my heart, I scream
At the chasm in between
And the path of misery

Overneath, overneath
Overblown, unbeloved, cannot be low
From the top of my lungs
To the bottom of my heart, I scream
At the chasm in between
And the path of misery

[Chorus]
High and overneath
High and overneath

[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason
