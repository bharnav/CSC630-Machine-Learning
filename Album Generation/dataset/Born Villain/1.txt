[Verse 1]
Crushing, cheating, changing
Am I deaf or dead? Is this constricting construction
Or just streets with rusty signs
Of something violent coming?

[Pre-Chorus]
This will hurt you worse than me
I'm weak seven days a week
Don't run from me, I won't
Bother counting 1, 2, 3

[Chorus]
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection

[Verse 2]
I can show myself how to make a noose
A gun's cliche and a razor, too
I'm not a death-trip vacation vacant station
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds

[Pre-Chorus]
This will hurt you worse than me
I'm weak seven days a week
Don't run from me, I won't
Bother counting 1, 2, 3

[Chorus]
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection

[Bridge]
You, you don't even want to know
What I'm going to do to you
You don't even want to know
What I'm going to do to you

[Chorus]
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection
