[Verse 1]
Sacrifice won't suffice
Resurrection needs your death to happen twice
Fall on my heart and burn and forge
Your tortured black-smitten into the sharpest, fucking sword

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be

[Chorus]
No sin eater to slay
Us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away

[Verse 2]
Christ consciousness manifest to the Golden Ratio
5 or 500 million years ago
We were 15 foot high and to die was a Bardot Bridge
We never thought we'd cross to burn down, behind and below

[Chorus]
No sin eater to slay
Us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away

[Interlude]
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be

[Bridge]
So take your little black book
I see the way that you look into it
I'll eat it and I'll cut my tongue

And all the pages you spread
"Sweet as honey", you said
But I'm choking on your bitter stories

[Chorus]
No sin eater to slay
Us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
