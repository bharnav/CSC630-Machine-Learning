[Verse 1]
And then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep and now it’s too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
We just keep on breaking the same old ground

[Chorus]
So you think that I asked for this?
Let me show you what I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this?
Come on, use your fists

[Verse 2]
And then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep and now it’s too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
We just keep on breaking the same old ground

[Chorus]
So you think that I asked for this?
Let me show you what I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this?
Come on, use your fists

[Bridge]
Then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep and now it’s too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
We just keep on breaking the same old ground

[Outro]
I am owned by death
And I am in love with oblivion
I am owned by death
And I am in love with oblivion
