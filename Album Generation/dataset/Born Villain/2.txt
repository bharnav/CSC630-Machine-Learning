[Verse 1]
You look so pretty when you cry
Don't wanna hit you, but the only thing
Between our love is a bloody nose
A busted lip and a blackened eye

You look so pretty when you cry
Don't wanna hit you, but the only thing
Between our love is a bloody nose
A busted lip and a blackened eye

[Chorus]
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped

(Cock, cock, cock it)

[Verse 2]
When I undo my belt
You melt and you walk away
With a red, red, red, red welt
Or so they say

When I undo my belt (Cock, cock, cock it)
You melt and you walk away (Cock, cock, cock it)
With a red, red, red, red welt
Or so they say

[Chorus]
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped

(Cock, cock, cock it)

[Bridge]
I wanna have your ache and beat you, too
I wanna have your ache and beat you, too
I wanna have your ache and beat you, too
I wanna have your ache and beat you, too

[Chorus]
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
(Cock, cock, cock it)
(Cock, cock, cock it)

You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
(Cock, cock, cock it)
(Cock, cock, cock it)

Cock, cock, cock it
