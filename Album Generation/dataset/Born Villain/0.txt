[Intro]
Hey, cruel world
You don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith
We've got fucking fate

Hey, cruel world
You don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith
We've got fucking fate

[Verse 1]
Creator, preserver, destroyer
Ask which one I am
There's no drugged-out devils
Or square-halo angels walking among us

I am among no one
I am among no one
I am among no one
No one

[Chorus]
Hey, cruel world
You don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith
We've got fucking fate

Fate, fate, fate!

[Verse 2]
The center of the universe cannot exist
When there are no, no edges
The center of the universe cannot exist
When there are no, no edges

[Chorus]
Hey, cruel world
You don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith
We've got fucking fate

Fate, fate, fate!

[Bridge]
I am among no one
I am among no one
I am among no one
I am among no one
No one

[Chorus]
Hey, cruel world
You don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith
We've got fucking fate

Fate, fate, fate!
Fate, fate, fate!
Fate, fate, fate!
