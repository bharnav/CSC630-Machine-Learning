[Verse 1]
Do you always have to hire actors
To play the devils that talk me
Out of my sui-sites?

You're just a ring tone that happens when
You get sick enough to call the one
With bullet holes, bullet holes for eyes

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels

[Verse 2]
I broken open the box
When I spoke the spell and I became
An entrance wound to your bedroom grave
And I was paid with the shadow of consensual rape

Your ransom note is quoted by
Your death and birth certificates
And all of your love, and all of your love letters
Read just like my will

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels

[Bridge]
I don’t have to see to know that murderers
Are getting prettier every day
I don’t have to see to know that murderers
Are getting prettier every day
I don’t have to see to know that murderers
Are getting prettier every day

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices of someone else's angels
