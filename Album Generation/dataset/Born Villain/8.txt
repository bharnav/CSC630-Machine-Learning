[Verse 1]
And I could look into the crowded morgue of mistakes
The sun stopped its smile and frowned on me, too
My rebuilt, remastered heart is smashed into its faces
And its face is confused

I cut my throat in two, I said sorry to you
For being a fool, but I didn't want forgiveness
It was regret, not an apology
It was regret, regret, regret

[Chorus]
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
You're with me, against me
But the only thing, forever, is hate

[Verse 2]
I forget what I saw before and after that day
I'd trade all I was worth to make myself into
The handsomest gun and put the diamond bullet
Into your "404 ERROR" face

[Chorus]
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
You're with me, against me
But the only thing, forever, is hate

[Bridge]
And I'm an event that everybody knows
You decide if you can live
Or you decide to let someone decide for you

[Chorus]
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
Dis, dis, dis, disengaged
You're with me, against me
But the only thing, forever, is hate
