[Intro]
I'm not man enough to be human
But I'm trying to fit in
And I'm learning to fake it

[Verse 1]
Don't ever meet their friends
Tells you too much or not enough
Or worse, exactly the wrong thing
Every nuance, every detail
Every movement, every smell

Sound, phrase, inflection, the way she laughs
These are all the things that you either obsessively fetishize
Or make yourself grow to love
Although you are supposed to be done growing
She is still growing

It's like a garden with two flowers
One just blooming and casting a shadow, just like yours
And then it becomes a struggle
Of sunlight or rain or weeds

[Pre-Chorus]
She and every she
Is doomed to be your idea of her
She and every she
Is doomed to be your idea of her

[Chorus]
I'm not man enough to be human
But I'm trying to fit in
And I'm learning to fa-fa-fa-fake it

[Verse 2]
But worse so, back to the point
You are no longer the flower and the sun
And most importantly the garden or the gardener
A muse, your amusement, I am used
It's all ruined if you meet their friends

[Pre-Chorus]
She and every she
Is doomed to be your idea of her
She and every she
Is doomed to be your idea of her

[Chorus]
I'm not man enough to be human
But I'm trying to fit in
And I'm learning to fa-fa-fa-fake it

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fake it

[Bridge]
You never wanted to share
Your concept of your creation
With any other gods or worshippers

Your book isn't burned
It was never written
Your book isn't burned
It was never written

[Chorus]
I'm not man enough to be human
But I'm trying to fit in
And I'm learning to fa-fa-fa-fake it

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fake it
Fa-fa-fa-fake it
