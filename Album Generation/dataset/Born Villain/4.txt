[Verse 1]
You've got your hell's teeth smiling at you
It keeps your brain safe as it all eats at your face
And don't worry, we'll blur it out
And no one ever will know

[Chorus]
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion

[Verse 2]
Pump in the laughter of dead-audience applause
And teenage rape candidates, I think we got ourselves a real hit
Don't we wish that we could feel something
More than hate and morbid panic?

Morbid panic
Hate and morbid panic

[Chorus]
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion

[Verse 3]
And I'm the host with Vaseline
I hide behind bulletproof glass
And I can feel your tits with my new camera
Equipped with a flash

Fast-food-nude, I hate you all, but somehow
You find me incredibly charming

[Chorus]
Slow motion
Slow motion

[Outro]
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot in slow motion
