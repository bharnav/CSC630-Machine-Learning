[Verse 1]
I'm not of this world, you're not in this heart
This isn't in me
To open this box, you can't shoot the lock
I hide everything so you can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms

[Chorus]
There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key, so lay down your arms
Arms, arms

[Verse 2]
You're a book, every page is written
In words I cannot read
So I burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
So I burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms

[Chorus]
There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key, so lay down your arms

[Bridge]
There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key, so lay down your arms

[Outro]
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
