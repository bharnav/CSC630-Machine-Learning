(hup, hup, hup)

Well, hello everybody why don't you pull up a chair
I why don't you tell me a story cause I really do care about
Talking, talking, talking away

Here's to me, to you, to us
To everything hope it never falls apart
And we're talking, talking, talking away

Well you look so fine, and you seem so kind
And I gotta say that I'm having a good time
Dancing, dancing, dancing away

Here's, to me, to you, to us
To everything I hope it never falls apart
And we're dancing, dancing, dancing away

(hup, hup, hup)

Could things get any better now?
If they can, I cannot see how
But as the time goes by, you stop and sigh
You stop and sigh and then you wonder why

I can't stop the feelin' as I'm walkin' away
And I can never understand half the things you say
And we're walking, walking, walking away

So I said here's to me, to you, to us
To everything before it fell apart
And were walking, walking, walking away

Things were better then
You felt that you had to pretend
But as time goes by
You stop and sigh
You stop and sigh and then you wonder why
