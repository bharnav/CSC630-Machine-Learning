Not long ago in my high school days
I watched a girl from far so away
But every time she passed me by
I turned my head away and quietly sighed
And when she walked by her hair would dance
A secret tango that only I could understand
And when she'd ask me for the time of day
I'd look her in the eyes and quietly say

Oh Kristina, Kristina, do you have any clue who I am? (HELL NO!)
So listen up cause I'll tell ya once and I'll explain myself the best that I can, whoa
Kristina, Kristina you don't know me so I'll have to persist, (whistle)
I'm kinda shy so no wonder why
Kristina, she don't know I exist

From class to class, I followed her
But I swore I'd leave her undisturbed
And if she'd ever stopped and turned around
I'd get so nervous that I'd stare at the ground
And then one day in photography
I found a contact print that I could not believe
And there she was staring back at me
So I took her home so quietly

1.17.98 has been a day that I've come to hate
As I walked into the video store
There she stood as my jaw fell to the floor
Tapping her toe, and waiting in line
With a movie and another guy
Why did I bother, why did I care
About this girl named Kristina Behr?

Kristina, Kristina, you'll never get to know who I am (YOUR LOSS!)
This is goodbye so please don't cry and ill let you down as softly as I can
Kristina, Kristina, another name to cross off my list
Another life, it could've been nice, but Kristina she won't know what she missed
