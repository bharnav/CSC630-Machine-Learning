He wakes up sad again and he wonders when the rain will end
She acts like she don’t care cause to her it’s just a game, that he plays
I’m a super, I’m a nothing, I’m a no one, goin’ nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don’t care
I’m a super, I’m a nothing, I’m a no one, goin’ nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don’t care

All the times he said he would she never really understood
What he said, or what he meant, he won't forget what wasn't said
He’ll find himself alone standing in the rain
I’m a super, I’m a nothing, I’m a no one, goin’ nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don’t care
I’m a super, I’m a nothing, I’m a no one, goin’ nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don’t care

He wakes up sad again and he wonders when the rain will end
She acts like she don’t care cause to her it’s just a game, that he plays, yeah
I’m a super, I'm a nothin’, I’m a no one, going nowhere fast
But I don’t care
I’m a super, I'm a nothin’, I’m a no one, going nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don't care

All the times he said he would she never really understood
What he said, or what he meant, he won't forget what wasn't said
He’ll find himself alone standing in the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah
I’m a super all or nothin’, I’m a no one, going nowhere fast
But I don’t care
I’m a super all or nothin’, I’m a no one, going nowhere fast
But I don’t care, but I don’t care
