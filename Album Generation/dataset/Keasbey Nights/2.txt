It was the summer of 95
(So what!)
In the backyard, shaving the old plies
Feeling so strong (strong!), something went wrong (wrong!)
Straight into my finger, what a stinger, it was so long
I still remember that day, like the day that I said that I swear
"I'll never hurt myself again"
But it seems that I'm deemed to be wrong
To be wrong
To be wrong
Gotta keep holding on
They always played a slow song

When they come for me, I'll be sitting at my desk
With a gun in my hand, wearing a bulletproof vest
Singing "My, my, my, how the time does fly
When you know you're going to die by the end of the night."
And said hey

I still remember when we were young and fragile then
No one gave a shit about us because times were tougher then
Feeling so good (good!) cruisin' the hood (hood!)
Straight into the real world where rich kids never understood
But I don't care
I can fade away to anywhere
Don't stop
Because you might get dropped
And if you do who's going to pick you up
Well I won't
Well I won't...
They always played a slow song

When they come for me, I'll be sitting at my desk
With a gun in my hand, wearing a bulletproof vest
Singing "My, my, my, how the time does fly
When you know you're going to die by the end of the night."
And said hey

When they come for me, I'll be sitting at my desk
With a gun in my hand, wearing a bulletproof vest
Singing "My, my, my, how the time does fly
When you know you're going to die by the end of the night."

When they come for me, I'll be sitting at my desk
With a gun in my hand, wearing a bulletproof vest
Singing "My, my, my, how the time does fly
When you know you're going to die by the end of the night."

When they come for me, I'll be sitting at my desk
With a gun in my hand, wearing a bulletproof vest
Singing "My, my, my, how the time does fly
When you know you're going to die by the end of the night."

And said hey
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
