You, you try, you try to get by
You're never going to pull it off
You shouldn't even try
You're a wet cigarette
You're always second best
They're never going to give a shit about anybody but themselves
So you fight for them to realize
There's more to life
There's more to you
There's more than meets the eye
And when you're done, the battle's been won
You sit back, you smile
And this is what you hum, you hum
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

(Years!) go by, the time it does fly, (Whoa oh oh)
Every single second is a moment in time, (Whoa oh oh)
That passes oh so quick, and it seems like nothing, (Whoa oh oh)
But when you're looking back, well it amounts to everything
(Whoa) I've got myself, I've got my friends, (Whoa oh oh)
I've got my little family, but that's not where it ends, (Whoa oh oh)
This one goes out to you, it goes out to everyone, (Whoa oh oh)
It's in the name of honesty because life has just begun
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

Look around little brother can you tell me what you see?
You're a big boy now, so take responsibility
You never had it hard, well now it's getting tough
So you (whine! whine! whine!) and you say you've had enough
You say I'm full of shit, that I'm a hypocrite
I shouldn't talk when I can't take the advice that I give
Well maybe you're right, but open your eyes:
The main difference here is that I (try! try! try!)

(Talking)
One: Please describe the experience of making the new album
Making the record was not unlike shipping out peach pits

Two: What took so long to make it?
Did it take long? If so, it's because we're very busy. Bands make almost nothing from record sales, so we were out touring in order to pay rent. Plus some other reasons but we are keeping quiet

Three: What is the record exactly? As it is called Keasbey Nights but no-one knows yet what the record contains
It's Keasbey Nights. We wanted to get it right for once. Plus it helps me sleep at night knowing blood, sweat, and tears were put into a record as opposed to making people pay thirteen bucks for a record and they only get flashy new cover art. This release is a preemptive strike, I guess. Whatever you want to call it, it'll piss people off, and that, at the end of the day, is all that really matters

This confuses me. Aren't they paying thirteen bucks for a record they already own? Because that is what I thought was happening, sounds like I have it wrong?
Yep, you've got it wrong. If there's one thing I can't stand it's when a CD is re-released untouched sonically, with a new cover and maybe a live video, and kids are duped into buying this new edition of something they already have. I was upset when I was told the guys were going to do this for Keasbey, so I offered to re-record it because I've always thought it sounded like pure garbage sound-wise. Plus the budgets we get are laughable, particularly for a band with seven musicians to record. So we used some of our own money and took our time with this one. I'll tell you right now, we have no intent on hiding our intentions. We wanted to prevent the re-release of Keasbey untouched as well as get the record to sound how it should have sounded originally. For that we sacrificed months of our time and our money, and now we feel what we have is worth paying for. Although, truth be told, I don't care if a single record is sold, as it is indeed old music, and kids have a right to know what it is and to decide whether or not they'll pay for it. Do I think it's worth thirteen dollars? Yes, very much so, but that's my opinion. What other people decide, that's their own opinion. We're going to keep doing what we do whether or not a single record is sold. We're going to keep doing what we do whether or not a single record is sold. We're going to keep doing what we do whether or not a single record is sold. We're going to keep doing what we do whether or not a single record is sold. We're going to keep doing what we do whether or not a single record is sold

Wow. Okay. First time I have heard it said that this is the same songs. Every time you were asked, you skirt that issue
Whatever you want to call it, we will piss people off. And that, at the end of the day, is all that really matters. As my good friend always says, you are indeed a cassette, and unfortunately just don't get it

Peace out, bitches
