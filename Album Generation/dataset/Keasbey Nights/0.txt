[Verse 1]
Run, run, run all you do is fucking run
But you'll never run away from yourself
I know it's hard but you've been there before
And you know you're gonna be there again
I don't care what the stars may say
Because they always feed their bullshit to me
It's kinda sad how you lost what you had
And you're never gonna have it again
And so I say:

[Chorus]
Hey Sergio, you've got to get us out of here
And so I say:
Hey Sergio, it's getting kind of hot in here
And so I say:
Hey

[Verse 2]
Every other day you don't care what they say
Because they always leave you two steps behind
You try to smile and it lasts for a while
But they always send you back to the start
Eenie meenie miney mo they shoot down everyone you know
And then they leave you there all alone
You wish they'd stop but they never give up
And you know deep inside that you're stuck
And so I say:

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sergio laughed for the last time today
He said It never really bothered me:
We all have dues to pay
Like a man that's cut off at the knee
He hobbles, and hobbles because nothing is free
So wake up, wake up, wake up
But don't cry because you'll fuck up your make up
And if you do, you won't get laid
You won't make money, no you won't get paid
And you act so free, you act so free
Everybody's laughing because you act so free
Well you might fool them
But you can't fool me with your mindless chatter
Like I don't need them, I don't need help
I don't even need to see the end

[Chorus]
