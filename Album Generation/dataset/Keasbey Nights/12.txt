She was diagnosed on a Friday
The kids were almost home
The kids were on their way back home from school
Lying face down in the gutter
Of unaccomplished dreams
And broken memories of things to come
"Sorry ma'am, I really am. I had to break the news
I had to make the phone call to tell you that you're due
You know where, I'll tell you when
And I suggest that you start living these next three weeks
The best way that you can."

Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind, I could swear, I could swear, I heard her say:
Don't wait for me, you've got a lot to do, you've got a lot to be
And in the end, maybe I'll see you there

Lost her strength on a Saturday
Spent the day in bed
"Yeah, I'm fine, it's just the flu" she said with a smile
But when they turned their backs
The tears would flow
She knew she only had a while, to live
To breathe, to be, to see, to bleed
To stand on her own two weakened feet
"And so I pray everyday: don't take my mother away"

Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind, I could swear, I could swear, I heard her say:
Don't wait for me, you've got a lot to do, you've got a lot to be
And in the end, maybe I'll see you there

Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind, I could swear, I could swear, I heard her say:
Don't wait for me, you've got a lot to do, you've got a lot to be
And in the end, maybe I'll see you there
And in the end, you know I'll see you there
And in the end I'll see you there

Don't wait for me, you've got a lot to do, you've got a lot to be
And in the end, maybe I'll see you there
