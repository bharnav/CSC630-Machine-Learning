I got no cash, got no girl, got the world in the palm of my hand
I don't care if you care, or if you understand
Cause I'm a little kid and I've got little problems, yeah
And I don't give a shit if you don't even understand

I got me (But I got me)
That's all I need (that's all I need)
And I live comfortably (and I live comfortably)
And I sleep peacefully, GO!

I give up, I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna be near
You, your friends, your dime a dozen miseries
I don't care if you care about the way you wear your hair
Your shoes, your idiot attitude
Don't stop 'cause I wanna hear your problems
Don't stop 'cause I wanna help you solve them
Don't stop whatever I might say got a problem
About your day, I'm moving things out the way

I GIVE UP!
I GOT NO CASH!
