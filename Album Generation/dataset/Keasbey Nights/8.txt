Staring out the window of somebody's pickup truck
Well I never mind the boredom cause I use it for a crutch
Just to get me to that plane
It's a different state of sane
And every time I try to change I always end up quite the same
Thinking back to happier days
When everyone was ignorant
And all the kids behaved
But me and my friends and the ice cream man
That was our existence, that was our clan
This one goes out to the friends I never had:

Hey I don't understand but I'd like to anyway
Hey I don't understand but I like it anyway
Hey I don't understand but I like you anyway
Hey I don't understand

Shelter in the city
We decided to go in
And I gave a man some money to buy heroin
But the homeless man returned and he gave me back a dime
He said, "put it in your sock my friend and save it for another time"
But: lessons are learned and later unlearned
If he knew then what he knows now
Well he could rule the world
But I'm not one to judge what happened yesterday
Cause I got me, I got myself, my future is at stake
