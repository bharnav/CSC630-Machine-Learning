V1)
All around the sky's are falling down
A new kind of sound, the smile becomes a frown
Wait for me now to run
Run towards the sun that will not shine
A just reward we're searching for the sign
Wait for me now to run

Ch)
Now is the time for a new generation today
Now is the time for a new generation today â€“ oh today

V2)
Clear your eyes to wounds that will not heel
Talk it out alone
Wait for me now to run

Ch)

Now is the time for a new generation today
Now is the time for a new generation today
Now is the time for a new generation the sun the moon and the holy nation
Now is the time for a new generation today

M8)
You gotta love the life that you live the most
You gotta love the life that you lead
You gotta love the life, you gotta love the life
You gotta love

Ch)

Now is the time for a new generation today
Now is the time for a new generation today
Now is the time for a new generation the sun the moon and the holy nation
Now is the time for a new generation today
