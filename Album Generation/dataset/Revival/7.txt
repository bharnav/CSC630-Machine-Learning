You taught me everything I know
How I should never hide my feelings
So tell now I'm not alone
Well I can't remember, I can't forget
Do you know that I will carry on? D' you know that I will carry on
You don't have to worry, I will never let you fall
And you know that I will carry on
At least you left when you were strong
More when her tears should not be shedding
The seven years have come and gone
But I can't help hoping that you return
Do you know that I will carry on? D' you know that I will carry on
You don't have to worry, I will never let you fall
And you know that I will carry on
If I can hear you tell me everything is all right
I`ll give it all if I hear you tell me that is all right
Do you know that I will carry on? D' you know that I will carry on
You don't have to worry, I will never let you fall
And you know that I will carry oooooooon
And you know!!.....that I will carry on
You don't have to worry, I will never let you fall
And you know I will carry on
