I met a woman walking on the highway
She said she don't why but she knows she couldn't stay
After digging deeper, I struck pure gold
She told me time is mine and the world is my own
I ask her where are we going
She said we've arrived without knowing
I got nowhere, I can turn
I take my chances I don't care if I burn
On that freeway I would spend my days
I take my chances I may never return
Come back again
I've watched the world collapse by the road side
They're gonna free us all we were born to collide
But the birds, the clouds and a blue blue sky
We'll follow down the path in our minds, yeah
I ask her where are we going
She said we've arrived without knowing
I got nowhere, I can turn
I take my chances I don't care if I burn
On that freeway I would spend my days
I take my chances I may never return
I got nowhere......
I got nowhere, I can turn
I take my chances I don't care if I burn
On that freeway I would spend my days
I take my chances I may never return
I got nowhere, I can turn
I take my chances I don't care if I burn
On that freeway I would spend my days
I take my chances we may never return
No, we may never return
Come back again
