I whisper in the wind
This journey reach its end
They said that you and I are the breakaways
Take me in your flow
You're my tornado
I can hear you howl as the day unfolds
You're my tornado
You brought the house down
You do it everytime
Let me breath you in
You're changing everything
This strenght you hold inside it can never day
Intoxicate my soul
You're my tornado
I can hear you howl as the day unfolds
You're my tornado
Save me, leave me, break me down
For as long as I can go but never called the rebel in that
And I hope you don't freeze by the side of the road
Now I got no more needs in the back where you slope
I believe you can save me
I'll drag you down, you're the devil I know
The rebel called tornado
You're my tornado
I can hear you howl as the day unfolds
You're my tornado
