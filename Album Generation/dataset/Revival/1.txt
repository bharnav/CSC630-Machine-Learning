I've got nothing left, I've got nothing to give
I guess you gotta know I'm beginning to loose my grip
And I told that I wanna be free, yes I told you that I wanna be free
Like a skin over the hill I see the brave
I, I am ready, I am ready to face your (??? chain maybe?), yeah
New horizon, new horizons ahead, (Again/I can't), (no/know)
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
Come on!
So come on!
You fight rough, you know you've got your dirty ways
You said all I really needed was a lover and a great escape
There's a danger that we're gonna ignite, a danger that we're gonna ignite
A danger that we're gonna ignite this dark sky
Liberation, liberation to dream (yes, ???)
So keep on swinging, swinging high through the air, (up there?), oh!
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
And you lead us, to war
You lead me to ruin before, yeah
So lead, us, to war
Lead, us, to war
You lead me to ruin before, yeah
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
Use me, won't you use me, won't you use me
Come on, use me!
