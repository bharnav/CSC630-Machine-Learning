One last warning
Forgive Me not coming
I'll be gone in the mornin'
So come on, Step over to me!

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Trouble entered so fast
So hard to call me low-mans
Ran for the record-stand
Baby, take my hand
You'll be the death of Me!

She's in Love to occupy
This hollowed space I left behind
I've got Trouble on the Knees
On the Knees!

I need a High-Speed rebel
To send me to heaven
2,3,4,5 steps taken
Come on, step over to Me!

Livin' in a shoe-box
I can't afford a whole-lot
Trouble made me Tic-Tac-To me
I could play my part before i die!

I've got Trouble at my Door
In my bed and on my Floor
I see Trouble everyday
Everyday!

I need a High-Speed rebel
To send me to heaven
2,3,4,5 steps taken
Come on, step over to Me!
Yes, I do!
I need a High-Speed rebel
To send me to heaven
2,3,4,5 steps taken
Come on, step over to Me!
Yeah!

How many times
Do I refuse to read the signs
Now I'm standing in the door
I'm in the Light!
Oh, how many times
Do I refuse to read the signs, ahead!

I need a High-Speed rebel
To send me to heaven
2,3,4,5 steps taken
Come on, step over to Me!
Yes, I do!
I need a High-Speed rebel
To send me to heaven
2,3,4,5 steps taken
Come on, step over to Me!

One last warning
Forgive Me not coming
I'll be gone in the mornin'
So come on, Step over to me!
