Can I hear ya Cry
All because of something that I said?
I never tried to compromise
This Tunnel-Vision swimmin' in my Head!

I'm not the Man you want!
You won't find no harmony!
I'm not the Man you want!
Why don't you break out!

So Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!
So Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!

Use my Circumstance
Bury Me and cover up those scars
Don't you tear your tears
You got to listen to your Heart!

I'm not the Man you want!
You won't find no harmony!
I'm not the Man you want!
Why don't you break out!

Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!
So Don't waste your Tears!

No, I don't ever wanna see your Face again!
I don't ever wanna see your Face again!
No, I don't ever wanna hear that, chum-chum-whistle blowin'!
Don't You waste your Tears on Me!

I'm a liar, yes I am!
Lost my Fire long ago!
Call Me worthless any-day, darlin'
Don't ever say I never told You so...

Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!
So Don't waste your Tears!
Don't waste your Tears!

I really do know
That I gotta Let ya go!
Yes, I don't need you anymore!
You'll do better on your own!
Yes, I really do know
That I gotta Let ya go!
I don't need you anymore!

So DON'T WASTE...Your tears!
