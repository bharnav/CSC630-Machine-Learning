[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting, no fighting (we got the refugees up in here)
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

[Hook 1a: Wyclef Jean]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (hey, yeah)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama (si!), bonita (si!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

[Hook 1b: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh baby, when you talk like that (hey)
You make a woman go mad (yeah)
So be wise (si!) and keep on (si!)
Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

[Hook 2: Shakira]
I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (let's go)

[Hook 1a: Wyclef Jean]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama (si!), bonita (si!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

[Hook 1b: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh baby, when you talk like that (oh)
You make a woman go mad (oh)
So be wise (si!) and keep on (si!)
Reading the signs of my body

[Hook 2: Shakira]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby, así es perfecto

[Hook 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
They know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verse 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Baila en la calle de noche Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche Baila en la calle de día

[Hook 1a: Wyclef Jean]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish (yeah)
Cómo se llama (si!), bonita (si!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

[Hook 1b: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh baby, when you talk like that (oh)
You knew you got me hypnotized (yeah)
So be wise (si! uh) and keep on (si! uh)
Reading the signs of my body (yeah)

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies si! (hey, yeah)
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así (yeah), say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (uh-huh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

[Hook 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (no fighting)

[Hook 2: Shakira]
Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

[Outro: Wyclef Jean &  Shakira]
No fighting, no fighting
