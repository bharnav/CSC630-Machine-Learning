[Verse 1]
Who would've thought that you could hurt me
The way you've done it
So deliberate, so determined
And since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
And question my own questions on and on
So tell me now, tell me now
Why you're so far away
When I'm still so close

[Chorus]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to be attentive
To all you wanted
Always supportive, always patient
What did I do wrong?
Been wondering for days and hours
It's clear, it isn't here where you belong
Anyhow, anyhow
I wish you both all the best
I hope you get along

[Chorus]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Outro]
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
