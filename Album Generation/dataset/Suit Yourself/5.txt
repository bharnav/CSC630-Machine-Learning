Ramble with an overtone
This queen lives without a drone
Searching lights they lead me home
I won't die alone

Gamble with your old wife's money
You might need to call her honey
Nights are black and days are sunny
I won't die alone

Hot white cake and ice cold coffee
Get this creepy monkey off me
Stomp and rant but do it softly
I won't die alone

Wait and watch and paint and powder
Turn the noise up make it louder
I can't leave here as a coward
I won't die alone

Wipe your head and be not sweaty
This room feels a little heavy
I ain't worried I am ready
I won't die alone

It's raining on my love parade
Look at what a mess I made
It's all a joke a big charade
I won't die alone

This is easy this is gravy
I feel like a little baby
This feels like a natural fade
I won't die alone
I won't die alone
