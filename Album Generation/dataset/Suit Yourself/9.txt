You look like an art piece floating in my mind
And I am told fortunes are gold
Fortunes are gold
Bucket loads of gratitude I feel for you
You are fine. I pour you like wine, pour you like wine

As the desert sky turns into shadow light
Beside me on my bed tonight
Your love is the only light I see
You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown
Tonight

You seem like a memory that I've always known
And it has shown as long as I go, long as I go
Safe and lost forever in a fantasy
Tosses and turns. My heart never yearns. My heart never yearns

There's no better place to be than in your eyes
There's no other sight to see
You're the cornbread and iced tea of life

You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown tonight
Oh how I'm shown
Goodnight
