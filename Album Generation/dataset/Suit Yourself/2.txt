Hey Baby
What's going on with you?
Hey Baby
Want to get it on with you
I've tried so many nights
Don't know what to do
Hey baby
Got something to say and it is and it is

I Cry Everyday
I Cry Everyday I Cry Everyday
I Cry Everyday

Hey Darling
Got a little news for you
Don't need your sympathy
Just want a little care from you

I Cry Everyday
I Cry Everyday
I Cry Everyday
I Cry Everyday

Chorus
