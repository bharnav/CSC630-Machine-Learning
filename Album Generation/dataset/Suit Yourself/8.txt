Can't believe the words you said your voice keeps hitting me in the head
I remember when you told me you'd never say mean things like that
Thought you had your love in tact but I was wrong thinking things like that
Might be time to reconsider what my plans have been

Cause when the girls walked by I could see that you never really wanted to be with me
Out the corner of your eye you were saying hi you're never satisfied

You don't have a heart
You don't have a soul
You don't see things clear and baby I'm too old
To teach you about love
Or get down on my knees
I wish you the best but it's time for me to leave
No, You don't have a heart

Oh I used to think that you had it all you said the words and I'd start to crawl
What a fool believes is the everything
Oh I must have had a head made out of wood wasn't thinking with my brain like I know I should
My heart led the way but I'm not ashamed

Cause when a woman's blind to all the heartaches she never knows the price she's gonna have to pay
You stole my heart and took my pride but I'll survive and come out on the other side

Chorus

Oh we all reap what we all sow your times coming you don't even know
Itâ€˜s worth the wait to watch you burn
I'm front row center as the tables turn

Chorus
