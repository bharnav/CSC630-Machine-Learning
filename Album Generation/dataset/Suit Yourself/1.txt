I thought I was moving but my legs were broken
Words were coming out but they were left unspoken
Maybe I was dreaming in my head, in my head

Memories were noted but I hadn't lived them
Swords were on my heart but I had long forgived them
Funny how the hurtful voices seem to slip away

Where Am I Now
I don't know how
I wound up in this place again
How Am I now
Just bringing me down
I'm looking for a house where the door is open
My body's moving fast but my spirit's broken
Where Am I Now

Oh anytime you break and turn the cycles change
Water starts pouring down your face again
You find yourself falling in the safety net you used to call home

When you focus all your little thoughts and troubles
To the place of clear and cloudy clouds that rumble
Standing in a field of open avenues with no place to go

Repeat chorus

Oh my lips are set and parted but my head is empty
I try to spit it out but it won't resempt me
From feeling like it's out in the open said and done

Telling's just talking that turns into speeches
Doesn't aid the body with the hand that reaches
Stumble in the void to find there's no one there

Chorus
