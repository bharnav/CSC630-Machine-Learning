Cold on a Friday afternoon
You’re on the other side of the room
Even with the fire going strong
It’s chilly when I think about us
Living all alone
If I thought a million bucks
Could make you want to just stand up
And walk into my love like before
I’d rob a rich mans diamond mine
And make you be my valentine
Say the word and I’ll be come
A thief
Voice in the wind sings through the trees
Reminds me of the nights together, you and me
As we sit parted listening to the wind
I think of you and hope you’ll want me
Once again
