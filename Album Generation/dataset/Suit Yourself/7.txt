Got some news today from the radio man
He spoke the words softly and as somber as he can
The world stood still and the sky opened up
Made my way to fill up my coffee cup
Then it occurred to me as the daylight sky shone blue
Today's the day that
Johnny met June

He waited a while he knew that he would
He was gonna hang around here for as long a he could
The days went by and hours idle passed
He was never sure just how long he would last
But there's not much love in a lonely room
Today's the day that
Johnny met June

Hey my darlin' hey my sweet
I've waited on the day that I knew we would meet
Hey my sun, hey my moon
Today's the day that
Johnny met June

Now were starting over it's the place that we are
You look more than pretty underneath all the stars
Love, love is a burning thing
Oh how I still love to hear you sing
And everything we ever heard about heaven is true
Today's the day that Johnny met June
Today's the day that Johnny met June
