My back porch is not a grand location
Than a lovely little spot where I might go vacation
It's just that it's never been noticed before
Washington decided to open the door

To all the trees within a hundred mile radius
They want us all to pray and then they'll protect us
But make sure you wear your mask with a smiley face
Oh yeah man

I'm so glad that my Dandy's old
And I'm so glad he's past the point of being told
To evacuate his house for his old bodies safety
To the place he walked on when he was a baby

Kept in a darkened room
With earthworms and big dirty mushrooms
Oh thanks for the death sentence man
Oh thank you Man

Somebody's been up there lining his pockets
While the poor folks bleed from there eyeball sockets
Somewhere a Mama's boy in a seersucker suit
Ate a buttermilk biscuit and took the loot

Loaded up the Cadillac for a rendezvous
To the Gulf beach where everybody just shoots the moon
Oh thank a lot man
I guess you want to unwind man
Thank you man

Cause you know
You're the man
