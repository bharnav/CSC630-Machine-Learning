Don't know where the time has gone
Must have lost it in the night
Maybe when it was when I was holding on
Couldn't get you out of my sight
Maybe this is trying to tell us something
Maybe we're doing something right

Chorus:
You just Go With It
You know it feels good
Go With It
You know it feels good
You Do it, do it , do it, do it, do it, do it
Just let go

You never looked so beautiful to me
Maybe it's the love in your eyes
Together we fit perfect darling
Don't let another moment go by

Maybe this is the real thing baby
Maybe this is what it is

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Kiss me darling
So we can start all over again
So we can be sure it's just not in our heads
Hold me real close so we don't ever worry
I won't be without you again

Repeat Chorus
