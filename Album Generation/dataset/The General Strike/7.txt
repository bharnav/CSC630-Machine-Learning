[Intro/Chorus]
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

[Verse 1]
Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
It moves too fast
I got no chance
A freight train racing set to crash

[Chorus]
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

[Verse 2]
Wake up wondering: “How’ did I get here?”
Then cross my heart and say a fuckin’ prayer
Ecstasy, tears, bravery, fears
This boat may float, but it don’t steer

[Chorus]
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

[Verse 3]
Life’s long and winding roads leading us
To a never ending trail to keep our youth
It flashes by in lessons painfully attained
Blood and sweat, black and blue
Some surrender I got nothing to surrender to

[Chorus x2]
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

So now you’re livin’
So now you’re livin’

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

[Outro]
Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
