They’re sleeping between satin sheets
While huddled masses sleep in streets
Tucked in at night they lay and dream
Of corporate state theocracy

Two steps ahead, three goose steps back

While the sheep sleep the wolf attacks

Nothing recedes
Nothing recedes like progress

Evil doesn’t stop to breathe, bleed till nothing’s left to bleed

You’re contemplating middle ground
While empire heads release the hounds
You’re dealing with a sick machine
Where there’s no heart, there’s no heart beat

Two steps ahead, three goose steps back

The masses sleep while their spines cracks

Nothing recedes
Nothing recedes like progress

Evil doesn’t stop to breathe, bleed till nothing’s left to bleed

This is class war

What are you waiting for?

For them to buy and sell your soul?
They already did

No rest for the wicked, for the wicked never sleep
