Faceless, mindless storm troopers

No heart, no soul, no care

The fist of corprotocracy, they serve their master’s will
Resist. We won’t back down, we’ll never die

I got something to say and I’ll say it again

I got something to sing and I’ll sing it again

I got something to scream and I’ll scream it again
