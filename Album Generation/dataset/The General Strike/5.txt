Times up!
You’re outta luck and your back’s up against the wall
From Tunisia to Washington the people are calling: “No!”

Your gas n guns, your clubs n thugs, your lies on the TV

None of that can save you now as your reign is swept away

Get up! Get up!
Your voices are needed
Become, become the pulse of the revolution
In the ranks of the masses risin’

Another shakedown and a slap in the face
And he know he’d had had enough
He doused himself in gasoline, took a breath, and lit a match

She said: “I will go down to Tehrir Square and I will stand alone

And if you have any dignity, I won’t be on my own.”

Get up! Get up!
Your voices are needed
Become, become the pulse of the revolution
In the ranks of the masses risin’
