Deceitful lie
Alibi's
Bullshit opportunist
With a disregard for fall guys
No collar crime
Stolen design
Spineless snitch
You can't see beyond your own eyes
Conceited time
Hoarding flies
You're so vain
The shit on your nose worn with pride
Absent mind
Covert disguise
Shit shining timeserver
You'd f*ck your own mother just to get a bit ahead of the calm
This separation
This disconnect
This is more than ignorance
This is more than disrespect
"If not for me who would it be?"
And still we close our eyes and drown ourselves in apathy
And still we cover our ears and pray to god to cure disease
This separation
This disconnect
This is more than ignorance
This is more than disrespect
"If not for me who would it be?"
Redefining what wealth is
Redesigning what success is
Who gives a f*ck who you are?
