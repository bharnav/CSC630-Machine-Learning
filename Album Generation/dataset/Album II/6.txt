They go round and round in circles
Out to find your weakness and to see
If you thinking
You going to make it - then
They try to change your mind

They think you work for money
But you got a thirst for something more than just
Another piece of the pie
You want to change your life

You will reap
What you sow
So be true wherever you go
You will have
What you say
That's the way that true love is made

They misuse you
Cause confusion
Just enough to make you act a fool
If you let it
You regret it ? so
Don't ever lose you cool (naw)
You got to think of others
You love em like your sister or you brother
And you only do
What you want done unto to you

You will reap
What you sow
So be true wherever you go
You will have
What you say
That's the way that true love is made
