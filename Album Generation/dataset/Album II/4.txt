I'll give you all my heart, all the time
Through the rays of the sun
Through the darkness of night
I'll sing you melody that it'll make you see
Through the windows of time
Heal all your heart aches
And while you're strong enough to let love
Let it set you free... whooo-oooh girl, yeah

I'll heed your every word, feel every phrase
I'll remember what you say
All your memories will be mine
You will never have to roam, you are always home
Have you refuge in my heart, our love is sacred
And while you're strong enough to let love
Let it set you free... let it set you free...yeah heyay

You've gotten over breaking your heart, there's
No better place to be, so open it up come go with me
And let love, set you free...
Hey...let it set you free girl
Whooo heyay...let it set you free

(Choir)
Through the rays of the sun (come on babe) through the darkness of night
Let it set you free
I'll remember what you say; all your memories will be mine
Let it set you free
You will never have to roam (never have to roam)
Have you refuge in my heart
Let it set you free
I will never leave your side (I will never leave your side)
We can make it
Let it set you free
You will never have to roam
Have you refuge in my heart
Let it set you free
I will never leave your side
We can make it
Let it set you free GIRL
You will never have to roam
Have you refuge in my heart
Let it set you free baby
I will never leave your side (come on don't you want go girl, yeah)
We can make it
Let it set you free
You will never have to roam, girl
Have you refuge in my heart
Let it set you free
I will never leave your side
