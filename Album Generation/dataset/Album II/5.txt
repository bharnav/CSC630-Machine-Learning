Could this be the very beginning babe
Of a love so fine?
Then let's get caught up in the middle babe
Girl you were mine, thats all I know
Hey we've got somethin special
A wise man can't define
It's just like heaven's watchin us
And it feels just like...

I'm in love
Ohh girl, i'm in love

You just get here girl
And i promise you

Inside and out i'll be lovin you
Makin my perfect storm
Until the mornin comes
Hey, you're sunshine, on my window babe

Let's watch heaven open up
Cause it feels just like...
