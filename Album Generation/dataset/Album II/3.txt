Where would I be without you
Where would I go to let it all out
Where would I be
Without you

Where did the song of love go
Where did you find someone new
What do I do
Without you
Without you
Baby

Where would I be without you
Where would I go to let it all out
If I'm gonna be without you
Better go now
Without you, yeah
Without you
