Talking to you, it's your son
Father, I can't believe all the things
We have done to each other
The problem I find
In all my years the danger is high
Though your love is near
So what can be done to heal each other
I hold my head up high to ease the pain
But quite frankly lord
I don't know how much more this world can take
Yes we truly need more love for each other
Lord it's me, it's your son
Trying to take a stand for peace
Like your other one
Send us your love
Cause we need each other
Mmmmm
We need, we truly need each other
