Hey, hey, there she goes now she's walking down the street again
Shuffling down the sidewalk, scuffing up her brand new shiny leather shoes
And all the stray digs, they hissing out cause they all wonder where she's going to
As early evening light keeps her shadow out of sight
Sleeping soft, hidden from view
Why does everybody always act so tough, when all anybody wants is to find a friend?
Why does everybody always try to hide the heart that hidden has no use?
Now some say sometime late in the evening light
You can see them shining dancing now with the greatest of ease
And some say they're faking, maybe breaking down
Afraid to cut themselves loose from some big daddys leash

Hey, hey, there you go now, baby
Dancing all alone in your room
Trading gossip with the twilight creeps
Killing the flowers that were planted for you

You say someday you gonna float away
Take yourself some kind of holiday
Hey, hey, ain't no use, no trying to make you stay

Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Cause when the sun is done and evening comes
The thieves will run to steal your pretty withering love
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Cause if the morning comes you can breathe, you can run
And keep alive your withering love

Why does everybody always act so tough, when all anybody wants is to find a friend?
Why is everybody always trying to hide the heart what hidden has no use?
Now you can fake it or you can break it, you can shake it down
And cut yourself loose from some daddy's leash
Or in the evening light you can keep that shadow out of sight
And sleep it off, hidden from view

Hey, hey, there you go now, baby
Dancing all alone in your room
Trading gossip with the twilight creeps
Killing the flowers that were planted for you

You say someday you gonna float away
Take yourself some kind of holiday
Hey, hey, ain't no use, no trying to make you stay, hey, hey, hey

Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Cause when the sun is done and evening comes
The thieves will run to steal your pretty withering love
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Cause if the morning comes you can breathe, you can run
And keep alive your withering love

Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
