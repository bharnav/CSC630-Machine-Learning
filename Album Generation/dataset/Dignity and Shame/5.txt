As I went wandering drunk down your street
To your window I stumbled by chance and I peeked in on you
Red roses, silk, you in your sleek summer dress
You were light revelation, oh, I love you the best, Valerie

I don't want to waste no time, I'm tired and I want something true
I don't need those peep show girls no more, no I only want you
Come on and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie

I seen you dancing alone in your room
By the moonlight to a violin the night I fell for you
And out of the darkness you took me by the hand
I went in just a boy and came out with you a man, Valerie

I don't want to be caught blinded thinking there ain't nothing new
I don't need those street kicks anymore, no I only want you
So come on and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie, alright

I don't want to waste no time, I'm tired and I want something new
I don't need those quick fix girls no more, no I only want you
So come on now and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie

As I went wandering drunk down your street
To your window I stumbled by chance and I peeked in on you
Cognac and cola upon your sweet breath
Oh, my angel of darkness, I love you til my death, Valerie

I don't want to be caught blinded thinking there ain't nothing new
You know those street kicks are such a bore cause I only want you
So come on now and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie

I don't want to waste no time, I'm tired and I want something true
I don't need those peep show girls no more, no I only want you
So come on and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie
