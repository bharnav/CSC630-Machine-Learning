Someday, babe, I'm gonna make you mine
And in the days between our love and hate
I'll keep your heart with mine
Until the day must come and I must leave you stranded in a haze
Until the day does come and you must see how I display my name

So lay down
Just let it come
And resign your heart today
To get blown away

Someday, babe, we're gonna have to try
All through these days as we are suffering
To keep our hearts in mind
Until the day is done
And we can bid this dying love goodbye
Until this course has run
And we can leave the memory behind

So lay down
Just let it come
And resign your heart today
To get blown away

Destroyer
