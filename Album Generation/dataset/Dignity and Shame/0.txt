Come on now and wrap your weary arms around the ones you love
Hold tightly, don't ever let them go
You have many enemies for reasons no one's certain of
So keep close only people you can trust

Beware of strangers knocking at your door
Old lovers, too
Don't you think for one second they've forgotten you
They've forgotten you

(laptapdadada...)

So go on strike first, don't be so scared of what you're running from
You know, man, that what will be must be done

There ain't no way they could ever prove
You're so calm and cool
You've been waiting your whole life to make your move
So make your move
