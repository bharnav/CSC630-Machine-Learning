Andalucia 1917
Such a splendid summer
We were sitting in the shade

But they can tell when you're afraid
I thought I heard an actress say
There's one thing that you should know
They will never let you go, go, go
They will never let you go

Antonita, my dear
Don't you cry
I have given all my ears to you
And Andalucia
Andalucia

Oh, Cordoba
Bring the Muiras on
We've been sitting in the sun

You can press your hands on wounded friends
Pray to Veronica
But they can tell when you're afraid
I thought I heard the doctor say
I thought I heard the doctor say
I thought I heard the doctor say

Antonita, my dear
Don't you cry
I have only one year
Until I'm home again in Andalucia
Until I'm home again with you in Andalucia
