[Chorus]
Jumping Jesus, my oh my
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine
Jumping Jesus, why oh why?
Take the time to get inside
To get inside

[Verse 1]
So what's a wall with so much yellow for?
I don't know what it's for
So what's a wall has so much yellow for?
I don't know what it's for

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Odessa in desert, he lives with his wife
And his child on a house boat
Yeah, he likes sunflowers and big picture frames
And Van Goughs

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Na na na na na na na na
Lala la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa laaaa laaaa
