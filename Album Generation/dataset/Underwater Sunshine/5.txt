[Verse 1]
You’re the kind of thing
Those sweetheart boys just talk about
Such a pretty flame
Still burning when the bullets all go out
Well, everybody knows your name around here
But that’s alright
And everybody learned your game around here
But that’s alright
You told me if I stayed around here
You’d find a good enough place to hide
But I see you, I see you
So come on out tonight

[Verse 2]
I had my courage up
But felt younger trying to fit the words
So I put a record on
And you found something you ain’t never heard
Well, honey, everybody knows that song ‘round here
But that’s alright
Ain’t no such thing as waiting too long ‘round here
So that’s alright
And I told you, if you stay down here
You might wind up by my side
And that’s true, that’s true
So come on out tonight

[Verse 3]
And all my friends told me
“You don’t need laws to tell
That if it feels like falling, boy
You probably already fell
The whole table saw your hand
So you might as well just play it
And you ain’t fooling anyone
So you might as well just say it…”
So, I guess I’m in love, I guess I’m in love

Some people get scared of those words ’round here
But that’s alright
Some people pretend they didn’t hear them ’round here
But that’s alright
And you said you can’t stay ’round here and that won’t change Because you made up your mind
But I still see you, I still see you
So come on out tonight
