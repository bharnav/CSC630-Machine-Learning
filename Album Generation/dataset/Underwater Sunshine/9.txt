[Verse 1]
Addressing a prayer into the air
In the shadows of satellites
So nobody hurt loves not for words
In a world at the end of its night

[Chorus]
Oh, everyone that left me
They’re so easy to forget
'Cause I haven’t let my failures hit me yet

[Verse 2]
Your voice on the phone, the blood from a stone
These tears that I can’t understand
If I could heal would give I don’t feel
Or by silently giving my hand

[Chorus]
Well, I’m sure I never loved you
That would be too fierce and too correct
But I haven’t let my failures hit me yet

[Bridge]
It made my demon reveal its hour of living
And may he not leave me broken
May he leave me broken

[Verse 3]
So wherever I’m bound, my ear to the ground
And my thoughts on their way back to you
As eternities slave, well, you can write that on my grave
When I’m finished resisting its truth

[Chorus]
While I’m shaking hands with darkness
It's where the warm wind that I admit
That I haven’t let my failures hit me yet
Yet while I’m shaking hands with darkness
It is where the warm wind that I admit
That I haven’t let my failures hit me yet
