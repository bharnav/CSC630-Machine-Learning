[Chorus]
She had four white stallions, coming up around the bend
Four strong angels at her command to send
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend

I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again

She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure
Got a mind like a sabre, razor sharp and sure

God, how I hate myself for still wanting her

Tell me its nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her
Nothing more but a heart still at war

[Chorus]
