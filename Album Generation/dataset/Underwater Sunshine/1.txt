[Verse 1]
I don't know if you can hear me
I'm feeling down and can't think clearly
Even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me

Some things I'd change, but it's too late
I'd take the past and make it straight
And even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me

[Chorus]
Even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things I've said
But some thoughts just won't leave my head
And even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me

[Chorus][x2]
