[Verse 1]
If tonight’s the night, then today is my day
That I should hang it all on display
Yours was just a loser's game
And I decided that I should play

[Chorus]
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget

[Verse 2]
Felt the wind’s direction beginning to change
Clouds so softly full of rain
The summer fell and the winter sprang
Now it’s all a feeling I can’t get back again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cloudy thoughts against a clear blue sky
When the feeling came, I felt like getting high
With no sense to try to find my peace of mind
‘Cause maybe I was born to win, dissatisfied

[Chorus][x2]
