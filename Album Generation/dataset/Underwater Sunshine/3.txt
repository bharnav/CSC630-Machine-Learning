[Verse 1]
I got a feeling of unrighteousness
Bitter cold, hollow bitterness
Down the road, I walk with loneliness
Mercy will follow me, I'm told

My sister sang songs, so sweet and sad
'Bout a man whose love I never had
There's a train bound for Gillian
Mercy will follow me, I'm told

[Chorus]
Mercy, will you follow me?
Mercy, will you follow me?
Till my final breath at last I take
Mercy, will you follow me?
Mercy, will you follow me?
Till the chains of this old world I finally break

[Verse 2]
Under this skin, there lies a heart of stone
It's growing old, so very far from home
But a heart of gold I may someday own?
And mercy will follow me, I'm told

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Till the chains of this old world I finally break
Till the chains of this old world I finally break
