1, 2, 1, 2, 3

Won't you scratch my itch, sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town?
Come out on your porch, step into your parlor
And I'll tell you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you

So I headed west to grow up with the country
Out across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

Hey, we flew straight across that river bridge
Last night at half past two
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye, good luck
As we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
That I've never been shown
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring, I met up with the king
His head an amphetamine crown
Talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt
And lit out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remember something you once told me
Oh, and I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Oh, twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
