[Verse 1]
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift
Gate won't close, railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere

[Chorus]
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

[Verse 2]
I don't care how many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money and pack up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to the tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Genghis Khan, he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill, no matter how steep
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it
And everybody says

[Chorus]
