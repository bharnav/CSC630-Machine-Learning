[Verse 1]
We used to say there'd come the day
We'd all be making songs
Or finding better words
These ideas never lasted long

The way is up along the road
The air is growing thin
Too many friends who tried
Blown off this mountain in the wind

[Chorus]
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm gonna see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes round again

[Verse 2]
Yet now I see, I'm all alone
But that's the only way to be
'Cause you'll have your chance again
Then you can do the work for me

[Chorus][x3]
