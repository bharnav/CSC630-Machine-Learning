[Pre-Chorus]
Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping
Wide awake, there's some pills you shouldn't take

[Chorus]
Honest to God, X is always an unknown
I said alright, Y gets buried in the bones
I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest
You don't have to stay around, you don't have to solve for X

[Verse]
I'm afraid I found it's eternally unequal
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight
On the way back down, finally a sequel
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight

[Chorus]
Isn't alright, and your X, it's always an unknown
It's hard to hold on too tight, 'cause I got buried with your bones
And I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest
All your reason gone tonight, you don't have to solve for X

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
And I said alright, X is always an unknown
I tried to hold on too tight but I got buried with the bone
And I said honest to God, I got to get it off my chest
I don't want to stick around, 'cause I don't need this suffering
