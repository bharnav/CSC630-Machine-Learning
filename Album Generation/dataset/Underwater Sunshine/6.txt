[Verse 1]
I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think
Or let you see one thing for yourself
And now you're off with someone else and I'm alone
You see, I thought I might keep you for my own

[Chorus]
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

[Verse 2]
Don't you think the time is right for us to find
That all the things we thought weren't proper
Could be right in time?
Can't you see which way we should turn, together or alone?
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
'Cause that take too long to see now

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or it's me?
But if it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see, yeah
Won't you look at me and tell me?

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I keep falling in and out of love with you
Falling in and out of love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I keep falling in and out of love with you
