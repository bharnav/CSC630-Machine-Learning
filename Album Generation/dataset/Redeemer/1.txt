Like miracles
Like clock work, and like miracles
You witnessed halos
But you failed to see its horns
The illusion of intellegence
A continous sounding bell
Can you feel the interruptions in the air?
Can you feel the static?
Ive never seen you like this
Seen you

Yeah, well thats what i said
Drive drive the vultures home
Youre killing me, just bury me
Yeah, well thats what i said
I said exactly what i meant
Youre killing me, just bury me

Holy ghosts and talk show hosts
How i panic as you fail
Your consience is a wolf
Walls are being built
Deception wears its veil
And time is fleeting
Her love just will not last
And far from men you hang and sway
With no defender
Pushed around by the noise of this carefree crowd
Time is fleeting
Her love just will not last

I will not sleep
While you are throwing anchors
To a drowning generation

Yeah, well thats what i said
Drive drive the vultures home
Youre killing me, just bury me
Yeah, well thats what i said
And i said exactly what i meant
Youre killing me, just bury me
Yeah well thats what i said
Yeah well thats what i said
Yeah well thats what i said
Yeah well thats what i said

Hell is empty, the devils are here
Hell is empty, the devils are here
I will never sleep
