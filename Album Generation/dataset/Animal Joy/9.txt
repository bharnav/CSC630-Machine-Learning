Now that we have pulled away
Is it better on the inside?
And did you like the offerings
On the counter, under black lights?

While the stars have aligned
With a light that irradiates all of us
In the parallel
Let the temperature rise
Til the urge to relieve it is perilous
Let the silences make it easy

Driving through the border range
Did we pass along the same road
We are ashes in the polar rays
We are blooming at the same time

While the sun slips away from the crest of the barricade
Radiant
In the winter light
If a tenth of the law is the urge to invalidate
Starry-eyed
And inveterate
And invincible
You make it easy

Is it heart attack and burial?
Is it evening on the west side?
Now that we are coming down
Are you bracing for the next wave?

The return of the life
The return of the colors of everyone
To the gallery
I believe in the rush
I believe in the gathering radiance
I could walk alive
Through a burning wall

Believing makes it easy
