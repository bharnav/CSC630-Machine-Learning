Run the banner down
And hide in the broken palms
But out of the blackness comes
A point of starry light

And a mountain moves
And the pressure drops
Snow on your open palms
Under a northern star

Leave the tape unwound
And the film unthreaded

In a summer rain
Where your image is frozen
And thrown into the lake
Where the words rebound
With the way you laid out
Your hands on my shoulders:

Open your mouth
Close your eyes
Open your mouth
