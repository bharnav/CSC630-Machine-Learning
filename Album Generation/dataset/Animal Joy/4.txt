Sometimes I think I welcome it
What you are frightened of
My thoughts become undisciplined
And then I slip away

It is effortless
Effortless

In the glow along the barren road
I see you shivering
My heart begins to separate
From the signs that would bury our lives

With an insolence
(Once beats and the light is close, close.)
Insolence
Effortless ranging and diving
(Once beats and the light is close, close.)
Effortless as fire

Oh, child
Where were you?
Where were you all your life?
All your life inside a chrysalis writhing?

And it's real
And it's real
Joy is real
One more time
It's real
Joy is real
Joy is real
One more time
It's real
Joy, it's so real
