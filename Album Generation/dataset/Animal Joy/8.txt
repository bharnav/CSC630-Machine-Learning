I could see by the way you were living
You had gone to the other side
You were the flashing wings of a swallow
You were the light in lion's eye

And you were standing there alone in the river
Where do you go when the well is dry?
Like you could summon up another religion
Like you could summon another life

But if you survive
Will you see me now?
Can you see me now?

Let's go back alone on the river
I wanna swim to other side
I could see by the way you were suffering
Oh, what you were really like

I'm not talking about a wade in the shallows
I'm not living there anymore
You can spend your life fighting the river
Or you could look me right in the eyes

But you have to decide

Can you see me now?
Can you see me now?
