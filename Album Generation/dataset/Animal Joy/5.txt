Johnny, get a hold of your life
Wherever I go, your face is in front of me
You aren't breathing
Holding up the end of the line
If there ever was a crack in the ice, you don't believe in it
You are a diamond, set

On an immaculate height
Safe

Belly up and under the wire
Lying awake in the hours and the emptiness
Only to run from the days we are living in
You only get a look at your life when you're leaving it
And in the silences

When you're arrested in flight
When you lie on your back
With your eyes on the firmament

Your burning mouth, your blazing eyes
Come on!
If you believe in it

It's a respectable life
Go police all the beats
You'll find nothing is innocent

Johnny, get a hold of your life
Stop at the edge till the animus drains away
Or follow the loneliest road
Run in the dark till a light comes screaming in
Through the silences

You are alone on the ice
And you stand on the brakes
To find nothing is happening
