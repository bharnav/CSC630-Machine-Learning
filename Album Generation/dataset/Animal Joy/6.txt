I was still life
I was pinned inside of a photograph
When I realized
You had slipped outside of the scenery
With only what you need to survive
So why did you come to me?
If you are looking at the enemy

Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses
Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses

I was waiting
I was reconstructing a memory
Unbelieving
In the changes looming inside of me
The pulse of an irregular life

But why did you turn away?
Before the horn sounds
Over the dark terrain
And the weapons of the enemy

Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses
Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses
And let in the night

Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses
Open up, open up, open up
Open your houses
Come into the night
