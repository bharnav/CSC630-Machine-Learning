Maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm not ready
Maybe I was not properly socialized
But when you drag me under
When you pull me over the line
That's when you really reach me
No
I know the night drives
I know the afterglow
I know I look quieter than I feel
I wanna fight like lovers
Wanna pull you over the line
Dread sovereign!
(Where do the lonelyhearts go
We of the lonely hearts knowing)
Another white-flag waver
When you were drowning under the lights
In the ever-black tide
Dread sovereign!
(Where do the lonelyhearts go
We of the lonely hearts knowing)
Dread sovereign!
(Where do the lonelyhearts go
We of the lonely hearts knowing)
