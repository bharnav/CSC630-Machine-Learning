All I really need are two notes and a beat

Oh last night I dreamt a magnificent thing
I held you close I heard you sing
Your voice was what I’d always wanted in a woman
I know you say he’s good to you and I’m sure he is
But darling he’s all you’ll ever know
Unless you trust your heart and let yourself grow

If your skin was the ocean I’d sprint to your shore
I’d wade in your shallows, alleviate my core
If you hair was the fir tree all hollow inside
With peace I would slumber

Gripping this pen
Cliff over water
Envisioning drums in rhythmic salute
Poetry craftwork is tough I won’t bother
But pull simple rhymes from the dirt
Who’d refute?

All I really need are two notes and a beat
All I really need are two notes and a beat
To sing to you my heart it’s a great place to start

D to a G
Swift as a bird
Muscles remembering artless, absurd
And modest attempts at creating a mood
With these thin metal strings my affection construe

Gripping this pen
Cliff over water
Envisioning drums
Poetry craftwork is tough I won’t bother
But pull simple rhymes...

All I really need are two notes and a beat
All I really need are two notes and a beat
To sing to you my heart it’s a great place to start
