You are the ever-lasting guilt, lingers
You are the glass hidden in sand
And in the morning when I wake, follow
Close behind me knive in hand
Does the tide love it's lunar bride?
Was man on purpose or mistake?
Or was God hypnotized?
And I remember when you came and folded
It was a young boy full of love
And all the good I did in vain, can't seem
To tell the demons from the sane
Does the tide love it's lunar bride?
Was man on purpose or mistake?
Or was God hypnotized?
And oh, this sky provokes
Endless questions without answers
Oh, this eternal water
Must reach to the ends of the earth
And what will we do if nothing misty finds us?
I shall die alone
