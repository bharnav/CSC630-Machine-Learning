L.A., you made me think
Too much gold and you sink
I don't want to live there, buy there
Or e'en die there
I don't want to live there, buy there
Or e'en die there

Nashville, you're much too safe
Quit weighing the pros and cons
Just create
I don't want to live there, buy there
Or e'en die there
I don't want to live there, buy there
Or e'en die there

Give to me miles of tall evergreens
And the smell of the ocean
And cool mountain breeze
Won't you please?

33rd's singing to me
Birds offer up perfect melody
I just want to live here, love here
And die here
I just want to live here, love here
And die here

Give to me miles of tall evergreens
And the smell of the ocean
And cool mountain breeze
Won't you please?

Hey hey
