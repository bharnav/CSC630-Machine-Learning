What if I swallowed all these pills at once?
What if I'd never been born, what if Germany had won the war?

Maybe this plane is destined to crash
The pilot's perfect smile a wreck on the dash

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? I'm leaving it up to the skies

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?

I've found the list of questions goes on, I think I might as well stop
Or I'll be questioning unanswerable 'til I drop
The scientist must lead a miserable life, studying gravity and infinite space
How much can one linear mind really know?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? I'm leaving it up to the skies

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?

Ah ah ah

End it now!
End it now!
End it now!
End it now!

End it now!
End it now!
End it now!
End it now!
