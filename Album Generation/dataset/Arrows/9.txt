He gripped my hand like a vice because
I stole her, a fox from a wolf
It seems to me we’re one in the same man
We both have fallen short
Time and time again

And...
All I can do is make other’s bleed
A prideful ego fire I’m eager to feed

And they say I’m a good guy
And they say I’m a good guy

The worst comes out when I'm alone
I think I'm hiding, but you've always known
Can you meet me in that place
When I'm too ashamed to show my face

And...
All I can do is make others bleed
A prideful ego fire I’m eager to feed
And they say I’m a good guy
And they say I’m a good guy

And...
All I can do is make others bleed
A prideful ego fire I’m eager to feed
And they say I’m a good guy
And they say I’m a good guy
