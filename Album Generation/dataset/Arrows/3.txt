Just when I thought I had nothing
Nothing good to give
You appeared, won my heart
And Showed me I must die to live
Take my pride
Please remove these selfish thoughts
Save me from the world
I wanna be addicted to love
I wanna be addicted to love

A Line of white is all my body really needs
The spirit sold for the lain to ease
But I know that this road
It isnt going to bring me peace
Give me something new For my soul to use
Something beautiful for my heart to abuse
The drugs are never enough
I wanna be addicted to love
I wanna be addicted to love
I wanna be addicted

Why are we so, loveless?
Im worried
Please hurry
And why are we so loveless?
Im worried
Please take me home
I wanna be addicted to love
I wanna be addicted to love (I want to be)
I want to be addicted to love (oh oh oh)
