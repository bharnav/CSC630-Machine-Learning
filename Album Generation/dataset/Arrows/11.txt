This is why you don't feed the animals
That live inside my head
This is why you don't encourage me
Mingling with the dead

I won't remove guards from my wall
I won't shed my outer shell it exposes my heart
I'll die long before you get to me

And dark and dismal was my song
But I will never again sing along
I swear I've been cowardly for quite some time
Now this melancholy boy is gonna shine

Let's go, arrows out
I'm gonna go
Let's go, gonna go arrows out

And when it gets dark
Sometimes my heart leads me
Into the woods
There I drink a sinister mead
That drives away the good

I'm gonna go arrows out
