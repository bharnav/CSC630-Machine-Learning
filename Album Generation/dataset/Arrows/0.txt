Sitting with him on the rocks
He'd been my strongest support, the arms that I'd run toward
I knew sooner or later
It'd come to the point when the truth would snake its way out
And I will always look up to him
Together we share our father's sin
I am afraid of myself and the darkness that's rising inside of my heart
So I hope I can trust you
Because I know I can't trust myself
Open my eyes remove anything in the way
Please be all I need
Be everything

And walking away from the water
I felt that a weight had been lifted
He'd shone through the clouds
And one day when I have a boy
And I can't keep this from him
His father's sin no
I will try and trust you
Because I know I can trust myself
Open my eyes remove anything in the way
Please be all I need
Be everything
And please be all I need
Be everything
Be everything
Be everything
