Up down tunnels underground
It’s your to fight off

Up down tunnels underground
Its your fight off
You dig lies to get around
Obvious contradictions
Childish self-affliction
Up down tunnels underground
Now it’s yours to fight off

Up down tunnels underground
He was a spy lurking around
In an attempt to save you
I was the dove to warn you
Up down tunnels underground
Now it’s yours to fight off
Now he’s yours to fight off

My heart is a room in a ramshackle house
Where the shades have been drawn
And the scenery is gone
Where is the sun?
My body’s cold

Occasionally visitors come and they knock
Trying to see if someone is inside
I try to speak but no one’s there
