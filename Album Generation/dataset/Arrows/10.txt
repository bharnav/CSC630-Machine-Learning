Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Let us pretend we've got it together
Let us ignore the coming sun
We'll sing the body electric
Until machine and soul are one
I've seen the tweaker struggle
Syringes lined his floor
A cycle churned to life
By dead-end jobs and a government's war

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

One by one the monsters trample
Through woods and dirt they feed
What sort of world and plight
For our children must we leave?
Let us burn the nation's budget
Let's send boys overseas
To fight ghosts in the desert
Instead of teaching them to give and lead

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Oh
We sing in time
We sing in time

Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life
To take me away

Oh, in time
We sing in time
Oh, in time the trees die and light will fade
But I hope for a new breath, a new life...
