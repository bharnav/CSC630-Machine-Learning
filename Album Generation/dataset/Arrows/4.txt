Get up listen to the coyotes howl
Why do they sound so menacing?
Do they know what i did last night?
Doesn't my sin seem interesting?
Get up listen to the coyotes howl
Why do they sound so menacing?
Do they know what i did last night?
Doesn't my sin seem interesting?

I wish you'd come back home
I want to hold your hand
I wish you'd come back home
I want to hold your hand

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Get up listen to the Coyotes howl

Why do they sound so menacing?
Do they know what i did last night?
And does my sin seem interesting?

I wish you'd come back home
I want to hold your hand
I wish you'd come back home
I want to hold your hand

It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
