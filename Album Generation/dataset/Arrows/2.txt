He sees a bird
She sees a complex pattern
He sees in lust
She tries to seed love
You hear the song
I feel it deep within my heart
Just chemical, animal sound

We'll never know
If it matters ??
Only in the dreams can we perceive reality and fiction became too
Too good of friends
And the bullshit, it never ends
It never ends

Just let 'em speak
He's got a good point brother
Can't you be close and disagree
Ever

We'll never know
If it matters ??
Only in the dreams can we perceive reality and fiction became too
Too good of friends
And the bullshit, it never ends
Became too good of friends
And the bullshit, it never ends
It never ends

Let go!

In the dreams can we perceive reality and fiction became
In the dreams can we perceive reality and fiction became too
Too good of friends
And the bullshit, it never ends
Became too good of friends
And the bullshit, it never ends
