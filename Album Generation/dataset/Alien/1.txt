I control an awkward soul
And my lines are automatic
Automatically drawn
Realizing a multiverse in just one thing
And then I’m automatic, automatically gone

Writing down my infinity
Writing for all eternity

Colors relate to numbers, relate to sound
Relates to form, relate to war, relate to sex
Relates to healing
Relates to all god vibration!

Formula!

I’d like to take it easy
I’d like to think I try
I’d like to think forever
I would not question why
I’d like to say I’m sorry
I do not know the words
All I can say right now is
Everything happens when no one's around

Writing down my infinity
Writing for all eternity
Eliminate inner parenthesis
Now combine like terms remembering to watch negative signs
I’m right here forward
Incriminate, fall down, hide soft; inner terminated
Om! Om! Om!
Be careful with polynomial colors
Colors
There can never be an answer
We can never factor om

And I know you've found your pain
And it's the last thing you'll ever do
And you've only got you to thank

Ooh, I control an awkward soul
In my time
And then I’m automatic, automatically god

Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fucking fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fucking fight!
