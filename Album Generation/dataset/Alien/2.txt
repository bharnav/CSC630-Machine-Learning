You bastard
Know, know, know
I hate you
Everything, everything, everything
Is wrong
And I don't want to fight
Because I don't know what's wrong or right
But I’ll do anything just to get some fucking sleep tonight
And I can't even eat
And I can't even fucking piss!
All I’ve been doing is thinking about
God and death, infinity

Sleep little baby, don't you cry, little baby

Now
You’ll fucking listen to me...everyone of you in my motherfucking life
All I’ve been looking for is an excuse to
Feel this way
And now I know
Ha!
I know
I’m in control of the infinite mind
And I control infinite power
When?
Every black minute

And self-control is something I’ve learned
But don't think I won't do it
Don’t you ever forget
If you want crazy
If you want fucking crazy
I'll show you how to be crazy

Fuck you!

Ladies
All this time I thought you wanted me to be like you
You don't want me to be like you
Now you'll sing for me

Baby! Little baby, little baby, yeah
Aw, fuck! Fuck!

Know, know, know
I fucking hate myself
Everything, everything, everything
About this is fucked

Now it's
Science
Science
Science
And
Math
Math
Math
