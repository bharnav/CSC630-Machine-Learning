March!

Love is a way of feeling
Love is a way of feeling less alone
So what's all the fuss about?

Fuck it
Love: the paradox of needing
Oh love, make way for breeding

Give it to me! Give it to me!

I know what I stand for
I stand for me

I’ll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I’m not the man you know
This love, it's about control

Oh, what a feeling
Oh, what a feeding
Know the chosen ones are here
All hail!

I’ll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I’m not the man you know
This love
It’s about control

Oh, you fucker!

All in the name of love
All in the name of love
All in the name of love
