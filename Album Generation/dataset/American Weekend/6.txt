[Verse 1]
Full moon
We see our breath in a blue glow
I follow you to the bar in the snow
And then we roll around in your sheets
And watch our habits become a routine
And we'll fall asleep eventually
And I'll move away
Forget today someday

[Verse 2]
Meditate
I expand on the floor
Floating in pennies and microphone cords
Repeat mistakes
You're easy to erase
And I abstain
Ideal falls in to place
But luck will fail
And others will pale
And I'll think of you
And I'll think I tried it
Or I will deny it
But it's not true

[Verse 3]
No one reminds me
That better won't find me
And I won't learn
Tiger, tiger
I play with fire
And I get burned
Yeah, no one reminds me
That better won't find me
And I won't learn
Tiger, tiger
I play with fire
And I get burned
