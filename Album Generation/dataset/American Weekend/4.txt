[Verse 1]
Hands under my clothes
You can't let it go
You set it up masterfully
And then blame it all on me

[Verse 2]
Cynicism smothering
Planted, blossoming in me
Our fun is toxic and bold
Embellished and oversold

[Chorus]
Embody me because I am weak
And I moved out but I never opened my mouth
I never opened my mouth

[Verse 3]
It's late
I'm up on the roof
In New York and I hung up on you
I can't pay for the mistakes I made
So I'll just let this die and decay
