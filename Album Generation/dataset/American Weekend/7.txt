[Verse 1]
Crowd stale
Wholesale
We're on the porch and there's a keg and you are quiet
Wind shifts
I drift to autumn
I tell Dom what I see
She laughs at me

[Verse 2]
Blast beats
We retreat
And it's a lonely street
The burden of circumvention
But fractions like us
Fill cities and flats and cul-de-sacs
So we yell over it and have a laugh

[Verse 3]
And it's a laughable scenario
Peripheral motion picture show
And I feel your eyes
And I stayed inside
But it wouldn't work
So I soak up your vice
Tonight's a blur

[Verse 4]
We meet
You scare me
See, I have met people from Maine and Athens, Georgia and Montreal
And I'm dead
Lips red
Licking sugar
I smile at everyone
Formulated fun
