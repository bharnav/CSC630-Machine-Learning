[Verse 1]
Take my word for it
I'm not worth it
I ignored you all night
You don't deserve it
Morning, bathtub
My skin soft and hot
I was sure you were right
But you're not
You're not
And I contemplate my ruined fate
Someone will hurt me so bad one day
You'll resonate
Apologize
Maybe I'll make the same mistake twice

[Verse 2]
And I hide from phone calls under the warm water
And Malice desists
No, it woefully recurs
And it plays like daytime TV shows
I confuse you
And I tell you not to love me
But I still kiss you when I want to
And I lament
You're innocent
Somehow the object of my discontent
It's fucked up
I let you in
Even though I've seen what can happen

[Verse 3]
You make a tape
I receive it in the mail
And I force myself busy
The diversion will prevail
And I will swallow all my guilt
With little pills and forge my chin up
And I will only think about it in the morning
In the bathtub
