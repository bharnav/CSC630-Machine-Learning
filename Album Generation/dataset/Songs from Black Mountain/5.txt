Diamonds and pearls don't move this girl
She can be icy cold to the crawl
One of her lungs breathes in another world
While the other sticks around to blow you off

Even when the four winds blow
She kinda passes by like she don't feel it
No, mamma, she don't feel it
One of these days I'm gonna dive into her waves
And bring back the meaning of it all

Sofia, I need ya
Like a junkie needs a vein
And I wanna feel ya, Sofia
Fallin' down on me like rain

They say in ancient times, men, that women ruled the world
But the goddess was the one who laid it down
Well, I got the woman as alive as the day
Gonna breathe a whisper, knock you right down to the ground

So go ahead men and say what you came to say
The black widow's a spider
The black widow's a spider
Then go and prepare for your dyin' day
Won't take one minute till you're curled up dead beside her

Sofia, I need ya
Like a junkie needs a vein
And I wanna feel ya, Sofia
Fallin' down on me like rain

Sofia, I need ya
Like a freeloader needs his train
And I wanna feel ya, Sofia
Fallin' down on me like rain

Sofia, rain down on me
And I'll never
I'll never be the same, baby
I wanna feel ya, Sofia
Fallin' down on me like rain
