The way I'm on your mind, like a ball and chain
Like a destiny to run from
Division in your soul (in your soul), keepin' you from whole
I can bare to see you crying

The wing that lays on your shoulders
Could be the wings that carry you home

Sometimes you've got to die to be born again
Sometimes you've got to fight
Sometimes you've got to learn
Sometimes you've got to burn
The old brush out so the new can grow

The wing that lays on your shoulders
Could be the wings that carry you home
Yeah, come on

Could be the wings
Could be the wings (carry you home)
Could be the wings (oh)
Could be the wings (carry you home)

Like to long, lost friend?
Like to love, lost friend?
Like it too long, lost friend?

The wing that lays on your shoulders
Could be the wings that carry you home (carry you home)
Come on, come on

Could be the wings
Could be the wings (lord above)
Could be the wings (oh yeah)
Could be the wings (carry you home)
Could be the wings
Could be the wings (carry you home)
Could be the wings
Could be the wings (carry you home)
