So many people die every day
Who lived every night without hope
Spending their time just standing in line
Tugging on societys coats

So many people live every day
Like they ain't never gonna get old
Doing their time like carps in the slime
Submarines with no periscopes

Oooh, oooh, you are not alone
Oooh, oooh, you are not alone

So many people keeping the pace
Just the other side of grace
Faking their smiles, just ranking the file
Wild cheetahs put in a cage, oh baby now

So many people can't see the signs
Even know their eyes are just fine
Hittin' the stage a day late for the show
Astronomers with no telescopes

Oooh, oooh, you are not alone
Oooh, oooh, you are not alone, no child
Oooh, you are not alone, no child
Oooh, you are not alone

Oooh, oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, ooh

Nothin' in the world could keep me from lyin' next to you
Nothin' in the world could keep me from flyin' next to you

So many people die every day
Who lived every night without hope
Spending their time just standing in line
Tugging on society's coats

Oooh, oooh, you are not alone
Oooh, oooh, you are not alone, no child
Oooh, you are not alone, child
Oooh, you are not alone

You are not alone, yeah

Not alone
Not alone
Not alone
Not alone
Not alone
Not alone
