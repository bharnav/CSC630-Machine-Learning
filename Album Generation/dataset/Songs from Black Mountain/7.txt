I wanted a mountain, you gave me a sea
I wanted a hurricane, you gave me a breeze
I wanted to run, made me stand there and breathe
I wanted to dream, you made me sleep
I wanted to touch the bottom, but it was too deep
I wanted a revolution, you said I was already free
Oh, yeah

Where do we go from here?
Now the day is gone
How do we face our fears
With nothing in our hearts, baby?
Where do we go from here?
Now the night has come

I wanted to touch your mind and your heart
I wanted to find a new place to start
I wanted to kiss your every part
Oh, yeah

So baby, don't leave me now as you turn to the flag
They get shot through the holes, but you're still alive
Like you're too close to death to ever really die
Oh, yeah

Where do we go from here?
Now the day is gone
How do we face our fears
With nothing in our hearts, baby?
Where do we go from here?
Now the night has come
How do we face our fears
With nothing in our hearts?
Nothing

Why won't you listen to me?
I never meant you no harm
I only wanted to be free
All I want is to be free

Where do we go from here?
Now the day is gone
How do we face our fears
With nothing in our hearts, baby?
Where do we go from here?
Now the night has come
How do we face our fears?
Oh, yeah

Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
