On a crystal clear blue morning
There is a peace that only you can know
It is truth and love and it is always there
Even if you fall down
Even if you fall down
Love shines

Oh, it shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines
Oh, love shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines

Think of gentle Jesus
Think of the buddha underneath his tree
They taught the world about love and how we all can be
How we can all be free
Open our hearts and see
Love shines

Oh, it shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines
Oh, love shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines
Oh, it shines
Like an eternal sun, love shines

It shines
Like a revolution in your mind
Like a revolution in your mind
Like a revolution in your mind

On a crystal clear blue morning
There is a peace that only you can know
It is truth and love and it is always there
Even if you fall down
Even if you fall down
Love shines

Oh, it shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines
Oh, love shines
Like an eternal sun, it shines
Oh, it shines, baby
Like an eternal sun, love shines

It shines, shines, shines, shines, shines
Love, it shines, shines, shines, shines, shines
Love, it shines, shines, shines, shines, shines
Love shines
