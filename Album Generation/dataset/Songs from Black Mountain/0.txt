It came without warning
A love like I ain't never felt before
She's like my destiny calling
And she's lying there all naked on the floor

And suddenly, out of the blue she's singin'...

Oh babe, let my lovin' ease your pain
Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life
Oh baby, let my lovin' ease your pain tonight

She came without warning
Like an angel come from heaven in the night (in the night)
The kiss makes me tremble
So she pulls me close and holds me oh so tight

And suddenly, out of the blue she's singin'...

Oh babe, let my lovin' ease your pain
Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life

Oh baby, let my lovin' ease your pain

I give you life
(ooohhh)
I'll give you life, baby
(oooh)
I'll give you love

Oh babe, let my lovin' ease your pain
Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life
Oh baby, let my lovin' ease your pain
Oh babe, let my lovin' ease your pain
Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life
Oh baby, let my lovin' ease your pain

La dah dah dah
La dah dah dah dah
