My ammunition won't load into my gun
My inhibitions, they fall like the weight from a stone
You lead my heart away like a homeless, dusted fool
Somehow this dimestore ring still shines like a diamond to you

Oh, how it deepens
Oh, how it deepens

Your mystery
Keeps on turnin' me on
Your mystery

Thought I knew the rules
Thought I held it in my hands
Thought I was bulletproof 'til the blood pooled up in the sand
Are you a satellite? A shooting star or a dove?
Did we put you way up there or did God send you down from above?

Oh, how it deepens
Oh, how it deepens

Your mystery
Keeps on turnin' me on
Your mystery
Burns me up like the sun
Your mystery

Mine eyes have seen the glory of a love that does transcend
Mine eyes have seen the worst inside of man
And the fear is like a fallen bridge
A broken promise
And the proof is in the bloodshot eyes of the one who failed to see

Your mystery
Keeps on turnin' me on!

(Heaven is one so why believe when you can see it for yourself)
