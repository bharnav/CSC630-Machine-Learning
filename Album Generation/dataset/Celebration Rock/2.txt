[Verse 1]
The sun lays low on a solemn city
All I see is sexual red
The last rays burst through between the train cars
And shine directly on my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So come and find me in this moment
And expose a passionate man for what he is
We'll cut loose our gold
Cause we need fire
And only kindling can buy it
Wildness is our treasure
So boldly surrender
To me and to the night

[Chorus] x2
Oh yeah
Alright
On the lash
And lashing out
It's evil's sway tonight

[Verse 2]
A candle's pulse is no companion
When all you see is sexual red
You burn away your dreams inside a journal
And leave those primal words unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll run and find you in this moment
And expose a passionate woman for what she is
We'll cut loose our gold
Cause we need fire
And only kindling can buy it
Wildness is our treasure
So boldly surrender
To me and to the night

[Chorus] x4
Oh yeah
Alright
On the lash
And lashing out
It's evil's sway tonight

[Bridge]

[Chorus] x2
Oh yeah
Alright
On the lash
And lashing out
It's evil's sway tonight

[Outro]
On the lash
And lashing out
It's evil's sway tonight
