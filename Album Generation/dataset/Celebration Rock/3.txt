[Verse 1]

You look just like an Elvis from hell
My heart is broken, and I'm going to hell
Bury me way down deep in hell
I'm a steel driving man, I want to go to hell

Then go tell Ivy
For the love of Ivy
I did it for Ivy
You're the one
Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
And kill everyone who ever done me wrong
Gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
And kill everyone who ever done me harm

[Hook]

Then go tell Ivy
Yeah go tell Ivy
For the love of Ivy
You're the one

[Verse 2]

Jawbone eat and jawbone talk
Jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for answers down in the dark
When suddenly I had a better thought

[Hook]

I was all dressed up
Like Elvis from hell
