[Verse 1]

A northern soul in southern lands
Will always find his way to southern hands
She'll kiss away your gypsy fears
And turn some restless nights to restless years

[Hook]

Hearts from hell collide
On fire's highway tonight
We dreamed it, now we know

[Verse 2]

A soul of fire and eyes of flame
Tend to overwhelm her tender frame
When raw winds blew us down her city's streets
She warmed my body with her spirit's heat
Some empty bottles, the cold sweat blues
Howling like outlaws from her rented room
No rising sun confession, dear
Only a restless night I'll nurse for years

[Hook]

[Bridge]

One night to have and to hold
To let live, but never let go

[Verse 1 Repeated]

[Hook]
