Just being honest

Sucker swallow every time
Airplane come erase your mind
Seems there's been an accident
Telephone costs you fifty cents

To find out the retail
Gory detail
Nothing here for me
I get all of my kicks for free

Mangy dog without a collar
Buy me love for forty dollars
I got love for sale
Come on, get some before it gets stale again

I win the double for a lie
I get my money on the fly
We're throwing down
So come on by, I'll be around

I've got three, six, nine
Another dollar makes a dime
Yeah, all in double Dutch again
Notify your next of kin, I say

Mangy dog without a collar
Buy me love for forty dollars
I got love for sale
Come on, get some before it gets stale now

Love don't mean a thing
But two a.m. and a telephone ring
Love is all you need
And all you need is love
Love is all you need
And all you need is love

We go underground
'Cause there's emptiness above

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just being
I'm just being
I'm just being
I'm just being

Honest, honest, honest
Honest, honest, honest

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
