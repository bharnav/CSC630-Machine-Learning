I am a fire starter, no ventilation
Now I’m kneeling
As the smoke is swallowing

No need for water, darling
I’m dedicated to a feeling
I can't help but following

A slow roulette
A sweet duet
I can't forget
I’m trying

Feel the powder burn
Tonight, tonight
There'll be nowhere to turn
It's all right, it's all right
And I burn
And I want that feeling again

I hear somebody calling
And now the fire's in the ceiling
There's no way to stop it now

A silhouette
Of sweet regret
I can't forget
I’m trying

Feel the powder burn
Tonight, tonight
There'll be nowhere to turn
It's all right, it's all right
And I burn
And no one can see me
And I yearn
‘Cause I want that feeling again

A cigarette
The fuse is lit
I can't forget
I’m trying

Feel the powder burn
Tonight, tonight
There'll be no self control
It's all right, it's all right
And I burn
And no one can see me
Tonight, tonight
And I yearn
'Cause I want that feeling
Tonight, tonight, tonight
