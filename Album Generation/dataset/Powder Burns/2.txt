Daylight is creeping
I feel it burn my face
I don't sleep here no more
So my shadow walks in place of me

Like candy your eyes
Sweetly roll out of control
Like the singer, alive
But just barely holding on

Far away, where you run
When it all became undone
You'll be dust, realise
You were taken for a ride

But still you call that number
Till you're crawling under
Them stones, assorted Jones, and all alone

I'm alive
It kind of took me by surprise
But every time I look away
There's no light, there's no sentry at the gate

Far away, where you run
When it all became undone
You'll be dust, realise
You were taken for a ride

But still you call that number
Till you're crawling under
Till you're crawling under
Till you're crawling under
Them stones, assorted Jones, and picked over bones

Daylight is creeping
I feel it burn my face
I don't sleep here no more
So my shadow walks in place of me
