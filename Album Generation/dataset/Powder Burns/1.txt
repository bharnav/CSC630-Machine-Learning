The sun don't shine 'round here no more
And I know it won't be long
I hope I see you out tonight
And I hope we get it on

'Cause I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, let's go

Whatever you heard about me before
Believe me things ain't what they were
Whenever you look at me or talk to me
You still sound just like her

And I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready

Seldom seen and in between
And I know it won't be long
Bittersweet is evergreen
Until we get it on

Now I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready, to love somebody
I’m ready, I’m ready

I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready

I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready
