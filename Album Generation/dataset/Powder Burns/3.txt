There was a rapture
So I can never see you any more
Nightmares believable
Walking into sweet oblivion

I'm not saying it's easy
To feel it all or not at all
When somebody says lay down your gun
And when you lay it down get ready to run

Situation dire
It's gone away, it's not going away
Since you're wasting time again, my friend
On bonnie brae, on bonnie brae

If she's your master
Then get down on your knees and beg for more
I'm not saying it's easier
To live your life like her little whore

'Cause when you play with fire
Take your fate, it's not going away
Situation dire, on bonnie brae
On bonnie brae, on bonnie brae

The soul, the screen
The smoke in between
The rise, the fall
The thrill of
The first, the last
The sins of the past
The burn, the fade
The skin that you've flayed
Come see the sun
Kill everyone
But me, Iâ€™m free
Indubitably

There was a rapture
So I can never see you any more
I'm not saying it's easier
I'm not saying it's easier
