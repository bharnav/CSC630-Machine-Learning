Strings of your death
Tied to your breath
All that's been seen
Cannot be unseen
Unless

Deeper you fall
The places you crawl
To find you're unclean
Unsaved
Defeated by self
And no one else, my love

Tongue tied, obsessed
Mesmerised I acquiesce
And step into the machine again
Don't breathe, don't tell, my belle, listen

Deep in the garden
I wait for you now
Under the weight of the leaves
That do bend on the bough
Come save me
