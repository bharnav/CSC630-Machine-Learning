With your best laid plans, push and pull like a man
With your mouth sown shut like a dream
I regret to belie that I ain't your whipping boy no more
No witness, no disguise or disbelief

Maybe I over thought
The situation’s over now
I'm gone

What's your name? Open wide
Watch your head, you better step inside
We all grows up, you hear?
I'm going to get a kiss then I’m going to get away from here

Maybe I over thought
The situation overwrought
Maybe I over thought
The situation overwrought
With drama
Go tell your mama
Go tell your mama
That I’m here
That I’m here

To save somebody tonight
I love you too much
I love you too much
You say you do
You say you're blue
But I told you once
You talk too much
And don't say enough
You're friends ain't true
They'd have you for lunch
They'd have you for lunch
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
I'll take a ride
