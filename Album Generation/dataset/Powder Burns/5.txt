They won't mind
Six to nine's a long, long time
But they won't miss it
They'll just forget it
That shit'll twist your mind
If you let it

So slow down, lean in
Call up that feeling
You get when you're stealing
That all too revealing
Side of you
Who loves you true
But they'll just forget it
They'll just forget it
That shit'll twist your little mind
If you let it, believe
Who love the blue sky
Wear the dark eye

So slow down, lean in
Call up that feeling
You get when you're dealing
You start to believe in
There ain't nobody
Who loves me
It's starting to sink in
So lean in and start to deceive it
That all too revealing

Slow down, lean in
Call up that feeling
You get when you're dealing
That all too deceiving
Side of you
Who loves you true
But they'll just forget it
They'll just forget it
That shit'll twist your little mind
If you let it, believe
Who love the blue sky
Wear the dark eye

So slow down, lean in
Call up that feeling
You get when you're reeling
That all too concealing
Side of you
Who loves you true
But they'll just forget it
They'll just forget it
That shit'll twist your little mind
If you let it, believe
Who love the blue sky
Wear the dark eye
Who love the blue sky
Wear the dark eye
Who love the blue sky
Wear the dark eye
