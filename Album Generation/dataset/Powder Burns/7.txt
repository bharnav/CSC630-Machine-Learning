There's a girl lying at my door
I would die just to taste her blood some more
I knew a girl dying at my door
For another hit she gave me her soul

Now I know that my time has come
And yet I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling through the scenery

In my bed as I lie undead
Making love to the snake inside my head
On the floor like a beautiful whore
What you love never comes till you run and love it some more

Now I know that my time has come
And yet I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling through the scenery

Now I know that my time has come
And yet I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling through the scenery

Seem unwell
Look like hell
But I don't play
I've come a long way
I've come a long way
I've come a long way
Since Sunday
Girl, get running

Take a drive where your mind will cease to feel
Stay alive if you feel you can't stand still
Come on, baby, while it's light outside
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling on a who ride

'Cause I know that my time has run
And yet I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling through the scenery

Now I know that my time has run
And now I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you know what I don't come on over here and teach me

Take a drive where your mind will cease to feel
Stay alive if you feel you can't stand still
Come on, baby, while it's light outside
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling on a who ride

'Cause I know that my time has run
And yet I know that my trial goes on and on
Come on, baby, let me set you free
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling through the scenery

And take a drive where your mind will cease to feel
Stay alive if you feel you can't stand still
Come on, baby, while it's light outside
If you're up for it knock and we're rolling on a who ride

'Cause I know that my time has run
'Cause I know that my time has run
