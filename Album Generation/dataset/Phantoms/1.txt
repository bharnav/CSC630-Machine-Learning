[Verse 1]
Oh no, this couldn't be more unexpected
And I can tell that I've been moving in so slow
Don't let it throw you off too far
'Cause I'll be running right behind you

[Chorus]
Could this be out of line?
(Could this be out of line?)
To say you're the only one breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on, so contagiously

[Verse 2]
Ohhhh, when I'm around you, I'm predictable
'Cause I believe in loving you at first sight
I know it's crazy but I'm hoping to
To take a hold of you

[Chorus]
Could this be out of line?
(Could this be out of line?)
To say you're the only one breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on, so contagiously

[Bridge]
Oh, you're everything I'm wanting
Come to think of it, I'm aching
On account of my transgression
Will you welcome this confession?

[Chorus]
Could this be out of line?
(Could this be out of line?)
To say you're the only one breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on, so contagiously

Could this be out of line?
(Could this be out of line?)
To say you're the only one breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on, so contagiously
