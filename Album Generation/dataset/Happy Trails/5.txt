Hey, Mona, hey hey hey hey, Mona
I'm gonna build my house next door to you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
Maybe we could do a little kissing and tellin' lies
You'll listen to my heart goin' bumpity bump

When I'm through lovin' I'll surely die
Can I make love to you once in a while?
I need you baby and it ain't no lie
When I come out on the front, girl
You'll listen to my heart goin' bumpity bump
I need you baby and it ain't no lie
When I'm through lovin' I'll surely die
