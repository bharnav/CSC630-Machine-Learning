Don't cry, my sweet love, you know how I can't stand you crying
All right, my lady love, I know you have heart, begin tryin'
Some day in the morning when the sunshine won't shine in your window
You may remember that I was the sun in your window
But these things happen all the time, they're always the same
One's always cryin', and one's always easin' the pain

You say goodbye, my lady love, I don't want the memories to haunt you
Just look in my eyes, babe, you can change my mind if you want to
But someday, with someone that you never cared for to start with
You may remember the one guy you won't share your heart with
But these things are happening, and never right all the time
One's always leavin' and one's always changin' his mind

Another time, another place, you'd know that I'd really love you
Dry your eyes, my funny face, another place, another world about you
Don't you remember the way that you once tried to leave me
And may be some day you may know you really didn't need me
But these things happen all the time, they're always the same
One's always cryin' and one's always takin' the blame
One's always cryin' and one's always takin' the blame
