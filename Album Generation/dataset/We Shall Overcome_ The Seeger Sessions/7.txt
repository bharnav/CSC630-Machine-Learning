[Verse 1]
When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip
I wanted a place to call my own
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place
And settled down along the Cimarron

[Chorus]
It blew away, it blew away
My Oklahoma home, it blew away
It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there
But my Oklahoma home, it blew away

[Verse 2]
I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And got a fancy mortgage on the place

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It blew away my rooster and it blew away my hens
The pigs and cattle went astray
All the crops that I sowed went fogging down the road
My Oklahoma farm, it blew away

[Chorus]
It blowed away, it blowed away
Everything I owned blowed away
I hollered and I cussed when my land went up in dust
When my Oklahoma farm, it blowed away

[Verse 4]
It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there
I figured I was all set for life
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Then I was left alone listening to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack
So, I took off down the road when the south wind blew
Traveling with the wind at my back

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere
Makes no difference where I'm walking
I can hear my chickens squawking
I can hear my wife talking in the air

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
I'm a roaming Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick until I die
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around
My Oklahoma home is in the sky

[Chorus][x2]
