[Verse 1]
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away you rolling river
I'll take her across the water

[Chorus]
Away, bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 2]
My Shenandoah, I long to meet you
Away you rolling river
I'll not deceive you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
For seven years I've been a roller
Away you rolling river
Seven years I've been a roller

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Shenandoah, I love your daughter
The way you rolling river
I'll take her across the water

[Chorus]
