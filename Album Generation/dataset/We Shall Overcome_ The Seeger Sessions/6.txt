[Chorus]
We are climbing, Jacob's ladder[x3]
Yeah, we're brothers, sisters, all

[Verse 1]
Every rung goes higher and higher[x3]
We are brothers, sisters, all

Every new rung just, just makes us stronger[x3]
Yeah, we are brothers and sisters, all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We are climbing higher and higher[x3]
Yeah, we are brothers and sisters and all

[Chorus]
