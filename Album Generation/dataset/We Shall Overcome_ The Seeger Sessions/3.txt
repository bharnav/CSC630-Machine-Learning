[Verse 1]
Well if I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 2]
Well, Mary wore three links of chain
On every link was Jesus' name
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 3]
Well one of these nights about twelve o'clock
This old world is going to rock
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 4]
Well, Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
Smote the water with a two-by-four
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 5]
Well, old Mister Satan, he got mad
Missed that soul that he thought he had
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 6]
Brothers and sisters, don't you cry
There'll be good times by and by
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Verse 7]
God gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water, but fire next time
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep

[Chorus]
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Oh Mary, don't you weep no more
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Oh Mary, don't you weep
