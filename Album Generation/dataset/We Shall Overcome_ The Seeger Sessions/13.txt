As I was walking down the street
Down the street, down the street
A pretty girl I chanced to meet
And we danced by the light of the moon

Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

Well, I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And her knees was a'knockin' and the band kept a'rockin'
Well, I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon

Well, I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And her knees was a'knockin' and the band kept a'rockin'
Well, I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon

As I was walking down the street
Down the street, down the street
A pretty little girl I chanced to meet
And we danced by the light of the moon

As I was coming down the street
Down the street, down the street
An ugly little thing I chanced to meet
We danced by the light of the moon

I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And her knees was a'knockin' and the band kept a'rockin'
Well, I danced with a Dolly with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon

Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon
