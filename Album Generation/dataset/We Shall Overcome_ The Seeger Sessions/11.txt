[Verse 1]
We shall overcome, we shall overcome
We shall overcome someday

[Chorus]
Darling, here in my heart, I do believe
We shall overcome someday

[Verse 2]
We'll walk hand in hand, we'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand someday

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We are not afraid, we are not afraid
We shall overcome someday

[Chorus][x2]
