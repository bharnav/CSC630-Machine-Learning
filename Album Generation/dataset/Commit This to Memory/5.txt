[Intro]
They carved a message deep within our broken hearts that failed to mend
Make out kids never had a chance to be best friends

[Verse 1]
She's into math and magazines
Director's cuts and gray cell green
Armed with an eye for contradictions
She sees completely through me

[Verse 2]
I'm fond of Twin Peaks afternoons
Inexpensive wine with cordon bleu
Armed with a plethora of insecurities
We keep each other amused

And we sing:

[Chorus]
Hooray for the madness, we are better by design
Let's hope we'll never have to say goodbye
Say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Snowed in sleep over winter break
Cocktails and miniature mistakes
Lights out, we're covered in each others' warm embrace..

And we sing:

[Chorus] x2
Hooray for the madness, we are better by design
Let's hope we'll never have to say goodbye
Say goodbye

If we keep swimming, maybe this will never die (never die)[x4]

[Verse 4]
We fail to keep in touch these days
I'm liquid cold, she's murder grey
Hollowed by circumstance that pushed us both away

[Outro]
They carved a message deep within our broken hearts that failed to mend
Make out kids never had a chance to be best friends
