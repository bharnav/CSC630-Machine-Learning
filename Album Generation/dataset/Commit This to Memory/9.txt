[Verse 1]
This must be it
Welcome to the new year
The drinks were consumed
The plants were destroyed
And the hors d'oeuvres dismantled

I'm not smiling behind this fake veneer
I am often interrupted or completely ignored
But most of all I'm bored

[Chorus]
I'm trying to find out if my words have any meaning
Lack-luster and full of contempt when it always ends the same
Why won't she listen to me?

Why did I come
Oh why did I come here?
These humans all suck
I'd rather be home feeling violent and lonely

I'm not trying to sound so insincere
But the post card that's taped to the freezer reads
"wish you were here"
How I wish I could disappear

[Chorus]
I'm trying to find out if my words have any meaning
Lack-luster and full of contempt when it always ends the same

Heads up damage control there's ring around her finger
Last chance for changing lanes and you missed it by a mile
Why won't she listen to me?

This must be it, welcome to the new year
