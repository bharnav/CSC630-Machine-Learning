[Verse 1]
Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Late night liquor flu will lead me to the floor
Can we fake it? Can we make believe?
I'm so full of love It deeply sickens me

[Chorus]
But all I could do was close my eyes
And cross my arms and hope to die
Cause you don't fucking listen
When I'm around

The least you could do is take it back
All the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
Cause I can't fucking stand it
When you're around

[Verse 2]
Midwest aftermath, the rumors start to rise
Did I truly do the things that you've described?
They must hate me, every single one
It just sickens them, what I consider fun

[Chorus]
But all I could do was close my eyes
And cross my arms and hope to die
Cause you don't fucking listen
When I'm around

The least you could do is take it back
All the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
Cause I can't fucking stand it
When you're around

[Chorus]
But all I could do was close my eyes
And cross my arms and hope to die
Cause you don't fucking listen
When I'm around

The least you could do is take it back
All the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
Cause I can't fucking stand it
When you're around

No I can't fucking stand it, when you're around
No I can't fucking stand it, when you're around
