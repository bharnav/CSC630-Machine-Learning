[Verse 1 - Mariah Carey]
(I should be your girl)
See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize
(I should be your girl)
But I am not wasting no more time
Because I've got to make you mine

[Chorus - Mariah Carey]
I'm going to make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm going to put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm going to show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're going to know for sure
That I should be your girl

[Verse 2 - Mariah Carey]
See I used to be afraid
But now baby I can't wait
(I should be your girl)
I just got to have your love
And enough's enough's enough

[Chorus - Mariah Carey]
I'm going to make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm going to put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm going to show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're going to know for sure
That I should be your girl

[Rap]
(I should be your girl)
(I should be your girl)
Get with me tonight
I'm going to put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm going to show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're going to know for sure
That I should be your girl
