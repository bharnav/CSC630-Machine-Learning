Oh, to the floor, everybody to the floor

To the floor, everybody to the floor
MC, Nelly

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't want to let you think

I like to try you, I think you so on fire
Easy, like them other girls you be seeing
I can't deny you, I be trying to fight it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saying, I just want to make sure that
You really want me just for me
Because it's not just that I'm so impressed
By your cars and jewelry
And you know like I know
Feel that chemistry
You know I feel it just the same as you
So why don't you bring that down to me

[Chorus]
Whatever happens
It's going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
So get ready
Because you and me got business
We are going to handle it tonight
Tonight, tonight

To the floor, everybody to the floor
