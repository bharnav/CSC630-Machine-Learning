[Verse 1]
You're kissing me and saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm and lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way, I don't want to leave
Want to hold you close and feel your love inside
But I don't want to play myself
Because I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't want to fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind

[Refrain]
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you baby, I'm so lost without your love

[Verse 2]
Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me to break away from you baby
Never could resist you and I still haven't learned how
And I don't want to be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
Because I don't want to miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
Boy I'm so confused down deep inside

[Refrain]
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you baby, I'm so lost without your love
(baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(lost without your love)
(baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
Oh, you keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you baby, I'm so lost without your love
(baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(stay tonight)
(stay tonight) you keep on playing
And you keep on saying
(stay tonight) baby
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying
(I'm so lost without your love)
And you keep on saying
(stay tonight)
Baby baby baby... oh
(stay tonight) And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying, baby
And you keep on saying
(stay tonight) stay
