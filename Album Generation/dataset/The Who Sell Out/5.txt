[Intro]
Our love was

[Chorus 1]
Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly

[Chorus 2]
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning

[Bridge]
Flying, soaring
Shining morning
Never leaving
Lying, dying

[Chorus 3] [x3]
Love love love long
Love love love long [x3]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
