[Verse 1]
If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think of this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think of this

[Chorus]
Armenia, city in the sky [x2]

[Verse 2]
If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off, and think of this

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The sky is glass, the sea is brown
And everyone is upside-down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Freak out freak out!
