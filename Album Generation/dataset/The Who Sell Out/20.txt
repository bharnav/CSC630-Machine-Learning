[Chorus 1]
Girl's eyes, butterflies, how she cries, can't get through to you
She knows all the charts, breaks her heart, thinks a lot of you
Each time you play a melody, it means the earth to this little girl
Can you be cruel and break her heart, tear her small world apart

[Bridge]
She's there, eyes aglow, very front row, don't throw sticks at her
Please don't look her way, see her way, don't care anyway

[Chorus 2][x2]
It's you who led her on, I see
Just leave her down in her misery
She don't want help from you and me
Can't tell a note from a symphony

[Chorus 1]
