[Verse 1]
3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old
With life's best side on the downward slope
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope
My girl's with me and all my friends can see

[Chorus 1]
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi

[Verse 2]
Done it before, do it again
Know from experience it's not in vain
She's the best I've had, I cannot see, what someone else can do to me
It's a long way home but love's so warm, you'll see

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Early morning cold taxi
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out
Early morning cold taxi
Though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt

[Verse 3]
3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old
One day we'll be wed
This I know for it's what she said
Then no more will my mind be uneasy

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old
One day we'll be wed
This I know for it's what she said
Then no more will my mind be uneasy

[Chorus 1]
