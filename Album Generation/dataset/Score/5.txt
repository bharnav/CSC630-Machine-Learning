[Verse 1]
Animation
Breathes a cloudless mind
Fascination
Leaves the doubting blind
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
The faithful live Awake
The rest remain misled

[Pre-Chorus]
Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

[Chorus]
Innocence faded
The mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

[Verse 2]
Callow and vain
Fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
Passionless stage
Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end

[Pre-Chorus]
Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

[Chorus]
Innocence faded
The mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

[Bridge]
Beginnings get complicated
The farther we progress
Opinions are calculated
Immune to openness
Beyond the circle's edge
We're driven by her blessings
Forever hesitating
Caught beneath the wheel

[Chorus]
Innocence faded
The mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you
