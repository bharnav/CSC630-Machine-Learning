[Intro]
I touched with one
Who made me run
Away from my own soul
In this world with its
Many illusions
We are moving like mice through a
Maze

[Verse 1]
And now I find
What's left behind
Has served to make me whole
Full of doubt, deception, and delusion
Seeking purpose to all earthly days
I search within
Beneath a skin
That bears both pleasure and pain
In a world full of constant confusion
I will not be a par to the craze

[Chorus]
In the Afterlife
Will dark be bright?
Will cold be warm?
Will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
Will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

[Verse 2]
Behind closed eyes
Some comfort lies
In knowing the truth never spoken
Through this world with us
Hidden conclusion
We'll keep moving like mice through
A maze

[Chorus][x2]
