[Samples from TV News on 01/09/11]

[Verse 1]
Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically
Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

[Pre-Chorus]
No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

[Verse 2]
Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

[Chorus]
Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their Sacrificed Sons
All praise their Sacrificed Sons

[Verse 3]
Teach them
What to think and feel
Your ways
So enlightening
Words they preach
I can't relate
If God's true Love
Are acts of Hate

[Chorus]
Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their Sacrificed Sons
All praise their Sacrificed Sons

[Outro]
God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?
There's no time
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake
