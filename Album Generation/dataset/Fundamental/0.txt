You've got a problem
With the reason why
An asymmetric haircut
And a painted eye

It's psychological
(Psychological)

Is it a cry for help or call to arms?
Frustration
False alarms

It's psychological
(All in the mind)

There's something in the attic
And it smells so bad
An undertaker in a bowler hat
(Psychological)
What's that spilt on the kitchen floor?
Who's that knocking on the cellar door?

It's psychological

Or is it only your imagination?
Driving me crazy, crazy baby
Baby, please

It's psychological
(Psychological)

I thought I heard a baby cry
I thought I heard a train
Down in the cemetery
Cellophane

It's second nature to you
All in the mind

It's psychological
(Psychological)
It's psychological
(Psychological)
