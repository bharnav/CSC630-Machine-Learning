[Verse 1]
Typical day
Cars being towed away
Junk mail through the door
Joins the post on the floor
Drilling
Always someone drilling
Somewhere in the city
Authorised by committee
Permission is bestowed
According to postal code
Terms and conditions may vary
It's nothing out of the ordinary

[Chorus]
Sometimes someone gets upset
Doesn't hear the laughter
Takes it as a threat
But it's different after
After the event
Looks like someone's smiling
Happy to be here
Blue skies heaven-sent

[Verse 2]
There's a kind of glow
Illuminates the flow
Over to the east
Of traffic in the streets
Not to be outdone
The school run has begun
Mothers all arrive
Each in a four-wheel drive

[Chorus]
Sometimes someone gets upset
Doesn't hear the laughter
Takes it as a threat
But it's different after
After the event
Looks like someone's smiling
Happy to be here
Blue skies heaven-sent

[Verse 3]
Evening comes as a surprise
Suddenly someone dies
Everyone's over-reacting
With clich's and bad acting
Misty in the rain
Flowers in their cellophane
Policemen intervening
Drama without meaning
It's perfectly routine
A statement from the Queen
Obituaries appear
You can leave your tributes here

[Chorus]
Sometimes someone gets upset
Doesn't hear the laughter
Takes it as a threat
But it's different after
After the event
Looks like someone's smiling
Happy to be here
Blue skies heaven-sent
