[Intro]
It begins like this
A crowded room
A silent glance

[Verse 1]
One night can turn your head around
One night your feet are off the ground
One night could change your life forvever
One night
Just one night

[Chorus]
One night can change your life
Can take you by surprise
Tonight's your only chance
So grab it with both hands
One night you're gonna find
The night has changed your mind
It's written in your eyes
Tonight you came alive

[Verse 2]
Your eyes meet
They catch the light
Your heart beats too fast tonight
And when somebody says
Don't talk to strangers
Remember sometimes they're
The ones to aim for
One night

[Chorus]
One night can change your life
Can take you by surprise
Tonight's your only chance
So grab it with both hands
One night you're gonna find
The night has changed your mind
It's written in your eyes
Tonight you came alive

[Verse 3]
You feign surprise
Within your eyes
Your waiting for the next move
One night can last forever
One night you're one half of together

[Chorus]
One night can change your life
Can take you by surprise
Tonight's your only chance
So grab it with both hands
One night you're gonna find
The night has changed your mind
It's written in your eyes
Tonight you came alive
