[Spoken Intro]
Un, deux, trois, quatre

[Verse 1]
I feel like sending you a love letter
Lets face it, nobody does it better
You're a promising prospect
From what I've seen
If you wanna take me out on a detour
I'm not feeling too demure
I like the cut of your jib
If you know what I mean

[Chorus 1]
There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

[Verse 2]
In Berlin you're dancing to techno
Before you catch the first flight to Moscow
You know your way around an espace d'affaires
On the coast you're such a creation
And though New York's just an obligation
I've every confidence you'll amuse yourself there

[Chorus 2]
There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi
There's something about the way that you think
There's something about the wine that you drink
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

[Bridge]
It's all perception
How people see you
And when they see you
They want to be you

[Spoken Interlude]
Un, deux, trois, quatre

[Verse 3]
In Tehran they've known you for years
In spite of clerical fears
They think you understand their point of view
In the old days it would have been Rome
But now Beijing's a second home
It started in the eighties, just Bertolucci and you

[Chorus 3]
There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi
There's something about the words you employ
There's something about the clothes you enjoy
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

[Outro]
When people see you
They want to be you
