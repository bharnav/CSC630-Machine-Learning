[Verse 1]
We sailed in a fishing-boat
Between these two shores
The Island of Lovers
And the Island of Whores

[Verse 2]
You at the helm getting
Soaked to the skin
Taking me to places
I'd never been

[Chorus]
Where are you tonight?
In the clouds or on the sea?
I'm thinking of you now
Do you ever think of me?

[Verse 3]
In different locations
Taken by surprise
I woke up one morning
And looked in your eyes

[Verse 4]
What were you thinking?
I never knew
You were the captain
I was the crew

[Chorus]
Where are you tonight?
In the clouds or on the sea?
I'm thinking of you now
Do you ever think of me?

[Verse 5]
Catching my eye
I wonder what you saw?
A not quite unrequited lover
Or just another whore?

[Verse 6]
Safe in our life-jackets
Salvaged from the sea...
Now I'm drowning
Won't you rescue me?

[Chorus]
Where are you tonight?
In the clouds or on the sea?
I'm thinking of you now
Do you ever think of me?

[Outro]
"I want you
And I want you to want me, baby
I want you
And I want you to want me too
I want you
And I want you to want me, baby
I want you
And I want you to want me too
The way that I want you"
