Driving down
A one-way street
I thought you’d understand
Of all the people that I meet
We’re still not in command

It's often said
There's no escape from fate
I've even read
It's a function of the state
Though we may be out on parole
I don’t care
I’d still like to think
I’m in control

Driving down
A one-way street
I thought you’d understand
Of all the people that I meet
We’re still not in command

I took a road
That lead me straight to you
All of my life
Now seemed overdue
I’ll state the obvious
’cause it’s true
I don’t care
That this one-way street
Led to you

Driving down
A one-way street
I thought you’d understand
Of all the people that I meet
We’re still not in command

Travelling without a map
It's tricky
Too much information
You've lost me
Without you
I pray
Together
We'll go all the way

Driving down
A one-way street
Led me straight to you
All my life was in retreat
Now it’s overdue
Driving down
A one-way street
Drove me round the bend
Life is just a one-way street
From start to end
