Let's drive round the ring road
Go round in circles
Just for the ride
Oh I'll be so happy
Being with you

We'll stop in a lay-by
By the allotments
No one will see
Oh I'll be so happy
Fooling around
Just you and me

Taking me for a ride
Taking it in your stride
Somewhere to run and hide
Parked by the road side
With you

I like riding dodgems
With your arm round me
My fantasy
Oh I'd be so happy
Bumping the cars
Being with you

Taking me for a ride
Taking it in your stride
Somewhere to run and hide
Parked by the road side
With you
