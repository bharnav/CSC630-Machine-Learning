(Running away)

Baby you’re good to me
But sometimes my reverie invites a flock of gulls
And though I can handle it
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever prove them wrong
I wouldn’t care
If they just stayed upstairs

Dancing in the dusk
Oh, it feels like I’m running away
(Running away)
Dancing in the dusk
I didn’t mean to be distant today
Dancing in the dusk
(Running away)
Dancing in the dusk

(Running away)

When I fall into dreams
Things are not as they seem
But I will let you in
On the relentless fear
Of waking without you here
To prove that they were wrong
I wouldn’t mind
If they came one bird at a time

Dancing in the dusk
Oh, it feels like I’m running away
(Running away)
Dancing in the dusk
I didn’t mean to be distant today
Dancing in the dusk
(Running away)
Dancing in the dusk

Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

I’d never bother if you were just another girl
