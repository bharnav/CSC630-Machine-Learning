Now is the time of our lives
But it won't last long
We're strong and in spite of the fight
You sing this song

It's always a new day in heaven
There's always a new way to heaven

You my brother
I'm really gonna miss you
You my brother
You're gonna take me with you
You my brother

Forever

Where do we stand in this land
We're invisible now
Clean an prepared to elect
Indivisible

It's always forever in heaven
We'll all be together in heaven

You my brother
I'm really gonna miss you
You my brother
You're gonna take me with you

We'll be together now and forever
We'll be together now and forever

I know that it won't be that long
Until the hour
Free and released from the world
It feels like power

You my brother
I'm really gonna miss you
You my brother
You're gonna take me with you
You my brother (It's the time)
I'm really gonna miss you
You my brother (It's the time)
You're gonna take me with you
