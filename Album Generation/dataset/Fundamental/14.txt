A brave face
Stiff upper lip
Will do the trick
Look
The mask is firm
The face is mine
It seems fine

Until the final day
I'll play this part
The only way
I can
For to live
I have to give
The performance of my life

What's the truth?
Well I won't bore you
With the truth
I knew
It would be tough
Right from day one
But you go on

Until the final day
I'll play this part
The only way
I can
For to live
I have to give
The performance of my life

Made it to the top
Although the road was steep
And there I had a dream
A vision of love
Revealed in sleep

Right on cue
I fell in love with you
You caused
Many a tear
But I had applause
I had a career

Until the final day
I'll play this part
The only way
I can
For to live
I have to give
The performance of my life
