This is no time for tears
Though our hearts are bleeding
One for all and all for one
For freedom

A bird flies across the sea
Free as his brother
Where is the freedom
We've been dreaming of
For so long?

Oh brother
Waiting is so long
Life is soon over
It can't be wrong
To cast off
Chains that still bind us
Let death remind us
We can be strong

Sister don't let me down
Please don't forsake me
One for all and all for one
For freedom today
One for all and all for one
Means freedom
Today
