Too straight no reaction
I don't care if I'm not in fashion
I will follow you
I will follow you
Its hearts up heads down puddle of red wine
You get back up and you face the crime
I will follow you
Something in me almost breaks but I wait
(I'm sinking in my skin)
Yeah, I wait
(My heart is wearing thin)
'Cuz I'm looking for something beautiful
You cut me up and you make me bleed
A sad stained heart hanging on my sleeve
I'll still follow you
I will follow you
And you say look up look up look all around you
Can't you see the love that surrounds the very soul of you
Something in me almost breaks but I wait
(I'm sinking in my skin)
Yeah, I wait
(My heart is wearing thin)
'Cuz I'm looking for something beautiful
And I wait
(For it to go right in)
Don't come all day
(My heart is wearing thin)
That I fall upon something beautiful, something meaningful
You still your soul, I'll risk it all
Your fearless beauty breaks your fall
Something in me knows there's something more
And it's so close I wanna run, but I wait
(I'm sinking in my skin)
And I wait
(My heart is wearing thin)
'Cuz I'm looking for something beautiful
And I wait
(For it to go right in)
And I wait
(My heart is wearing thin)
That I fall upon something beautiful
Something beautiful, something meaningful
Something beautiful, something beautiful
