All my life I thought I was the one to save the world
It would come easy
Now I'm old enough to sit around and piss and moan instead

Plant a tree and I will gladly admire its beauty
10 to 12 inches
Don't expect that I will get out of my chair to watch it grow

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to
Weed

Those are people with their votes and all them hippie thoughts
They do it better
If I got involved I'd only get in everybody's way

Shine my shoes and I won't say a word behind your back
Yeah we're all brothers
Don't expect that I will share my plate when your ribs start to show

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to

Dandelion dandelion
Souls of you and me
How can you smell so bad but look so pretty?

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to

I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to
Turn my back and turn to
Turn my back and turn to
Weed
