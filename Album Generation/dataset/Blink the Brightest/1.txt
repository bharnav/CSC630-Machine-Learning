Whether it's the sunshine
Whether it's the rain
Doesn't make a difference
Till you complain
Whether it's the water comin' in from the roof
Does it piss you off
That you're not waterproof?

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
It's whether you get up
It's whether you get up

And you hate the silence
As it fills up the room
And there's not much to say
To your blushing groom
Maybe all eyes are on you
As you finish the race
And the world sees you struggling
For last place

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
It's whether you get up
It's whether you get up

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
Whether you get up
Whether you get up
