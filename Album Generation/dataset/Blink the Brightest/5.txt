My stubborn skin is wearing thin
I bared my soul, you waltzed right in
I gave you everything
And you just made me feel so very..

Naked
And I don't remember
How I let myself become so unraveled

I spilled my guts on your best shoes
You keep it in, I rang it loose
It's only love that makes me feel like getting so completely..

Naked
And I don't remember
How I let myself become so unraveled
I'm naked
Pretty as a heartache
Waiting for my second skin to settle in

Your hardened heart can't hide you now
It loves as much as you allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just take you down
And you'll be..

Naked
Nothing but a heartache
And you know there's nothing that can hide you now
You're naked
Pretty as a heartache
Going out exactly how you came in
