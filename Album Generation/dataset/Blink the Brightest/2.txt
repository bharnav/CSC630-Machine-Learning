I’D LIKE TO BE MY OWN BEST FRIEND
TURNS OUT THERE’S NO RECIPROCAL FEELINGS
WHAT A TOTAL SNOB, HOO HOO HOO HOO
SOMETIMES I WRITE HER LETTERS
AND I’VE SEEN HER HANDS
AND I KNOW THEY’RE NOT BROKEN
SO COME ON WOULD IT KILL YA?
TO WRITE A DAMN LETTER?
SO I LET IT SLIDE
DAY TO DAY REJECTION
STILL I CAN’T ERASE
FEELINGS THAT WE’RE CLOSE
WE’RE VERY CLOSE
CORNERED HER IN THE GIRL’S ROOM
SAID “HEY, YOU’RE NOT SO TOUGH. NOW GIVE ME SOME LOVIN”
THAT’S NO WAY TO GO NOW, NOT A WAY TO ACT NOW, NOT A WAY TO GO DOWN
THEN I HEARD HER SING
LOVE IS ALL AROUND YOU
AND THE GREATEST LOVE
SOMEWHERE HERE RESIDES
HERE IT RESIDES....
AUGUST SUN IS HANGING LOW SCHAAP IS ON THE RADIO
AND A LOVE COMES OVER ME
TWISTED LIPS AS CHARLIE SWINGS NOTES FLY OUT AS IF ON WINGS THIS IS HOW WE WANT TO BE
BREAK THE LIMIT IN MY AMC HORNET CUDDLE NECKING ALL ALONG THE WAY DRIVE UP TO READING TO THE SEVEN FEATHERS BETTING
MERLE AND BIFF WILL SHOW US HOW TO PLAY
TAKE ME IN YOUR BEADS OF BLUE ALL THE MISFIRES LEAD TO YOU
ONCE THE BATTLE WOUNDS WERE CLEAN
LOVE IS SIMPLE LOVE IS FREE DOESN’T HAVE TO TWIST AND BLEED BABY YOU UNTANGLE ME
UNA BORACHA BEFORE I MET-CHA WRECKLESS DANGER CLAPPING ON THE BEAT MASTS OF MANHATTA BROUGHT US TOGETHA SHOES TIED STRAIGHT LINES HEADING OUT TO SEA
