What, what do I know
About anything?
Love is a two-headed beast
Clumsy and stupid
Ready to crush everything

What do we know, do we know about it?
What do I know, do I know about it?
Soon as it comes
I'm all thumbs

Now, now it's confirmed
Love is a bottle
In Tijuana
It puts up a good fight
Willing to lose everything

What do we know, do we know about it?
What do I know, do I know about it?

Soon as it comes
I'm all thumbs

Crash
Burn
Still I don't learn
I don't know why
"I love you, good-bye"
Always makes perfect sense at the time

What do I know, do I know about it?
What do we know, do we know about it?
Soon as it comes
I'm all thumbs

Where would I be, would I be without it?
What do we know, do we know about it?
Soon as it comes
We play dumb
