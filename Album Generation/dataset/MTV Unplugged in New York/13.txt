[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

[Verse 4]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
(Shiver the whole night)

[Verse 5]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 6]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 7]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines
The sun don't shine
I'd shiver... the whole night through
(Thank you)
