[Verse 1]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion

Invented at your birth

[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside of me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion

Invented at your birth

[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
And store it deep inside of me
