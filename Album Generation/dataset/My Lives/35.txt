When a star is born
They receive a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a dream come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
Love's sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true

Ooh, like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and I sees you through
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true
