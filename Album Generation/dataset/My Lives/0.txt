Well I climb the highest mountain
And I swim the deepest sea
If I knew you were riding at my journey's end

And waiting for me I'll be there, I know that you'll love me
I know whatever that you'll say and I go anyway
If I knew you were waiting there at my journey's end

Now I may travel the end of the earth
But it really doesn't matter what I say
I'll come back someday

Now I know someone who's telling and I said now that it makes
If I knew you were there at my journey's end
To be mine for the rest of my day

But now it really doesn't matter
How many days I may spend
'Cause I go anywhere if I knew you were waiting there
At my journey's end

Whoa oh oh, at my journey's end
Oh oh oh oh, at my journey's end
