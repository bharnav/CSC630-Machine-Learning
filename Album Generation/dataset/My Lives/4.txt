From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and west of the Rio Grande

Well, he started with a bank in Colorado;
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
And the word spread of Billy the Kid

Well, he never traveled heavy; yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many other guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart, and he never had a home
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name

Well, he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they loved to tell
About when Billy the Kid came to town

[Musical interlude]

Well, one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said, "String him up for what he did."
And the cowboys and their kin
Like the sea came pouring in
To watch the hanging of Billy the Kid

And he never traveled heavy; yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many other guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart, but he finally found a home
Underneath the boot hill grave that bears his name

From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and west of the Rio Grande
