Don't get me wrong
I ain't the kind
To turn away from you
When something's on your mind

But you have to know
You just have to see
I'm having my troubles, babe
And they're all too much for me

You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time to pass along the bad news
Tell me why you try to give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time 'cause this man's got the blues

Don't get me wrong
You're not alone
I'd like to help you
But I've got problems of my own

It's a bitter phase
I'm going through
And I can run from strangers, darlin'
But I just can't hide from you

You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time to pass along the bad news
Tell me why you try to give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time and I ain't got time to lose

Ain't it the truth when they say
That the only thing worth dying for is our freedom
Ain't it the proof that someday
We will all be lying on our backs
Free at last from income tax

Don't you get me wrong
The mood won't last
And I'll be myself again
Soon as this pain has passed

And I'm standing here
Don't ask me how
I'll make it up to you
Someday but not right now

You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time to pass along the bad news
You caused a real hard line to invade my isolation
You picked a real bad time 'cause this man's got the blues

Ain't it the truth when they say
All you need is love but all you'll want is forgiveness
Ain't it the proof that someday
Even love will not provide for man
The way that life insurance can

You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time to pass along the bad news
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you tryin' to give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time, 'cause this man's got the blues
