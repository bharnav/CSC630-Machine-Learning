This is your life, you've got problems with your wife
She once made you mashed potatoes, now she gives you Minute Rice
And she used to do your laundry now she sends it out instead
And she always made believe that she was satisfied in bed

That's what she used to say, but that's how things were yesterday
Looks like the good ol' days were gone
That's how she used to be, but that goes down as history
Time has the way of movin' on

Oh I know she was there when you needed lovin' care
And she only used the car to drive the children everywhere
And I'm sure she washed the windows and I'm sure she waxed the floors
But now she doesn't call you her Prince Charming anymore

That's what she used to say, but that's how things were yesterday
Looks like the good ol' days were gone
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history
Time has the way of movin' on

She's not the sweet little girl that she was before
You're not the end of the world anymore
You're not the end of the world

She wins when you fight and she goes to school at night
She leaves you home to babysit and watch "The Price Is Right"
And she wants the joint account to see where all the money goes
So she doesn't have to talk you into buying all the clothes

That's what she used to say, but that what things were yesterday
Looks like the good ol' days was bored
That's how she used to be, but that goes down as history
Time bridged the way of movin' on

She's not your li--little girl that she was before
You're not the end of the world anymore
You're not the end of the world
