One, two, a-one two three four

I got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I got a chp on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey
But I'll be back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show 'em what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

Oh I don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna lock myself away, hey
But I'll be back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show 'em what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead
Until then, I'll cry instead
Until then, I'll cry instead

(Thank you very much. Thank you all.)
