Do you really want me, am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long
Respect and love is the key, just listen to my song
Yeah yeah... mmm

Boy, listen to me carefully now
'Cause this is something every man should know
Oh, this is a lesson about how
You treat your girl right, just let it show
That you love her, that you need her

Say, yeah, that you want her in every way
You gotta show your girl a little respect
Or you won't get nothing back but hate
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right or get out of her sight

Oh oh
Do you really want me, am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long
Respect and love is the key just listen to my song

Safe, it is how she wants to feel
Protect her with all you've got
Oh, she wants to know your love's for real
And be a good lover, make her hot

Then she'll do everything, love you day and night
She'll do anything, just do her right
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right or get out of her si-ight

Do you really want me, am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long
Respect and love is the key just listen to my song

Girls don't give up, give your best
No part time job, no time to rest
Let him know what's up before
So he can give you more and more

All right
Yeah yeah

You gotta show your girl a little respect
Or you won't get nothing back but hate
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right or get out of her site

Do you really want me, am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long

Do you really want me, am I really special
Taking is so easy, boys giving is unusual
If you really want me, don't make we wait too long
Mmm... just listen to my song, my song

You better show me baby
Show me respect now
You've got to show me baby
Show me respect now

You've got to show me baby
Show me respect now
You better show me baby
Show me respect now
