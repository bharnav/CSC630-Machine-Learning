Sometimes life can be a bumpy ride
Sometimes it feels
Like you're driving with covered eyes
And you listen to your friend who's in the car
By your side

They say they've got your map
What if your friends are tellin' lies
So listen to your heart
Cause you can't see no roadsigns

You don't know where to stop or to turn
Everyone goes through it
I'm in the middle of mine
And I try to remember it's the only way to learn

Hold on
(You've gotta hold on)
Hold on
(You've gotta hold on)
You gotta stay real true to yourself in the game
Of becomin' a woman
Where the rules never stay the same
Remember who you are
Who made you and who's keeping you here

Who's making you not duck for problems in fear?
People in your way
Dogs and bitches
Who's licking your ass?
Liars and snitches

Even though it's a bumpy ride
Keep your head above the waterline
Keep focused
And you'll make it through

Keep on rolling is what you've got to do
Even though it's a bumpy ride
Don't you slip and don't you slide
Love will be there in the end
When you come around that bend

You've gotta keep your flow smooth
Never hesitate
Never stop believing
Always keepin' the faith

But always be critical
Never naive
'Cause if you can be that
There's so much more you can achieve

Maybe then
When you're grown up satisfied and strong
Maybe then
You will be happy
Happy that you held on
