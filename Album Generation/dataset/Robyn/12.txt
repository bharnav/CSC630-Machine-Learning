Do u know
What I think about all these nights
When I can't sleep
Sleep at all
Oh slowly
I close my eyes
My thoughts they fly away to you
No matter what I do
And wish I could turn back time
Back to the time when you were mine
And I wish
I wish the day, the day you went away
Never happened baby
I wish the stars, the stars and heaven
Would come down to me
So I could give them to you
And tell then would u be
Loving me like I wish

And it's so hard
When you love someone this much
But you just don't know how
How to love him the right way
If you could see
What you've done to me
What you've done to my heart
What you've done to me soul
Baby all of my mind and all of my body
Then you should know
Why I can't let go
And baby I
I wish the day, the day you went away
Never happened
I wish the sars, the stars and heaven would come down to me
So I could give them to you
And tell me then would you be
Loving me like I wish

I don't know what you want me to do
To prove my love is real for you
I don't know what you want me to say baby
There is no if's or maybe's
All I want is you
Cause baby you are my only wish
Oooo, my only wish
