[Intro]
You've got that something
You've got that something

[Verse 1]
Look at me
Here I am
I'm giving all of my loving
Every day of my life to you
All you see can be yours
If you show me
You want me
And just one little hint will do
And I know
I give too much
And there is much that I sacrifice
But I've got all the reasons
When I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I love you
Even though I shouldn't
And you should know I've tried to stop

[Chorus]
But you've got that somethin'
Something I can't describe
It gives me that feeling
It gives me that freaking vibe
You've got that somethin'
That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waiting
Until the day that you will be mine
All mine

[Verse 2]
You decide to take your time
I just want you to know
That I'll always be here for you
Friends keep telling me
You gotta let go
They say that I'm too good for you
And maybe that is true

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'll just keep on
Loving you the way I did before
And you should know I've tried to stop

[Chorus]
But you've got that something
Something I can't describe
It gives me that feeling
It gives me that freaking vibe
You've got that somethin'
That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waiting
Until the day that you will be mine

[Bridge]
You've got that somethin'
Something so hard to find
And it keeps buggin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind

[Chorus]
Cause you've got that somethin'
Something I can't describe
It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe
You've got that somethin'
That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waiting
Until the day that you will be mine
You've got that somethin'
Somethin' so hard to find
And it keeps buggin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind
