I believe we'll win, I believe the soul
Believe I am, in the control
To start
To start
To start again

I believe the wind, I believe the soul
Believe I am, in the control
To start
To start
To start again

Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in someone
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in something

So you make the change, make the change that would
Be embraced on the side of good
I believe in sin, because I think it could
Be the hand that holds the world

Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in someone
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in something

God held me and told me you fight your enemies
Don't let them make your end, you will make everything
You will make everything
The way it has to be
God held me

You're living through, you're living through and fighting
You're living through, you're living through and fighting

I believe we'll win, I believe it all
Believe I am, in the control
Believe we'll win, I believe it all
Believe I am, in the control

Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in someone
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in something

Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in someone
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in something

You're living through, you're living through and fighting
You're living through, you're living through and fighting
You're living through, you're living through and fighting
You're living through, you're living through and fighting

I believe we'll win, I believe us all
Believe I am, out of control
I believe we'll win, I believe us all
Believe I am, out of control
