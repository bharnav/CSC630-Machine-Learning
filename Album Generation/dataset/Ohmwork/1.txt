Pardon my depression, my mind's in recession
Compulsion for confession, my soul's obsession
Hey, now I'm fallin' apart today
Yeah, yeah, now I'm fallin' apart

Pardon my depression, my mind's in recession
Compulsion for confession, it's my soul's obsession

Pardon my intrusion, I need a truth infusion
My life is just illusion, pardon my intrusion
Hey, now I'm fallin' apart today
Yeah, yeah, now I'm fallin' apart

Pardon my intrusion, I need a truth infusion
My life is just illusion, pardon my intrusion

I've got nothing to say to you
Except that I am confused
I've got nothing to say to you
Except that I am so used

Pardon my aggression, my symbol of oppression
My only indiscretion, it's my last transgression
Hey, now I'm fallin' apart today
Yeah, yeah, now I'm fallin' apart

Pardon my aggression, my symbol of oppression
My only indiscretion, it's my last transgression

I've got nothing to say to you
Except that I am confused
I've got nothing to say to you
Except that I am so used

Pardon my depression
Pardon my depression

Yeah, yeah, now I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I'm fallin' apart
