Pull the string, it's a ravenous thought

A ridiculous plot

Brought on by the enemies

Full disgrace, all of which is bought by all of you

Full disgrace, all of which is bought by all of you

Empty race, need a leader, not a criminal mind

Who is blind to the anarchy in life

Full disgrace, all of which

Is bought by all of you

Such a waste, all of which

Is bought by all of you

Unfit, overpaid, unfit, got it made

I know you're so unclean

I'll never trust you again

Sympathy that I won't make

Stay away and just decay

I'll never trust you again

Pull the string, yeah

I'm angry and lost

A ridiculous plot

Brought on by the enemy

Full disgrace, all of which

Is bought by all of you

Full disgrace, all of which

Is bought by all of you

Human race

We are told to rely on the lies

That supply all the empathy and cries

Enemies, all of which is bought by all of you

Full disgrace, all of which is bought by all of you

I did it all and I gave it all and I did it all

That's why I'm ruined

That's why I'm ruined

That's why I'm finished
