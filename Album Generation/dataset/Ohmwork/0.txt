This whole wide world Ive traveled
Ive seen the sins of other men
The secrets that Ive unraveled
Theyve made me who I am today
The one who sold out all of my dreams
Can you tell me what this all did mean
When the whole world has fallen
I will be living in a dream
The claims of war and poverty
They are holding you and me
Low, how far can we push this
Own, run my life like a misfit
Hate, Ive grown to live my life by this word
Take, Im taking none of your lies anymore
Low, Own, Hate, Take
