Simply there
A reflection of someone that you made
But its like the one, like the one you trust
Like the one you know
Its all made up by you
Force fed, man made
Pseudocide
This is created by the fuel to be fired in the mind to kill everything
You are now extinct
Exempt to become someone else, so
Force fed, man made, so fake
Pseudocide
Cannot hide from the ones that know of your plan
Were not like the ones, like the ones you fooled
Like the ones you must, you impress, so hopeless
Simply there
A reflection of someone that you made
But its like the one, like the one you trust
Like the one you know
Its all made up by you
