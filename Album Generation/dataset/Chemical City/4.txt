You feel the weight of the weight on your shoulders
Cuz everyday gets shorter and colder
And hand in hand we walk through leather fire
The mountains bleed red as the sun gets higher

All the things that you are I provide
'Til your footprint is swept away by the tide
I can wait for awhile I don't mind
Yeah I can wait for awhile cuz I got time

Wish you was less of a way his
With it were more of the way you could be
And you could put your faith in me for a while
In the end I hope you're free cuz I'll be out of style

All the things that you are I provide
'Til your footprint is swept away by the tide
And I can wait for awhile I don't mind
Yeah I can wait for awhile I got time (I got time)

Whoever said you can't be saved by a song
Whoever said that is stringing you along
We're all afraid to be dead and gone
This will live on it will live on it will live on

And all the things that you are I provide
Til your footprint is swept away by the tide
And I can wait for awhile I don't mind
Yeah I can wait for awhile I got time

And all the things you're looking for I hope you'll find
Before your footprint is swept away by the tide
And I can wait for awhile I don't mind
Yeah I can wait for awhile I got time
And I can wait for awhile I don't mind
Yeah I can wait for awhile I got time (I got time)
