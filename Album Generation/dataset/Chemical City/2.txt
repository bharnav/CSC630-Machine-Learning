Our love is dark thoughts as it is bright lights
It's the sound of a teardrop falling down from a great height
So don't let go, let waters flow

And babe you have nothing to fear for
This is as real as the rain
My love for you is as deep as a coalmine

You move like moonshine straight to my head
This is a storyline we write from the same bed
You had for sale a holy grail

And babe you have nothing to fear for
This is as real as the rain
My love for you is as deep as a coalmine

And our love is dark thoughts as it is bright lights
And it's the sound of a teardrop falling down from a great height

And babe you have nothing to fear for
This is as real as the rain
My love for you is as deep as a coalmine
No, babe you have nothing to fear for
This is as real as the rain
My love for you is as deep as a coalmine

If you were marked with a bullet
I'd jump in front of it
I'd rather die for love than die for the want of it
Forever alive, forever forward
I have no use at all for any more words

I'll take on all of your sorrows for mine my dear, till the days run clear, until they start to shine, coming through your window, head on your pillow, the sight is honey for my mind girl and I've been digging, ever deeper, this love gets easier the more it's sung to, the more it rings true, the more I find the breath to help sing with these miner's lungs...
