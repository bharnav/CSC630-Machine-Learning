We are descendants of the free
We are the soldiers of the Cause
We shouted out the same decree
To hold the truth above the law

Those were the nights to remember
Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced
While the city slept

I was born a restless soul
I never did what I was told
That old fire rages on
I hope it burns after I'm gone

I'm getting tired of the same old thing
It only takes one soul to make a change
It takes two young hearts to make it beat again
Three long nights and you're on the mend
Living, loving, swinging, ducking
We might fail but we have to try
I poked my finger in the public eye

Those were the nights to remember
Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced
While the city slept

We are the only chance
This is our resistance
And if we fail then we all know
How it goes, it goes
How it goes, it goes

I navigate the mines we lay
And I'm comin' home but not today
I fought my way through the hungry mob
The Mayor and his henchmen on the job
We faced-off like it was High Noon
We both let fly and our aim was true
Yeah!

Those were the nights to remember
Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced
While the city slept
Those were the nights to remember
Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced
While the city slept

So even if you can't see it
You can still believe in it
It's easier if you lose all the things that prevent you from seeing it
In the evening sun when the Earth and sky are one
We all come undone and remember where we came from

So even if you can't see it
You can still believe in it
It's easier if you lose all the things that prevent you from seeing it
In the evening sun when the Earth and sky are one
We all come undone and remember where we came from
