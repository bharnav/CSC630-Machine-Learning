Ooh, it's got me mystified, heavy now
Deep down to my soul
You try to keep the wheel steady now
Easy as she goes
I can hear on the wind a tale that needs to be told again
The horizon bends at either end and the sea can't tell a foe from a friend

I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

I was never satisfied with any life 'til she called my name
The air on the high ground was rarefied, every day the same
And old fears were always near but when we set sail they disappeared
There are those who fear the deep but the world don't wait when your faith won't leap

And I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

Then we watched as the Southern Cross led the sailors home, constellation borne
We set sail in a heavy gale and to the sea many of us thrown
And there were times when my courage failed but I never bowed to the storm
Whatever path you choose to walk, in the end, you walk alone

Ooh, it's got me mystified heavy now
Tongue-tied to the anchor chain
You try to keep your hand steady now
But it slips again
And landfall surprised us all and she broke on the rocks like a china doll
You can hear the siren call for the last dance at Poseidon's Ball

I know it was only a dream
As delicate a dragonfly wing
I hope it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing
