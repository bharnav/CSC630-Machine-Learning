When it comes calling, will you heed the call?
When it gets heavy now, will you let it fall?
And as the loon cries it opens minds
The stream reflects these Northern climes
Through these days we walk the line
Sixteen dollars and a couple of dimes

There've been a number of times
Took a step back, couldn't read the signs
Cross the plains till they start to climb
Down to the valley where the river winds
Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...

Grey skies, the waters rise
Mind flood's gonna break the bank
Will it wash us away now? Will it wash us away now?
Blue skies, the river dries
A light goes out before your eyes
Till the break of day now, till the break of day now

Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...
Goin' down to the river now, mind flood's got my head in the gutter
Will it wash us all away?
You come to with a shiver now
Flash back eighth grade with a stutter
Will it wash us all away?

If love is a cult we are all believers
Cruel, passionate underachievers
Fools lashing out at the dreamers
Kiss the enemy and kill the redeemer
We are indeed a dying breed
We are the people of the sky
So when the river floods and you're made from mud
Get yourself up high....

Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...
Goin' down to the river now, mind flood's got my head in the gutter
Will it wash us all away?
You come to with a shiver now
Flash back eighth grade with a stutter
Will it wash it all away?
Goin' down to the river now, mind flood's got my head in the gutter
Will it wash us all away?
Whoa, come and wash it all away, all away...
Get yourself up high...

The wolf's eyes have found their prize
And you have found your place in it all....
