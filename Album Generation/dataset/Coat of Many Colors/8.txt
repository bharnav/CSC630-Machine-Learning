[Verse 1: Dolly Parton & Sia]
Here I am, here I am, here I am
If you need a love that's true
Need someone to stand by you
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am

[Chorus: Dolly Parton & Sia, Both]
Here I am, I’m reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been searching for
Oh here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am

[Verse 2: Dolly Parton & Sia]
My world is such an empty place
I need someone to fill the space
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Because I’ve got so much love to give
I need someone to share it with
And here I am (Here I am)
Oh here I am, here I am
Oh

[Chorus: Dolly Parton & Sia, Both]
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been searching for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am
Oh here I am,
Here I am

[Outro: Dolly Parton & Sia, Both]
Oh here I am
Oh here I am,
Here I am
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am, yeah
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am, hmmm
