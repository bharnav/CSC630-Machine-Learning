She meticulously curls her hair, her hair, her hair, her long blond hair
Applies mascara with the greatest care, with care, with care, the utmost care

She puts on lipstick that is scarlet red
She's already fairly off her head

Fishnet stockings and a bottle of wine, she's fine, she's fine, she thinks she's fine

Girls, you better watch out
Schizophrenic Playboys
Cannot handle their toys

Girls, you better watch out
Schizophrenic playboys
Cannot handle their toys

Baby, baby will you'll come with me, with me, with me, please come with me
I'll take you places that you'd rather be, to be, to be, to come with me
Driving faster now in his car
Now she knows that she has gone too far
In the morning she is in his bed, his bed, his bed, her eyes are red

Girls, you better watch out
Schizophrenic Playboys
Cannot handle their toys

Girls, you better watch out
Schizophrenic Playboys
Cannot handle their toys

I'm in, I'm out, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out, I'm out

Boys, you better watch out
Schizophrenic Playgirls
Cannot handle their curls

Girls, you better watch out
Schizophrenic Playboys
Cannot handle their toys
