I looked for love in every single situation
For something, someone
That would last a lifetime, a love that never dies
And I find

CHORUS

You know when I wake, when I rise, when I pray, when I curse You
And You love me the same
You know when I stumble and fall, and You're there through it all
The only unchanging one

I looked for faith on the edge of my roof
No fear, daddy's here
Still I struggle to trust You with the rest of my life
When I could just fly

CHORUS

You know when I wake, when I rise, when I pray, when I curse You
And You love me the same
You know when I stumble and fall, and You're there through it all
The only unchanging one
I looked for God

CHORUS

You know when I wake, when I rise, when I pray, when I curse You
And You love me the same
You know when I stumble and fall, and You're there through it all
The only unchanging one

You know my inmost being
You know my deepest scars
You know my darkest secrets
You know and You love and You love
