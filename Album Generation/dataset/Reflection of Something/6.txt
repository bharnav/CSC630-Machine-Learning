Looking out the window at the clouds flying by
I wonder if You moved them with a thought or with a breath
And as they pass, I see the beauty of the sky
And wonder how You decided to make it that blue
And once again I'm amazed

I see the miracle of a baby being born
And wonder how You give us life
I see this young boy trying to grow into a man
And wonder how You let us live so long
And once again I'm amazed

CHORUS
I can see the majesty You have made
I gaze into the eyes of Your creatures
I can feel the wind You breathe on my face
And I'm amazed... at the wonder of it all

When beauty breaks forth from the shell of a worm
I wonder how You give it wings
When green leaves burst into the colors of a flame
I wonder why October is time for the display
And once again I'm amazed

CHORUS
I can see the majesty You have made
I gaze into the eyes of Your creatures
I can feel the wind You breathe on my face
And I'm amazed... at the wonder of it all

BRIDGE
I'm amazed, speechless
Stand in awe, astounded
Can't believe, Jesus
What You've done for me

The wonder of it all

I can see the majesty You have made
I gaze into the eyes of Your creatures
I can feel the wind You breathe on my face And I'm amazed... at the wonder of it all
