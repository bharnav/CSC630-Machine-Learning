[Verse 1]
Which Jesus do you follow?
Which Jesus do you serve?
If Ephesians says to imitate Christ
Why do you look so much like the world?

[Chorus 1]
'Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the arrogant
So which one do you want to be?

[Verse 2]
Blessed are the poor in spirit
Or do we pray to be blessed with the wealth of this land
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness
Or do we ache for another taste of this world of shifting sand

[Chorus 2]
'Cause my Jesus bled and died for my sins
He spent His time with thieves and sluts and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the rich
So which one do you want to be?

[Verse 3]
Who is this that You follow?
This picture of the American dream
If Jesus was here would you walk right by on the other side
Or fall down and worship at His holy feet?

[Verse 4]
Pretty blue eyes and curly brown hair and a clear complexion
Is how you see Him as He dies for Your sins
But the Word says He was battered and scarred or did you miss that part
Sometimes I doubt we'd recognize Him

[Chorus 3]
'Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and the least of these
He loved the poor and accosted the comfortable
So which one do you want to be?
'Cause my Jesus would never be accepted in my church
The blood and dirt on His feet might stain the carpet
But He reaches for the hurting and despises the proud
And I think He'd prefer Beale St. to the stained glass crowd
And I know that He can hear me if I cry out loud

[Post-Chorus]
I want to be like my Jesus
I want to be like my Jesus
I want to be like my Jesus
I want to be like my Jesus

[Verse 5]
Not a posterchild for American prosperity, but like my Jesus
You see I'm tired of living for success and popularity
I want to be like my Jesus but Iâ€™m not sure what that means
To be like You Jesus

[Outro]
'Cause You said to live like You, love like You
But then You died for me
Can I be like You Jesus?
I want to be like You Jesus
I want to be like You Jesus
