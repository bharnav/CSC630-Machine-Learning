[Verse 1]
I saw the Lord, seated on a throne, high and exalted
And the train of His robe filled the temple
Above Him were angels, with six mighty wings
With two they'd cover their faces
With two they'd cover their feet
And with two they’d fly
With two they'd fly… and sing

[Chorus 1]
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
He's glorious

[Verse 2]
I said, "Woe to me, I am ruined
For I am unclean, and so are all my kind
But my eyes have seen the King
The Lord Almighty, the Lord Almighty"

[Chorus 2]
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
He's glorious

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And an angel flew to me and he had fire in His hand
And he put it to my lips and God took away my sin
He took away my sin
So we sing…

[Chorus 3]
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
And holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory

[Post-Chorus]
He's glorious
He's glorious
He's glorious
He's glorious
He's glorious

[Outro]
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
And the whole earth is full of His glory
