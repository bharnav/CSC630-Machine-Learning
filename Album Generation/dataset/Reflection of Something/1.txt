I was born with no chance at life
Dead before I took my first breath
I was born with no family ties
Alone before I knew where I lived

CHORUS:
They called me broken, worthless, and a shame
They called me wasted, used up, and chained
But You made me Your child
And You called me Your own
Now they can call me
But they've got to use my new name

I walked miles and couldn't find a home
There was no place that I belonged
I walked for days and days and weeks and years
Couldn't find a melody for my song

CHORUS

I don't need money, I don't need fame
I don't need the love that this world can bring
I don't need this prison, I don't need these chains
I needed a Father, and Child is my new name
