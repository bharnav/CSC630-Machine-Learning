[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I need a little more sunshine in the middle of rain
Need a little more joy in the middle of pain
Need a little more color in the middle of this plain jane

[Refrain]
'Cause I've looked as deep as I can see
And I think I need a little more You
In the middle of me

[Verse 2]
I need a little more patience in the middle of stress
I need a little more beauty in the middle of this mess
Need a little more substance in the middle of this emptiness

[Refrain]
I've looked as deep as I can see
And I think I need a little more You
In the middle of me

[Bridge]
I need more of You and less of me
More of You and a little less insanity
More of You and a little less complexity
I've looked as deep as I can see
And it seems more of You is better for me

[Verse 3]
I need a little more rhythm in the middle of this lazy rhyme
Need a little more spontaneity in the middle of this daily grind
Need a little more truth, not music, in this world of lies

[Refrain]
'Cause I've looked as deep as I can see
And I think I need a little more You
In the middle of me

[Outro]
Oh, in the middle of me
O-oh in the middle
