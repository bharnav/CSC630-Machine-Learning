Our mistake was the love we made
I didn't deliberate
But I never meant you wrong
No I didn't mean it

If you've ever lost a loved one I pray for you, I really do
If you've ever lost a loved one I pray for you

'Cause there's a sad and lonely comfort
In the hollow of your eyes
But don't you let it take you over
'Cause it will eat you up inside

I heard you're married to a house carpenter
And your love will never be mine

If you're not breathing why am I
Left alone in this ship
If you're not breathing
Why am I left alone?

With a sad and lonely comfort
Of the hollow in your eyes
But don't you let it take me under
'Cause it will eat me up inside

I'm sure you're married to your house carpenter
And your love will never be mine

All the pain and the way it was
All of the shame and the hate
Because I was in love with the way it was
All that I do I do for you
All the pain and the way it was
All of the shame and the hate
Because I was in love with the way it was
All that I do I do for you

If you're not breathing why am I
Left alone in this ship
If you're not breathing why am I left alone?

With a sad and lonely comfort
Of the hollow in your eyes
But won't let it take me over
'Cause it will eat me up inside

I'm sure you're buried with your house carpenter
And your face I'll never see no more
Your face I'll never see no more
Your face Your face Your face Your face

With a sad and lonely comfort
Of the hollow in your eyes
But I won't let it take me under
'Cause it will eat me up inside
Yeah I heard you're married to a house carpenter
And your love will never me mine
No, your love will never be mine
