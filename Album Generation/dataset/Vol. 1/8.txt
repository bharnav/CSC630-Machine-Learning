All of my life I've tried to be like the man in the pictures with outstretched hands
Wearing purple around his neck and he's saying words that I can't forget

Won't you tell me just who made you judge and ruler over me?
Little girl, can you tell just who made you
So very god damned holy?

Cause I tried to be the best I could
And I did the best my frail mind could
I'd trade it all just for one touch
I'd give it all to be enough
To make things new

'Cause one n a million is all the same
I've taken aspirin for my pain
Empty bottles just seem to say
I cannot make this go away

Hey you, tell me just who made this judge and ruler over me
I can tell what I want just to make it
So very goddamn holy

Cause I tried to be the best I could
And I did the best my frail mind could
I'd trade it all just for one touch
I'd give it all to be enough
To make things new
To make things new inside so I could be like...

I'd trade it all just for one touch
I'd give it all to be it

And I did the best a boy could do
And I did the best my frail mind could
I'd trade it all just for one touch
I'd give it all to be enough
To make things new inside
To make things new
So I could be like you
I tried so hard to make things
New
