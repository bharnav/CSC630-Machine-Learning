You're watching the cars, movies and stars
They are your lifetime...
Yet all that I am is half what we are
Maybe some other time
I'll get it right
I'll get it right

Oh sweet voice on the phone
You sound so alone
'Cause you couldn't be wasted
Yet all that I ever was
To you I am
I'm less than a man

That slowly changes out of phase
And I don't know why it is
Its an ever changing simple thing that I miss...

While watching TV take in what you say
So you're death is painless
When all that I ever was returns again
I'm all that I am

And I'll get it right
When I get it right
'Cause I'll get it right
When I get it right

But I'm slowly changing out of phase
And I don't know why it is
It's an ever-changing simple thing that I know
But don't know why it is
That I'm longing for a sweet embrace, which I miss
