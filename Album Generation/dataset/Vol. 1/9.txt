Cold on the inside
In phases my lights die
Staring through ardent eyes
I love you, but I lied

Cold on the inside
In faces a smile dies
Staring through ardent eyes
I loathe you, but I lied

But it should be okay, they said
Just forget the pain, they said
Well, I could always lie
And yet the doctor said that I would be just fine
Yeah the whitecoat said that I
Would live until I'm
Cold on the inside of me
I'm cold on the inside of me

Cold on the inside
In me the little child
Holds thoughts that I hide
Dead though I seem a lie

Cold on the inside
In me the lights die
Staring through ardent eyes
As tears drop like moist flies

Yeah, they call me well
But I might live
Too long to die on the inside of me
Cause I'm cold on the inside of me
