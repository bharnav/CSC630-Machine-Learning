I'm down there puking over a toilet
You take my lessons and learn them before, now
You really taught me well
Oh well

A perfect cancer was spreading and twisting
You start explaining and I'll start pretending
That all of my actions are for you
And all of my heartache is from you

Even though you had been used before I saved myself for you
But the contents of my stomach fell when I was told the truth
After one last desperation I beg you for some time
Damn it all I loved you but you're unkind

To me you're unkind
To me… (and now we come clean)

You gave your body to all who were willing
And took this pleasure that I wasn't filling
And everything sacred to me
Just adds to the heaving, when I breathe

When all that I needed was a life
And all that I found in you was a lie
And all that I asked for was some time
Damn it all I loved you but you're unkind

To me you're unkind
To me…. (and now we come clean.)

Even thought you had been used before I saved myself for you
(I'll burn my eyes out watching you go now)
But the contents of my stomach fell when I was told the truth
(I'll burn my eyes out watching you go now)
After one last desperation I beg you for some time
(I'll burn my eyes out watching you go now)
Damn it all I loved you but you're unkind
(I'll burn my eyes out watching you go now)

When all that I needed was a life
(You're unkind!)
And all that I found in you was a lie
(You're unkind!)
And all that I ask for was some time
(You're unkind!)
Damn it all I love you but you're unkind
(You're unkind!)

When all that I needed was a life
(All that I needed, was all that I needed, and all that I needed….)
And all that I found in you was a lie
(….was all that I needed)
And all that I asked for was some time
(All that I needed, was all that I needed, and all that I needed….)
Damn it all I love you but you're unkind
(….was all that I needed)
