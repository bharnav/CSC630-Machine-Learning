There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no safe place for me, too tired
There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no safe place for me...

There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no safe place for me, too tired
There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no safe place for me...

It always hurts when it's someone you love
Won't you rise above
Won't you rise above
There's a price in blood

There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no place left left for me, I'm tired
There is no safe place for me to hide
Theres no place left left for me, I'm tired

So tell me a story about your life
I don't mind, I don't mind
Won't you tell me, that will be just fine
I don't mind, I don't mind
Singing songs about the Auld Lang Syne
I don't mind, I don't mind
It's takin me back to another time

(Forever)
Won't you lend me your sins against you
For every thing I understand
One thousand more won't comprehend
(Forever)
It always hurts when its someone you love
Won't you rise, rise above
(Forever)
It always hurts when it's someone you love
Won't you rise, rise above
There's a price in blood

It always hurts when it's someone you love
Won't you rise above
Won't you rise above
There's a price in blood

I see the card that your mom keeps sending
I breathe, it feels just like my life is ending
Think of the one that I' most respecting
And all the words that I'm now regretting
I'd hold them now, but I'm bruised and beaten
And I'm alone and I've barely eaten
And it seems just like the way it goes that down the road I may have known about the love in both of us, we push and shove, betray the trust, don't let this make a fool of us, I'm tired hungry broke and just wish I could come back home

Forever
Calling you out I called your bluff
But that just wasn't good enough
You split my face and spilled my blood
Then tears ran down the face I loved
Forever
It always hurts when its someone you love
Won't you rise, rise above
Forever
It always hurts when its someone you love
Won't you rise, rise above

It always hurts when its someone you love
It always hurts when its someone you love
It always hurts when its someone you love
