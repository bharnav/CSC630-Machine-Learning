I asked it where it had been
Then we started arguing
I'm just like the other ones
But I don't believe you think I'm dumb
And where did all the money go?
Did jesus come and no one know?

Sugar, spice and insulin
Hold me 'til you're back again
Cause it feels like I'm losing you
When it feels like I'm losing you

We can try to laugh it off, I guess
Claiming blissful listlessness
But I miss, how it used to be
She only looks like you
When it's using me

Her silver spoon oblivion
Paints her blue and back again
While I hear...
I love you
I need you
I'm still here

Then I fear that I'm losing you
When it feels like I'm losing you
When it feels like I'm losing you
Then it feels like I'm losing you So do you do what you do for the love of it ?
Or do you do what you do with the thought of this?
Tell me my love, am I enough...

So I was still trying and fighting
And pushing in vein
And all that I did just to stop it
Would add to it's strength
Because a juggernaut will not stop even with you in the way

When it's given the choice of its life or to lose
I'm not so sure just which one you will choose

But I'm losing you
It feels like I'm losing you
When it feels like I'm losing you
Then I fear that I'm losing you

So do you do what you do for the love of it
Or do you do what you do with the thought of this
Tell me my loves
Was I enough?
