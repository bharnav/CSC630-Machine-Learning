[Verse 1: J. Loren Wince]
I'll take one, cause I needed to feel it so much
I had an emotional crutch, but
I'm feeling bored so I'll take some more
Cause nothing is happening
And once you told me that you loved me so much
I foolishly began to trust, but
Now I'm ignored and I'm taking more, till
Something is happening

[Verse 2]
I'll take one cause I needed to feel it so much
I needed that thing we call fun, but
Now I'm ignored and I'll take some more, till
Something is happening
Cause once I thought you were right here with me, so
Maybe I'll take two or three
Until I believe what I have seen is really happening

[Chorus 1]
Morpheus!
How could you leave me when I had need of your love?
Stop holding back!
Give me one reason to think you're decent
When I am alone
Don't you ever try to bring me back

[Verse 3]
With this one I needed to feel you so much
I wantingly longed for your touch, but
Now I'm ignored and I'm feeling bored
'till something is happening
Cause once I thought you were right here with me, so
Maybe I'll take two or three
Until I believe what I have seen is really happening

[Verse 4]
With this one I needed to feel you so much
I needed that thing we call fun
Now I'm ignored and I'm taking more, till
Something is happening
Cause once I thought you were right here with me, so
Maybe I'll take two or three
Until I believe what I have seen is really happening

[Chorus 2 ]
No no more!
God Morpheus why did you leave me when I had need of your love?
No holding back now!
Give me the real thing!
I've got a reason
When I am alone
Don't you ever try to take me back
