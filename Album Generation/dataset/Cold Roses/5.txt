I ain't afraid of hurt
I've had so much it feels
Just like normal to me now

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone for good

Everything you ever touched
Is undisturbed and hangs out
Like crime scene evidence undisturbed in dust
I don't dare touch anything
Because it's evidence of us
And it means everything
Well sort of

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone for good

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now
In your old room but there's nobody there

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone for good
