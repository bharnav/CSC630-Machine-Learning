You plant a rose and if the rose comes up
You're thankful to God and when it doesn't you cuss him
You raise a child and when the child grows up
You gotta learn to let go if you can't learn to love him
But, oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing

Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
Oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Blue sky cracking and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do

Now I'm not saying only bad news comes
For the people who want it, too
But you gotta play that music for who's listening
You gotta have someone you wanna sing it to
Oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing

Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Blue sky cracking and it makes me believe
Oh, oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do

Close my eyes, see the glorious sunset
Through the windows of a store and I want it
Anyway, if I ever felt haunted
You were there for me

These angry people who are waiting to judge you
Have their own judgement that they'll have to live up to
Open your mouth
And if nothing will come through
Remember
You're the one who sings
And it's a gift
And life's a beautiful thing
Oh, don't waste it, doll

You build a house and if the house comes up
You gotta work on that house wanna make it your home
'Cause everything inside that's not something you own
Is what you're taking with you on the day that you go
And oh, what a beautiful world when you sing

Hear all them bells ringing out in the street
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
Oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the streets
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe
'Cause if I don't believe in love
Then I don't believe in you
And I do

I believe in you
I do
