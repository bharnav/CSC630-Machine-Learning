For all the hours here that move too slow
There's all this letting go, that don't pass
If all this love is real, how will we know?
If we're only scared of losing it, how will it last?

If I am a stranger now to you
I will always be, I will always be
Stronger now than me, stronger than you
Our love will always be
And if we let it go, I will try to be there for you
If I can, what if I can't?

Today is yesterday when you don't know
How to rebuild the walls that someone has knocked down
To tell the truth it's hard enough without a lover
Who you want to hide your darkness from
So they won't let you down

If I am a stranger now to you
I will always be, I will always be
Stronger now than me, stronger than you
Our love will always be
And if we let it go, I will try to be there for you
I will try and be there for you
If I can, what if I can't?

For all the hours here that move too slow
There's all this letting go, that won't pass
If all this love is real, how will we know?
And if we're only scared of losing it, how will it last?

If I am a stranger now to you
I will always be, I will always be
Stronger now than me, stronger than you
Our love will always be
If we let it go, I will try to be there for you
I will try to be there for you
I will try to be there for you
If I can, what if I can't?
