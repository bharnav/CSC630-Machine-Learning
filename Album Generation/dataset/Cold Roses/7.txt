Mockingbirds sing
Sing me what the Lord was singing
On the day He made the water
The color of the blues

Sing me that song
Sing me til the heaven's rising
On the day He made the water
The color of my baby's eyes

Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
It must not be enough
Cause in the way she cries
It only tears me up
I feel dead inside and dying
And if you give up
Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love

The rivers they run
They run until they get too tired
Until they run behind the houses
And they become a creek

When I was a child
I ran until the creek became a river
When it turned into the ocean
I wondered why He'd made it so deep

Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
Must not be enough
Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up
I feel dead inside and dying
Don't give up
Cause in a way that she's crying
It only tears me up
I feel dead inside and dying
Give up
Don't give up on love...

Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Sometimes it ain't enough
Sometimes it ain't enough
But don't give up on love
Don't give up on love...
