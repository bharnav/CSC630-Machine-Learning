Lord, I miss that girl
On the day we met the sun was shining down
Down on the valley
Riddled with horses running
Crushing them with flowers
I would have picked for her
On the day she was born
She runs through my veins like a long black river
And rattles my cage like a thunderstorm
Oh my soul

What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean to be so sad
When someone you love
Someone you love is supposed to make you happy
What do you do
How do you keep love alive
When it won't

What, what are the words
They use when they know it's over
"We need to talk"
Or "I'm confused, maybe later you can come over"
I would've held your mother's hand
On the day you was born
She runs through my veins like a long black river
And rattles my cage like a thunderstorm
Oh my soul

What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean to be so sad
When someone you love
Someone you love is supposed to make you happy
What do you do
How do you keep love alive
When it won't

How do you keep love alive
When it won't
