There's something about you
That reminds me of all those times
When I wasn't sorry, when I wasn't blue
The cherry moon it shone down on us
Under the stars shining down every one for you
If I could count them all
I would circle the moon
And count 'em back to nothing
Til I got to you

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?

I used to be the house that you lived in
Down on Meadowlake Street
When you moved they cut down the maple tree
I carved your name into
The tree became a boat, I christened it your name
And when the water turned to salt
From your tears it hit the bottom of the ocean
Where I go when I hear your name
And I sink like a stone

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?
Why do I dream of you?

I feel like a dream that's not worth having
Like a nervous joke ain't nobody laughing
Like somebody with nothing 'cause they don't know
What they're wanting
Tiny like the sand in the cracks of the driftwood
Washed up on the shore of an ocean of you
Boats out on the horizon
Made out of the maple tree where we used to lie down
On Meadowlake Street counting the stars you and I

You and I [x3]

Something in you dies when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream that's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?
Why do I dream of you? [x3]

Why?
