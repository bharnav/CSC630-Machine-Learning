Something in the way she eases my mind
And lays me 'cross the bed til I close my eyes
Stirs me in the morning til I can never be satisfied

I leave Carolina every night in my dreams
Like the girls that try to love me that I only leave
Rock me like a baby-doll
And hold me to the chest
But I'm always moving too fast

If I could find my way back home
Where would I go?
And everything about me I used to be
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
Lost out in the woods where you're looking for me

When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
No one leaves the lights on
In a house where nobody lives anymore

Loaded like the boxes up in my bedroom
And coming off the hinges like a door
The shadows dancing up in the window
They're not who we are, they're who we were

And I'm not gonna break but if I do
I'm gonna shatter like a glass
That tears your heart in two
Broken like the windows
In the house where I used to live

And if I could find my way back home
Where would I go?
And everything about me I used to be
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
Lost out in the woods, looking for you

When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
No one leaves the lights on
In a house where nobody lives anymore

Everything about me you liked is already gone
Everything about me we loved is gone

When will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
When, when will you come back home?
