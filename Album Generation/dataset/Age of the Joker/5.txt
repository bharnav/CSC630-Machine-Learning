Loads of times on the losing end
It's the same old situation
Just another constellation
Daggers drawn with a steady hand
You push the aggravation
To your final destination

Cut me out in copper
Use me as a doppel
Down on your feet now
How does it feel now?
As you get yourself some
Self-esteem and now some heat in your room

In your eyes
In your mind
I'm two out of seven
In your eyes
In your life
Just two out of seven

As you watch my world from the outside
You think that you are strong
And you dream that you belong
You're supreme cause you know how to spell right
You drown in salivation, you set off from frustration

Living on a copper
Use me as a doppel
I know that lately
Afraid since been stately
As you gag yourself some
Self-esteem and now some heat in your room

In your eyes
In your mind
I'm two out of seven
In your eyes
In your life
Maybe two out of seven

In your eyes
In your mind
I'm three out of ten
Out of nine
I'm just fine
I'm only whatever

In your eyes
In your mind
I'm two out of seven
In your eyes
In your life
I'm two out of seven

What the fuck
Suck my cock
I'm only a seven
Out of twelve
When I wank at the bank
I'm ten out of ten my friend
