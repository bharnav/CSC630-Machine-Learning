[Verse 1]
Oh oh oh
Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no
We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Aha, oh, oh
I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it ok
Makes it go away
Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on North Americans

[Hook]
We are North American scum
We're from North America

[Verse 2]
And all the kids, all the kids that want to make the scene
Here in North America
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love, where's the love, where's the love where's the love, where's the love tonight?
But there's no love, man, there's no love and the kids are uptight
So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go North Americans
Oh you were planning it? I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said the more I do it, the better it gets
Let's rock North America

[Hook]
We are North American scum
We're from North America
We are North American scum
We are North American

[Verse 3]
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government uh huh huh
Some fat American christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we're keepin' them off the street
Now we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright, uh huh uh huh
You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
Cause we're North Americans

[Hook]
We are North American scum
We are North Americans
We are North American scum
We're from North America

[Outro]
Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
Where we can be in any one of a million new bands
North America
Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
But don't blame the Canadians
Look out North America
