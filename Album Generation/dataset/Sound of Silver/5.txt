[Hook]
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today

[Verse/Hook]
And so all the good people wanna rescue
All the smart people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
All the little people wanna dance, it's true

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And so all the good people wanna rescue
From all the smart people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
All the little people wanna dance, it's true

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you please

[Instrumental break]

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you please
If you please, please anyone
Talk to me, talk to me
All you boys, lonely and drunk
On your knees

Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over and over again

[Verse/Hook]

So it's us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again [x2]

[Verse/Hook]

Its just us and them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again
