[Verse 1]
Caught up and I can't feel my hands
No need to chase
Can you relate?
Can you keep up the pace like you're dyin' for this?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you say, "I'm not okay
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get me"

[Chorus]
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

[Verse 2]
And I can't see your face
Cigarette the wrong way
Inhale to the top of my lungs
I've been dyin' for this

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you say, "I'm not okay
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get me"

[Chorus]
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

[Bridge]
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go

[Chorus]
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

[Outro]
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go
I'm only gettin' started
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go
I'm only gettin' started
