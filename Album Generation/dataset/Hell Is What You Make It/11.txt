All this wasted space
This whole room it takes
Hard to stay awake
This is my escape

If we feel it back up
Amphetamine rush
Set me on fire tonight, tonight

It's getting critical, getting critical
I gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Your my chemical, your my chemical
Killer, killer, killer, killer

Stabs me in the back
Takes me all I have
Wrestle to the floor
See you soon for more

If we feel it back up
Amphetamine rush
Set me on fire tonight, tonight

It's getting critical, getting critical
I gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Your my chemical, your my chemical
Killer, killer, killer, killer
