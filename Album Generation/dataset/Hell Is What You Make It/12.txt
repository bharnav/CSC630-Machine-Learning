((Verse One))
Every shooting star reminds me when Hollywood lost the brightest
That shine, that spark
The sun set too soon that night ((x2))

((Hook One))
Here's to
Here's to you
And we'll raise our drinks one last time
I never thought I'd have to say this
(I never thought I'd have to say goodbye)
One life lost, a thousand memories fade in
(Your memory will never fade in mine)

((Hook Two))
You opened the door to show me there was hope
So I'll take it and run to show the world, so they will know
Your fire won't burn, burn out
And I hope heaven needs you more than I do now

((Verse Two))
Every shooting star reminds me when Hollywood lost the brightest
That shine, that spark
The sun set too soon that night ((x3))
