I'm waking up outside
Everybody passed out on the floor
Last thing I remember
Was the girl next door
Somebody call my phone so I can figure
Out the shit I've done
Still drunk, so what, why stop when the
Morning comes?

Last night we were dancing on the table
Swinging from the chandaller singing
Eh-Yo!
Last night they had to shut the whole
Place down so we took it to the boulevard
Try to remember last night
Wish I could remember
The time of my life alright
I can't wait for tonight to be
Like last night

Last night was the prequel
But tonight is the sequel
Getting high off the lights
This is life, this is what I do
I'm feeling deja vu
Strangers telling me that "I love you!"
Fuck it I don't know why
But "I love you too!"

Last night we were dancing on the table
Swinging from the chandaller singing
Eh-Yo!
Last night they had to shut the whole
Place down so we took it to the boulevard
Try to remember last night
Wish I could remember
The time of my life alright
I can't wait for tonight to be
Like last night

Say what you want
But fuck what they say
Cause we're having fun
Everwhere we go you already know I
Don't give a f***
And I won't talk about anything
Run your mouth if you want but we don't
Care what you say

Last night we were dancing on the table
Swinging from the chandaller singing
Eh-Yo!
Last night they had to shut the whole
Place down so we took it to the boulevard
Try to remember last night
Wish I could remember
The time of my life alright
I can't wait for tonight to be
Like last night
