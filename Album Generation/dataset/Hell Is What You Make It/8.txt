SHUT THE FUCK UP

See the girl with the pretty girl eyes
Sitting pretty in the blue skies
All alone and I don't know why
Looking good like she don't try
Sweet talk in the paralyze
Wouldn't know she's a dirty dime

[Bridge:]
Stories changing colors fading
You are nothing more than I thought

[Chorus:]
I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger. crawl into my bed
I should have killed you when I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance to get off easy

Only pretty on the outside
Fully nails on the inside
I guess lust is blind
Red nails and a butchers knife
I don't care cause she's looking fine
She's looking good way to die

[Chorus]
I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger. crawl into my bed
I should have killed you when I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance to get off easy

Next time I won't be so weak
I made it out alive [x4]

[Bridge]
Stories changing colors fading
You are nothing more than I thought

[Chorus]
I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger. crawl into my bed
I should have killed you when I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance to get off easy
