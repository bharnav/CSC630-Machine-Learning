It's time!

Did I give in too much?
Was it never enough?
The walls are rising up
Is it too late to learn?

Starting to turn on me
As if I stole its memory
Left alone, gone and forgotten
So close to breaking me in

And I wish you well
I'm the storm giving you hell
So take cover, cause I'm not the only one

It's time...
I'm not the only one
You're killing everyone
I'm not the only one

You're never close enough
You're too far behind
Stripped to the bone
No heart to find

I'm falling, nothing to break my fall...
Once I hit I won't feel anything at all

And I wish you well
I'm the storm giving you hell
So take cover cause I'm not the only one
I wish you well, you won't drag me to hell, no never
You'll be the only one

Come back to me
Your heart's not breathing
Please don't drag me down with you
Never!

And I wish you well
I'm the storm giving you hell
So take cover cause I'm not the only one
I wish you well, you won't drag me to hell, no never
You'll be the only one
