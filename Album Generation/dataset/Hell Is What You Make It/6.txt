My eyes open
To the sound of a song I've heard
Don't know the name, But I know all the words
Sun came up, crawled into the front seat
Memories leaving me, was it all a dream I had?
Time for us to wake up...

I'll save my words to make the most of it
I never meant to be gone so long

Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long

Street lights passing
Everyone gets me a heartbeat closer
To where it started beating
Keep me feeling safe and sound
When everything that's right is upside down
Was it all a dream I had?
Time for us to wake up...

I'll save my words to make the most of it
I never meant to be gone so long

Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
As I have you, I'll be home
I never meant to be gone so long

The world still moves on
I'm sorry I made you wait
I wish that I, I could stay
The world still moves on
(I live for this, but I'd die for you)
I'm sorry I made you wait
I wish that I, I could stay
The world still moves on
(I live for this, but I'd die for you)
I'm sorry I made you wait
I wish that I, I could stay
The world still moves on

Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
As I have you, I'll be home
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
