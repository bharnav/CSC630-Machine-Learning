Bass in my chest and I can barely breathe
I'm out of time I just might catch fire
I feel the heat creepin' up to me
It's in my bones
I just might sweat it out

I'm not alone
Until we drop the lights
I'm not alone, you're not alone
Until we drop the lights
We're not alone
I just might sweat it out

It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me
It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me

Turn em back off!!

I'm up right now, and I'm not shutting down
I crossed the line, follow or fall behind
This shit is mine everywhere everytime
Why don't we sweat it out?

I'm not alone
Until we drop the lights
I'm not alone, you're not alone
Until we drop the lights
We're not alone
I just might sweat it out

It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me
It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me

Turn em back off!

I'm not alone
Until we drop the lights
I'm not alone, you're not alone
Until we drop the lights
We're not alone
I just might sweat it out, out, out

It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me
It won't be pretty when the lights come back, back, back
Turn em on, turn em on for me
