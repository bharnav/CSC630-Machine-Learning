This feels oh so right to me
Taking back all the things I said
Never meant to "stay with me"
It's all coming back to me
Get back to the world I left
Gettin rid of everything I don't need
So now the pressure's off
Played this game before
So I know all your bullshit tactics

And I swear she would run
But she won't follow me
And I'll tear up this love like it don't mean a thing
For too long it was you, way before it was me
I'm not giving up, I gave up enough
It's back to me

Lies spread like your legs did
Take it back, it'll stop this track right here
Can't keep my name out your mouth
I know it's getting hard
But isn't that the way you liked it?
The pressure's off
Played this game before
So I know all your bullshit tactics

Take it back when we were golden
Told you we would shine forever
Now it's just whatever
Take it back when we were golden
Now it's just melted and sold
