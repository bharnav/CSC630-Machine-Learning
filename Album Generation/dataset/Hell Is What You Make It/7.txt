What's another burned bridge?
Does it matter?
You weren't there, why do you care?
End the chapter
Loose talk is the enemy of laughter
Light up my cigarette and wait for disaster

I wish there was a way to give it all away
From the hole where my heart used to be
Just believe me

Don't go play by the water
They say you won't come back
Don't go you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back
Don't go you won't come back
Tried to warn you
You didn't listen

Back to the lake where I disposed of my body
Parts of me she is resurfacing
And I just don't understand
Why's she gotta talk so much
And I'm so tired of telling lies
I wanna go back
Rewind

I wish there was a way to give it all away
From the hole where my heart used to be
Just believe me

Don't go play by the water
They say you won't come back
Don't go you won't come back
Don't go looking for answers
They say you won't come back
Don't go you won't come back
Tried to warn you
You didn't listen

There's no use in bringing up the past
No need to see where I've been
We can find a silver lining
See the best in all the worst things
