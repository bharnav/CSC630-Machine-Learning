"Nice shoes"
Wanna get to know you
How can i get you alone?
Lights flash Move fast
Tell me how can i get into your heart?

She got a bitter bite but i'm a sweet talker
Diamonds in her eyes
And i'm shine for her

Waiting for you love
Waiting to feel you love
Waiting for you

We dont have to fall in love
We don't have to feel to touch
We can do it for the rush
I'm waiting for you

Bodies crash with no reaction
She bites my toungue so i don't say too much
She was made for lust
Anymore than that would be dangerous

She got a bitter bite but i'm a sweet talker
Diamonds in her eyes
And i'm shine for her

You're a fool if you dance
You're a fool if you don't
You're a fool either way
So don't tell me you won't
So pick it up!
