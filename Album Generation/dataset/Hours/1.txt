When there's a rub
We can talk for a while
But I have sweet nothings to say
You don't want me anyway
You don't want me anyway
So why?
Why should I stay?

So goodbye to you and your life
Your new best friends
Your confidence
And I'll be here when you get home

Sitting half way
Away from no where
Praying for our lips to touch
Holding myself
For a second
Just to catch a smile
On this line

So goodbye to you and your life
(Two months, eight weeks)
Your new best friends
Your confidence
(Turn my hours into days)
And I'll be here when you get home
(When you get home)

So goodbye to you and your life
(Two months, eight weeks)
Your new best friends
Your confidence
(Turn my hours into days)
And I'll be here when you get home
(When you get home)

(I can't feel the same about you anymore)

So just like you said it would be
(It's never easy)
I can't feel this way about you anymore
So just like you said it would be
(It's never easy)
I can't feel the same
I can't feel this way
I can't feel the same about you anymore
(It's never easy)
About you anymore
(It's never easy)
No... I can't feel this way
I can't feel the same about you anymore
(It's never easy)
About you anymore
(It's never easy)
About you anymore
