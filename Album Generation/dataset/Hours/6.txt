Dear friends of this academy
Oooh romeo is bleeding to death
To see a friend bleed to death, what for
Some kind of metaphor that I can't see?
So I'll drink until I see it

This sky will make me sick
So I'll give up on you
I'll give up on this
This sky will make me sick
So I'll give up on this
I'll give up on you

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine

So you want to hold me up and bring me down
Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down
I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you
And I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine..

It's all mine..
It's all mine..
It's all mine..

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine..

Archers in your arches
Raise your fingers for one last salute
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine..
