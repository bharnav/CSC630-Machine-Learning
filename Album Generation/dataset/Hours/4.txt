I wish it was sweeter
The taste of your mouth
Because right now it hurts too much to be
Closer than this
And with one hard look
I can tell
That you've had enough of these useless sunsets..

This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings
This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings..

So tell your father that
That you're mine and I'll swear
We'll run away and I'll make a plan and save
Everyone from themselves
And put them in the ground
And put them in the ground

This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings
This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings..

Sitting in the car with the radio
Turned to static
Feeling quite tragic
And with one strategic blow
And you find yourself back in the hole
That you used to sit so comfortably in

Sitting in the car with the radio
Turned to static
Feeling quite tragic
And with one strategic blow
And you find yourself back in the hole
That you used to sit so comfortably in

This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings
This could be a movie
This could be our final act
But we don't need these happy endings

Sitting in the car with the radio
Turned to static
Feeling quite tragic
And with one strategic blow
And you find yourself back in the hole
That you used to sit so comfortably in

Sitting in the car with the radio
Turned to static
Feeling quite tragic
And with one strategic blow
And you find yourself back in the hole
That you used to sit so comfortably, comfortably in..
