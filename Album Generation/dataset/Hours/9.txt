The stars will be your nightlights tonight
And I will be your lullaby

They dragged it up
And continued with the beatings
And how you bleed
You could bleed forever

It burns and leaves the rope tied tonight
It burns and leaves the rope tied
The stars will be your nightlights tonight
And I will be your lullaby

Another finger lost
What use do you have for those eyes in your head
You took and killed
Everything about me

It burns and leaves the rope tied tonight
It burns and leaves the rope tied
The stars will be your nightlights tonight
And I will be your lullaby
The stars will be your nightlights tonight
And I will be your lullaby

So disgusted with it
You took your sweet time
So let's get out of this town
So let's get out of this town

So disgusted with it
And you took your sweet time
So lets get out of this town
So lets get out of this town
And start this day all over and over again

Just like the good old days
You wipe the stains from off of your face
And forget her, just forget her
Just like the good old days
You wipe the stains from off of your face
And forget her, just forget her

The best liar I heard all day
You're too much of a good thing
You're too much of a good thing
