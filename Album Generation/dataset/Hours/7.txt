Scared to open up these eyes
To see just what's inside
This tree is dead and cold
This house is not a home
Help me now I'm dying here alone
This is not a new game
So don't think that you know
Casually I confide
Awake and paralysed
Forever in one word
Forever is the longest time
It's the only cure I'm not sure I'll survive

This is not a new game
So don't think that you know
Can you see these blood shot eyes
Can you see
That my strength is failing
And I can't go on this way
And this hearts not beating
It just doesn't seem the same
And my strength is failing
And I can't go on this way (can't go on this way)

Promise me
Promise me
Promise me you will not ever leave
Promise me (you will not ever leave)
Promise me (you will not ever leave)
Promise me (you will not ever leave)

That my strength is failing
And I can't go on this way
And this hearts not beating
It just doesn't seem the same
It just doesnt't seem the same
It just doesnt't seem the same
