You are bleak
You are beautiful
No matter what they say
In this light
Tired childish games
Swept us all away

Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us
Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us

This is strange
This is wonderful
It's grip chokes us all
It takes time
More than we have
So what have we done?

Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us
Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us

It takes time
Please tell me what we've done
It takes time
Please tell me what have we done

Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us
Sing it out
Sing it out for all of us
