Killing you
May be the only chance I have
Of recovery
And I no it's so severe
As you knew it would be
The punishment, it fits the crime

So let's take this knife (Take this knife)
And run it down your chest
Does this feel like love? (Feel like love)
Here we are waiting
So let's take this knife
And run it down your chest
Does this feel like love?
Here we are waiting

The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week
The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week

Killing me
Might be the only chance you have of recovery
And I know it's so severe as you knew it would be
The punishment, well it fits your crime

So let's take this knife
And run it down your chest
Does it feel like love?
Here we are waiting
So let's take this knife
And run it down your chest
Does it feel like love?
Here we are waiting

The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week
The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week

You and I, we'll die alone tonight
You and I, we'll lie alone tonight
You and I, we'll die alone tonight
You and I, we'll lie alone

The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week
The light feels good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week
