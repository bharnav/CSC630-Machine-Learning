Who am I to say you're wrong
For feeling what you feel
There's something in the way you talk
Like you've forgotten what is real
You don't have to prove you're strong
To face it on your own
Cause it'll steal your breath
It'll wear you out
It'll throw you to the ground

There is a lighter day
Hold on, hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoa-oh
When life cuts you like a blade
It's gone so wrong
You can't remember who you're supposed to be
Hold on, hold on
To me

You can tell me anything
Your deepest darkest fears
I ain't gonna judge you baby
That's not why I'm here
You can lay your burden down
You can lay it down on me
And I'll take it all
I'll lift you up
I'll pass you to the sun

There is a lighter day
Hold on, hold on

It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoa-oh
When life cuts you like a blade
It's gone so wrong
You can't remember who you're supposed to be
Hold on, hold on
To me

To everything you're certain of
All the love that's right in front of you
Trouble always has a door
That you can break through

There is a lighter day
Hold on, hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoa-oh
When life cuts you like a blade
It's gone so wrong
You can't remember who you're supposed to be
Hold on, hold on
To me

There is a lighter day
Hold on, hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoa-oh
There is a lighter day
There is someone that you can turn to
Hold on, hold on
To me
