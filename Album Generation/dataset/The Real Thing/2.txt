Lately, I've been so far gone
Pretending I don't know where I went wrong
I've been lying to myself in the arms of someone else
Without you I just can't fake it ..tonight
Here I am, so please don't tell me it's the ending

You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever
I want to scream out loud
That you're the only one that makes me better

Baby, I could barely talk to you
You got me, don't know how I made it through
Still you came with me that night, you will remember that alright
I can't believe that we could lose this tonight

I'm begging you now please don't tell me it's the ending
You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever
I want to scream out loud
That you're the only one that makes me better

Yeaa...this time I'm gonna make you right..
Oh, just take me home with you tonight

Please don't tell me it's the ending 
You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever
I want to scream out loud
Cause you're the only one that makes me better
