We've been through this over for a thousand times
Come on, come on, come on
Tell me what's on your mind
It doesn't matter baby what I say
You never seemed to hear me anyway

What's going to show
It's never enough
It always comes down to something
How could I live
Why would I try
I could learn to live without you
While that's a lie
No giving in, no saying goodbye
All comes down to one thing that all of this means nothing without you
All of this means nothing without you

I've thought a thought you reach out
Thought I thought you tried
Waiting here for something, nothing's all I find
Nearly natural alter standing on the shore
Writing now to listen, I'm outside the door

What's going to show
It's never enough
It always comes down to something
How could I live
Why would I try
I could learn to live without you
While that's a lie
No giving in, no saying goodbye
All comes down to one thing that all of this means nothing without you
I won't give up, I give in, no, cause you know I won't let you down
How could I live
Why would I try
I could learn to live without you
While I would die
No giving in, no saying goodbye
All comes down to one thing that all of this means nothing without you
Why would I try
I could learn to live without you
While I would die
No giving in, no saying goodbye
All comes down to one thing that all of this means nothing without you
That all of this means nothing without you
