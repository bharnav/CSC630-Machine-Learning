As long as you're who I'm with
Praise you with my dying breath
Pull my heart out of my chest
God, I'd do anything

I'll open every car door
I won't go out any more
I'll even eat off the floor
God, I'd do anything at all

I'll be there to catch you right when you fall
I'll be there as long as you tell me when
I'll be there until eternity ends
You know why, 'cause you're worth everything

And side by side forever, we'll be together
It keeps getting better, through the desert, now
I'll laugh in the face of danger, I'll be your lone ranger
And you'll be my angel, as we wave goodbye
And ride into the sunset, some things we ain't done yet
And prove to the world our love will never die at all

I'd stick my hand in the flames
Subject myself to the pain
I'd even sleep in the rain
God, I'd do anything

I'd cross the desert for you
Let you beat me black and blue
Spray paint your name on the moon
God I'd do anything at all

I'll be there to catch you right when you fall
I'll be there as long as you tell me when
I'll be there until eternity ends
You know why, 'cause you're worth everything

And side by side forever, we'll be together
It keeps getting better, through the desert, now
I'll laugh in the face of danger, I'll be your lone ranger
And you'll be my angel, as we wave goodbye

And ride into the sunset
Some things we ain't done yet
And prove to the world our love will never die at all
Yeah, I'd do anything at all
You know why, 'cause you're worth everything

I'd do things you won't believe
Get you a ring if you need
Get down right here on one knee
God I'd do anything

You know why, you know why
'Cause you're worth everything

And side by side for ever
We'll be together
It keeps getting better, through the desert now
I'll laugh in the face of danger, I'll be your lone ranger
And you'll be my angel, as we wave goodbye
And ride into the sunset, some things we ain't done yet
And prove to the world our love won't ever die at all
I'll be your lone ranger, I hope you never die at all
And you'll be my angel

Cause I'll do anything at all
I'll do anything at all
Yeah, I'll do anything at all

You know why, 'cause you're worth everything
