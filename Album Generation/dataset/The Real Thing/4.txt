Did you know that you were leaving when you first told me your name
Convince me that you love me while planning your escape
Always looking past me on to someone else's face
Tell me
Is he all the things you tried to change me into

Tell me does he make you high?
Does he make you real?
Does he make you cry?
Does he know the way you feel?
Love is all around you
Your universe is full
But in my world
There is only you
Yeah, there is only you

Kept me at a distance while you told me you want more
Plans about our future made with one foot out the door
You say that it's over but there's some things I can't ignore
Tell me
Is he all the things you tried to change me into

Tell me does he make you high?
Does he make you real?
Does he make you cry?
Does he know the way you feel?
Love is all around you
Your universe is full
But in my world

I have my fears, you let them out
Now I wrap myself around you like a blanket full of doubt
The darkness burns, the sunlight stings
Cause he's holding everything

Does he make you high?
Does he make you real?
Does he make you cry?
Does he know the way you feel?
Love is all around you
Your universe is full
But in my world

You made me high
You made me real
You made me cry
Now you know the way I feel
Love is all around you
Your universe is full
But in my world
There is only you
