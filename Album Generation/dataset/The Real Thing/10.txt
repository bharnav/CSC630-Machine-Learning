I've been down and I'm nothing at all
And sometimes I feel I've grown
Never try to let it show
But I'm not alone
If you sing this song
I'll take you there
If you don't care

Going to the Valley of Angels
To swim in their deep blue sea
Surrounded by your faith and your glory
Is where I find my peace
True peace
In the Valley of Angels...
In the Valley of Angels

Heard so many stories, I thought they were lies (but you know they're true.)
I know that I have quit before I even tried (ahhh, but you could not worry.)
I stood up one day and found myself
But I'm not alone
If you sing this song
I'll take you there
If you don't care....
Come with me!

Going to the Valley of Angels
To swim in their deep blue sea
Surrounded by your faith and your glory
Is where I find my peace...
You know I find true peace
...in the Valley of Angels

[instrumental bridge]
All you ever dreamed to see..
You can't touch, you don't believe
Flyin' here on angels' wings....

Going to the Valley of Angels
To swim in their deep blue sea
Surrounded by your faith and your glory
Is where I find my peace...
You know i find true peace
You know i'll take you there
No, if you don't care....
Ohhhhh, in the Valley of Angels

(Going to the Valley of Angels)
To the Valley of Angels
(Going to the Valley of Angels)
