Close your eyes, get ready
One won't stop the flow
Console your child...get him ready
One more don't let go
Tonight...

It's you

Calm your eyes...get em ready
One won't stop the flow
(Soul coming around...in morning sun)
C'mon c'mon soul of mine...you're ready
One more don't let go
(Soul coming around...the mourn tonight)
Tonight, it's soda water
Soda water, soda water boys

Soda water so

Ahh, soul of mine
Ahh, sober
Ahh sold the mind
Ahh I'm so sober
I know the way
Ahh...stoned
Ahh, so it ends
Ahh oh stone sober

Ah, gimme that wine!
Gimme that acid!
And I wanna lose everything that's policing us, and then everything must begin!
And I wanna do heroin!
And I wanna do crack cocaine!
And I wanna lose everything but release... Why don't you just:

SMOKE THAT FUCKING WEED, BOY! DRINK THE WINE!

Weed boy, drink the wine...
Weed boy, drink the wine...
Bring the pain!
(All of it's all we are... that's all we are)
Bring the pain!!!
Weed boy, drink the wine...
Weed boy, drink the wine
Bring the pain!!!
Weed boy, drink the wine...
Weed boy, drink the wine...

Face yourself!
Send me to hell!
