WANDERING SOUL OF MINE!
WANDERING IN TIME!
WANDERING SOUL OF MINE!

Ahh, we are so far gone!
I knew you once, what will you become?

I PROBABLY WOULD!
I PROBABLY WOULD!

Soon you will know where all the sinners go..
I sew you up and throw you away!

All is calm, all is well!
A LIFE WORTH WAITING FOR!
ALL is rooted, in INFINITE CHAOS!
CHOOSE YOUR PERSPECTIVE!!!

Pandemic (I farted!)
Pandemic (I farted!)

WE ARE ALL! ...HERE COMES THE TRUTH!
EGO EGO EGO!

I probably would....

JUST GET IT OUT!

YES!

WANDERING SOUL OF MINE!
WANDERING IN TIME!
WANDERING SOUL OF MINE!
