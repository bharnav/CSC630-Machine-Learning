Let's finish this!!!

NOW, we FALL APART at the SEAMS, then see that NOTHING'S CHANGED!
THIS LIFE LIES!
Oh my god knows!
That everybody wants to be the NEXT ONE TO BOW!
You'd let your MOTHER FALL ON DOWN!
Do my eyes deceive me?? DO MY EARS BELIEVE ME???

ONE GOD GREATER THAN ALL RELIGION!

GIVE IT TO!!!

I HAVE NO TIME!!

So I say:
DIE!! POLTERGEIST!
DIE!
POLTERGEIST!
DIE!
POLTERGEIST!
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
DIE!
POLTERGEIST!
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN YOUR WAR!
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)

Now we come to the end!

DIE!
POLTERGEIST!
DIE!
POLTERGEIST!
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)
GIVE UNTO ME! (Wait!)

I AM RIGHT HERE, AND I AM NOT FRIGHTENED...ARE WE CLEAR?? ARE WE???
YOU NEVER COME ROUND, YOU WILL NOT BE WELCOME, YOU WILL NOT!!!
YOU HAVE BEEN VANQUISHED, LET GO!!!
I'VE CONQUERED MY SOUL!
VANQUISHED...NOW GO!!!!
EXORCISE YOURSELF!

AND STAND FOR WHAT YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN!

Now!
We all know the peace of mind that comes from the fight!
(FIGHT!)
NOW!
WE STAND TALL FOREVER AND SEEK THE ONE TRUE LIGHT!

SAY IT TO THE WORLD!

So we've arrived, no one depends on me
So, with forces far from gone??
No way! NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY!

THERE'S GLORY TO THE BRAVE!!

GLORY TO THE BRAVE!!

STAND!!!!!!
