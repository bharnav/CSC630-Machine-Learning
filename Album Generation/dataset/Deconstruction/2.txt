[Intro: Devin]
Ih-Ah!

[Chanting]
Home, home, home, home, I go
Home, home, home, home
When we meet you god we go
Home, home, home, home, I go
Home, home, home, home
When we meet your god we will...

[Verse 1A: Devin]
Say goodbye, you know I've tried
But now the time to mourn has died
It's cold inside the worm
Nothing ever bothers me now

[Chanting]
Home, home, home, home, ah
Home, home, home, home

[Verse 1B: Devin]
Lady Vagine, you know I'm dying
But to my surprise, the punishment subsides
It's cold inside, my son
Nothing ever bothers you now

[Chorus: Ihsahn]
I survive!
Nothing ever bothers Juular!
Eye for an eye, I survived
And God damned you, hey!
I survive!
Nothing ever bothers Juular!
Eye for an eye, I survive and God damns you to hell!

God damns you!

[Verse 2: Devin]
Lady of mine, you know I'm trying
But to buy the buy, this boy must die
It's cold inside, my love
Nothing ever bothers me now

[Chorus: Ihsahn]
I survive!
Nothing ever bothers Juular!
Eye for an eye, I survived
And God damned you, hey!
I survive!
Nothing ever bothers Juular!
Eye for an eye, I survive and God damns you!

[Outro: Devin]
Say goodbye, you know I tried
Say goodbye, you know I tried
Say goodbye, you know I tried
Say goodbye, you know I tried

[Ending: Ihsahn]
Juular!
