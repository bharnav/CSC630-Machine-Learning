I HAVE NEVER KNOW HER LOVE AND I WILL NEVER HOLD MY CHILD
I WILL NEVER KNOW THE FAMILY AND NOW IT'S OVER FATHER!!
...FOR ME!

OH! What do we know? About sacrifice and self control?
OH! We do NOT know...'cause we are ANIMALS...
ANIMALS!!!
INSTINCTUAL!!!

FREE MY HEART, MY INTERGALACTIC PART!

NO!

HEY THROUGH ANGER, WE HUNGER FOR GOD...
HEY NOW, THROUGH ANGER WE HUNGER FOR GOD...

Shower the world where it's trying to be
How the memories have taken a leave
Now they're here and they're lying to me!
Accountable man, nothing is free

FREE!

MY SOUL!
Love, love me...love, love me...LOVE, LOVE ME! LOVE!!!
Drink Soma

HONOR!

I know why, I know what we came for...

SO MUCH THAT I WANT TO KNOW!

I've come down!

CHANNELLING THE MIND OF A COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS
THEIR PASSIONATE WAYS CULLED TO MARKET THY NAME!!
ONE! (God!)
SAY NO MORE! (Down!)
WHY HAVE YOU? (Fall!)

VENTURE IN, BARTER FAITH FOR THE EVERYMAN!
'TILL THE MANNA CALLS FOR OUR LIVES AND OUR FEARS!
ALL WILL RULE ON MIND COMMAND...
AND THIS MIND COMMANDS:

LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE!

I know why, I know what we came for!

SO MUCH WE NEED TO LEARN!

HONOR!

Be free, my heart... MY INTERGALACTIC PART!

CALL NOW TO THE WORLDS OF OLD!
ALL SHALL BE FREE!

Shower the world where it's trying to be
How the memories have taken a leave
Now they're here and they're lying to me!
Accountable man, nothing is free

FOREVER!!!

HEY THROUGH ANGER, WE HUNGER FOR GOD (SUMERIA!!!)
(Known in my day...)
HEY NOW, THROUGH ANGER WE HUNGER FOR GOD

SUMERIA!!!

Cold, we mirror the I, have all come to rise when souls cry?
The old man is so proud tonight
In the fields of the earth...
Choral lines, July in the birth throes of light never die...never lie
Lie
Sane, pray for where our hearts lead us now...
