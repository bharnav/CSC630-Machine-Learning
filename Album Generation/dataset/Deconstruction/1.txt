Some may sever
Some may never...
Some may take their needs then go...
Some find heaven
...In sevens and elevens
Some may chase the even flow
But:
Some may never...some may never even know

Some may leave us
...Take us or leave us
Some must face their fears to grow
Some mind heaven
...Through sevens and elevens
Some must taste their heathen glow
But:
Some may never
Some of you will never even know...

...Ready?

I'VE COME FACE TO FACE WITH MYSELF, MAN
SANCTIFY THE EARLY LIGHT JUST LIKE THE OLD MAN CAN, BOY!
CHANGE THE WORLD?? YOU BETTER CHANGE YOURSELF MAN, BOY...MAN
CHALLENGE THE MIND TO BE MORE LIKE THE ROLLING OCEAN MAN!

And BURN!

BURN!!!

Thou now behold us: The souls of those who anger overcame
Thou now behold us: The souls of those who anger overcame

SOME FIND JESUS
SOME MAY NEVER EVEN STAND!!!

STAND!

I WILL NOT, I WILL NOT GO!
(I want to know why we are metal...)
I WILL LET, I WILL LET GO!
I I I I I
(harmony, harmony...walk to war)

I STAND!!!

STAND!!!

I WILL LET GO! I WILL GO!!!

I fall now... I'm letting go
I call tonight, I'm letting go
I crawl...but now, I'm letting go
I fall tonight...I'm letting go...
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
(I will let go babe...)

To thine own selves be true...show me
I'm not afraid...
I know myself...
SHOW YOURSELF!!

Do not pretend to know...there's NEVER a time but now
And I will never back down...DO YOU HEAR ME ?!?!?

I STAND!!!

I WILL NOT, I WILL NOT GO!!!
(I want to know why we are metal...)
I WILL LET, I WILL LET GO!

I WILL LET GO!!

FALL OUT, THEN FALL BACK IN LINE...SHUT IT!!
