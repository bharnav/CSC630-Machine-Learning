[Chorus: Danny]
Pour me, pour me, pour me another
It holds me, holds me like no other
One more drink then I swear that I'm going home
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go
So pour me, pour me, pour me another

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
I wake up right about the mid-afternoon
With the sun in the sky, but night's coming soon
And I walk to the mirror just to fix myself
Yeah, life gets harder when you love nothing else
So I pick up my pills from the counter drawer
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor
I guess I'm a man of no recourse
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me
I swear I used to be one, I truly believed
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
That even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so...

[Chorus: Danny]
Pour me, pour me, pour me another
It holds me, holds me like no other
One more drink then I swear that I'm going home
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go
So pour me, pour me, pour me another

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
People get sick, and they'll watch you bleed
When you fall from the top, boy you better believe
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need
But at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea
When we stop, and we look up to the sky
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say
Our knees are getting tired, too tired to pray
That's when we lay down, end of the road
We all seem to walk it, guess I walked it alone
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so…

[Chorus: Danny]
Pour me, pour me, pour me another
It holds me, holds me like no other
One more drink then I swear that I'm going home
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go
So pour me, pour me, pour me another

[Bridge: Danny & Johnny 3 Tears]
Time just seems to go on and on
On and on and on and on
Life inside a bottle, all along
All along, the bottle's gone
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea
What's life inside a bottle if it's gone?
One more song and I'm finally free
I'll meet you here in heaven between the sea
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so…

[Chorus: Danny]
Pour me, pour me, pour me another
It holds me, holds me like no other
One more drink then I swear that I'm going home
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go
So pour me, pour me, pour me another

[Outro: Danny]
Pour me, pour me
Pour me, pour me
Pour me, pour me
Pour me, pour me
Pour me another
