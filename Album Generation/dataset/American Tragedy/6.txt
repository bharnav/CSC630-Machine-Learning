[Intro: Da Kurlzz & Danny]
Gangsta
Gangsta
So gangsta

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Danny]
Gangsta, got my diamond earrings
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat, so don't disrespect me

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene & Funny Man]
I love it when the DJ throws my song on
Hit the dance floor and get my sing-along on
I love to spit the choruses when I'm on one
My C-Walk's too hot, I done ripped my Sean John
Smelling so fly, I got the Hugo Boss on
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on
We could roll in the Fiesta just to get our floss on
I got the speakers bumping, straight banging the Thong Song
Got my hair did, got my shit braided up
Rolling with Funny Man and he's breaking a blunt
Snatch it out of his hand, and now I'm blazing it up
Took another sip of Henny, now I'm faded as fuck
Yo, Charlie Scene, tell me where you got them shades at
You know I've had this OG style since way back
Sitting in VIP, blowing trees, I'm laid back
This bitch is gonna be another notch on my wave cap

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Danny]
Gangsta, got my diamond earrings
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up if you let me
Gangsta, diamonds all up on me
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat so don't disrespect me

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
I'm just so damn flossy
And I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me
I'mma give it to you every time

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene & Funny Man]
Hold up and let me lace up the Timbs
I'm only 26, but so is the rims
I wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis
I look so good, a million bucks is jealous
So I parked the Huffy, kicked down the kickstand
Paid twenty-dollar cover, and I got me a wristband
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standing in quicksand
If they talk to me twice, they better talk to my pimp hand
Got the Laker jersey and the platinum chain
Two Bluetooths and a pinkie ring
Getting drunk as fuck off that Tanqueray
Beer goggles on, I'm talking to a grenade
Yo, Charlie Scene, tell me how you got so flossy
It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me
I just roll with the posse who's cool like Fonzie
And known to be flashier than paparazzi

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Danny]
Gangsta, got my diamond earrings
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up if you let me
Gangsta, diamonds all up on me
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat so don't disrespect me

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
I'm just so damn flossy
I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me
I'mma give it to you every time

[Verse 3: Funny Man]
Freeze at ease
Let Funny Man bang on these keys
I'm about to get it cracking and freaky-deaky
All the ladies in the world just dying to meet me
'Cause nothing about me is ever cheesy
I'll get you in the bed and make it squeaky, squeaky
Looking so damn fly as I hit the club
Low ride, west side, yes, we throwing it up
Make my way to the dance floor to burn it up
Now go ahead and hit that chorus and turn it up

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Danny]
Gangsta, got my diamond earrings
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up if you let me
Gangsta, diamonds all up on me
Gangsta, gonna turn you on
So gangsta, I preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat so don't disrespect me

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
I'm just so damn flossy
And I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me
I'mma give it to you every time
I'm just so damn flossy
And I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me
I'mma give it to you every time
Give it to you every...
Give it to you every...
Give it to you every time
