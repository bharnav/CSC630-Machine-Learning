[Intro: Danny]
I wanna tear it up before we tear it down
I wanna light it up before we burn it down
We gonna get fucked up, drink till we all black out
So fucking start it up 'cause you know it's going down

[Verse 1: Funny Man]
Tricked out swag, yeah, we keep it the same
Mad dog, dub-dub, in the back of the Range
Ain't no bub bub, baby, got bills to pay
Yeah, I'm getting fucked up as I'm changing lanes
Oh my God, I'm one of a kind
I'mma smash it up, it's about that time
I'll be back to the party by the end of the night
But my hoe got needs, and I needs mine
'Cause the Funny Man is just so damn sexual
The ass on my mind is so damn edible
Feast your eyes, girl, I'm so delectable
Dick like Hulk, yeah, they call me incredible

[Pre-Chorus: Danny]
You got your dress pulled up
I see you all around
I know you ain't no slut
But I know you're so down

[Chorus: All]
Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
Girl, you so hot, you can spark a match
And me and Funny wanna flip you like an acrobat
And you can go back home in a Cadillac
Put my name in your phone, it's the Man in Black
You got a big ol' mouth and an ass to match
You've got my back in a scrap, and I'm a fan of that
We can go home and open up a can of that
I'll put my prize in your box like Cracker Jacks
Oh wait, that's just me being shitfaced
Let me put out my Bluetooth and briefcase
And replace everything that I said wrong
But then it won't be a Hollywood Undead song

[Pre-Chorus: Danny]
You got your dress pulled up
I see you all around
I know you ain't no slut
But I know you're so down

[Chorus: All]
Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash, I'm gone

[Brige: Danny]
​I wanna tear it up before we tear it down
I wanna light it up before we burn it down
We gonna get fucked up, drink till we all black out
So fucking start it up…
​
​[Verse 3: Funny Man]
Smashing, crashing, what's on and cracking?
It’s me and you, girl, now that's what's happening
Let's take a little trip to my stabbing cabin
Grab the cam, it's lights, camera, action
Let me take care of that satisfaction
Grab a six-pack, I'm back off the wagon
Pour a little out for Michael Jackson
I'm smashing now 'cause I know she's down

[Chorus: All]
Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash, I'm gone
Smash it up, smash it up
This bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash, I'm gone
Smash it up, smash it up
Smash it up, smash it up
