[Intro: Johnny 3 Tears]
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands, on my hands
Blood on my hands

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Wake up in the middle of its any other night
With some tears on my pillow, and there's blood on my knife
And my soul has stained the sheets, but they're pulled off to the side
Whose blood could this be? Is it yours or is it mine?
Take the knife and twist it; where's my heart? You missed it
You know I don't wanna die, but, baby, you insisted
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have
My heart just keeps on beating, and it's more than you can stand
Baby, please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
We used to sing together when we used to sing this song
We could never sing forever 'cause now my voice is gone
Guess I'm gone forever, and you knew it all along

[Chorus: Danny]
I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you laid next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stayed close to me, the further I ran

[Post-Chorus: Johnny 3 Tears]
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'm only evil when I need to be, but you did this so easily
I tried to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning
But you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me
You came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me
I had nothing to give, so I gave you my life
Didn't wanna see me live, so you gave me your knife
Didn't hear you as you tiptoed coming from behind
You took away my kid, so I guess you killed me twice
Dragged me into the night 'cause it's the one thing you keep
You knew that I had to die so you could finally sleep
There's blood all over your knife, you know you earned yourself
And it's a matter of time until you burn in hell

[Chorus: Danny]
I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you laid next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stayed close to me, the further I ran

[Post-Chorus: Johnny 3 Tears]
There's blood on my hands

[Bridge: Danny]
Your remorse holds no recourse
No, I'm breathing slowly
Oh, won't you hold me?
Your remorse holds no recourse
No, I'm breathing slowly
Oh, won't you hold me?

[Chorus: Danny]
I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you laid next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stayed close to me, the further I ran
I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you laid next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stayed close to me, the further I ran

[Post-Chorus: Johnny 3 Tears]
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
