[Intro: Da Kurlzz]
Boy, you better put a lid on it

[Chorus: Danny]
You don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
Oh no, you don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums, so just run along 'cause you don't want none

[Verse 1: J-Dog]
Let me take you back, so back in time
That made the front page news, living lives of crime
'Cause we ran moonshine, outlaws, to be exact
We did something new, and we never turned back
Six shots, point blank, aiming at your face
I'mma quickdraw, then I'm gone without a trace
And I'll rob a bank, or I'll cheat and steal
Derail a fucking train 'cause you know that I will
You need to pay your dues or get cement shoes
And we're still on the run, the most ruthless crew

[Chorus: Danny]
You don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
Oh no, you don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums, so just run along 'cause you don't want none

[Verse 2: Funny Man]
I'm a heartbreak kid, I'm a stickup kid
Bang-bang, Tommy Gun, you's a punk-ass bitch
Knocked out, one punch like a superhero
Paid up, crapped out, now you're back to zero
Boom-bing-pow, King Kong, no doubt
Like a prohibition, I'mma have to dry you out
You'll be picking up your teeth straight off of the ground
I'mma switch-blade shank, you know how word gets around
All bets are in, I say you roll the dice
Looks like another seven, it's the end of your life

[Chorus: Danny]
You don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
Oh no, you don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums, so just run along 'cause you don't want none

[Verse 3: Johnny 3 Tears]
It's no matter, just a matter of time
It don't matter to Three, it ain't no matter of mine
If you keep your mouth shut, then you'll be just fine
If you keep running gums, you better look out behind
You see U-N to the D-E-A-D
Got the full clip, bitch is cocked and empty
The cock of the walk, but you walked too far
Now your cock's on the block on the boulevard
I'm the J-O-H to the N-Y 3T
You lucky you ain't dead if you know they sent me

[Chorus: Danny]
You don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
Oh no, you don't know what it's like to get your head lumped in
'Cause you keep flapping those gums, so just run along 'cause you don't want none

[Bridge: Danny & Charlie Scene]
U-N to the D-E-A-D
You got your fists raised, but your legs are shakey
U-N to the D-E-A-D
You know that I'm the shit, that's why you're trying to take me

[Verse 3: Charlie Scene]
We can go around the corner, I ain't catching a case
This will all be over quick, I'mma do what it takes
So you better know your role and never speak out of place
Or I'mma roll your ass up and smack the lips off your face
You better not run 'cause my bullets are faster
I'd never really hit a bitch, so I'm gonna smack you
This won't even be a fight 'cause I'm knocking you out
And my name ain't Dick, so keep it out of your mouth

[Outro: Danny & Charlie Scene]
U-N to the D-E-A-D
Let it be known we do this shit on the daily
U-N to the D-E-A-D
Ain't nothing, still serving you baby
