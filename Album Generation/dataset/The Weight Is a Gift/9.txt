[Verse 1]
I was about to change
But you stayed the same
Had pinned against the wall
That we are pre-ordained
If they gave you extra scenes
You'd hit back to main
I was about to change

[Refrain]
Disappear by train
Cut my signal chain
Find a stable girl
And fill it up again
You can't foresee intent
When the writer writes all bent
Armies walk inside of me
Armies walk physically

[Verse 2]
Every day I steal a car
That's how hard it is to
Get away from where you are

[Refrain]
Disappear by train
Cut my signal chain
Find a stable world
And fill it up again
You can't foresee intent
When the writer writes all bent
Armies walk inside of me
Armies walk physically
We'd like you to leave
Coz we've gotta breathe

[Outro]
Who's to say
Why we're built so strange
Disappointing ourselves
Before we change?
Grass is greener right over here
Why do simple things
Take so many years?
