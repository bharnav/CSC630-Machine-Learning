I look in the mirror
To see what my hair is doing
Is it kind of skywalker
Or is it kind of stupid?
But that's not the real reason i'm looking
I need a reminder of what i'm doing
I need a reminder that i'm human

In my dreams i love you like
A snowstorm in the night
The windows open wide
Here comes reflected light
We can keep the covers up
It's like we never stop

But do dreams ever do damage to life?
When you need so much
You can't get it right

Who else is here today?
I'm alone but can't obey
Swim on my back at night
Near my clothes and a flashlight

I look in the mirror
Why am i complicated?
I'm trying to see clearer
The sun has faded
