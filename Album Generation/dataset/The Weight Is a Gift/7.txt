Comes a time when
You can't judge no more
Go out shopping
Can't see the store
I can't believe that
We're really all good
One of us has gone
Where they never should

Comes a time when
You really can't judge
Should go walking
You don't even budge
I can't believe how
Far we have gone
One of us has not come along

Get up and tell the sun
That you don't feel love

How long can you
Keep circling round?
Like paris, texas
â€˜til she found out
