So we sat and talked
And then we walked and talked
But said it was the truth
What is your secret?

Dragged it on and on
Even favorite songs
But your division's wrong
What is your secret?

I don't care about you anymore
The people got tired
Our movies don't play much anymore
The actress was fired

You said you were yourself
Not being someone else
That this was new for you
What is your secret?

You said just what i said
Like it came from your head
So what's the needle pet?
What is your secret?

I don't care about you anymore
People got tired of
Our movies don't play much anymore
The actress was fired

I don't think about you
I try not to think about you

You want to control
You want to be controlled
You're like a little switch
And then you take your time

You lived a reckless twist
I wasn't made for this
Think i've been locked for long
The city's so big
