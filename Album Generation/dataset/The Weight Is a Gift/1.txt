Well I'd snap to attention if I thought that you knew the way
I'd open my mouth if I had something smart to say
I bought a stack of books, I didn't read a thing
It's like I'm sitting here waiting for birds to sing

Let's do it again
Come on, let's do it again
Please, let's do it again
Come on, let's do it again

The hum of the clock is a far away place
The azalea air holding your face
You're lying down and the moon is sideways ( *** cold that never gets old)
It's like I'm sitting here waiting for birds to sing

I spend all my energy staying upright
And I like the masked noise quiet of your breathing nearby

Let's do it again
Come on, let's do it again
Please, let's do it again
Come on, let's do it again

I want your lazy science, I want some peace
Are you the future? Show me the keys

I spend all my energy walking upright
I like the masked noise quiet of your breathing nearby
When I accelerate I remember why it's good to be alive
Like a 25-cent game

Maybe this weight was a gift
Like I had to see what I could lift
I spend all my energy walking upright
