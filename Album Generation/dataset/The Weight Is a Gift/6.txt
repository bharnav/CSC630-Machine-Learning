[Intro]
Oh, fuck it
I'm gonna have a party (x2)

[Hook]
I had the blankest year
I saw life turn into a T.V. show
It was totally weird
The person I knew I didn't really know

[Verse]
Time don't move
We're the only ones who do
Bending reason
Cause its all we hold on to

[Hook 2]

[Bridge]
And I was lonely
Thank god the band's doing well
But you don't own me
I'd like to return this spell
Cause it's not my size
And your lies are so much bigger than my lies
And your ties are made of things that shouldn't make ties

[Outro]
Oh, fuck it (fuck it)
I'm gonna have a party (x3)
