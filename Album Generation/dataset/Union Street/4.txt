She looks around
There are snowflakes on the ground
Here comes another lonely Christmas
Stars in the night
There is one there shining bright
Shine bright for me this lonely Christmas

And I wanted to say to you
How much I want to be with you
I wanted to say to you
How much I need to be with you
Christmas time comes once a year
She knows this time he won't be near

She (hello) phones her mum
Says this time she cannot come
Don't worry I'm with friends this Christmas (Oooh la la la)
Dad gets upset
But in time he soon forgets
Here comes another lonely Christmas

And I wanted to say to you
How much I want to be with you
I wanted to say to you
How much I need to be with you
Christmas time comes once a year
She knows this time he won't be near

(Oooh la la la)
And I wanted to say to you (She won't be home)
How much I want to be with you (This christmas time)
I wanted to say to you (She won't be home)
How much I need to be with you (This christmas time)
I wanted to say to you (She won't be home)
How much I need to be with you (This christmas time)
I wanted to say to you (She won't be home)
How much I need to be with you (This christmas time)
I wanted to say to you (She won't be home)
How much I need to be with you (This christmas time)
