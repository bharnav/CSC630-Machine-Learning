Love leave me alone
I've got troubles of my own
I do believe that I have paid a price
For all the things I've said and done
Every little thing that seemed to go wrong

How many times
Will I regret the chances taken?
Why do I end up
Always the one who is mistaken?

Love leave to sleep
Let me wallow in my dreams
See the icy past fade away
The dawning of a brand new day
The echoes of voice that still remind me

How many times
Will I regret the chances taken?
Why do I end up
Always the one who is mistaken?
How many times
Will I regret the chances taken?
Why do I end up
Always the one who is mistaken?
How many times
Will I regret the chances taken?
Why do I end up
Always the one who is mistaken?
