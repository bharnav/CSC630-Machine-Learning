Past five in the morning
Feeling worse for the weather it seems
But what a feeling
What an endless night this has been

And we can't stay here
'Cause we won't be forever young
We'll have to go down
Before innocence is lost

And I dream you're with me
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms

I've been getting used to all the crying
And the games that you play
And if I carry on I'm gonna end up with a
Hole in my head

And there's more to life
Than thrills & spills & dollar bills
We'll have to get through
Some way some how

And I dream you're with me
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms
