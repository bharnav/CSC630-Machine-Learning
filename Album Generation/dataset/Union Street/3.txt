I try hard
To put you out of mind
Every night alone
I'm thinking 'bout you
Now can I avoid this
Pain without you
I won't cry
Won't be sorry no more
I know that this is
Something I'll get over
Maybe I can learn to love another
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
Just because I lock
Myself in my room
It doesn't mean that
I'm afraid to talk to
Those people I know
That might have you seen you
No return
I keep reminding myself
I look back
Don't regret a single moment
I gonna mend this heart
Inside you've broken

Show me the way
They say safety in numbers
I lift up my eyes to the sky
And imagine a crowd
Of hearts that surround me
And give the me courage to die
Were you to weep
And lie at my feet
Then you'd wash all
My troubles away
And imagine the host
Of angels around me
That give me the courage to die
