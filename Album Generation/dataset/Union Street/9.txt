It's not just a love affair, it's all or nothing
Do i bet it all on love?, or change and freak out?
When the chances come my way
Will they up and dissappear?
Will it ever go my way?
Or am i out of here?

There'll be tears before your bedtime
You mark my words
You wanted more than i could give you
You wanted more than you could have

It's not just a love affair
It's now or never
Could i give it all to you?
Is that what we're about?
If i hold you, will you stay?
Or will you up and dissappear?
Be forever and a day
Like your letter said

There'll be tears before your bedtime
You mark my words
You wanted more than i could give you
You wanted more than you could have

When the chances come my way
Will they up and dissappear
Will it ever go my way
Or am i out of here?

There'll be tears before your bedtime
You mark my words
You wanted more than i could give you
You wanted more than you could have

(love's growing stronger every day)
(love's growing stronger every way)
