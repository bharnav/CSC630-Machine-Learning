Cuts to the quick
Pure emotion, a trip
No word of a lie

Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo-ah

Pressed to your lips
We collide, slowly twist
Ardent and lithe

Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo-ah

Seeps into the ground
Kisses the earth and I am found

Love's young dream could be alien
Strange ways how we fly
Tuning low like a radio
Whispering goodbye

Alien, Wo-Ah, alien

Just so it seems
Softly potent, serene
Vacant and shy

Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo-ah

You are everywhere
Under my skin and in my hair

Love's young dream could be alien
Strange ways, how we fly
Tuning low like a radio
Whispering goodbye

Seeps into the ground
Kisses the earth and I am found

Love's young dream could be alien
Strange ways, how we fly
Tuning low like a radio
Whispering goodbye

Love's young dream could be alien
Strange ways, how we fly
Tuning low like a radio
Whispering goodbye

Love's young dream could be alien
Strange ways, how we fly
Tuning low like a radio
Whispering goodbye

Love's young dream
Could be serene
So alien
