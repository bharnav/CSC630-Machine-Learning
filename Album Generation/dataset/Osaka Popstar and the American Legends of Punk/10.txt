Well I woke up this morning and I got out of bed
I felt really beat stars spinned through my head
I knew what to do to get outta this rut
Toss down some of my cap'n crunch
Opened the cabinet where it belonged
I looked at the box and cap'n crunch was gone
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
Well I can't eat it now with out the cap'n around
What will we fo, he must be found!
Cuz lucky charms they don't do the trick
And wheaties don't pack a sugar fix
Quisp left the galaxy
Quake got his way
All passed the expiration date
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
They said he'd gone away to sea
And now there's a big mystery
They told me to solve the clues
I was too depressed I had the crunchberry blues
Then he came back one day
They said he'd been at the milky way
Nut i don't believe all the spoon-fed lies
Conspiracies, pay-offs or cereal-spies don't feel right
Who could it have been
The silly trix rabbit trying to work his way in
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n
Where's the cap'n - gone?
