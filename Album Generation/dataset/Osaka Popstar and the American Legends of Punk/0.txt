We have sinned so many times before
We see no need to turn back now
'Cause we're the world the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing, we're marching to hell

Come and join have some fun
Dance in joy beneath the neon lights
'Cause we're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing, We're marching to hell

We're the world, the wicked world
We do whatever we please
Forget you're sow your wild oats
And sin is a Wonderful disease

Lie and steal, it's alright
We have no worries for tomorrow
'Cause we're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing, we're marching to hell

We're the world the wicked world
We don't believe in God
We don't believe in anything
We find that to be rather odd

We paint ourselves as our bodies start to decay
Getting closer everyday
We have sinned so many times before
We see no need to turn back now

'Cause we're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing, we're marching to hell
We know what we're doing, we're marching to hell
