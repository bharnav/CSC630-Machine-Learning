There once was a christmas that almost wasn't,almost wasn't, almost wasn't
There once was a christmas that almost wasn't,almost wasn't, almost wasn't
Because of a man named prune
Now prune was a man who jolly wasn't, sweet wasn't merry wasn't
Now prune was a man who just wasn't, a very nice man at all
Prune, prune was his name
He was a man who had no shame
Prune, prune was his name
If there is no christmas he's to blame
He tried to stop christmas, we wished he wouldn't
We thought he couldn't, he knew he shouldn't
He tried to stop christmas, but santa wouldn't let him have his way
Though prune did his worst santa worried wasn't
Scared wasn't, conquered wasn't
Though prune did his worst, his best wasn't enough to stop christmas day
Prune, prune was his name, he was a man who had no shame
Prune, prune was his name
Prune, prune was his name
If there is no christmas he's to blame
So there once was a christmas that almost wasn't, almost wasn't, almost wasn't
There once was a christmas that almost wasn't, almost wasn't, almost wasn't
Because of a man named prune
