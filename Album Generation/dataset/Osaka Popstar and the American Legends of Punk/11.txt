Spouting off eastern philosophies
Without a sense of inner piece
Like a shaolin monkey yeah a barrel full
Genuine as you'll find for $1.99
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Sounds good for the image
Sounds good fro the press
Those in the know are not a bit impressed
Now watch your step you're gonna slip on a peel
The extent of your knowledge will be revealed
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Swing from the tree and eat your own crap
You're a clueless, shoeless, skill-less mess
Pick at your fleas and scratch your head
Pick the wrong fight and you'll end up dead
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Stay in your cage and stay clear of me living your life of transparency
Put on a dress and make a silly face
Monkey see, monkey do, monkey imitate
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Orient-ation time's arrived
Stand up be human try to survive
Don't need fake identities
When evolution set you free
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
Shaolin monkeys
