I can't sleep cause there's monsters in my closet
They hide in the dark and they creep around my room
I can't sleep cause there's monsters in my closet
I turn on the lights and prepare to face my doom
What can I do?
No one sleeps when there's monsters in their closet
So hide under cover and wish for the darkness to disappear
You can't get away and there's nothing that can stop it
They shriek through the night and they try to incite your fears
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one believes there's monsters in my closet
They tell me I'm wrong and I don't belong with ghouls
But maybe one day they'll discover that they've been haunted
They'll be all alone in the twilight zone poor fools
I can't sleep cause there's monsters in my closet
They hide in the dark and they creep around my room
I can't sleep through all the hours of mindless nonsense
They break all and make lots of noise it's true
What can I do?
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-oh
