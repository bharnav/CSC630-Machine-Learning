[Verse 1]
Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I don't know what is real
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion

[Chorus]
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

[Verse 2]
The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I'm blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction

[Chorus]
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

[Verse 3]
No matter if you're born
To play the king or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow

[Chorus]
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall
