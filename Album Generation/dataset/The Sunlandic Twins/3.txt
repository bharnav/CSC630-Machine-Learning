[Pre-Chorus]
And so begins, begins our odyssey...
And we begin, begin our odyssey...
And so begins, begins our odyssey...

[Chorus]
The aria is bleeding and the boyish voice is leaving
I've been an evil tenor, I filled the innocent's doe-eyes with glue
You're my only softness, you're my only pleasure, it's true
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse]
The chrysalis is breaking and the superego's waking
I've been a gloomy Petrarch, with a quill as weepy as Dido
You're my mousy aesthete, you're my buoyant cherub, it's true
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure

[Chorus]
