Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
I know what I'm needing, and I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind

[Bridge]
It was so easy living day by day;
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News

[Verse 3]
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind

[Bridge]
It was so easy living day by day;
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News

[Verse 3]
I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
Because I'm in a New York state of mind
