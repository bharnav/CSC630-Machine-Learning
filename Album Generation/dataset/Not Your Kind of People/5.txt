[Verse 1]
Felt sure you felt something
Felt sure, but it really was nothing
You felt, but you're only guessing

[Hook]
They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings

[Verse 2]
Felt I'd left you hanging
Felt sure I'd stopped myself caring
You felt, that I'd stopped believing

[Hook]
They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings

[Breakdown]
What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
I still get you
Do you still get me?

[Verse 3]
Felt my skin on your skin
Felt sure, sensations like raining
You felt, no logical thinking

[Hook]
They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings

[Outro]:
Oh-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Oh-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Oh-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Oh-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Oh-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
