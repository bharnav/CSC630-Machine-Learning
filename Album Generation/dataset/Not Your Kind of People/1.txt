[Verse 1]
We are difficult to understand
It was hard to make the simple plan work
Difficult and that's what made it burn

You're a satellite around my heart
One million miles before the start
Indescribable and that's what makes it you

[Pre-Chorus]
Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the teeth

[Chorus]
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
We rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

[Verse 2]
You're mysterious, you make no sense
I love you cause you're innocent
You fell out through a hole inside the sun

So magnify the best inside me
Fill the parts that you can't find me
The parts that won't give out when things get hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the teeth

[Chorus]
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
We rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

[Bridge]
Round and around in the setting sun
Round and around in the setting sun
Round and around in the setting sun
Round and around and around and around and around

[Chorus]
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

[Outro]
I'm with you
(Big bright world)
I'm with you
I'm with you
(Big bright world)
I'm with you
I'm with you
(In this big, bright world)
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
