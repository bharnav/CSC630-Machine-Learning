[Verse 1]
Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes

[Chorus 1]
Wind chimes [x2]

[Verse 2]
In the late afternoon you're
Hung up on wind chimes

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Though it's hard I try
Not to look at my wind chimes

[Chorus 1]

Now and then a tear rolls on my cheek

[Verse 4]
On a warm breeze the little bells
Tinkling wind chimes

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 5]
Close your eyes and lean back
Listen to wind chimes

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 6]
It's so peaceful
Close to a lullabye

[Chorus 2] [x2]
The wind chimes tingling
Tingling
The wind chimes tingling
Tingling
Da do do da do do da do do da do do

[Outro]
Whispering winds send my wind chimes a tinkling [x2]
