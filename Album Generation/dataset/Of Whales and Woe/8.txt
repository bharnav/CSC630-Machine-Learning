I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
I percolate my coffee off the radiator boil
I been chasin' tuna nearly 27 years
I got the eyeballs of an eagle but there's ringing in my ears

I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
Granddad was a farmer but I couldn't stand the soil
I like to keep it simple; it helps to keep me sane
I like floating in the ocean it nullifies the pain

Some say we can find a place
Between heaven and hell
Some work to make the bread rise
I like to plow the ocean swell
Errol's got a sweet monterey
Rigged for salmon and crab
Never had a family
Unless you count that old yellow lab

I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
I percolate my coffee off the radiator boil
I been chasin' tuna nearly 27 years
I got the eyeballs of an eagle but there's ringing in my ears

I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
Granddad was a farmer but I couldn't stand the soil
I like to keep it simple; it helps to keep me sane
I like floating in the ocean it nullifies the pain

Lookin' back to '95
I had a fresh Cummings re-power
Draggin' lines for Albacore
'Till the market went sour
We talked of strike for 40 days
'Cause the price was drove down
And when we finally settled up
We got less than a dollar a pound

I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
I percolate my coffee off the radiator boil
I been chasin' tuna nearly 27 years
I got the eyeballs of an eagle but there's ringing in my ears

I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil
Granddad was a farmer but I couldn't stand the soil
I like to keep it simple; it helps to keep me sane
I like floating in the ocean it nullifies the pain
