[Chorus] Back off Turkey, i think i'm comin' around again, i think comin around again, i'm comin around comin again.[]
I'm comin around with vengeance on my chin
I'm comin around with bristles on my hide
I'm brown with hair dyed, n eyes wide
I'm comin around again

[Chorus]
You can sit in smelly sweat and you can sit and watch me spit, 'cause im comin around again
I'm comin around with both barrels blazin'
While calvin raised me, while glasses crazin around the edges. (????)

I'm comin around again
