Ol' Silk Johnson, cruisin up mighty fine
Got a brand new cadillac
Buddy comrad Smith, rollin down the line
Got a last year's cadillac
Johnson said hey smitty boy, what ya thinkin' of my spankin hot cadillac?
Smith just reeled his head back, looked him in the eye, "that's a mighty fine cadillac

(chorus) But i'm gonna get me one better.(just you wait and see)
I'mma gonna get me one better.(you can't get the best of me)
I'mma gonna get me one better.( the baddest one around)

I'mma gunna get me one better.( 'cause' i got the biggest balls in town).(chorus)
Remember ol' Khrushchev when he was ridin' high with that sputnik satellite
He told us yankee boys, he's gunna fill the skies with them shiny new satellites
He said "hey Mr. Eisenhower, watcha think of my sputnik satellite?"
Ike reeled his head back
Looked him in the eye, that's a mighty fine satellite

(chorus)
I'm gonna get one better
