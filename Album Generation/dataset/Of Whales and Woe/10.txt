Filipino Ray, he can sing it out
Like you would not believe
Always had his blond freckle-faced lady
Dangling from his sleeve

Filipino Ray, he played an old Les Paul
Big ol' jumbo fret
Had scars up on the headstock
From where he kept his lit cigarette

Filipino Ray had a fang tooth
And a face like a China moon
Them biker gals squealed when he'd flip his hair back
Step up to the mic and croon

Filipino Ray was a smiler
Quick with a tale or a joke
And more than happy to lend you his ear
Especially if you bought him a fresh bourbon and coke

Filipino Ray had seen his share of demons
And many days of black
But when he picked his guitar and sang back to the bar
He pissed the monkey off his back

Now Filipino Ray, he could belt it out
Like you would not believe
It's been five years for this guitar man
Since he rolled up his sleeve

Now Filipino Ray, he's a smiler
Quick with a tale or a joke
He'd likely as not give you the shirt off his back
All over bourbon and coke
