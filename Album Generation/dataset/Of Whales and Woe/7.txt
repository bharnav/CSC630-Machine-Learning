Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
His old time dentures pitted and coffee stained
Drove a milk truck for an outfit called Dairy Time
Till the cobwebs filled and clouded his mind

Something borrowed, something blue
Rest assured her love was always true
They raised their Sons in a place called Tomales Bay
Then melanoma came and took her away

He doesn't worry but will often pine
TheTBiggest obstacle is passin time
He sold his house and bought a big old wood trawler
Now he drags the ocean to earn a square dollar

Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
The salty air helps to fade the pain
A simple man with a simple wish
Affable seas and an occasional load of fish

Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Every now and then
Yer gonna get slapped with a slab of rain
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Some die and leave their mark
Some just a stain

Nothin' ventured nothin' gained...
