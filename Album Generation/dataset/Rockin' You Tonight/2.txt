We grew up in the same town
Three houses down on Magnolia Street
Young love was going strong
Even though your Dad and Mom were sound asleep
A blanket and some moonlight
We'd slip down by the lake
Seventeen and restless
You know we just couldn't wait
And I wish I were rockin you tonight

I remember the day we both cried
You got that full ride to university
You had to do what you had to do
And we both knew it was the end of me
We wrote "we miss you letters"
Made long distance calls
But I lost you forever halfway through the fall
And I wonder, baby, who's rockin you tonight

And I live for those moments
Wrapped up in your arms
Swaying to the music of those wildly beating
Wildly beating hearts

Gotta a lot of time to think of you
On my way to the next marque sign
With any luck one of these days
You'll see my name, no, I'm doing fine
Every now and then out here on the stage
I look through the flood lights
And I swear I see your face
Feels so good to be rockin you tonight
Yeah, I'm rockin you tonight
I'm rockin you tonight
Baby, I'm rockin you tonight
