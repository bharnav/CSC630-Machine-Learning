Did you really think she'd let you in with that bouquet
Welcome you with open arms and say, it's okay
Well, them long stemmed apologies won't work no more
Cause she can't see the beauty just a hand full of thorns

And they don't grow enough roses to undo the damage done
Clouds don't make enough raindrops
And it's too much to expect from the sun
You can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back

Boy, looks like she finally made you understand
Love can wilt away like the flowers in your hand
Well, honesty might well be your saving grace
But you won't see forgiveness in another pretty face

And they don't grow enough roses to undo the damage done
Clouds don't make enough raindrops
And it's too much to expect from the sun
You can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back

Now, you can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back
