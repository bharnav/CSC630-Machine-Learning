Five hours of football one afternoon
Three nights of poker dragging in past two
Four years of trying to make it last
Even a fool could do the math

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you

One of seven boxes, one Uhall truck
Three brawny men a'loading it up
One thousand "I'm sorry's" ten minutes too late
One fed up girl on the interstate

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you

Congratulations Einstein
Look at what you've done
You've solved the equation
For two minus one

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you
No woman, no woman for you
