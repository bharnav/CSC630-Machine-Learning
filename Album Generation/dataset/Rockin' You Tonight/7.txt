Guys are playing pool, longnecks in a bucket
Bragging about their luck with the ladies in bed
Laughing when they ask him for all the dirty details
He don't say nothing just starts shaking his head

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

Cue behind the eight, he's staring down the table
There's a cutie across the room trying to catch his eye
She walks across the bar with her number on a napkin
He gives it to a buddy with a wink and a smile

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

He pays his tab, pulls his keys out of his pocket
The boys say, where you going, just one more game
Give us one good reason whey you can't hang
Turns at the door and just holds up his ring

Spoken like a man, devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man, crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

Spoken like a man, spoken like a man
Spoken like a man
