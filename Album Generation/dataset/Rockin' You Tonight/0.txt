"No ablo Espannol"
Was all I knew of the local lingo
That old pocket guide to Mexico
Wasn't much help to this out of place Gringo
When I checked into my motel room
Was helped by a brown-eyed senorita:
She said: "Buen venidos, Senor: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
"Como esta. Buenos dias."
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

As I followed her down the hallway
I was tryin' my best not to stare
The angel before me was a rare beauty indeed
Jay-Lo had nothin' on her
She winked an' she smiled at me sweetly
Said: "Senor, a qui esta sou mas vez
"Muy bappo," an' somethin' 'bout "ho ho's."
An' I thought: "Oh, baby, whatever you say."

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

Later that evenin' in a local cantina
A Mariachi band was playin'
She held me close so her body would know
That my body knew what she was sayin'

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
"Boy you won't ever forget it."
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
No, I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
