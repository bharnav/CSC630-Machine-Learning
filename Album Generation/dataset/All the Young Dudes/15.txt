[Verse 1]
Standing on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset and Jane is in her vest
And me, I'm in a rock and roll band

[Verse 2]
Riding in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
Those were different times
And the poets studied rules of verse
And all the ladies rolled there eyes

[Chorus]
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

[Verse 3]
Now Jack he is a banker
And Jane she is a clerk
And they're both saving up all their money
And when they come home from work

[Verse 4]
Sitting by the fire
Radios a-play a little classical music for you kids
To The March of the Wooden Soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

[Chorus]
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

[Verse 5]
Some people like to go out dancing
Other people, they got to work
And there's always some evil mothers
I tell you life is just full of dirt

[Verse 6]
And the women never really faint
And the villains always blink their eyes
And children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die

[Verse 7]
But anyone who had a heart
He wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
He wouldn't want to turn around and hate it

[Outro]
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane (Sweet Jane)
Sweet Jane (Sweet Jane)
Sweet Jane (Sweet Jane)
Sweet Jane (Sweet Jane)
Sweet Jane (Sweet Jane)
Sweet Jane
Oh my Sweet Jane
