Just done some living - still got the pain
Ain't done much giving - just my name
Ride on my son, that cold steel rail
Still following you, oh lord I wanna try and lose this iron bail
Ride on the sun, ride on the sun, until you break

And the City doctor's - try to see
There's a future - left for me
So I show them the rainbows, they're too colour blind
I'm hard to find, oh lord give me the strength so I can speak
Ride the sun, ride on the sun, until you break

Oh Undertaker - switch off your TV
I don't know who's dead - Is it you or is it me
For your calculations, Innocent eyes (?)
You are in doubt, on lord I'm trying to find out just where I am
Ride on the sun, ride on the sun, until I break
