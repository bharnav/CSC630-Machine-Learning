Holiday, get away
I feel funny
Children's money

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Don't be late at God's gate
Don't talk shit... out with it!

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?

It's the chance of a lifetime
It's the chance of a lifetime
It's the chance of a lifetime

On the train, feel insane
What the fuck? Just bad luck

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?

It's the chance of a lifetime
It's the chance of a lifetime
It's the chance of a lifetime

Don't you tell me that I'm fine
'Cause I'll show you that you're blind
Don't you tell me that I'm fine
'Cause I'll show you that you're blind
