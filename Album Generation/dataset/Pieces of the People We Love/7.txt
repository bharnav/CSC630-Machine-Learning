Because a cynic told me
The best is yet to come
The day we all die on our backs
Out in the sun
And now the dawn time shadows haunt my every thought
I've been lost in blind drunk photo phobia
I've been searching so long
Then an anylyst said
"why fret finality?"
'Cause, looking up
Ain't nothing looking down on me
And if the man upstairs
Don't care what's going on
Then we can find out for ourselves
What's right and wrong
I've been searching so long
I'm coming around
I'm coming around
I'm coming around
I'm coming around
I'm coming around
I've been searching so long
I've been searching so long
'Cause we can do it for ourselves
[la la la]
We can do it for ourselves
[la la la]
We can do it for ourselves
[la la la]
I've been searching so long
I've been searching so long
I've been searching so long
