[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Never have I been so disgusted
Never has it all been so clear to me
Watch out for pretenders

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
No one of any positive reputation will respect what youâ€™ve done
Judgment will befall your rule, the wrath will break your law
Harshness will have His place on this
You fake, you were meant to fall down

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Stop, stop, restart, restart
Watch out for pretenders

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Obtain perspective
Re-evaluate your inception
Endless imitation
Obvious plagiarism

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
I know how you function I know how you function
There will be an end to your profit, your possession
How did it all become, become published?
How can no one see,  see these things?

[Verse 4: Mike Hranica]
How can no one see these things?
You fake, you were meant to fall
How can no one see these things?
You fake, you were meant to fall down
How can no, how can no one?
You fake, you were meant to fall down
And now the record went gold
But not an ounce of sincerity was achieved

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
I know how you function I know how you function
There will be an end to your profit, your possession
How did it all become, become published?
How can no one see,  see these things?

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
Stop, restart, stop, restart
