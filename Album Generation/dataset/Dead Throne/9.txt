[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
In this grave hour, I have composed our final song:
The last words of our love lost, of our love lost
I called your hands home for years
For years, for years, for years on end
It’s become distant and I hate my helpless defiance, no
You have no problem finding me
Although you only commit unintentionally, unintentionally
I do it for the Lord
I do it for Chicago
I once lived for you and I’ve never, ever been
So wrong, wrong, wrong, so wrong, wrong, wrong
We keep building, building to find no release
