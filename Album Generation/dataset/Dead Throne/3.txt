[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
You are a sickness, my only sincere plague
Is this what you’ve worked for?
Running your false empire to the ground
What is this substance that made your very own morals change?

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Jeremy McKinnon]
It’s gone a little too far to turn back now, turn back now
It’s gone a little too far to turn back
Always running I am the outcast
Keep running, keep running away

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
On to the next one, how can you have no shame?
Gone, gone is your reason
Think of from where you came, where you came
God as my witness, there will be no love lost

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
This is my vengeance, from here on out it’s no regrets
You are my sickness, I gave it all my very best
This is my vengeance, from here on out it’s no regrets
You are my sickness, I gave it all my very best, my very best

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Jeremy McKinnon]
It’s gone a little too far to turn back now, turn back now
It’s gone a little too far to turn back
Always running I am the outcast
It’s gone a little too far to turn back now, It’s gone a little too far, turn back now
It’s gone a little too far to turn back
Always running I am the outcast
Keep running, keep running away

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
On to the next one, driven by what you gain

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Broken honor, you came and you went

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
We’re just another crack in the wall
Here with no love lost, no love lost
