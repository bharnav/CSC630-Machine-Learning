[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Turn your back now, lose yourself in hesitation
Dancing, dancing, always dancing, and staring at the floor
The sun came out just long enough to go down

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
She shows the symptoms of being my suicide

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
I’m holding you to blame for this
I won’t stop selling myself short
The broken windows, all of the glass
Knife in my hand, the questions I’ve asked
I dream about her more nights than not
I can’t drown this away, I can’t drown this away

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
With every single move that you make
You come closer to breaking me
With every single breath that I take
You push further from helping me, but you can’t, you can’t
I’m pulling the weight again
With every single move that you make
I come closer to ending me

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
I blame myself, and it’s not the first time
You see me for what I am, damaged
Turn your back now
I will bask in the blackness of my darkest days

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
With every single move that you make
You come closer to breaking me
With every single breath that I take
You push further from helping me
But you can’t, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t
I’m pulling the weight again
With every single move that you make
I come closer to ending me
Self-loathing me
