[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
I won’t let this ruin me

[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
My orchestra, my indecision: It all comes back full circle
From grace to all my hate
I never meant to hurt anyone (anyone)
I came for peace, and for great reason
There is no solace, there’s no alleviation
In all our money, or within her golden teeth

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Is this it? Is this how it goes?
I am the wretched one, I am the beggar’s hands
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but feel nothing

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
Pick it up... Oh...

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Such a bitter friend, change can be
Remind me God, refresh what’s turned to grey
Oh my intentions, you vanish with the wind

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Is this it? Is this how it goes?
I am the wretched one, I am the harlot’s bones
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but care no more

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Is this it, is this how it goes?
It all comes back full circle
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but feel nothing

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
All that you know
I am all that you know
He had a vision as to what comes next
So disregard this unholy place
