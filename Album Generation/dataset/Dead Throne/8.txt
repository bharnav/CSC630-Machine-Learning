[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Still broken, I can’t see anything but you
I don’t even know if I want to
I’ve been so wrong in this

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster]
What does this mean? Where did it go?
All is best, all is lost
What does this mean? Where did it go?
All is best, all is lost, all is gone

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Forever in ruin, I can’t just disappear
Forever in ruin, I can’t let go
Forever in ruin, forever decay
I can’t see anything but you, I can’t let this go

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
Still searching, I might be missing you for years, for years
Every month feels like a lifetime

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
When will this pass?
Goodnight, farewell, I’m nearly done with this day
Goodnight, farewell, our grace has met its end

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Forever in ruin, forever decay
She fell in love with the city, and since then I don’t mean anything
She fell in love with the city, and since then I don’t mean anything
Forever in ruin, forever decay
Forever in ruin, forever decay

[Verse 4: Mike Hranica]
I’ve been so wrong in this
What does this mean? What does this mean?
Where did it go? Where did it go?
All is best, all is lost

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster]
What does this mean? Where did it go?
All is best, all is lost, all is gone

[Verse 5: Mike Hranica]
Forever in ruin, I can’t just disappear
Forever in ruin, I can’t let go
Forever in ruin, forever decay
I can’t see anything but you
