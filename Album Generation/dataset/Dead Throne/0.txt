[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
What you hold dear is a false account
What you hold dear offers no salvation, salvation
Trust in that I’m not right for this, for this
Know that I’m not the one to hold you up, hold you up
I can’t hold you, I can’t hold you

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Dead throne, dead throne
We’ve put the world up onto a dead throne
Dead throne, dead throne
We’ve put the world up onto a dead throne

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
She will slip, slip away
You will see your downfall

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Dead throne, dead throne
We’ve put the world up onto a dead throne
Dead throne
We’ve put the world onto a dead throne

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
I am guilty, I have fallen
There are things that have come between you and me
I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry
Let all be put to shame who serve carved images

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
We’ve put the world on a dead throne
We’ve put the world on a dead throne
