[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
What has exhaustion brought me?
Unvisited, but still too busy to close my eyes, to close my eyes
Maybe one day I’ll grasp the pattern
Maybe in time this will all be readable
Maybe in time, time

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with constance, I found no sleep

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can’t remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing but wished away, but wished away
I can’t remember what it is to be content

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Show me the exit: Let the signals fade
Maybe one day I’ll defeat the cycle
Maybe, maybe in time, in time I’ll be able to define this
This wretched purgatory, purgatory

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with constance, I found no sleep

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can’t remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing, these thoughts are nothing
But wished away, but wished away
I can’t remember what it is to be content
This is bound to fail, this is bound to fail

[Verse 3: Tim Lambesis]
The enemy will not resist, deceived until the end
I hate this persistence, my eyes may never close
I hate this persistence, my eyes may never close
