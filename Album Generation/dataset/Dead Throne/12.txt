[Intro: Mike Hranica]
We will not be forgotten
Holdfast, holdfast

[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
I will never subject myself to the flames
You are a demon to me, your power is but a fraction of me
But a fraction of me
And with that I, I make progress, within each step I move

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Save me, for the waters have come up to my neck
Come up to my neck, we will not be forgotten
Glory to the patient and to those who have hope
To those who have hope, we will not be forgotten

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Studying photos and deleting pictures
With bleeding clouds ahead we pray for boldness
We pray for boldness, we pray for undying grace

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Save me, for the waters have come up to my neck
Come up to my neck, we will not be forgotten
Glory to the patient and to those who have hope
To those who have hope,  we will not be forgotten

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
I donâ€™t plan on going anywhere without you
Holdfast, holdfast, holdfast
My body was meant to rot,but these words will never pass
Bless the Lord, oh my soul, for these words will never pass

[Outro: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Save me, save me, save me, we will not be forgotten
Save me, we will not be forgotten, holdfast, holdfast
Save me, we will not be forgotten, we will not be forgotten
Save me, we will not be forgotten, holdfast
