[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Something has got to give, yeah
When did I start choking?
When did I start drowning?
Is this what’s to become?
All thoughts left to wait
Is this what’s to become? Is this...

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
My questions, my questions
Unanswered, unanswered
I wish, I wish this would break
I wish this would break

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
What am I doing here? These waters extend for miles. Oh....
My heart remains the same, yeah
Will I ever, ever stop choking?
Will I ever, ever stop drowning?
Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot
I should not have put that on you
Leave my body at the river, let me pass along downstream, oh
Is this what’s to become?

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
My questions, my questions
Unanswered, unanswered
I wish, I wish this would break
I wish this would break
My questions, unanswered
I wish this would break
I wish this would break
I wish this would break

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
I breathe in your shadows and sleep in your disinterest
I breathe in your shadows and sleep in your disinterest

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
Let the tears fall, let me write some sad songs
That You don’t deserve, that You don’t deserve
Let the tears fall
Will I ever, ever stop choking?
Will I ever, ever stop drowning?
