[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Back for the fourth time around and still meaning every word
Never more honest, always too tired
Drowning in the pages I’ve planned:
Provoke, destroy. Provoke, destroy
I could be the lost cause, for I am dead poetry
In this reflection, we are perfect disorder

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Bring back balance, bring restoration
I saw the waves again, I felt the impact
I saw the waves again, I watched the current sway us
Bring back balance, bring restoration

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Lost in the clouds and my heart is sleeping
Within the tide, although my eyes are dying

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Back for the fourth time around and still meaning every word, every word
Never more blatant, always too thoughtful
If I could change things, I’d change myself

[Bridge: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
Time to be joyful in no consistency
Faith can be our only regularity
Time to be joyful in no monotony
There are no final goodbyes, this is our certainty

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Bring back balance, bring restoration
I saw the waves again,  I felt the impact
I saw the waves again, I watched the current sway us
Bring back balance, bring restoration

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
And just like that my life ceased to be

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
If I could change things, I’d change myself:
Sunk to the bottom of a deaf, lifeless world
