[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Blessed be those who have no idols
Invoke holy honor, sanctify the patient
I don't see the world the same
I'm no one's hero, so just forget my name

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
I abhor you with every foolish thing that you say
None of it is worth the time, another meaningless war

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster]
You don't know what you need
We're all so back and forth
Nothing is as it seems
You don't know what you need
We make the same mistakes
We've ruined everything

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
What is it this time?
What must you call holy?
This is your lifeline
Nothing is as it seems
If I were you I'd give it up
I'd give it up, I'd give it up
If I were you I'd care
I'm born to lose
With a noose around my neck
World be damned and move forward

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
I abhor you with every selfish thing that you say
None of it is the worth the time

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster]
You don't know what you need
We're all so back and forth
Nothing is as it seems
You don't know what you need
We make the same mistakes
We've ruined everything

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
Born to lose, born to lose
Born to lose
With a noose around my neck
