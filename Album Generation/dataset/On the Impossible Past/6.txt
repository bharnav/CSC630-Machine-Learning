[Verse 1]
I remember, when you came around
I was younger
Burning statues to the ground
Now I'm older and tired
I no longer see the differences

[Verse 2]
I remember the taste of the fruit
Disremember all we knew
Said we wanted to be interesting
Then we fell asleep

[Chorus]
These days you'll find me where the nectar's plenty
Looks are cheap and the talk is heavy
Where liars lie to themselves
Liars lie to themselves

I remember

[Verse 3]
You said, "Sometimes I need you around"
And you said that my conveniences are so convenient
You said you wanted to be interesting
Then you fell asleep

[Chorus]
These days you'll find me where the nectar's plenty
Looks are cheap and the talk is heavy
Liars lie to themselves
Liars lie to themselves

[Outro]
Walk home single, seeing double (x4)
