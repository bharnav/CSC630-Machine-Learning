[Verse 1]
"A moving aria for a vanished style of mind"
"A noble debut, tackling vertiginous demands"
"Has absence ever sounded so eloquent, so sad? I doubt it"

[Refrain]
With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nails

[Verse 2]
"Touching the shattered lives it unearths"
"A nocturne filled with glorious ideas"
"A chilling exploration of erotic consumption"

[Refrain]
With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nails

[Bridge]
Cossacks are charging in
Charging into fields of white roses
Cossacks are charging in
Charging into fields of white roses
"That's a nice suit"
"That's a swanky suit"
"Been a pope like no other"
"I'm looking for a good cowboy"

[Verse 3]
"A rare outcry makes you lead a larger life"
"You could easily picture this in the current top ten"
"Medieval savagery, calculated cruelty"
It's hard to pick the worst moment
It's hard to pick the worst moment

[Refrain]
With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nails
