[Refrain]
(Pow! Pow!)
(Pow! Pow!)

[Verse 1]
Nose holes caked in black cocaine (Pow! Pow!)
No one holds a match to your skin (Pow! Pow!)
No dupe, no chiming, a way off miles off
No needle through a glove

[Refrain]
(Pow! Pow!)

[Chorus]
Famine is a tall, tall tower
A building left in the night
Jesse, are you listening?
It casts its ruins in shadows
Under Memphis moonlight
Jesse are you listening?

[Refrain]
(Pow! Pow!)
(Pow! Pow!)

[Verse 2]
Six feet of foetus flung at sparrows in the sky
Put yourself in my shoes
A kiss, wet, muzzle, a clouded eye
No stars to flush it out

[Chorus]
Famine is a tall, tall tower
A building left in the night
Jesse, are you listening?
It casts its ruins in shadows
Under Memphis moonlight
Jesse, are you listening?

[Refrain]
(Pow! Pow!)
(Pow! Pow!)

[Verse 3]
In the dream I am crawling around on my hands and knees
Smoothing out the prairie
All the dents and the gouges and the winds dying down
I lower my head, press my ear to the prairie

[Outro]
Alive
I'm the only one left alive
I'm the only one left alive
I'm the only one left alive
Alive
I'm the only one left alive
I'm the only one left alive
I'm the only one left alive
