[Verse 1]
The car in front follows the long way around
Prey moves, predator moves
Foreshortened angels hunting me down
Halle, halle, halle
Underkill
Sticks in gutters
Overkill is personal
Too many bullets

[Verse 2]
Rabbi crater keyed for action hits the marks
I wish I was in Dixie
Sleet switches silence to the shredding of larks
Serifot
Combs of honey
Kellipot, saliva's coating
Balls of money

[Bridge]
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
World about to end
World about to end
World about to end

[Verse 3]
Windblown hair in a windowless room
A lifeline of knuckles
Waddles into the afternoon
Look into its eyes
It will look into your eyes

[Outro]
What's up, Doc?
What's up, Doc?
What's up, Doc?
What's up, Doc?
What's up, Doc?
What's up, Doc?
