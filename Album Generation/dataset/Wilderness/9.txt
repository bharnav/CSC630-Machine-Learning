Silly games
New relations
Ain't it funny how
These things occur
Communication without any sound
I can't explain what I can't comprehend
All I know is nothing's stranger than
Nothing's stranger than love is
Love is holding you and other things
My feeble mind will never seem to understand
Crazy kids
Launching arrows
With their tiny bows
If you're hit, best surrender
Take it as it goes
I can't explain what I can't comprehend
All I know is nothing's stranger than
Nothing's stranger than love is
Love is holding you and other things
My feeble mind will never seem to understand
You never know
You never know what's there to be found
No, you never know
You never know what's waiting around
You could have a heart of stone
A heart of stone will crack like an egg
And put you on your knees where you'll beg
Hope and pray to God that it never ends
Never ends...
Love is...
Love is...
Love is...
Love is...
Love is...
Holding you
Love is...
And other things
Love is...
Holding you
Love is...
And other things
Love is...
Holding you
Love is...
And other things
Love is...
Holding you
Love is...
And other things
Love is...
Holding you
