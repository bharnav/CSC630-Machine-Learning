[Verse 1]
Give a little bit of your love to me
Put it right there on my cheek
Give a little bit of your love to me
That’s all I really need

You could save me, keep me from harm
I’ll be your baby, take me in your arms

Oh oh ohhh

[Chorus]
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts

[Verse 2]
Give a little bit of your love to me
Gimme something I can keep
Give a little bit of your love to me
We got possibilities

If you need me, I will run
And completely, thy will be done

Oh oh ohhh

[Chorus]
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts
That’s how (uh-huh) it starts

[Bridge]
When I discovered the wonder of
The path was easier to see
There ain’t no other but the one I love
Won’t you come deliver me?

Oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh

Give a little bit of your love to me
Give a little bit of your love to me
Give a little bit of your love to me
