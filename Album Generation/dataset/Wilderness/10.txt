So you've turned around and found
That nothing is the same
Don't be afraid
Because the winds of change
Have blown you to another page
Or so they say

Chapter two begins with you
Wishing for the life you have no more
The only thing that you receive
Is an old familiar melody you've heard
Before

Yours to keep
Yours to keep

Now you wonder why you're here
And how you could deserve
Such a fate
But the only thing that's clear
Are the memories you found
Along the way

Chapter three, you finally see
That something good can come from anything
Then you recall a time when all your love
Was safely tucked beneath her wing

Yours to keep
Yours to keep

And so it goes:
The life you've known
Is the only one you'll ever know

Yours to keep
Yours to keep

Yours to keep
Yours to keep
