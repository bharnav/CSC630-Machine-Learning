Tell me what you want to hear
Does it really matter, dear?
Change my ways to suit your rules
That don't seem to comfort you

What do you expect of me?
Always been a mystery
When nothing's given in return
How do you suggest I learn?

This is just another one
Aimed right at your heart
This is just another one
Bound to miss the mark

Can't see past the history
Happens and it just repeats
Always time and time again
Now we're back where we began

So tell me what you want to hear
And does it really matter, dear?
Wish I knew how to get through
Lovin' you don't seem to do

This is just another one
Aimed right at your heart
This is just another one
Bound to miss the mark

This is just another one
Aimed right at your heart
This is just another one
Bound to miss the mark

This is just another one
This is just another one
This is just another one
