I was born screaming
And then I hit the ground
Like a wild demon
I never settled down
Then I got mine
Just like my old man got his
K-I-D-S Kids

They were born screaming
They had fire in their eyes
Just like wild demons
No it came as no surprise
So now I found
Just how sweet that mischief is
K-I-D-S Kids

I was born screaming
I was born screaming
We were born screaming
Yeah we were born screaming
