Say hello to the children born today
You and I know they'll soon be on their way
To live a life and see what they may see
What kind of people do you think that they will be?
Say so long to the ones who've passed away
You and I know that nature has her ways
Were they happy and were their hearts content?
I hope they felt like their time here was well spent
Is this the beginning
Or is this the End?
Are you happy?
Is your heart content?
