See the weatherman scratch his head
See the animals on the run
See computers try to calculate
The damage that we have done
See the scientists try to figure out
If we can over come

Big Mama's gonna whip us good
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
(Oh no, Oh no, Oh no)
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
(Oh no, Oh no, Oh no)
Cause we never, ever, never, ever do
What we should

I was tryin' to do my part
I built a house out of aluminum cans
That crazy lady came and tore it down
I guess she didn't really understand
Now my bed is just a pile of leaves
And my home is just a piece of land

Big Mama's gonna whip us good
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
(Oh no, Oh no, Oh no)
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
Big Mama's gonna whip us good
(Oh no, Oh no, Oh no)
Cause we never, ever, never, ever do
What we should
