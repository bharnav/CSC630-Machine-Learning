Cover your head
Waiting for a big one to fall
You can hide all you like
Doesn't really matter at all

When you offer up your heart
Well you're bound to lose your mind

Stand in the way
Heart on display. What a sight!
Laugh all you want
Ain't funny long when you find
Bombs are never taken too easy
Fear is never too far away
Still you never tend to run out of reasons
So you

Offer up your heart
Well you're bound to lose your mind
And another one falls
And another one falls
Then another one

Offer up your heart
Well you're bound to lose your mind
