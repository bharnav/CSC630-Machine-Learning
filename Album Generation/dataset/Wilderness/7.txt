I took you down to a river side
With a picnic basket and a box of wine
You said, "My love, this ain't no fun
Treat me like a lady, not a simpleton."

Well I tried, I tried
To keep you satisfied
Give my heart, but you don't seem to care
Some day you may find
A rich man who will buy
A golden comb to tame your wild hair

Went to town
And I thought we might
Have a quiet stroll under street lights
You said, "My love, this ain't no good
You're as romantic as a knot on wood."

Well I tried, and I tried
To keep you satisfied
Give my heart, but you don't seem to care
Some day you may find
A rich man who will buy
A golden comb to tame your wild hair

Keep your ribbons tied
Straighten up your bows

Keep your head held high
Powder on your nose

Well I tried, and I tried
To keep you satisfied
Give my heart, but you don't seem to care
Some day you may find
A rich man who will buy
A golden comb to tame your wild hair
A golden comb to tame your wild hair!
