Never give you any reason
Never give you any right
Found it hard to believe in
Found it hard to rely

The past always seems
To be the only thing
That never really goes away

I'll be waiting on the inside
I'll be calling out your name
Keep your love to the outside
Keep it tied to the blame

Here it comes again
Now turns to then
It never really goes away

The past always seems
To be the only thing
That never really goes away
To stay
