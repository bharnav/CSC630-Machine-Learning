Yeah, you can clap your hands if you want to

What's in your eyes 'cause they talk to me
They know how to read my mind
I get this feeling when you're next to me
It's like joy and summertime

I wanna be your favorite song
That will only bring you joy
But now that I never see you
I can only wish for more

At the end of the day
I'll, I'll keep writing you
Should I stop by and say "Hi"
Or just keep riding straight?

I wanna be your hero
And everyone else knows
That you mean the world to me
So let love unlock the door

Oh, ooh, come on, baby
Let's move in together
Just you and me, baby
That's all we got, I like it, I like it
Matter fact, I love it

Without you there will be no light
Light for me to see
I do believe I'm the best for you
Holding onto me

You see, this love just keeps getting sweeter
Year after year
You know you're something like a miracle
Always knew you would appear

[Interlude]
Oh, you got me smiling, girl
Don't you wanna dance? Don't you?
Come on, hold my hand, baby
Keep on movin', move it just like that
Oh yeah, move it like that
Don't you ever go away
Please don't go
Not you, no, not you

Please don't go, don't you ever go away
Walk with me baby
Take off your dancing shoes, babe
I need you, I need you to stay
This is what Mr. Leon Ware would say
Make love in the dark, love in the sun
Love watching the moon, love every day
Hey, don't you go away
Please, I want you to stay

Just take off your clothes, relax a little
Hold me and please me
I got your back, baby, don't you go away
Please don't go away, 'cause I'm here to stay
