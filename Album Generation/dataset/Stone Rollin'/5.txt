Have you ever wanted to
Buy someone you love somethin'
But you couldn't afford it?
But you just bought it anyway
You know how that go

Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh

When the price ain't right
And everythin' ain't lookin' right
But you still want it all, uh huh
This line is long but still I ponder
This here check won't last 'til October
But nothin' more special than bringin' my gifts to you

Oh, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh

When the sun comes out I find myself
Spendin' money on foolish necessities, mmm hmm
This woman I got is worth a lot
But man she sure hits the spot
Nothin' more special than bringin' them gifts to you

I'm livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh

Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, yes, I am
Livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, like I said

When the sun comes out I find myself
Spendin' money on foolish necessities, uh huh
See uh, this woman I got is worth a lot
But man she sure hits the spot
Nothin' more special than bringin' them gifts to you

Yeah, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
I'm livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
With bad credit and all, baby

I'm livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
Even if I have to take it back next month
I'm living on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
Even if I have to borrow from my other girlfriend

I'm living on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
Just for you, it makes me feel good
Whenever I buy somethin' 'specially for you
It makes me feel good, yes, it does

I'm livin' on daydreams
Yes, I am, livin' on daydreams
It's like the sunshine
Makes me feel good, alright
