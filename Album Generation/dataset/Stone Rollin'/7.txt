[Verse 1]
Walking down the street
I saw a random picture of your face
Trying to get you out of my mind
But you won't go away

The eyes that cried days and nights too
You were there for me, what a fool
I overlooked you
And you were always there for me
I was there for you

Time can't buy respect
Hurting you was such a big regret
And now I'm on this miracle mile
Everything I touch runs wild

I spend my last to make you first again
Guess I can see the trees again
The grass is never greener
Tell me why I didn't think about this before now
Cause my baby's gone

[Chorus]
Just don't know what to do about you
All broke up over you
I Just don't, I just don't
Just don't know what to do about you
All broke up over you
I just don't, I just don't
Just don't know what to do about you
All broke up over you

[Verse 2]
Shelly moved away to Jackson, Mississippi
Where the grass is green and so pretty
She found her a preacher man
Cause that's all she ever wanted

Life at home was very hard
Yes, I sent a million cards
Life without her there
This can't be true, no, this isn't fair

Walking down the street, calling your name
People think I'm going insane
This is just a terrible dream
And my mind can do without it

I drown myself in whiskey, grass and beer
Love, I was wishing you were here
But here's a toast to you
And your new found friend
I'm gonna be missing you

I just don't, I just don't
Cause my baby's gone

[Chorus]
Just don't know what to do about you
All broke up over you
I just don't, I just don't
I just don't know what to do about you
I'm all broke up over you

I just don't, I just don't
I just don't know what to do about you
All broke up over you
I just don't, I just don't

[Vamp]
I tell you all my secrets, everything I dreamed of
It will be the loneliest, but you know beyond it's true
I'll always be your lover, for me there is no other
You made me wanna go back to you
You better try to taste

I tell you all my secrets, everything I dreamed of
It will be the loneliest, but you know beyond it's true
I'll always be your lover, for me there is no other
You made me wanna go back to you
You better try to taste

[Instrumental breakdown and fade out]
