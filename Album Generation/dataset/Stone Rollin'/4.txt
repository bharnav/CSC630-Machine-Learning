Listen
Fat lady shakin', backbone breakin', come on
(This girl of mine)
Everything she's got is movin' hot, come on
(This girl of mine)
I was just a friend but she took me in, said, come on
(This girl of mine)
Everything was right, I felt like the lights had come on
(This girl of mine)

She said, you make a blind man walk away from home
You'll tell your girlfriend you wanna be alone
It makes an old man throw away his cane
Girl, what your booty doin', I just can't explain

Listen, you don't call her fat, that girl is stacked, come on
(She's got my mind)
Everything is wide and she walk with much pride, come on
(She's got my mind)
Top chef and cook with grandma's looks, now come on
(She's got my mind)
There was no way to prepare
Nothing I could see
All I saw was a woman (She's got my mind)
Walking up to me

Now say big booty woman, turn me loose
I need to go home, I can't stand your moves
You see your high heels are killing me
It's like your Ballantynes are shaking me, oh yeah

I'm your lover man, and I won't let go
I wanna stay with you, you can lock the door
Booty's so fat, so fat to me
I'm gonna squeeze it, darling, endlessly

Hey big booty woman, turn me loose
I need to go home, I can't stand your moves
You see your high heels are killing me
It's like them Ballantynes are shaking me
