Here's the situation, yes, the devil knows me well
See I'm trying to do my best not to go to hell
I'm counting all my blessings as I walk the narrow road
Victory is near, that's what I've been told

I can feel it getting closer, closer everyday
I wanna be a warrior of everything I say
There's trials in the valley, take me upstream
I need to feel this water rolling down over me
Rolling down over me

I can see my name written across the sky
Ravens started flying, I saw tears in their eyes
There was fires in the mountains and storms in the sea
Winds in the valley, rushing into me

Knock and it will open, seek and you'll be fine
You're just a flower and the seed is your mind
Clouds will bring us water and the sun will bring us heat
But we have the power moving from sea to sea
Moving from sea to sea

Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together
Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together

Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together
Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together

Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together
Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together
