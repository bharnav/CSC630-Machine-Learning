[Verse 1:]
Boat-rocking trouble maker
Non-conforming shit starter
With the rebel DNA, the pirate spirit
Headache

[Chorus:]
It took me all my life
To finally figure out
That I'm not in the mood
To be anything like you
And maybe it's alright
And maybe not
I'll conduct my choir
I'll figure it out

[Verse 2:]
Truth seeker, big bullshit detector
The point is made, not well received
Plastic flowers, whatever
Behave

[Chorus:]
It took me all my life
To finally figure out
That I'm not in the mood
To be anything like you
And maybe it's alright
And maybe not
I'll conduct my choir
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out

[Bridge:]
And I, you know I tell the truth
Even if you, you wanna shut your mind
And I, I'm so alive
Well, I'll just stick with my own kind
Hey!

[Chorus:]
It took me all my life
To finally figure out
That I'm not in the mood
To be anything like you
And maybe it's alright
And maybe not
I'll conduct my choir
I'll figure it out

[Outro:]
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
