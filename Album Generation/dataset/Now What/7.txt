Can you bring me another?
I’m not there yet
Do I seem to remember?
How much 'til I forget?

Oh, I can’t get high enough, loud enough, nice enough

Can you hear me now?
'Cause I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again
Oh, why, ooh, does what I’ve done
Take so much to disappear?

Can I, ooh, can I stand up?
Help me from this chair
I was the life of the party
Or so you tell me

Oh, I can’t get high enough, loud enough, nice enough

Can you hear me now?
'Cause I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again
Oh, why, ooh, does what I’ve done
Take so much to disappear?

Can you hear me now?
'Cause I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again

Can you hear me now?
No, I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again

Can you hear me now?
No, I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again

Can you hear me now?
No, I’m not doing fine
I’m drowning in my mind again
