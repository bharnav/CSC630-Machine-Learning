[Intro:]
Sing it right
1 - 2 - 3 - 4

[Verse 1:]
And as the raven flies, she feels unwelcome
She's fallen out of her tree, caught on a limb with silver lining
Her wings uncertain, ooh but she's still flying
Yeah little Raven, I see you there

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hold your head up now
I won't try to pull your feathers
Out, I promise

[Chorus:]
Go on dry your eyes
You know that I've forgiven you
And I'm sorry
And everything 'til now
Wasn't that bad really
Beautiful lady

[Verse 2:]
Why don't you fly with me
We'll have a chat and a cup of tea
And a long lost need to see who's really there

And you'll finally be okay with me
And I'll hear your stories
That fill your sad eyes
When you had raven hair

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hold your head up high
I know that I've been ruthless
I've been ruthless

[Chorus:]
Go on dry your eyes
You know that I've forgiven you
And I'm sorry
And everything 'til now
It wasn't that bad really
Beautiful lady

[Bridge:]
Go on dry your eyes
Hey you finally see me - hi
And I see you

[Chorus:]
And everything 'til now
It wasn't that bad really
Beautiful lady

[Chorus:]
Go on dry your eyes
You know that I've forgiven you
Yeah, and I'm sorry
And everything 'til now
Wasn't that bad really
Beautiful lady

[Outro:]
And I think I love you...
