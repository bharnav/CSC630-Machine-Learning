There’s so much to offer, so much to throw away
The ever-present darker side, it's making you color blind
But luckily, my blinded one, I know you and not what you’ve done
Not what you’ve done
Ooh, you beautiful soul

When you go, a feeling that chokes
When you go, a fever that soaks
When you go, you go away
Into the unknown
When you go, you break my heart
Don’t you go, 'cause it chokes
It chokes

Given all you are inside, a shaft of light that you can’t hide
But an idle mind will dominate and feed all the demons steak
When you walk around that old street, where you lived and who you were then
You can have it again
Ooh, everything’s not broke

When you go, a feeling that chokes
When you go, a fever that soaks
When you go, you go away
Oh, into the unknown
When you go, you break my heart
Don’t you go, 'cause it chokes
It chokes

When you go, a feeling that chokes
When you go, a fever that soaks
When you go, you go away
Into the unknown
When you go, you break my heart
Don’t you go, 'cause it chokes
It chokes

When you go, you break my heart
Don't you go, you'll break my heart
When you go, you go away
Into the unknown
When you go, you break my heart
Don't you go, you'll break my heart
When you go, you go away

When you go, you break my heart
Don't you go, yeah, 'cause it chokes
It chokes
