[Verse 1:]
One day
On one tombstone
All our names should go
We shared a life

The beauty
And the ugliness
Through all the pain and death
The birth of a child

[Chorus:]
Thanks for throwing me the line when I've lost sight of it
You’re the only reason I can exhale
Now suddenly when I find that the outcome's just not right from what I just did
You’re the only thing I can breathe through

[Verse 2:]
Hear, my sweet friends
A few lines of poetry
It may be laughable
But thanks for laughing with me

And here’s to the next time
I wrap myself around a tree
I know that you’ll be there with bells on
Yeah, to pull me off

[Chorus:]
Thanks for throwing me the line when I've lost sight of it
You’re the only reason I can exhale
And now suddenly when I find that the outcome's just not right from what I just did
You’re the only thing I can breathe through

[Bridge:]
And you can tell me a story I’ve heard before
I’ll insult your mother
Then you can tell me where to go

[Chorus:]
Thanks for throwing me the line when I've lost sight of it
You’re the only reason I can exhale
And now suddenly when I find that the outcome's just not right from what I just did
You’re the only thing I can breathe through

[Chorus - Repeated:]
Thanks for throwing me the line when I've lost sight of it
Oh, you’re the only reason I can exhale
And now suddenly when I find that the outcome's just not right from what I just did
You’re the only thing I can breathe through

[Outro:]
Oh, you're the only reason I can exhale
