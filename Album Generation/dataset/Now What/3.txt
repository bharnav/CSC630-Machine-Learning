Unidentified flying object in space
If I were identified, you couldn’t make me erase
You never understood me, and I’d have to applaud
It’s lonely out here alone, but I can’t be what I’m not

You can be all the writing on the wall
That you want
I’ll be the line across it
But I’ll blow your mind
I’ll blow your mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)

Ooh, yeah, yeah yeah
Ooh

Ooh, and all the others can shine
Oh, but not like I can shine
You could have set me free if you’d eased up on the line
It’s supposed to be quiet, but it’s loud in this sky
I’ll take care of the vultures with a glass of wine

You can be all the writing on the wall
That you want
I’ll be the line across it
But I’ll blow your mind
I’ll blow your mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)

Ooh, yeah, yeah yeah
Ooh, ooh

You can be all the writing on the wall
That you want
(You can be all that you want)
I’ll be the line across it
But I’ll blow your mind
(Ooh, I'll blow your mind)
I’ll blow your mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah)

Ooh, yeah, yeah yeah
Ooh, ooh
