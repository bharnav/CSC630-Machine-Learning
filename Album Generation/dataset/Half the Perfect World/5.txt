You got a lot of tenderness
And so much love, you can get no rest
If you're willing
To waste a little time

I don't want all of it
All I need is a little bit

You got a lot of money saved
No use takin' it all to your grave
Ain't worth nothin'
If you ain't feelin' fine

I don't want all of it
All I need is a little bit

You know daddy gave you everything
On a silver platter
But the one thing he never gave you
Was the one thing that really matters

So if you feel unsatisfied
Somethin' missin' deep down inside
You had so many lovers
But you never really tried

I don't want all of it
All I need is a little bit

I'm tellin' you now it's gettin' dark
It's gettin' late
Now that we all need someone
To sit down and set us free

You got gold to give and time to pray
You think livin' right is livin' your way
But there's heaven down here, baby
We can find it if we try

I don't want all of it
All I need is a little bit
I don't want all of it
All I need is a little bit
