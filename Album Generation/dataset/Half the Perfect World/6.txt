From bad luck, I'm walkin' away
I'm not gettin' stuck, I'm not gonna stay
To good things, I'm movin' ahead
I'm tired of dyin' an' I'm livin' instead

Once in a while I'll wake up
Wonderin' why we gave up?
But once in a while
Comes and it fades away

The sun's up and lightin' the sky
I never could see it, it just passed me by
Good things keep movin' along
I'm not lookin' backward for something that's gone

Once in a while I'll wake up
Wonderin' why we gave up?
But once in a while
Comes and fades away

I don't know what love is? I'm selfish and lazy
And when I get scared, I can act like I'm crazy
When I think of your kisses, I'm still gonna smile
I'm still gonna miss you once in a while

Once in a while I'll wake up
Wonderin' why we gave up?
But once in a while
Comes and it fades away

Good things keep movin' ahead
I'm tired of dyin', I'm livin' instead
