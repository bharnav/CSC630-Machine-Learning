Handicap yourself by choice
And keep the mind confined to the chair with no voice
So speak up (you move your lips too slow)
And make way to the center stage
And pretty up that face, cause your servants await
(It's time to play your role)
So sing and dance just the way we like it!

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
Gonna suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

A coward dies a thousand times
Death before dishonor, cross the thin red line
So stay alive, (No other place to go)
Silence the facts, dillusions are quoted
Clench the fist in truth and shove it down your throats
(Don't act like you don't know)
I'm on the broadpath walkin the tightrope

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
Gonna suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

Mistakes & Glories!
There in the ground where they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
They answer the call and some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live

You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for.....us!

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
Gotta suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

Mistakes & Glories!
There in the ground where they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
They answer the call and some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live
Mistakes & Glories!
There in the ground where they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
They answer the call and some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live
