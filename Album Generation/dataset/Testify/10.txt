Yo! Eternal rhythms in your system so clear
No negative, take your isms stay clear
We keep it lovely, give you want you won't hear (no you won't hear)
And Matisyahu in the house, stand clear
P.O.D. in the house, stand clear
If Jah is for me, tell me whom I gon' fear? (no I won't fear)
And Jah of Jacob, deserving of my love
And God of Isaac, reign blessings from above
Hashem of Abraham will show me the way
I go down on my knees and this is what I pray

[Matisyahu & Sonny Sandoval]
Strength Of My Life, whom shall I dread?
When them evildoers approach to devour my flesh
Even if there would be an army against me
My heart would not fear

[Matisyahu]
Steer clear from weird vibes
Chuck a spear these evil guys must realize
Even if there would rise a war against me
In this I trust, it's a must
Elevated is my head, above my enemy
Surround me with the song of glory
(Yeah, Song of glory, Yeah, ohhh)

[Sonny Sandoval]
Take away the scales from my eyes
Anoint your love upon my life
Have mercy on my soul and hear me when I cry
Do not abandon me, and don't forsake me
Leave me on the path of integrity

[Matisyahu & Sonny Sandoval]
Even if there would be an army against me
My heart would not fear
Strength Of My Life, whom shall I dread?
When them evildoers approach to devour my flesh
Back them up against the wall, stumble and fall them battle y'all
And stand tall, show me favor when I call Oh-oh
Back them against the wall, stumble and them fall
Battle y'all and stand tall, show me favor when I call

[Matisyahu]
Oh-oh-oh, yo, Matisyahu, P.O.D
Eternally, with his majesty
Dwelling in the songs of glory
Dwelling with the song of glory
