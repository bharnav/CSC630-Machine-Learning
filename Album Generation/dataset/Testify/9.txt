Imperial, Righteous respects, cause we ain't done yet

Lock it down, and overthrow all the pirates
And get out of town, can you see them smiling
Blisters, these bones are breaking
Whispers, are louder than screaming
And we suffer this moment until the day is coming
That we'll reign forever!

Training Day!
Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
Training Day!
We been through the fire cause we're pioneers
Training Day!
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Training Day!
Warriors, SoulJahs, we still believe you!

Crawling through poison Ivy
My soul still flies with broken wings
And the sun is blinding, I can't stop staring
I don't wanna close my eyes
Righteous respects, and it's the best kept secret
And I can let go of my burdens that keep me from living
So I can start dying

Training Day!
Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
Training Day!
We been through the fire cause we're pioneers
Training Day!
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Training Day!
Warriors, SoulJahs, we still believe you!

Warriors
Jah love for the bleeding
Jah SoulJahs
We still believe you

Crawling through poison Ivy
My soul still flies with broken wings
And the sun is blinding, I can't stop staring
I don't wanna close my eyes!

Training Day!
Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
Training Day!
We been through the fire cause we're the pioneers
Training Day!
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Training Day!
Warriors, SoulJahs, we still believe you!

Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
Cause I man is coming and we are the Teachers
