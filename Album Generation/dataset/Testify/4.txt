What you know about that
Fallin, Fallin Babylon!
The so called great. Dead weight
Dread 'bout to update the death rate in one take
Make no mistake we the real deala
The radical natural born wig-splitta
Gonna get cha with the style that make your soul holla
More drama, The on droppa the sure shotta
I rock it steady, be ready till the track is diminished
And when the dog goes belly up consider it finished

Sounds like it's war to me
Peace, Love, and casualties
Sound's like it's war to me, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like the war in me, yeah

We keep on movin like don't stop, let it go, soul to soul
Dread at the controls, tag em up and label em John Doe
The raw flow, rebuild the new style empire
Blazing required like that. Fourth man on fire
This guns for hire, take the vow of the Nazarenes
To come clean, Like crazy baldheads (knot I mean)
Wickedness fear the style of the deathblow
Carve the name across your chest
Incase the dogcatcher wants to know

Sounds like it's war to me
Peace, Love, and casualties
Sound's like it's war to me, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like the war in me, yeah

Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe
Dread at the, Dread at the
Dread at the controls, label em John Doe

Sounds like it's war to me
Peace, Love, and casualties
Sound's like it's war to me, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like the war in me, yeah

Sounds like it's war to me
Peace, Love, and casualties
Sound's like it's war to me, yeah
Whatever the case may be
This time it's got to be
Peace, Love, and Harmony, yeah
