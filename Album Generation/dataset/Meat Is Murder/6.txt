[Verse 1]
Well I wonder
"Do you hear me when you sleep?"
I hoarsely cry
(Why?)
Well I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half die
(Why?)

[Chorus]
Please keep me in mind
Please keep me in mind

[Verse 2]
Gasping - but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying - but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

[Chorus]
Please keep me in mind

[Outro]
And I wonder
And I wonder
Please keep me in mind
Ohhh keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
