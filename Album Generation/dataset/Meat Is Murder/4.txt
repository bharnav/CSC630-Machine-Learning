[Verse 1]
Park the car at the side of the road
You should know time's tide will smother you
And I will too

[Verse 2]
When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

[Chorus]
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

[Break]
Kick them when they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down

[Verse 3]
It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face after all

[Outro]
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
