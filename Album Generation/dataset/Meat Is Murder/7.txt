[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Outro]
A crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of who you are!
And a crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of what you are!

A crack on the head
Because of the things you said (things you said)
The things you did

[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand
