Theres a mountain of cars
A couple miles of garbage
God, will you look what we've started

All in a row
Our churches and bars
All in a row
Yeah, spotlights and stars
All our guns and daughters
Lined up all in a row

Take a look at these scars
Just take a look at us starving
God get us back to the garden

All in a row

Our churches and bars
All in a row
Yeah, spotlights and stars
All our guns and daughters
Lined up all in a row

Can you see it going?
Can't you feel it go?

And it's all in a row
Our churches and bars
Yeah our spotlights and stars
All our guns and daughters
Buried all in a row
