I've got some oil and some matches
You know I would do anything for you
Whether for light or for ashes
All of us burn for something

The greatest risk, the greatest wonder

Some of the time we are stolen
Most of us live our lives as thieves
So how could you know that I could be trusted?
How could you know that I just know that I won't leave?

Always waiting for someone to be sure
Always praying that we'll be ready for
The bravest wish, the going under
The greatest risk, the greatest wonder

You cannot give somebody joy
But you can find it by trying
You can't save someone from death
But you can love them while they're dying

Always waiting for someone to be sure
Always praying that we'll be ready for
I'm ready, I'm ready, so give me something pure
The bravest wish, the going under
The greatest risk, the greatest wonder
