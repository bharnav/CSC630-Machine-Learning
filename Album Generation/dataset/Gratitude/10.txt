She’s always sayin maybe we’ll never know
I can’t hear it for all my fears
I’m too busy prayin wishin for what I should
Do or say to get my way
Oh maybe well never know

We’re on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain [2]
Dream again

The windows shuttered the big day never comes
The gift is giving what comes with it
Celebrate the birth at any age
Eat up grow up shut up measure up

We’re on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain [2]
Dream again

We’re on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain

Dream again
