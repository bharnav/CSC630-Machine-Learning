Lately I'm ashamed to say I'm starving for it
But I want someone to love
And you may think you're to blame
But oh I'm so proud of you
And I want someone to love
Yeah I want somebody to love

Take it easy on yourself
Just know that you're enough
I just need to know that
I want somebody to love
Yeah I want somebody to love

The thought of it
Just all of it
We wanted it maybe too much
But better than
To never have tried and failed again
Oh I want somebody to love
Yeah I want somebody to love
Want somebody

Take it easy on yourself
Just know that you're enough
You'll find it
I want somebody to love
I want somebody
I want somebody to love
Yeah I want somebody to love
Want somebody to love

Lately I'm amazed
That I found someone to love
That I found someone too
Take it easy on yourself
Take it easy on yourself
Take it easy on yourself
Take it easy on yourself
Take it easy on yourself
