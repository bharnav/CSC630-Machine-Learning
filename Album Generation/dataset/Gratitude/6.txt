Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Send me your letters
Send me your letters
I'm willing to pretend

All I mean, is let it be
Got options, so look around
You're beautiful, so is she
So is he, so look around

I can't right now
But let's try to talk tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday

Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Send me your letters
Send me your letters
I'm willing to pretend
Yeah

Growing up, getting straight
Move forward, so look around
But what a mess, we've gotta make
To get there
Look around, around

I can't right now
But let's try to talk tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday

Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Send me your letters
Send me your letters
I'm willing to pretend

Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Send me your letters
Send me your letters
I'm willing to pretend

Sadie you want me
But what a mess we've gotta make
To be there, will you be there
In the end

Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Send me your letters
Send me your letters
I'm willing to pretend

Maybe we'd all better beware
Or end up here again
Sending our letters
Sending our letters
And willing to pretend

Sadie you want me to be there
Be there in the end
Sadie you want me, oh
Yeah I'm willing
Willing to pretend
Oh, Sadie
