When the lights go out
Do you think of death?
Do you make a sound?
Or do you hold your breath?

But tonight let's celebrate it
Love or hate it, it's ours
Tonight, let's overrate it
We really made it this far
Tonight

The places we don't know
Someone makes our clothes
Someone's counting sins
It gets under my skin

But tonight let's celebrate it
Love or hate it, it's ours
Tonight, let's overrate it
Yeah we really made it this far
Tonight

Oh tonight let's celebrate it
Love or hate it, it's ours
Tonight, let's overrate it
We really made it this far
Oh tonight
We really made it this far
This far, this far
Yeah we really made it this far
Tonight
