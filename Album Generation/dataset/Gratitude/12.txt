If you ever see her, lying hurt
Don't just stare
Please get up, get up, get up
Get up and help her
And then check her pulse
And give her air
And then listen and breathe
And keep checking and checking her heart

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
Don't drive away again

I could never say the things
That kept me up
Just lay there listening
To your whispering
Maybe you were supposed to help me
Learn to love you more
Help me to notice how we're
Different, different, different
All right, all right

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours in our days
Don't drive away
Don't drive away
Don't walk out on her again
Again

(Don't drive)
Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours in our days
Don't drive away
Don't drive away
Don't walk out on her again
Again, again, again

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours
Not enough hours in our days
Don't drive, don't drive, don't drive
Don't drive away
