I've built up this collection of
Souvenirs from years of missed connections
I'm giving it all away
So here's a ripped up picture and
Here's an unused ticket from the show, the play, the game
I'm giving it all away
This is the part

This is the part where we start to feel better
And stop shutting up
We're all running out of time, waiting in line

This is the part where yr friend got sent and
All the big war words stop making sense
And you wonder how the money ever got spent
And you wonder how that motherfucker ever got in
This is the part where you get to realize that
Whether yr dad died, yr boy or yr girl lied
There are families on the other side
It's a start, it's the same place for any and all hearts
This is the part

This is the part where we start to feel
