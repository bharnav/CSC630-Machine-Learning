Here we go again, beat and stuck up and spent and
Saving for rent on our blood red homes
Cos a dream with no color
Well why even bother

And we know that it won't last, but we force it and force it, and the
Time just proves too much
And we're wearing down, wearing down again

Should have been fall, with the memories of summer
The burn of the sun and the cold, oh, fall
You're a comfortable lover but I just can't take all the decay

It's okay if you don't show, but I want you do know you're invited
It's okay to feel the cold, but I want you to know that I'm inside
