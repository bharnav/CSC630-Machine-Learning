The knowledge that seeking the favour of another
Means the murder of self

This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away

Silence speeds the path to your streams
Of solace that run so few and narrow
Brooks that babble the sounds of torture
The sounds of torture
You will one day raise

To flood the banks of the chosen
This is the art of ruin

This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away
It bleeds all life away

Go!

I will show you all that I have mastered

Fear
Pain
Hatred
Power

This is the art of ruin
This is the art of ruin
This is the art of ruin
