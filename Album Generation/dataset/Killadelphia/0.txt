The Most Gracious
Teacher of the Al-Qur'an
Creator of the human beings
He taught them how to distinguish
The sun and the moon are perfectly calculated
The stars and the trees prostrate
He constructed the sky and established the law
You shall not transgress the law
You shall establish justice; do not violate the law
He created the earth for all creatures
In it there are fruits, and date palms with their hanging fruit
Also grains and the spices
(O humans and jinns,) which of your Lord's marvels can you deny?
He created the human from aged clay, like the potter's clay
And created the jinns from blazing fire
