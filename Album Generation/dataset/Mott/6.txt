[Verse 1]
I changed my name in search of fame
To find the Midas touch
Oh I wish I'd never wanted then
What I want now twice as much

[Verse 2]
We crossed the mighty oceans
And we had a few divides
But we never crossed emotion
For we felt too much inside

[Chorus]
You know all the tales we tell
You know the band so well
Still I feel
Somehow, we let you down
We went off somewhere on the way
And now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus
Is in town

[Verse 3]
Buffin lost his child-like dreams
And Mick lost his guitar
And Verden grew a line or two
And Overend's just a rock n' roll star

[Verse 4]
Behind these shades, the visions fade
As I learn a thing or two
Oh but if I had my time again
You all know just what I'd do

[Chorus]
Rock n' roll's a loser's game
It mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights
And for the sounds
We went off somewhere on the way
And now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus
Is in town

[Chorus]
So rock n' roll's a loser's game
It mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights
And for the sounds
The greasepaint still sticks to my face
So what the hell I can't erase
The rock n' roll feeling
From my mind

[Outro]
From my mind
From my mind
From my mind
From my miiiiiiiiiiiind
From my miiiiiiiiiiiind
From my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind
From my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind
