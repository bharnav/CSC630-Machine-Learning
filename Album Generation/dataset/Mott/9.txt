It ain't so long ago since we were just two kids
Remember well memories we all hid
But you're much older now, although you still are young
I know you well, I'm like you

Hey Rose, you're finer than you know
Why hang around with clothes of another name
Hair so dyed she lost too much inside
Ain't nothing left to hide in the game

Hey Rose, how do you laugh in your own show
Try to fight the fears that rise within
Rock 'n' roll slag, oh my, you're such a drag
Trying to find the corner to inject

Hey Rose, so silently she goes
Careful not to make up, see your maker

Hey Rose, how do you laugh when she's on show
Try to fight the fears that rise within
Hey, rock 'n' roll slag, oh oh, you're such a drag
Trying to find the corner to inject

Hey Rose, you're finer than you know
And I hate to see you cold on a summer day
