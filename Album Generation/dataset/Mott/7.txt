When I feel so down, like a worn out shoe
Gotta grease my wheels, turn around and crawl to you
And you turn me on, like you did before
But it won't be long you'll be running through the door

Lovin' you is hard enough, lovin' you is strange
Burnin' up my days and nights, lock me up in chains
Then you cast your spell on me, I hear rock'n'roll
Keeps my motor runnin' cool, rollin' down the road

I'm a cadillac, I'm just holding back
All the speed inside just to let me ride you through
You're a thunderbird cruisin' round my heart
But don't push your luck, I don't always play my part

Lovin' you is hard enough, lovin' you is strange
Burnin' up my days and nights, lock me up in chains
Then you cast your spell on me, I hear rock'n'roll
Keeps my motor runnin' cool, rollin' down the road

You know I'm not for sale, I'm just here for fun
Call me up sometime, try and catch me on the run...
