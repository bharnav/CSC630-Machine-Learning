Take good care of what you say
If you don't they'll think you're insane
And hold you down like a dog
Every day will be a nightmare

When I see your pale pale face
Looking as though it is lost
Now I know there ain't no-one
To lead you through your nightmare

Feels are waiting to come
But you don't know what you want anymore
For your (pillow?) now lies high
And the days they are starting to fly

When I see your pale pale face
Looking as though it is lost
Now I know there ain't no-one
To lead you through your nightmare

When I see your pale pale face
Looking as though it is lost
Now I know you need someone
To see you through your nightmare

(The backing's like a fart! I can't hear any backing, it's phww)
