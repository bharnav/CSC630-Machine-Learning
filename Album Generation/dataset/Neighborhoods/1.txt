[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I'm like a cat in a cage
Locked up and battered and bruised
I am the prodigal son
A shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life
Battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night
I stand there waiting for you
There is desire to fight
But I have nothing to prove
But with the crowd and some lights
I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide?
Because I think that we all do
I am a child inside
Back up and give me some room

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'm just a bastard child
Don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time
Maybe I'm better off dead
You turned us loose in the night
I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives
Although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Don't start to panic for me
Cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun
I burn up all that I choose
Up on the side of the field
I see a city with lights
I touch her face and I kneel
She tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run
The kids who scatter and hide
To reach and grab for someone
But end up buried alive
The world is waiting for me
A move that I rarely use
I start to feel my feet
They kick down walls as they move

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'm just a bastard child
Don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time
Maybe I'm better off dead
You turned us loose in the night
I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives
Although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'm just a bastard child
Don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time
Maybe I'm better off dead
You turned us loose in the night
I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives
Although we're dying inside
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
