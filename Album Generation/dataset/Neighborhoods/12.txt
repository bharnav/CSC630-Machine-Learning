[Intro]
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
This air is too thick to breathe so just drive, (just drive, just drive)
These eyes are too sick to see to leave me behind (behind, behind)
Something's swimming in my blood, something's rotting in my brain
I'm smothered from the flood, I can't recognize your face
I need to leave so just drive

[Chorus]
Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity (fight fighting the gravity)
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me (they'll take you away from me)
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last of me (yes, this is the last of me)
I'm always fighting the gravity

[Verse 2]
Tonight is too much for me to get through (get through)
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room
When I'm far away from you

[Chorus]
Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity (fight fighting the gravity)
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me (they'll take you away from me)
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last of me (yes, this is the last of me)
I'm always fighting the gravity

[Outro]
This makes no sense
This makes no (no, no, no, no)
