[Verse 1: Tom and Mark]
Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start

[Chorus: Tom and Mark]
Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night

[Verse 2: Tom and Mark]
Everyone's cross to bears the crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day

[Chorus]
Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
