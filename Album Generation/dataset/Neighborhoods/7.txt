[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Been gone a long time
I kind of lost my way, can't find it
And I caught a short ride
To the grave and back this season
I can try to get by
But every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy
A bit strange and a little bit manic

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
I went to a wishing well
It sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
On the narrowing line
What a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time
Gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out?
I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud?
A bit hard or a little misleading

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
I went to a wishing well
It sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
I went to a wishing well
It sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

I went to a wishing well
It sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land
