Oh I think it's so hard trying to figure out what they want me to do

I've spent most of my days
Only to deny what I know inside is true

Oh I think it's so hard trying to get around what they want me to be

I've done just about all trying to care About everyone else except me

I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy)
I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's goin forth to buy her some candy now)

On a saturday night
(On a saturday night)
On a saturday night

I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy)

Oh I make it so hard gettin clear about
What it is I want me to do

One day I'll get myself out in the sunshine
Then I'll get rid of the blues

I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy)
I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy some candy now)

On a saturday night
(On a saturday night)
On a saturday night
(niight)

I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy)
I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy now)
I'm going forth to buy me some candy
(She's going forth to buy her some candy)
