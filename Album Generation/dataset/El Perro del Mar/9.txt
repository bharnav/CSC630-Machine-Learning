Here comes that feeling again
And it ain't right
That lonely feeling that came
To me last night
It hurts to see you
In the arms of my friend
Here comes that lonely
Lonely feeling again

I saw you last night
In a drive-in way downtown
Locked in her arm
You didn't know I was around
Alone in my room
I remember where you've been
Here comes that lonely
Lonely feeling again

I've got to get rid of this lonely feeling
That makes me feel the way I do when a day is done
One day you're gonna know what it means to be
Lonesome
You're gonna want me back while I'm having fun

Here comes that feeling again
And it ain't right
A lonely feeling that came
To me last night
It hurts to see you
In the arms of my friend
Here comes that lonely
Lonely feeling again
Oh, I'm so lonely
I feel that feeling
I feel that feeling
Alright...
Oh yeah...
