Down on the street, there's a police attack and you've got to find out, so you suck on a cranberry candy
They look so sad when you call 911, but you've got to report them for criminal classification
What can I do? White light turns into blue. You know it's easy, so very easy...
I'm in trouble like a dirty stinking jew

Pep√© Le Pew singing 'What can I do?'; still I go on vacations and act like the queen of injustice
And the girl on the subway who sleeps on her back, and she's got to relax when I speak of the pleasures of silence
I want to play; who threw my toys away and gave me coffee? Who wants some coffee?
I'm in business on the wrong side of your bay

My heart be still, white light deploy at will. My little brother, I want another...
Come together now for one enchanting thrill
