Losing on a Tuesday filled with purposeful disasters
Tell her I'm losing on a Tuesday afternoon
Anger steers me clear of every instinct for eloping
Someone should mention that I won't see you again
Tuesday's the day I die
Moping in style but still so lost
Caught in between the uptown scenes
Destined to fall apart tonight
I don't mind the crazy weather
I'm so glad we stayed together

I'm just losing on a Tuesday filled with purposeful disasters
Tell her I'm losing on a Tuesday afternoon
