Gemstones cracking 'cause we're just too strong, drum-sized yearning 'cause the pressures gone
Supervised love, crucified stubs, simmering red in the sex farm clubs
There's an exit to this desert dangling freely from the shingles in the snow...
She's a showoff, Xanax, Zoloft -- bling-faced footprints of the zebras in the glen

Cavemen humping in the sterling spacepod; young Sid Pumpkin in the Starbucks courtyard
Gigolos dance, stepping on toes; Benadryl nights in the old K-holes
There's an exit to this desert dangling freely from the shingles in the snow...
She's a showoff, Xanax, Zoloft -- bling-faced footprints of the zebras in the glen

Let's break into the labrynth of lies, let's dive off the end of his eyes
Hollywood hills, peppermint bills -- I can still taste the grime that you stuffed in my gills

Oh, Johnny, can't you set a place for Holly? She's a wild one, she'll be staying for a spell
Till they find her, and they drag her down to Barcelona! Down to Barcelona!
I'm a very funny boy but I know what I just said! Chk Chk Chk!
Dunkin' Donuts, give me Dunkin' Donuts -- she's a very funny girl, but I love that crazy bitch, all right!
