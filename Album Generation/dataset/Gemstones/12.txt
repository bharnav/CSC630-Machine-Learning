The sweat on your lips is the rest of your smack
Your breath starts to skip as your neck turns to slack
Lay down my chubby princess before you get some rest
Cause tonight she's gonna put your crummy mattress to the test
And they say not so many strawberries grow in the sea
Cause it's too late for changes in my family
And all the phoney princes still hate my guts so much
Cause I just don't believe in bad news before lunch

And if I went back to that whorehouse tonight
Do you think I'd find a reason for a princess not to bite

For those of us folks that good health does not bless
The best news for us is the end of our death
Lay down my chubby princess before you get some rest
Cause tonight she's gonna put your crummy mattress to the test

And if I went back to that whorehouse tonight
Do you think I'd find a reason for a princess not to bite
My cock
