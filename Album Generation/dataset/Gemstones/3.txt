I need someone, I need someone today
Never gonna see the end of you this way
Until I see the magical fungi
Now there she goes right over the sunrise
Never gonna be adored
Never gonna be bout you, momma!
Now there she goes, right over the sunrise
Cause I'm so sick of fuckin' up in the subway
We're gonna do it in this beautiful mustang
Cause I'm a choo choo, we're pumping and revelling

Cinnamon the spider bones
I'm talking on the telephone
And sending off the message to the wingman
Later in the afternoon
I almost stole a different tune
I waited till the evening came to write this song
Walked into a coffee shop
In time to grab a soda pop
Before the dog exploded on the curbside
Yesterday my hair was gray
I turned and faced the other way
Back behind the mirror where the kids play
Momma!

Now there she goes, right over the sunrise
Cause I'm so sick of fuckin' up in the subway
We're gonna do it in this beautiful mustang
Cause I'm a choo choo, we're pumping and revelling
