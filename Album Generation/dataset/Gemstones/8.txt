Who's your boyfriend on this coast?
I bet your boyfriend hates you most
I joke around but I don't look down
Because you could break my heart
Only you could break my heart
Only you could win my dreams back
From the man who writes prescriptions on post-it notes
I bet your boyfriend hates you most
I joke around but I don't look down
Because you could break my heart
Only you could break my heart
Only you could win my dreams back from your girlfriend

Someone like me should not have a phone
Jumping the gun despite grief I've known
She will become someone I listen for nothing more
Into the hallway with you
