I'm a man in the rain
Here they come now, Teddy Boys
I'm a bad man all alone
I belong here, Teddy Boys
Oh, maybe I'm just looking for something nasty
Songs I'm gonna sing in jail
Or maybe I'm just looking for some affectations
Before the bouncer comes and kicks me out of the club

I'm a man, maybe two
And I see you, Teddy Boys
Like a mad dog in a dream
I want ice cream, Teddy Boys

Oh maybe I'm just looking for something nasty
Songs I'm gonna sing in jail
Oh Bobby's not in trouble, maybe it's his birthday
And now somebody's come to kick me out of the club

Teddy Boys, Teddy Boys
Call me Jack anyway, could be fun
Here they come, anyone
You don't have to be clean to be seen
I'm a man moving uptown
And the fat boys are tracking me down
Oh my God, so I run, and I run, and I run
Till I'm tight back laughing with you
