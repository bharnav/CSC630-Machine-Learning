She's my baby
She's my love
Pixie queen of bible club
I've seen her sitting round the fountain sipping cokes
Crafting brand new polish jokes
And I can't explain
Why my accent changed
I guess there's still some hope to score some dope
She needs to be changed inside

She's my waitress
She's the boss
Lips and teeth of Santa Claus
Pencil in the dentist
Clean the crops
Have you seen my soda pop?
There was a polish priest
Who thought he could please me
He got me so wacked out
I nearly lost my house
'Cause nobody needs me yeah...
