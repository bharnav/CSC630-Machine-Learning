[Verse 1]
Forever waiting for disaster
What David calls servant and master
Will you play it too?
As this displacement begs for water
Swimming, bathing
Drowning in sorrow

Scream with me

[Verse 2]
I crawl across this cracked expansion
I'll be buried soon
Beneath the sand with pure intentions
Wanting something, someone to follow

[Chorus]
For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
(Here's my lullaby)
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through
(Hush now, don't you cry)

[Verse 3]
I swoon upon my knees come crashing
Will you bury me?
Today, this small favour I am asking
Hold me, you may drop me tomorrow

[Chorus]
For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
(Here's my lullaby)
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through

For a change, I'll refrain
From hiding all of me from you
Pray for rain, lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through

Here's my lullaby
Hush now, don't you cry

[Outro]
Calm down, come down
Cold resides with me
I'll flee to (I'll flee to) Decemberunderground
As you exhale, I breathe in (and sink into)
The water, underground
And I'll grow pale without you
