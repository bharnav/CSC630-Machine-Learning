[Verse 1]
Warn your warmth to turn away
Here, it's December every day (I like that)
Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

[Verse 2]
She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, "It seems you're somewhere far away," to his face

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(She wanted love
I taste of blood)
She bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

[Bridge]
Love like winter
Love like winter, winter
Three, four

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before
From years before
