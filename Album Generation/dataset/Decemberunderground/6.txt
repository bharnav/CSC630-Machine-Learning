[Verse 1]
Every night, devise new heights in genocide
Lover, I am loveless
All my friends and I toast health and suicide
Lover, I am lonely
Come on!

[Pre-Chorus]
Were you holding hands when
My palms bled?

[Chorus]
Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line

[Verse 2]
World is unified, ennui, and I divide
Lover, I am loveless
Red days and burning might bleed 'til, 'til the faceless die
Lover, I am lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
Were you holding hands when
My wrists bled?

[Chorus]
Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line

[Bridge]
So stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love
Stay sweetly numb
Maintain lifeless love
Stay sweetly numb
Remain lifeless, love

[Chorus]
Oh, I will be all right, just use me
Just use me
The future's bright without me
Spend some time walking the line
Spend some time walking the line
