[Verse 1]
Five A.M. on the bathroom floor, from the night before
Do you find me dreadful?
What a shame, such a sad disgrace
Such a pretty face, but she's not regretful

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

[Chorus]
It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

[Verse 2]
Three A.M. on the city street
When the air is sweet, I've had my mouth full
But it seems that outside the screen
Such a pretty face often will look dreadful

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bridge]
You see they always remember
They never forget a face
When they cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up
Cut, cut, cut, cut, they remember
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up
Cut you up

[Chorus] (x2)

[Outro]
All again
All again
It's time again
It's killing time
