[Verse 1]
One at a time, constants become surreal
One at a time, heart attacks are concealed
I can see that I lose the joys of life
One at a time, suicides are revealed
You will see that I lost another life
But tonight...

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares

[Verse 2]
One at a time, I watched them all forget
One at a time, I'm lost in little deaths
It's the place that I, I forget my life
Like tonight...

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares

[Bridge]
Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?
Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up
I'll let you break it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares, cares

[Outro]
I'll let you tear it up, if you don't wake me up
'Cause it's apparent that you don't care
And it's sunk into me, 'cause I don't care
Now, no one cares
