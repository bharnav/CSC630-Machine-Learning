[Verse 1]
Bring your secrets to me
Just give me your hands and I'll let you feel the wounds
They put in me
If you believe in me, how can I be dissolving?
If you'd believe me, I'd tell you everything

[Chorus]
Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me

[Verse 2]
Silence, can you hear me?
Press me to your lips and I'll suck the poison out
Who will heal me, me?
If you keep killing me, how can I keep absolving?
Your sins into me, begin the poisoning

[Chorus]
Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me

[Bridge]
Time, time, time
We're not waiting
Time, time, time
We're no one

I fall
I fall

[Chorus]
Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)

Do you fall too? (every time that I)
Yes, I fall (every time that I)
Do you want to (try to pacify)
Fall into me? (fall into me, fall into me)
Into me

[Outro]
We are no one
We are one
We are no one
