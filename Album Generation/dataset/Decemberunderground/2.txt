[Intro]

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

Whoa-oh-ohh

[Verse 1]
With just a look, they shook
And heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky
He left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why
He left us all behind

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Verse 2]
Dreams of his crash won’t pass
Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify
He left them all behind
And how his children cried
He left us all behind

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Bridge]
What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?
