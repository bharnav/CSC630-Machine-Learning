[Verse 1]
Walked into our world and made
Horrible sounds
I can still hear them today
(Strangely, they seem)
Beautiful now
Though, they outlast my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, each time, I always meant
Every word, every one
Though, in time, they finally bent
Every word, every one, every word

[Chorus]
"I will wait for you," she said
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
Misery

[Verse 2]
I returned to you but found
My empty home
The radio told me to stay
(As it burned down)
I sang alone
You will outlast my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, each time, I always meant
Every word, every one
Though, in time, they finally bent
Every word, every one, every word

[Chorus]
"I will wait for you," she said
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
Misery

[Bridge]
I have been waiting for you
Biding as you taught me to
I have come to relieve you
Of life and love

I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait
I will wait

[Chorus]
"I will wait for you," she said
(I will wait)
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
(I will wait)
Misery

I will wait for you
Wait for you
Endlessly
"I will wait for you," so spoke
So spoke
Misery

[Outro]
I will bite straight through
As I wait for you
Dear
Endlessly
