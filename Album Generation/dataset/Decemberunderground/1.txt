[Verse 1]
So, I'm feeling much worse now
You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me
Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, on such voltage?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

[Chorus]
So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)

[Verse 2]
As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to
Ride that, ride that dirty ride
That is turning too fast now
I c-c-cannot, cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who would, who would want to?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

[Chorus]
So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)

Don't ever speak my name

[Bridge]
Don't ever speak my name again, don't ever speak it
Don't ever speak my name again, don't speak, don't speak
Don't speak my...
Don't speak my name

[Chorus]
So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)
