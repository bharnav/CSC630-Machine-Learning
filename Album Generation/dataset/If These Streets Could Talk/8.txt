This is how it's been, this is how it will be
And when you wake up with him, remember when it was me
And I always will be waiting for you
And I know that you will never see...that

I can't break away from these chains to my heart
The further you push me the closer you are
Maybe I should try to let go
Maybe I should try to walk away
There's nothing left to say, yeaheeyeah

Do you remember when, you used to laugh there with me
And now I've become the joke, a punchline's all I will be
And I always will be waiting for you
And I know that you will never see ...that

I can't break away from these chains to my heart
The further you push me the closer you are
Maybe I should try to let go
Maybe I should try to walk away
There's nothing left to say

You'll be waiting for the rest of your life
Just so you can finally hear me say
These words don't mean a thing but I'll say them anyway
...anyway, yeah

I can't break away from these chains to my heart
The further you push me the closer you are
Maybe I should try to let go
Maybe I should try to walk away
There's nothing left to say...but

I can't break away from these chains to my heart
The further you push me the closer you are
Maybe I should try to let go
Maybe I should try to walk away
There's nothing left to say, yeahheahh
â€˜cause I can't break away
