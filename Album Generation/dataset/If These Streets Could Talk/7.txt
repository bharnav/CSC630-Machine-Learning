I'm watching your eyes move slowly
Up and down my silhouette
And I wonder if you get it yet
This is the last time I crawl away on these broken knees
And don't you wish it all would be okay?

"Promise me you'll forget me,"
You said as you walked away
"Don't hold on… please… let go of me…"
You make it so hard to leave

And I can't breathe without you here
For fear I'll catch your scent
And we both know how bad I get
I don't do well or dwell in change
And don't you know that
Three small words could make this all okay?

"Promise me you'll forget me,"
You said as you walked away
"Don't hold on… please… let go of me…"
You make it so hard to leave

You promise me
You'll never forget me
You promise me
You'll never forget…

"Promise me you'll forget me,"
You said as you walked away
"Don't hold on… please… let go of me…"
You make it so hard to leave

"You promise (YOU) me (PRO) you'll (MISE) forget (ME) me,"
You said as you walked away
"You promise (YOU'LL) me (FOR) you'll (GET) forget (ME) me."
