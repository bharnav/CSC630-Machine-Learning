[Verse 1: Jason + (Dan)]
Tell me girl, what were you thinking?
Hit me with something that will make this worth my time
(Take it back, take it all back now
Every promise I made was just another mistake with you)

Tell the truth if you think that you can take it
But I know you won't
(I never felt so all alone
But when it was safe, I turned my back and the blade came through)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason + (Dan)]
And I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)
And I can barely breathe

[Chorus: Dan + (Jason)]
Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yeah, it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
'Cause I can barely breathe
(I can barely breathe)

[Verse 2: Jason + (Dan)]
Tell me now, can you still taste him?
'Cause you know you'll never wash your hands of this
(Take it back, take it all back now
Every drunken kiss that landed on his lips from you)

Make a move if you think that you can make it
But I know you won't
(I never felt so all alone
But when it was safe, I turned my back and the blade came through)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason + (Dan)]
And I can barely breathe
(And I can barely breathe)
And I can barely breathe

[Chorus: Dan + (Jason)]
Stand on top of the roof top, wondering
Is it good? Yeah, it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
'Cause I can barely breathe
(I can barely breathe)

Stand on top of the roof top wondering
Is it good? Yeah, it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
'Cause I can barely breathe
(I can barely breathe)

[Bridge: Jason + (Dan)]
Hold your tongue
You know nothing about this, don't even get involved
(I hope you watch as I'm falling down
Because you are the reason I'm hitting the ground)
You could be the one that breaks me
You will be the one that breaks me now
(I hope you know that every tear you cried
There's a memory left from when you watch me die)
You know I'll haunt your dreams
With all these pieces that you stole of me, of me

[Chorus: Dan + (Jason)]
Stand on top of the roof top, wondering
Is it good? Yeah, it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
'Cause I can barely breathe
(I can barely breathe)

Stand on top of the roof top, wondering
Is it good? Yeah, it's good for jumping
Take back every word you said
'Cause I can barely breathe
('Cause I can barely breathe)
