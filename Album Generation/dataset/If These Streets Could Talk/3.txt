Tell me dear
How could I make this more clear
When I say this is forever
(when i say that this is forever)
And how is that so wrong
Is it too much to ask to not be alone (alone)

So what did I do wrong
I'll take it back and start over again (again)

Well I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone, and unwanted
In your silence
And I wish I could destroy you
But instead I'll just adore you
And know that you were silent

I'll cross my fingers tight
And sleep to dream of you
Cause when I wake
I know I'll be alone
But it's worth it for you...for you

Well I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone, and unwanted
In your silence
And I wish I could destroy you
But instead I'll just adore you
And know that you were silent

I'd sleep through any dream for you
I'd wait through anything
You're everything
You're everything to me

Well I fall asleep with you
(I'd sleep through any dream for you)
And I wake up alone, and unwanted
In your silence
And I wish I could destroy you
(I'd wait through anything)
But instead I'll just adore you (I adore you)
In your silence
(You're everything to me)

Well I'm still waiting...
