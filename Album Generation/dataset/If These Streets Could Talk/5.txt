I'll take this as easy as I can make it seem
You'll keep me, me guessing
Act like you still believe

There's a time and place for everything
The words you spoke, the words he said
"How could this happen to me?"
Wake up and turn around
Your game's the flame, it's burning out
And now you mean nothing to me...

You make it so easy to just walk away
You'll take me for granted
As we both know you have

There's a time and place for everything
The words you spoke, the words he said
"How could this happen to me?"

Wake up and turn around
Your game's the flame, it's burning out
And now you mean nothing to me...

And so replace every dream you've had
And find your way back home
This time you'll be on your own
I'll be waiting there with your hopes
The hopes of better days
And a love that won't fade away
And I've been feeling so lost, but I won't let it show
Into your arms I've fallen once again

So I wake up, wake up
How could this happen to me
So I wake up, wake up
Don't let it burn out on me
