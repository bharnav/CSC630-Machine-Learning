I search your words
Fish for breaks in every line
You say you paint a picture in my mind
I'm paying attention to detail
And searching for any trace of ideas...
You tell a tale
You tell enough to carry me away

'Cause I know where you've been
And I know what you've done with him
I hope its worth what we lost
Take your time with your goodbyes
'cause this will be the last time
I stand by with eyes closed tight

And it's hard to know
If I had caught this months ago
I could have paced myself
Saved myself from this disease
It's killing me faster
With every single second you are gone
You needed an answer but when I said, "yes"
I meant "forevermore!"

'Cause I know where you've been
And I know what you've done with him
I hope its worth what we lost
Take your time with your goodbyes
'cause this will be the last time
I stand by with eyes closed tight

I look into your eyes
And see that your colors changing
I wish that I could change with you
And when you said forever did you mean it to be true?
Or was it another tale from you?

I look into your eyes
And see that your colors changing
I wish that I could change with you
And when you said forever did you mean it to be true?
Or was it another tale from you?

I look into your eyes
And see that your colors changing
I wish that I could change with you
And when you said forever did you mean it to be true?
Or was it another tale from you?

I look into your eyes
(From You, From You)
And see that your colors changing
(From You, From You)
I wish that I could change with you
(From You, From You)
And when you said forever did you mean it to be true?
(From You, From You)
Or was it another tale from you?
