It's 9 o’clock and it’s getting dark and I can’t see the road
I flash my headlights into the dark night
I swear we’ll make it on our own

We're older than we used to be
This town holds no more to see
We’re fading in, we’re fading out
Until I hear you say

Come on, come on
Hey kid, this is far too important for you to understand
She says be a man, you know this is what we both wanted
It’s time for us to let go
Of all we’ve known

It’s 1 a.m. and we’re alone again, I reach out for the sky
My mind keeps playing all the words you’re saying
I’m always wrong when you are right

We re older than we used to be
This town holds no more to see
We’re fading in, we’re fading out until I hear you say

Come on, come on
Hey kid, this is far too important for you to understand
She says be a man, you know this is what we both wanted
It’s time for us to let go
Of all we’ve known

Come on, come on
Hey kid, this is far too important for you to understand
She says be a man, you know this is what we both wanted
It’s time for us to let go
Of all we’ve known

Of all we’ve known, of all we’ve known
Of all we’ve known (Hey kid, this is far to important)
Of all we’ve known (For you to understand)
She says be a man
