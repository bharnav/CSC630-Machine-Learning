Take apart every piece of this machine
Leave my broken body in the street
I'll stammer drunk and hallow to your doorstep

You'll say
Don't even breathe his name
You'll say
Don't you dare

One shot is all that I would need
Tonight I'll have you on your knees
I'll make you see
(I'll have you begging for his life tonight)
One shot is all I'd ever need
Tonight I'll have you on your knees
I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe

And now you'll see
Just how desperate that we both can be
And now you'll see
That you could never live
Live without me

One shot is all I that I would need
Tonight I'll have you on your knees
I'll make you see
(I'll have you begging for his life tonight)
One shot is all I that I would need
Tonight I'll have you on your knees
I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe
I'll make you believe
