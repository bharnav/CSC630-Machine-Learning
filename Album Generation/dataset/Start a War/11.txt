[Instrumental Intro]

Time to take control (I control this)
It's harder than you know (Got to change this)
Feel the muscle twitch (It's electric)
When you let it go

Feeling primitive (In my dark room)
Pounding in my head (Creeping silence)
They will never know (All the secrets)
Better left unsaid

Always the same and
I didn't know you were
Taking what's mine, I
Can see it show through
Waiting to break me
'Cause everyday it's
My damnation

[Short Instrumental Break]

Take another step (Look around me)
All that I have left (Taken from me)
Things that could have been (Are forgotten)
Haunting me again

Set in my own ways (Never changing)
Make it through the day (Rearranging)
Nothing more to lose (I can tell there's)
Nothing more to say

Always the same and
I didn't know you were
Taking what's mine, I
Can see it show through
Waiting to break me
'Cause everyday it's
My damnation

Always to blame, you
You crucified me
Leave it behind, I
Can't take this hating
I'll make it go away
And everyday it's
My damnation

Go ahead
You throw the dirt
You tried
To make it hurt me
Everything, everything
Everything breaking me

Always the same
Always the same
Always the same
Always to blame
Always the same
Over and over, it's my damnation

[Short Instrumental Break]

Always the same and
I didn't know you were
Taking what's mine, I
Can see it show through
Waiting to break me
'Cause everyday it's
My damnation

Always to blame, you
You crucified me
Leave it behind, I
Can't take this hating
I'll make it go away
And everyday it's
My damnation

Always the same and
I didn't know you were
Taking what's mine, I
Can see it show through
Waiting to break me
'Cause everyday it's
My damnation

Always to blame, you
You crucified me
Leave it behind, I
Can't take this hating
I'll make it go away
And everyday it's
My damnation
