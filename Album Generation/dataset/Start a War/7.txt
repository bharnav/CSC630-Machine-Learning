Wait every hour of every day
Played light, played hard
Had to go my way
I feel like death wearing a disguise
Can't catch my breath
From all this noise
From all this noise

I want I want I want I want I want
I'm fucking bored
Give me a new found sensation
Take it Take it Take it Take it
Take all the pills
I'll try anything to get me off
Come on Come on Come on Come on
Kicked in the ass
Why do you tell me I can't?
Fake it Fake it Fake it Fake it
I can't go on
Give me anything to set it off
Set it off

I bite your tongue
Watch with keen eyes
I found the gun
Nervouse excitement
Go on and touch it
You just might like
I sip your poison one last time
One last time
Time time time time

I want I want I want I want I want
I'm fucking bored
Give me a new found sensation
Take it Take it Take it Take it
Take all the pills
I'll try anything to get me off
Come on Come on Come on Come on
Kicked in the ass
Why do you tell me I can't?
Fake it Fake it Fake it Fake it
I can't go on
Give me anything to set it off

My confidence is all that's left
Under this veil I count the minutes
I'm growing weaker
Search for a glimmer
Pulsating sounds come blaring out
You may be right
My mind is gone
I'll try anything to set this off
Set it off
Set it off
Anything to set it off
Anything to set it off
Anything anything anything to set it off..

I want I want I want I want I want
I'm fucking bored
Give me a new found sensation
Take it Take it Take it Take it
Take all the pills
I'll try anything to get me off
Come on Come on Come on Come on
Kicked in the ass
Why do you tell me I can't?
Fake it Fake it Fake it Fake it
I can't go on
Give me anything to set it off

Anything anything anything to set it off...
Anything anything anything to set it off...
