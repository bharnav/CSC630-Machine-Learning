Starting
Spinning
Turn Around
To my heart pounding
Motor screaming
Sliding down
Got to turn it around
Danger nowhere
By myself
I burn the thrill
Claw my way out
Right now
Got to try to get out

I'll start a war with it
I'll start a war with it
I'll start a war with this fucking emotion
I'll start a war with this fucking emotion

I'll start a war
Against you
You're one of them
You call yourself
A victim
But you're at it again
I've felt stranger
Paradise
You made me kill
Now I'm far out
Right now
Got to try to get out

'n' I'll start a war with
'n' I'll start a war with
'n' I'll start a war with this fucking emotion
'n' I'll start a war with this fucking emotion

I'll take it all
Give me some more
I'll take it all
I'll take it all
I'll take it all
I'll take it all

Danger nowhere
By myself
I burn the thrill
Claw my way out
Right now
Got to try to get out

'n' I'll start a with
'n' I'll start a with
'n' I'll start a with this fucking emotion
'n' I'll start a with this fucking emotion

I want it all
I start a war
I take it all
I take it all

I start a war
I start a war
I start a war with this fucking emotion
'n' I start with
'n' I start with
A fucking emotion
