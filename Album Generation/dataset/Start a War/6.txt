Keep me around, waiting behind glass
In case you need, I'll be your piece of ass
Pretend to want me, string me along
Break glass if need, you can make me crawl

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep

I was strung out for such a long time
Now I own myself, yes I am mine
No longer will I be your just in case
No longer your shit do I need to taste

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean

I don't want to be your just in case boy
I don't want to be your just in case
Oh no

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can see my emotion
Is this for real?
Is this for real?
Is this for real?
