Ampersand ampersand

Ampersand the angry sea beats
On the rocks of futility
Fields ever grown, groves ever green
This is the madness of my dreams
Ampersand

Ampersand ampersand

Fields ever grown, groves ever green
This is the madness of my dreams

Ampersand

Tools I use the tools at hand
Alliteration, irony, pathetic fallacy, ampersand
