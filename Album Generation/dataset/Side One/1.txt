(Belew/Rice)

Only a week ago today
I sat on a plane and flew away
I see you everywhere I go
I dropped my bag in the hotel hall
I thought I heard your voice through the wall
I see you everywhere I go

The Autobahn I ride
I see your eyes on the signs ahead

And as I sat beside the Seine
A boat went past and I saw you wave
I see you everywhere I go

When I went to sleep in Japan
I saw your face on the ceiling fan
I see you everywhere I go

Reminds me who I am
A stranger in a stranger land

When I went to sleep in Japan
I saw your face on the ceiling fan
I see you everywhere I go

The Bullet Train I ride
I see your eyes on the signs ahead

And as I'm landing back in the states
A hundred of you waiting at the gate
I see you in the streets
I see you in my sleep
I see you everywhere I go
