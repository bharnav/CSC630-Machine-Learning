1.When the sun falls from the sky
And the muse begins to fly
Then she will come to wrestle me
Just as I am about to sleep
When the moonlight in the fall
Make some movie on the wall
Then she will come to tears
She?s afraid of fall from reality

Ref: Walk around the world tonight
See these places ? they?re only in my mind
I see everything - beautiful things
I can do the garden in your hair
Visualize the city in the air
Where little faces in little squares
Talk to me
I am late

I am late

2.If a man can?t learn to bend
Like a reed does in the breeze
Then how will he ever comprehend
All of life?s sweet mysteries

Ref: Walk around the world tonight?

Use your brain
Your perception
Use your imagination
Even reality is mostly in your mind
