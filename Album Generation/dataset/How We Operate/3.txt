Oh no, why can't you get along?
Okay, I know its not my place
I've gotta say somethin'
I've gotta say somethin'
I've gotta speak

She'll never leave
And you can never throw her out
Impossible to conceive
You'd rather be with than without
That's just the fear talkin
That's just the fear talkin
That's just the fear

Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me
Fear
Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me
Fear

Remember the good old days
Well love is like a dragonfly
So beautiful
It will die
And disappear before your eyes
I'm no philosopher
I am no poet
I'm just trying to help you out

Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me
Fear
Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me

So you sit and wait
For another man to take your place
And when, when he comes
Would you welcome him with open arms

You'll feel a hundred years younger
You'll feel a hundred years younger
You'll feel no fear

Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me
Fear
Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me
Fear
Don't let it kill you
Like it nearly killed me
Fear
