You can make up a list of the things you want
Could be anything
When you've crossed them all off and there's nothing left
Just start again

The occasional milestone on your path
Shows how far you've come
But the record will show when it's all too much
And not enough

So step right up
(Everything's just fine)
I'm only here to do what's right

If it cannot be slowed and it's too late to change
Just cover up
Keep it spinning around out of control
Till it's hard to stop
Like a moth to the flame you can't resist
You have to get involved
Why did you get involved?

So step right up
(Everything's just fine)
I'm only here to do what's right
(Step right up)
Don't worry, I'm on it

Tell us, what's your secret?
How come it works every time?
You make it look so easy
Like you don't even try

Tell us, what's your secret?
Have you got something to hide?
If giving up's so easy
Why do you even try?

And the record will show you were falling fast
It was all too much
And you weren't fast enough

So step right up
(Everything's just fine)
Don't worry, I'm on it

Tell us, what's the secret?
How come it works every time?
You make it look so easy
Like you don't even try

Tell us, what's your secret?
Have you got something to hide?
If giving up's so easy
Why do you even try?

It's like you don't even try
It's never all too much
Yeah, not enough
It's like you don't even try
It's never all too much
Yeah, not enough
