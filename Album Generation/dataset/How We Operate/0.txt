I stopped tryin' to write the things I don't like
And I started goin' back to where I'd been before
She said "I don't blame you I'd do the same"
Opportunity knocks knocks knocks open the door
But I think she saw through it
I see through myself
Another chance gone, won't get many more

But I'm not the only guy I know that
I'm not the only guy I know that
You never notice
The only guy I know, well I'm not the only guy I know
That you never notice

I stopped tryin' to write the things I don't like
And I started goin' back to where I'd been before
She said "I don't blame you I'd do the same"
Opportunity knocks knocks knocks open the door
But I think she saw through it
I see through myself
Another chance gone, won't get many more

But that's not the only lie I told you
That's not the only lie I told you
You never notice
The only lie I told you, that's not the only lie I told you
You never notice
The only lie I told you, that's not the only lie I told you
You never notice

I can tell you're in denial, get over it
I can tell you're in denial, get over it
I can tell you're in denial, get over it
I can tell you're in denial

I'm not the only guy I know that you never notice
