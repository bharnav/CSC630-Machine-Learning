A temperamental ex stops and asks her why
But "why?" cannot expect a true reply
Somehow love's picture hangs imperfect
And hand on heart we learn the score
The lovers and their wars
Are wondering whats meant to be

For hope will spring eternal
While love has got you on your knees, oh-oh-oh
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Always and much more

Her body makes an "S", today they made a scene
His sleepless needing her, he dogs her dreams
Then he wakes up on her doorstep
Then he wakes up on his floor
More drunken than before
She wouldn't open up to him

But hope will spring eternal
Through a multitude of sins, oh-oh-oh
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Always, always, always

For hope will spring eternal
While love has got you on your knees
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Sha-la-la-la, man
Sha-la-la-la, woman
Always and forever more
