I spend a lifetime
Trying to decipher
Charley Patton songs

I don't know why I bother
Even if I think its right
It always comes out wrong

But I'm old enough
Old enough to know why
You're still young enough
Young enough to still try
Still try

I keep on pushing
Forcing through it
Til I'm knackered out

I know how you're feeling
Even though I've never been
That far south

But I'm old enough
Old enough to know why
You're still young enough
Young enough to still try
Still try

Now I've been looking in New York
I've been looking in Chicago
I've been looking in New Orleans
I can't find you

I've been looking in Detroit
I've been looking in Los Angeles
I've been looking in Louisville
I can't find you

Well I'm old enough
Old enough to know why
Yeah you're young enough
Young enough to still try
You still try

Now I've been looking in New York
I've been looking in Chicago
I've been looking in New Orleans
I can't find you

I've been looking in Detroit
I've been looking in Los Angeles
I've been looking in Louisville
I can't find you

I've been looking in the Lonely States
I've been looking in Philadelphia
I've been looking in Memphis
I can't find you
I cannot find you
