I wish I could cry on demand
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo
Given all these troubles on my mind
The tears won't come out

I've been shaking
Shaking in my boots
Every time I hear my telephone
Ring, it can't possibly by you
You never call
Not since my little accident

I didn't mean to cause any trouble
I didn't know you were so serious, and
I didn't mean to burst our bubble
It can only float for so long

Now I realize, I realize that you were wrong
'Cause what happens in Vegas don't take very long
To travel cross continents and onwards overseas
On to our little island, to our city, our home, but

I didn't mean to cause any trouble
I didn't know you were so serious, and
I didn't mean to burst our bubble
It could only float for so long

Sometimes I wish I could cry on demand
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo
Given all these troubles on my mind
The tears won't come out

I didn't mean to cause any trouble
I didn't know you were so serious, and
I didn't mean to burst our bubble
It could only float for so long

Sometimes I wish I could cry on demand
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo
Given all these troubles on my mind
The tears won't come out

I wish I could cry on demand
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo
Given all these troubles on my mind
The tears won't come out
The tears won't come out
The tears won't come out
