I epitomise restraint
But time has tempered my discretion
I'm bound to betray myself someday
I'm hitting the road
(hitting the road)
And saying goodbye
(saying goodbye)
I'll never look backwards
Let the sun get in my eyes

Oh, don't make me laugh
You're not fooled by the way I come over
Don't make me laugh and don't make me cry
So long, goodbye

This parted history we share
Poorly wrapped and hardly mentioned
An unreciprocal glint in your eye
It's hard to know
(it's hard to know)
Who's telling a lie
(telling a lie)
You never say never
And see your vanity deprived

Oh, don't make me laugh
You're not fooled by the way I come over
Don't make me laugh and don't make me cry
So long, goodbye

Don't make me laugh
There is no other way I could know her
Don't make me laugh and don't make me cry
So long, goodbye
'Cause you know

Don't make me laugh
You're not fooled by the way I come over
Don't make me laugh and don't make me cry
So long, goodbye

Don't make me laugh
There is no other way I could know her
Don't make me laugh and don't make me cry
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye
