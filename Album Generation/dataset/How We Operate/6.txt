Take my time, dear
It's all yours

As the Earth goes round the Sun
Life takes some fighting
And it leaves scars
And it keeps us on the run

This is a game I'm longing to play
But stumble at the start
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If this is just a lie, (tear our love apart)
There's still nowhere I would rather be
Now hold on tight

I'm not frightened
I'm all yours
And you keep me safe from harm
I'm not enlightened
Can't reach the stars
But I'm closer in your arms

There is a flame that flickers and sways
But burns while we're apart
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If this is just a lie, (tear our love apart)
There's still nowhere I would rather be
(tear our love apart)
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
No place, no time, (tear our love apart)
There's still nowhere I would rather be
Now hold on tight

There's nothing to blame
To get in our way
Or tear our love apart
If we're in the same place
It won't matter where we are
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If this is just a lie, (tear our love apart)
There's still nowhere I would rather be
(tear our love apart)
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If there's nothing, (tear our love apart)
If there's nothing
