[Verse 1]
Day to day
Where do you want to be?
Cause now you're trying to pick a fight
With everyone you need

[Bridge 1]
You seem like a soldier
Who's lost his composure
You're wounded and playing a waiting game
In no man's land, no one's to blame

[Chorus]
See the world, find an old fashioned girl
And when all's been said and done
It's the things that are given, not won
Are the things that you earned

[Verse 2]
Empty handed
Surrounded by a senseless scene
With nothing of significance
Besides a shadow of a dream

[Bridge 2]
You sound like an old joke
You want out, a bit broke
And askin me time and time again
And the answer's still the same

[Chorus]
See the world, find an old fashioned girl
And when all's been said and done
It's the things that are given, not won
Are the things that you earned

You've got a chance to put things right
So how's it going to be?

[Bridge 3]
Lay down your arms now
And put us beyond doubt
So reach out it's not too far away
Don't mess around now, don't delay

[Chorus]
See the world, find an old fashioned girl
And when all's been said and done
It's the things that are given, not won
Are the things that you earned

The things that you earned
Are given, not won
The things that you earned
Are given, not won
