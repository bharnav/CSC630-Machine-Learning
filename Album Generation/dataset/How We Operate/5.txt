Well its been more than a year
Since I lived by the sea
And though we both have been moving
You came back to me
And I remember the old signs we threw off the pier
They've been burning for God knows
They sink, disappear

Take one day of my lifestyle
Passing ghosts in the street
I chase them away with alcohol
But they don't get drunk

The ghosts around your city
Have all got my name
I wonder how I'm glowing
I wonder why I'm glowing
I wonder how I'm glowing
I wonder why I'm glowing
