[Verse 1]
When you first left me, I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door, what'cha do that for?
When you first left me, I didn't know what to say
I've never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

[Pre Chorus]
I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

[Chorus]
At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

[Verse 2]
Whenever you see me, you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health, I was quite unwell

[Pre Chorus]
I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

[Chorus]
At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

[Chorus]
At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile
At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile
