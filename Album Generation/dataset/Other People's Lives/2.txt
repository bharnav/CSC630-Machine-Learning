Mr. Jones, my next door neighbour
I feel I've known you all my life
I haven't seen you for a while now
How's the family? How's that beautiful wife?

I hope your dreams were not forgotten
And you've become downtrodden

Get your health together
Get your wealth together
Get yourself together
Jones, you were my next door neighbour

Mr. Brown, you're so ambitious
You ran off with an Essex blond
You've broke the bank to keep two women
You're over extended, now, it's all gone wrong

Now, you're right back where you started
Still, you shouldn't be broken hearted

Get your mind together
We can still climb together
A step at a time together
Brown, your world was turned upside down

I know it's not the same
And everything changes
But behind front doors people think that they can hide

We win and lose, we laugh and cry
Live and learn, at least we try
Oh, give it a try

Ba, ba, ba, together
Ba, ba, ba, together
And we can go miles together
All of my next door neighbours

Get your style together
Put a smile together
And we'll go miles together
All of my next door neighbours

Mr. Smith, another story
I wonder what became of him?
They say he threw the telly through the window
He went berserk and jacked the whole world in

They say he may have hit rock bottom
Still, he went out with a bang and so he is not forgotten

We had our tiffs together
Our rows and our rifts together
But let's learn to forgive together

Smith, you were my next door neighbour
Jones, you were my next door neighbour
Brown, you were my next door neighbour
