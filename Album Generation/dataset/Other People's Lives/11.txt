Wakin' up, feeling rough
Totally stressed
Every day it's a dead(?) time
Step by step
Hit a wall, took a fall
To a new depth
Count to ten, focusin'
Take a deep breath

In a world that is close to breakin'
I thought that you were my friend
In a world that is full of hatin'
And(I'm?) about to descend
I just smile and pretend(?)

I'm a million miles away from it all
And let it go right over my head
Let 'em chase and the winner take all
And let it go right over my head
Over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head

Everywhere, everyone
Questioning me
Are you ill? Are you well?
Do you like being free?

Didn't know you were close to breaking
So you thought it should end
Left it all for a new location
So you could start up again
So keep keep smilin' till then

Right now I want some peace of mind
So let it go right over my head
Just want to give myself a little more time
And every single word that you said
Went over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head

Little girl I was so mistaken
Thought that you were my friend
In a world that is full of hatin'
I'm about to descend
Didn't know you were close to breakin'
So you thought it should end
Left it all for a new location
So you could start up again
So keep smilin' till then

I'm a million miles away from it all
And let it go right over my head
Let 'em chase and the winner take all
And let it go right over my head
Right now I want some peace of mind
So let it go right over my head
Just want to give myself a little more time
And every single word that you said
Went over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head

Close the door, let me please
Get to my bed
I wanna take stock, see my life
In perspective
Tomorrow I'll be back in the race, till then
Live and let live
So let all the anger pass me by
Over my head
Over my head
Over my head
