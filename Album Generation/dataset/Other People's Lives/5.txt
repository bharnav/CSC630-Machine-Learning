Hey, my friend
You can't run away from time
They say you can't fight fate
Time won't wait
You can't run away from time

And time is the avenger
But why should we just surrender to it?
Why go through it?

Run run run run run run run away
Let's run away from time
Run run run run run run run away

Girl, you and me
We've got to set ourselves free this time
We must try to escape because it's never too late
Liberation is ours to find

Hey, hey let's run away
Let's run away from time
Hey, hey let's run away

Hey, girl
Let's run away from time
We've still got mountains to climb
A day at a time
It's never too late, so why should we wait?

Take me
Save me
Maybe, baby
Run run run away
Run run run away
Run run run away

The world is too obsessed by the counting(?) requests
For the fountain of youth they will never find
And time is the avenger
But why should we just surrender to it?
Why go through it?

Run run run run run run run away
Let's run away from time
Run run run run run run run away
Run run run away
Run run run away

Run run run away
Run run run away
