Things are gonna change
This is the morning after
When reality bites
The morality kicks in
To those damaged limitations

This is the morning after
All that went before
All of the song and laughter
The morning after, gets up from the floor
To do it all again

But things are gonna change
This is the morning after
My turn to get pushed in the face
Feeling right down, resurrecting the clown
Yeah I bloody well will
You look around for which way to go
But where you gonna turn?

And when the morning after
Pleads to take no more
We patch up the last disaster
Slower, faster, crawl out through the door
And do it all again
But things have gotta change
This is the morning after

You feel shite, the air bites
Oh will I ever learn?
Your ear's deaf, your girl's left
Never to return
But it's the morning after
All that went before
And now you paid your debt
Get up you wreck, and crawl out through the door
Oh, love will return

This is the morning after
You will learn
The barrier we cross
Is somewhere between Heaven and Hell
Ah, but the world will never change
So we must dig inside, and crawl outside ourselves
I will, I bloody well will
Things are gonna change

Things are gonna change
This is the morning after

I will, I bloody well will
Things are gonna change
