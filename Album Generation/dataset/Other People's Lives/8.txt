Every time I hear that lonesome train roll down the track
Going away to unknown destinations
I believe there's someone out there making the great escape
Just moving on, suddenly gone and so unexpectedly

It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought, it just comes over you
And it's a shadow on a sidewalk, someone like you
In a blink of an eye, waving goodbye
It's time you made your getaway

In a suburb somewhere someone's quietly planning their getaway
Traveling light, in case they might get a change of heart
It's the bravest move they'll ever make, but they have to make the break
That's the risk that they take, so don't hesitate, then so unexpectedly

It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought, it just comes over you
And it's a shadow on the sidewalk, someone you knew
It's time you made your getaway

It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought, it just comes over you
And it's a shadow on the sidewalk, someone like you
It's time you made your getaway

You'll make the great escape
Get out that door before it's too late
Hear that lonesome train
The lonesome train
