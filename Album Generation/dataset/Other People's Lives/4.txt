You caught me with my pants down
But I was only taking a shower
Still you looked for the evidence
Like the smell of perfume, or lipstick on my collar
You're always suspicious, and terrified I'd made a mistake
We are such creatures of little faith
We are such creatures of little faith

And when I come home late, you always ask me
"Have you been drinking?"
"I swear I've been working"
You say I'm lying as if you know just what I'm thinking
You say you don't trust me, and you quiz me till I finally break
Oh, we are such creatures of little faith
Such creatures of little faith

You say that love is blind
I wish you were out of sight, and out of mind
I take you out fist fighting(?)
But still I find you keep looking for those telltale signs

I didn't mean to follow you
But I suspected you were meeting somebody
I was playing detective
Thought you were fooling around, now it's too late to say I'm sorry
Still I'm optimistic, my trust has not been betrayed
Forgive me
I'm still a sad creature of little faith
We are such creatures of little faith

And all we need
All we need
All we need is a little bit of faith
We are such creatures of little faith
Such creatures of little faith

Don't you know that
A little bit of faith can be such a beautiful thing?
