You've cut it down
Down to the bone
You begin to spite yourself and all that still surrounds
You've been deceived now
By what you've sold
Truth gave way to consequence and left you all alone

(Chorus)
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When i was holding you I think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
Its killing me so slowly i think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight

These streets seem empty
Not a ghost in sight
You walk alone now while you become one with night
Black cold and heartless. You'll reap what you sew
Truth gave way to consequence and left you all alone

(Chorus)
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When i was holding you I think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
Its killing me so slowly i think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight

This ghost
This town
Has been turned upside down
I don't want to believe
But this ghost is all i see
(x2)

(Chorus)
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When i was holding you I think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
Its killing me so slowly i think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
