(One Two Three GO!)

You can't be saved
You've gone and dug your grave
And its getting deeper by the minute
Well you had to turn your back
Ain't cutting you no slack
Hooked on your lies you had me going

So give me one
Good reason I should be forgivin' you when I don't care anyway
So give me two
Good reasons I should be forgivin' you when I'm the victim today

You threw it all away
Still gettin high today
You'll crash and burn before you know it (Yeah)
Addicted to your lies
Think I've been victimized
Same day same night same situation

So give me one
Good reason I should be forgivin' you when I don't care anyway
So give me two
Good reasons I should be forgivin' you when I'm the victim today

GO!

And I feel like I'm the victim
And I feel like I'm the victim

I feel like I have be criticized (yeah yeah)
By every little thing you say
Now I don't really care cause you're the one thats going down
And now I've left you here for dead

So give me one
Good reason I should be forgivin' you when I don't care anyway
So give me two
Good reasons I should be forgivin' you when I'm the victim today

So give me one
Good reason I should be forgivin' you when I don't care anyway
So give me two
Good reasons I should be forgivin' you when I'm the victim today

So give one
Good reason I should be forgivin' you
So give me two
Good reasons I should be forgivin' you

And I feel like I'm the victim
