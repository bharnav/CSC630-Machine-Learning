Three days gone by in the desert
I've broken down on the side of the road
The cops drive by and the dust starts rollin'
Will I ever find my way back home?

Beaten down, I can't stand up now
I see it all flash before my eyes
Beaten down, can I give up?
'Cause it's only three more days 'til I die

I'm highway bound for
Another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and
It's over where I'm going

I see your face but I can't decide now
If it's real or just in my mind
I see your face, and it says with a smile
"Welcome to hell, 'cause this is where you'll die"

I'm highway bound for
Another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound now
I can't drive

I'm highway bound for
Another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and
It's over where I'm going

I don't know where I'm going

Bleed, let me bleed
Until there's no more life left, left in me

Bleed, (bleed) let me bleed (bleed)
Now this love is gone, so just bury me
Bleed, (bleed) I said bleed, (bleed)
Now this love is gone, so just bury me

I'm highway bound for
Another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound now
I can't drive

I'm highway bound for
Another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and
It's over where I'm going

Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed

Bleed, (bleed) let me bleed, (bleed)
Until there's no more life left, left in me

Bleed, (bleed) let me bleed (bleed)
Now this love is gone, so just bury me
Bleed, (bleed) I said bleed, (bleed)
Now this love is gone, so just bury me

Bleed, bleed, bleed
It's over but I'm going
Bleed, bleed, bleed
It's over where I'm going
Bleed, bleed, bleed
It's over but I'm going

It's over where I'm going
It's over but I'm going
Down
