We'll be tonightless

We can't wait another moment
Our time will come before we know it (before we know it)
With your heart you got to open up this time
I don't want to be alone tonight

Am I gonna be tonightless again?
Although the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet
But you don't have to go, so please don't leave

Our souls are lost without each other
We got to find some time to recover (to recover)
If you hold me close, this heartache will subside
I don't want to be alone tonight

Am I gonna be tonightless again?
Although the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet
But you don't have to go, so please don't leave

We'll be tonightless
We'll be tonight

We'll be tonightless
We'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless
We'll be tonight (You know me well, you know me well)
We'll be tonightless
We'll be tonight (You know me well, you know me well)
We'll be tonightless (We'll be tonightless, baby)
We'll be tonight (You know me well, you know me well)
