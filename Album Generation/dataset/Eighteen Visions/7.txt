On a bed of rusted nails I lay
Just waiting for the sun to fade

Well I tried to escape this
But I'm lost inside, I'm lost forever
Well I tried to escape this
But I've lost my mind, so God please save me

Will I fly away?
Into the night?
Will I fly away?
Am I dreaming again?

I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I think it's over now
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now

My head is racing through the night
Comatose don't feel alright

Well I've got an obsession
For the pain inside and it's destruction
Well I've got an obsession
Now the pain is gone, so God please save me

Will I fly away?
Into the night?
Will I fly away?
Am I dreaming again?

I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I think it's over now
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now

And now I'm comatose again

Will I fly away?
Will I fly away?

I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I think it's over now
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now
