You're so meaningless and forgettable
You gotta figure it out
Figure it out and let it go

You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say
But don't think that I don't know

We wanna bleed for more
We never wanna get old
We don't wanna get lost in the fashion
Come on

You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say
But don't think that I don't know

This is your fantasy
This is your darkest dream
And it's just become your nightmare
We'll smash your fantasy
'Cause it's not what it seems
And it's just become your nightmare

You'll be the one dropping to your knees
Begging for us to put you at ease
When the light goes on
The darkness will subside
You'll be the one running for your life

This is your fantasy
This is your darkest dream
And it's just become your nightmare
We'll smash your fantasy
'Cause it's not what it seems
And it's just become your nightmare

You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say
But don't think that I don't know

Yeah, you're so damned pathetic
You're so meaningless
