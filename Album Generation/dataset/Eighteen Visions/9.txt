I remember all the time you spent with me
It broke my heart to see you go
And I remember those times that you were there for me
And I remember the drive home (I remember the drive home)

Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone

I remember always looking up to you
But you were never looking down (You were never looking down)
And I remember that warm September afternoon
And I remember all the sounds (And I remember all the sounds)

Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone

Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night I didn't get to say goodbye

You meant the world to me
And I know we will be together in the end forever baby (In the end forever baby)
I'm feeling so alone now, more then I've ever been
I just want to feel you in arms again

Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone

Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night I didn't get to say goodbye
