We have returned to the edge of our lives
To gaze deeply within the meaning to just why we're here
Look deep inside all your miserable minds
Only then you will find the meaning to why you are here
There is no truth though you try to rebuke
What you're told, what you learn every day
Face it, you're fucked, you don't know when to stop
But your stop, it awaits the point in time that you step off
You are standing on the edge of all eternity
You can't see the black abyss and you can feel no peace
Plague at your door
Death and pure war
A world unkind
Is what you find
Transfixed by the torture
You can't turn back
On the edge of darkness
You're trapped, you're gagged, you're silent
Staring at the illness
That fills your world
Balance of existence
Offset, severed, it's no more
Everything is turned upside down
An abyss where nothing is found
Overcome, your shocked in terror
It's not real, it's just a vision
Plague at your door
Death and pure war
Blindly staring
In the abyss
Take one step and you fall
Forever
Never to return - no
Slipping into the darkness
Fill your void with nothing
Life deranged
Through your mind you're falling
Staring into the abyss
Just forget that you're sick
Just forget that you're dead
Your world has left you now you can't find your way
You're plunging faster
Forgotten eternity
Of hate and regressions
Finally you hit the ground
Finally you obtain what you never found
Peering up the black slopes
Covered in flesh and blood
Human rage, souls deranged
Wanting out of this hell there's no way out
Look up to see the light
Up to see the might
You fell into night

Fall - on the brink of death
Fall down with the rest
Force you to confess
Stand - up to face the truth
Lost within your youth
Nothing to refute
Run - dive into your grave
The whole world has caved
Into what you made
Just forget that you're dead
Just forget where you're lead
Your world has left you now you become my prey
Your - my possession
Forgotten eternities
Of hate and regression
Finally you hit the ground
Finally I obtain what - you never found
Clawing up the thorned slopes
Covered with flesh and blood
Human rage, souls obtained
Wanting out of this hell - screaming skywards
