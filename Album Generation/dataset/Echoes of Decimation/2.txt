Death-has come to you
Nothing left to do
Fire - coming at you from all ways
Burned - still alive
Screaming silent cries
Crawling - out to see your fallen world
Flames - fill the sky
Everything will die
The burner - of all worlds has come to you
Gone - nothing gained
Nothing is the same
Failed - burning your flesh where you lie
Now say your prayers
Now is your time to atone
This is your last day
And you will die all alone
Take your last breath
Burning as your lungs explode
The deadly flash
Melting both your eyes away
Burning all your lives away
Burning all your cries away
Burning all your minds away
Burning all your eyes away
Death not dignified
Burning all your lives away
Death not dignified
Burning all your cries away
Death not dignified
Burning all you minds away
Death not dignified
Burning all your eyes away
Scourging the earth to rebuild it for only me
Reface the world to do just as I please with it
The burner set to destroy just what I see in you
The burner sent has erased what I hate in you
The sky black for all time
Now - nothing will exist again
Barren, void, of all life
Empty - now until eternity
Sky is black for all time
Now - nothing will exist again
Barren, void, no more life
Empty - now unto infinity
