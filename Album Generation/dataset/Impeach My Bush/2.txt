If you're gonna something
You've gotta do it full on
Hardcore, like this

Wanna get you home, wanna make ya moan
Wanna get you in my pleasure dome
Wanna make it hot, get your pistol cocked
Gonna get ya if you're ready or not

Wanna chew the fat
Wanna hit your back
What d'ya say to that?

Pardon me but please
On you hands and knees

Let's hit it hard
Now you're in charge
You wanna roll
Then take control
Get up on the floor
Show me what its for
Wanna score
Por favor
Come on rock it hardcore

Wanna bring back sling back, tickle fight
Wanna do it, do it, do it right
Make a women a man and a man can-can
I think your Mac needs a lot more RAM
Be my Moog and I'll twiddle your knobs
Be my corn and I'll nibble your cob
Now take these apples and start to bob
You play The Cure and I'll grab and rob

Lets hit it hard (lets hit it hard)
Now you're in charge (now you're in charge)
You wanna roll (you wanna roll)
Then take control (then take control)

You wanna go (let's go)

Wanna hear ya hum my ding a ling
Gonna help ya stick but not cling
Lets break on out of this Sing Sing
Do me a favor and hold that thing

Some people think I'm conduit
Wondering if I'm getting it
Well now ya know I don't have to prove it
Stay a while and I'll get to move it

I wanna feel your lust
I know I'm gonna bust
It's a must must must
Tell the others, eat your dust

Lets hit it hard (lets hit it hard)
Now you're in charge (now you're in charge)
You wanna roll (you wanna roll)
Then take control (then take control)

You wanna go (let's go)
Then let me know (let me know)
You want it bad (how bad?)
You never had it so (you never had it so)
