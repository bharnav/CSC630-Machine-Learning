Shock shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock

Lenny showed me something
It could make you cry
Don't you worry baby
Just give it a try
Gonna let you in a little secret
You gotta learn this little trick
Get your hands and your fingers ready
Stop relying on your dick

You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock gotta rock rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)

Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out
Lyrics

Wanna wind her up like a hurdy gurdy?
You can put your finger on it
Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty
Gonna make you feel supersonic
Boys oh boys, I'll give you something to really flunt
Toys, no toys I'll show you what, what a girl wants
Get into the groove, don't forget to move
(close your eyes, watch out, come on give it a try)

You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock gotta rock rock rock rock the shocker (shocker, shocker)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (don't be shy)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (come on now, we'll all do it together)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker (come on, get your hands ready)
You gotta rock rock rock the shocker

Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back (gotta rock the shocker, rock the shocker)
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back (gotta rock the shocker, rock the shocker)
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back (gotta rock the shocker, rock the shocker)
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back (gotta rock rock rock rock rock the shocker)

Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock
Rock, rock, rock, shock

Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
Thumbs up fingers out, pull back, pull back
