[Verse 1]
You've got them all by the balls
Causing waterfalls, Stonewalls, bar brawls
Climbing stalls at concert halls

[Verse 2]
To you they crawl, body sprawl
Smoking Pall Malls, close call, stand tall
Doll, you make them feel so small
(And they love it)

[Chorus]
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)

I wanna be her
Yes I do

[Verse 3]
The way you rock, nonstop
Girl, you got the chops
Flip flop, she bop, self-taught
You look so hot

[Verse 4]
Are you conceived, kids receive
Crawling up the sleeve
Parents peeve, can't conceive
That her deed we'll never leave
(And we love it)

[Chorus]
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her

I wanna be her
So do you
