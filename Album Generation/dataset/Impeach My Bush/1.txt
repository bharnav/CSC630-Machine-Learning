[Intro]
The tent so big
The tent so big
The tent so big
The tent so big

[Verse 1]
I see something in your pants that can't be real
Don't hold back, baby, tell me what's the deal
I gotta move in closer and cop a feel
Oh my, you got something with mass appeal

The tent so big in your pants, baby
The tent so big in your pants

[Verse 2]
If there's a housing crisis and there ain't anymore
Need a place to go, you gotta open the door
Wanna stay the night, pull up a floor
Wanna feel alright, party galore

You got a tense gig down in France, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby
The kids need something romance, baby
Come on, let's take a chance (ooh)

[Chorus]
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
Gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
I'm gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby

[Verse 3]
I'm inviting Shereen, Connie and Dean
Girls and boys everywhere wanna make the scene
There's a pole in the middle and it's made out of wood
We should all dance around it, we would if we could

Start the pole dancing, sliding up and down
Get to romancing, down, down to the ground
Start the pole dancing, sliding up and down
Get to romancing, down, down to the ground

[Chorus]
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
I'm gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
I'm gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby

[Bridge]
You lick the pole when it's cold and your tongue'll stick
So keep the party pumpin' and thumpin' and shit
Rubbin' the club, legs in between
Lovin' the scrub, keepin' it clean
We're gonna wash that pole
We're gonna wash that pole
We're gonna wash that pole
Scrub that pole, wash that pole

[Chorus]
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
I'm gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby
The tent's so big in your pants, baby
I'm gonna bring my friends for a dance, baby
Gonna sell those tickets advance, baby
An immense gig up in your pants, baby

[Outro]
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
Hurts so good I got a soregasm
