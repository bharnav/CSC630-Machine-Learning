[Intro]
Better know your hanky code
Before you go and shoot your load

Excuse me
What's that hanging out of your pocket?
Do you actually know what that means?

[Verse 1]
Boy, can you tell me that you don't really know?
I've seen it all too many times
You can't tell me that you never heard
'Cuz it's been all over line

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you a left? Or are you right?
Are you switching just for tonight?
I don't even know all the codes, but
Baby, you better find out before you go

And, if you wear it, you too
They're gonna come to you

[Chorus]
To the left, and to the right
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?
On the left, or on the right
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?

What you got in your pocket? Tell me
Do you know what that means?
What you got in your pocket, baby?
Is it yellow, blue, or green?

[Verse 2]
If you're wearing gold lamee, you better work out all day
If you're wearing black on the right, you know you're gonna hurt tonight
Red, to the wrist, pink, give it twist
Gray, you're gonna be tied up, you can't resist, but
If you're wearing blue, what shade is it, baby?
You better know what to do

[Chorus]
To the left, and to the right
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?
On the left, or on the right
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?

Could be red, or could be white
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?
Cutting loose, or sitting tight
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?

[Verse 3]
Orange on the right means not tonight, but oh-oh
On the left means anything goes
Uncut, brown, lace, light blue, use your face
Olive tone, you love a man in uniform

[Chorus]
On the left, or on the right
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?
Could be red, or could be white
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?

Cutting loose, or sitting tight
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?
Fly the flag and you'll invite
Don't you know you better know your hanky code tonight?

[Outro]
What you got in your pocket, baby?
What you got in your pocket, baby?

Better know your hanky code
