[Verse 1: Peaches]
Come over here, hot boys, don't you worry I'm nice
Have you ever heard about a woman named Heidi Fleiss?
I got a lusty proposition that I know will suffice
Let me lay out the conditions that I know will entice

I wanna take you home get you satisfied
Drugged out, sexed up, however you fly
Just one thing I can't compromise
I wanna see you work it guy on guy

I wanna see you boys get down with each other
I wanna see you do your little nasty brother
Just one thing I can't compromise
I wanna see you work it guy on guy
On guy, guy, guy, guy

[Hook: Peaches and Beth Ditto]
Two guys for every girl, every girl

[Verse 2: Peaches]
Once you boys get started you'll be at it for hours
Come on boys, I know you're not that coward
Just remember: an ass is an ass
So roll over have yourselves a blast

Don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid to lap up the Venus
Don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid to fill up my bag
Don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid to be a wet freak
But it's time for the brothers to take a pass

[Chorus: Peaches and Beth Ditto]
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl

[Verse 3: Peaches]
Working both bones and I'm not in the set
I'm waiting while you're lickin' suckin' breakin' a sweat
Just when you realize there's nothing left to regret
Move on over, number one's about to rock it

I'll slink in when you boys are in a French knot
We play a game it's like you're gonna get caught
That's the time you're gonna get so damn hot
You wanna see my pussy pop pop pop pop

I'll be hitting your bottom you'll be blowing your top
Hittin' bottom blowing your top
Hittin' bottom blowing your top
Hittin' bottom blowing your top

[Chorus: Peaches and Beth Ditto]
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl

[Verse 4: Peaches]
No no no baby; I ain't carrying mace
Did you feel something just spray in your face?

He's covered in marmalade
He's covered in marmalade
He's covered in marmalade
He's covered in marmalade

Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face
Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face

[Chorus: Peaches and Beth Ditto]
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl
Two guys for every girl, every girl

[Verse 5: Peaches]
Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face
Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face
Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face
Slappin' those dicks all over the place
Rubbin' that shit all up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
Up in your face
