Shed off and peel
I'm in no shape or form
You just reject coming down for more

When two are receiving
You know I could be there
Soon you're laughing
Soon you're laughing my way

Your daddy don't get you
A heap in a big mess
Soon you're laughing
Soon you're laughing my way

You're urban, you're complex
And you know I will be there
Soon you're laughing
Soon you're laughing your way

When you lost on the stoop
When you fall out of bounds
Yeah, you could be leaving this downtown

And it's always your fault
You get lost in yourself
Yeah, you could be leaving this downtown

And I can find you
Once you know about this plan
And now I can find you once you insult the man
And yeah, you like this trash talking washing you down
And yeah, you like this trash talking moving you around

When two are receiving
You know I could be there
Soon you're laughing
Soon you're laughing your way again

When you lost in the stoop
When you lied out of bounds
Yeah, you could be leaving this downtown

But it's always your fault
You get lost on the stupid things
When you leave this downtown

Well, I can find you lonely without a plan
And now I can find you once you insult the man
And yeah, you like this trash talking washing you down
And yeah, you like this trash talking moving through all
And stand alone again

Now when you lost in the stoop
When you lied out of bounds
Yeah, you could be leaving this downtown

But it's always your fault
You get lost on the stupid things
When you leave this downtown
