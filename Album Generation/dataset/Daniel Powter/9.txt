My direction's a problem with your friends
Understand my point of view
I'm not bothered, I'll break before I'll bend
Give me life, give me life for what I do

I can't remember if everything is the same
What you think that I should be
You push me backwards, I played the stupid game
Give me life, give me life for what I say

In the moment that you lose yourself
You wish that you were someone else
And the only thing that comes apart
To take us back from where we start

'Cause I got no excuses for the way I talk to you
But you don't compromise, you're nothing new
Let's get together to see what we've become
Give me life, give me life for what I have done

What's the answer, we fall between the cracks
I'll be happy when we sink
I was promised if you're through with us
Give me life, give me life for what I think

In the moment that you lose yourself
You wish that you were someone else
And whatever else is going on
Everyone will know once you're halfway gone

You got no excuses for the way you're treating me
And I don't compromise too easily
Let's stay together to see what we've become
Give me life, give me life for what I have done

Give me life, give me life for what I have done
Give me life, give me life for what I have done
