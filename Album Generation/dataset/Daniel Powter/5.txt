[Verse 1]
Jimmy you know
Everybody hates you when you're living off rock n' roll
So you get high tonight
And Jimmy you lied
I wonder if you could ever get yourself back here alive
So you get high tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you don't need nobody to make it on your own
You don't need nobody you'd rather be alone

[Chorus]
So Jimmy gets high tonight
And Jimmy gets high tonight
I must confess I'm a real live wire
Jimmy you and me will get along awhile
Jimmy gets high tonight

[Verse 2]
Jimmy you lied
I'm hoping that soon maybe life it don't pass you by
So Jimmy gets high tonight
And Jimmy you know
Everybody hates you when you're living off rock n' roll
So you get high tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you don't need nobody to make it on your own
You don't need nobody you'd rather be alone

[Chorus]
So Jimmy gets high tonight
And Jimmy gets high tonight
I must confess I'm a real live wire
Jimmy you and me will get along awhile
So Jimmy gets high tonight

[Bridge]
I've been so confused
And I just hope it all gets back to you

[Outro]
So Jimmy you get high tonight
I must confess I'm a real live wire
Jimmy you and me will get along awhile
So Jimmy gets high tonight
And I hope that you'll be alright
Jimmy gets high tonight
And I hope that you'll be alright

And Jimmy you know
Everybody hates you when you're living off rock n' roll
So you get high
