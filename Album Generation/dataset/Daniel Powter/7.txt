Hey hey, well this could be cool
'Cause we could be together
And nothing lasts forever
And me, I'll be your fool
Pick you up when you fall down
And when you are cross the dance floor
Let me buy you a drink or two

And you could be my star for weekends
Do you like your Hollywood
As far as I'm concerned
The lesson's been learned
At least that's what I understood

That's right
Hey, tell your daddy not to wait up
You're not coming home
You're all mine
And that's fine
I'll keep you by my side
Oh, fill you up with all my lies

And when you are across the dance floor
Let me buy you a drink or two

And you could be my star for weekends
Do you like your Hollywood
As far as I'm concerned
The lesson's been learned
At least that's what I understood
Come on

Write them a letter
That you're not coming back
These days ain't been good
But then these days ain't so bad
Sooner or later when you come around
If you got these problems
Then I'll let you down

Let me be your star for weekends
And do you like your Hollywood
As far as I'm concerned
The lesson's been learned
At least that's what I understood

Let me be your star for weekends
Do you like your Hollywood
As far as I'm concerned
The lesson's been learned
At least that's what I understood
