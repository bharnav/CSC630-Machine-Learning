[Verse 1]
I got lost out there in this world
Looking for a brand new way to fall down
It's no surprise that things gotten worse
And I thank God you never let me drown

[Chorus]
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home

[Verse 2]
While I was having the time of my life
I think my soul died a little every day
I always called to say I'm sorry
You said it's okay
But you should be through it all
You never walked away

[Chorus]
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home

[Bridge]
Into the arms of my angel
Into the peace I left behind
All I had to do to save my own life
Was to look into your eyes

[Chorus]
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven (to find my angel)

[Outro]
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I just had to go home
I just had to go home
I just had to go home
