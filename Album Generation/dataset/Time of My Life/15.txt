[Chorus 1]
Put me on a train mama
This place just ain't the same no more
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today
I don't wanna watch the world spinnin'
I wanna be spinnin' with it
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more
Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine

[Chorus 1]
Put me on a train mama
'Cause I can't take this pain no more
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today
And there's a world that's out there waiting
And I know that it's the chance I'm taking
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more
Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine

[Bridge]
God knows how long I'll be gone
But maybe one day a train will bring me home
Put me on a train mama
Put me on a train mama
Oh, put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more
Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine

[Outro]
Oh, put me on the train
'Cause I'm leaving today
