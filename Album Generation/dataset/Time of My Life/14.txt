[Verse 1]
This world asks for so much
Despite what you give it's just never enough
Then you're left cold tired and alone
Searching for something that's already gone
You try not to be afraid
Bound down by all of these things that they say
And you feel like you're all by yourself
But I’ll be right here when there's nothing else

[Chorus]
Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe
From the storms and the rain
And from all of your pain
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains
Only the silence remains

[Verse 2]
Your fears they know that you're scared
Wherever you go they seem to meet you there
And you face them all on your own
Never the weak always the strong
And you win most of the time
Never once claiming that victory's mine
And you carry this burden alone
But this candle's burned at both ends for so long

[Chorus]
Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe
From the storms and the rain
And from all of your pain
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains
Only the silence remains

[Bridge]
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down

[Chorus]
Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe
From the storms and the rain
And from all of your pain
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains
Only the silence remains
Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe
From the storms and the rain
And from all of your pain
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains
Only the silence remains
