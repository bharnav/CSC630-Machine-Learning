[Verse 1]
So far away from knowing where I am going
I am trying hard to find out who I am
They all say that I don't know what I am doing
I say they don't hardly understand

[Hook]
Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone
When you're young

[Chorus]
You give what you give 'cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you
It's already over and done
When you're young

[Verse 2]
Everything seems perfect (everything seems perfect)
Everything's OK (everything's OK)
It will all get better now (get better now)
At least that's what they say
But I don't see it coming

[Chorus]
You give what you give cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you
It's already over and done
When you're young

[Bridge]
Days never seem longer
They say it's better this way
I hope one day I am stronger than I feel
And I hope that it feels different than today

[Chorus 2]
You give what you give cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you
It's already over and done
It's already over and done
It's already over and done
When you're young

[Hook]
Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone
When you're young
