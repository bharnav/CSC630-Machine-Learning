[Verse 1]
It's going to rain some days I know
And things are going to hurt sometimes that's for sure
But I won't get turned around cause I keep moving on
I think my mind plays tricks on me
Cause sometimes what I get ain't what I see
I just turn it upside down and I keep moving on

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to race for the morning sun
I can't wait for the day that's on it's way
I'm going to race for the morning sun
And it's going to shine on me
Oh, it's going to shine

[Verse 2]
I'm going to take everything I want
And won't get lost in what I don't
I just hide it all inside and I keep moving on

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to race for the morning sun
I can't wait for the day that's on it's way
I'm going to race for the morning sun
And it's going to shine on me
Oh, it's going to shine

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it's going to shine a light right down on me
And I swear I’ll find where I want to be
And I’ll live the day like it's the only one
I'm going to race for the sun
Oh, it's going to shine a light right down on me
And I swear I’ll find where I want to be
And I’ll live the day like it's the only one
I'm going to race for the sun
Oh, it's going to shine a light right down on me
And I swear I’ll find where I want to be
And I’ll live the day like it's the only one
I'm going to race for the sun
