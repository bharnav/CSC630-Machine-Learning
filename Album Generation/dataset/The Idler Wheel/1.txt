[Verse 1]
I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, I'm caught on the hot
Not so with the warmer lot
And all I want's a confidante
To help me laugh it off

[Chorus]
And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

[Verse 2]
Say I'm an airplane
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing
And I use them to give me a lift
Hip hip for the lift
Hip hip for the drag
I want them all in my bag
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift

[Chorus]
And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

[Bridge]
Seek me out
Look at, look at, look at, look at me
I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up
Give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

[Verse 3]
Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you
And never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
Skirtin' the skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

[Chorus]
And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone
