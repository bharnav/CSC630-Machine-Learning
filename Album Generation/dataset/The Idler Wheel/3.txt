Jonathan, call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while I calculate
And calibrate and heaven's sake
Don't make me explain

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything

[Verse 2]
Jonathan, anything
And anyone that you have done
Has gotta be alright with me
If she's part of
The reason you are how you are
She's alright with me

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything

[Bridge]
You'd like to captain a capsized ship
But I like watching you live

[Verse 3]
Jonathan, call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while I calculate
And calibrate and heaven's sake
Don't make me explain

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
