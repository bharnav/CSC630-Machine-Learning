If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise
If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise

He excites me
Must be like the Genesis of Rhythm
I get feisty
Whenever I'm with him
If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise

If I get a chance I’m gonna show him that
He’s never gonna need another, never need another
