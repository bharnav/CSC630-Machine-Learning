Before you knew me
An angel came to me
I wrestled him down to the ground
He said he could cure me I said
That don’t worry me now

Those angels just bore me
The same old damn story
They were lost oh but now they been found
Ain’t nobody lookin but
That don’t worry me now

I live by the sound
Of devils in flight
I travel alone
In the cold
In the dead of
The deep dark night

So if Jesus is comin
He’d better start runnin
I don’t really think he’ll be proud
And I won’t get to heaven but
That don’t worry me now

I live by the sound
Of devils in flight
I travel alone I
In the cold
In the dead of
The deep dark night

And if flocks of the best
Will sing me to my rest
I’ll never get used to that sound
Just give me Sam Cooke singin

That don’t worry me now
