I'm gone

There are things i will do for a hatchet job, too
Ante up, there's a new kid in town
But it won't take long for what's red hot and blonde
To be ashes on the ground

And men headin' skyline, with a bet and a byline
Have come to cradle your face
And i won't be the last one to commit crimes of passion
With a shootout and a chase

Mmm, over and over and over and over
Back in, back in, keep hanging on

Going once, going twice, mercy god, jesus christ
And i'm gone, and i'm gone, and i'm gone

Well, nothing has changed since the last time i came
And my pride and my hat in my hand
And i never sleep well and i still kiss and tell
And i do not pay the band

Over and over and over and over
Back in, back in, i keep hanging on
Going once, going twice, mercy god, jesus christ
And i'm gone, i'm gone, i'm gone
And i'm gone, and i'm gone, i'm gone
