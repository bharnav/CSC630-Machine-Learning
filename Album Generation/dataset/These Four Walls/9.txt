It's a beautiful flower in your garden
But the most beautiful by far
Is the one growing wild in the garbage dump
Even here, even here we are

It's the song of the bird way up in the sky
But the most beautiful by far
Is the scream of the man who never learned to fly
Even here, even here we are
Even here, even here we are

When the sun shines bright, it's a beautiful sight
But the most beautiful by far
Is the blind girl alone, the angel of the night
Even here, even here we are

It's a beautiful flower in your garden
But the most beautiful by far
Is the one growing wild in the garbage dump
Even here, even here we are
Even here, even here we are
Even here, even here we are
