I put on my finest summer dress
So light and thin it was my best
I brushed my hair I held my breath
I went out to face the wilderness
I went out to face the wilderness

The men in hats the boys on bikes
The perfect girls the baby dykes
The superstars the blighted ones
I went out to face them one by one
I went out to face them one by one

Goodbye MaryAnn
As you turn to watch me
Don't cry MaryAnn
And don't try to stop me

I'm gonna go where the lights are bright

Where sacred secrets sail like kites
We've been sleeping girl all our lives
And we never lived we just survived
We never lived we just survived

Are there thieves and beggars saints and liars
Are there thieves and beggars saints and liars?

Goodbye MaryAnn
As you turn to watch me
Don't cry MaryAnn
And don't try to stop me

I put on my finest summer dress
So light and thin torn at my chest
I brushed my hair I held my breath
I went out to face the wilderness
I went out to face the wilderness
