Oh Cinnamon Road
That's where we would go
To try and feel better

Oh hot summer breeze
Tops of the trees
Reachin forever

So you take all the things that you felt then
And never did show
With a picture in your head of somebody
That you never did know
Put em all in a box and you leave em
Down Cinnamon Road
But all the money in the world is never gonna
Let you go

Oh where did you go

Cinnamon Road
I wanna feel better

Oh bibles and beads
Stacks of degrees
Reachin forever

So you take all the things that you felt then
And never did show
With a picture in your head of somebody
That you never did know
Put em all in a box and you leave em
Down Cinnamon Road
But all the money in the world is never gonna
Let you go

All them money in the world...
