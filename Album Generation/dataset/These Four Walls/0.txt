Fill me up , fill me up I'm a long way from home and I don't have a lot to say
Fill me up , fill me up cause you're all that I've got and I traveled a long, long way

Cheer me up, cheer me up cause I'm all alone and I'm takin it day by day
Cheer me up, cheer me up cause you're all that I've got and I traveled a long, long way

I'm a bell, hop an el on a busy day and I'm starting at sunrise
And the color of dawn from this plane that I'm on is the day breaking in your eyes

I'm a still life from hell on a tabletop I'm a case study in French blue
And it's clear to me now that the whole of my life I've been making my way to you

And I know where you live and I know who you are
Don't get too close and don't go too far

Well I might be alright if I just see the light, I don't care if the phone don't ring
And I know when it's right by a voice in the night and the right shade of tangerine

Fill me up , fill me up I'm a long way from home and I don't have a lot to say
Cheer me up, cheer me up cause you're all that I've got and I traveled a long, long way

And I know where you live and I know who you are
So don't get too close and don't go too far
Don't get too close and promise me that you'll never go too far
Never go too far

Fill me up , fill me up I'm a long way from home and I don't have a lot to say
Fill me up, fill me up cause you're all that I got and I traveled a long, long way

Cheer me up, cheer me up cause I'm all alone and I'm takin it day by day
Fill me up, fill me up cause you're all that I've got and I've traveled a long, long way
But I've traveled a long, long way
Yeah I traveled a long, long way
