[Verse 1: Paolo Nutini]
Picking up the pieces of the wreck you went and left
And I'm dealing with dilemmas
In my now so stressful life
And I'm drinking stronger spirits
I made my home here on the floor
And I'm losing all ambition and goals
I'm going all out
I'm thinking you're just as bad

[Chorus]
No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

[Verse 2]
Oh remember at 16
Oh the crazy drunken night we had
When I kissed you in the hallway
Then I took you straight to bed
Oh two years on
And I'm still that same boy I was

[Chorusx2]
No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

[Bridge]
You might blame it on me
But you insisted that we fall
Wiped your hands of me
And said you needed more, more, more

[Chorusx2]
No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

[Outro]
Wo woah woah woah
Wo woah woah woah
Wo wo woah
Can't we just rewind
