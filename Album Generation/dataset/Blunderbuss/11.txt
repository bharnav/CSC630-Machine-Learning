[Verse 1]
The sun and the moon never change
They just rearrange, the night and the new day
Gold exchanges for silver
And a light on a river gets carried away

[Chorus]
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

[Verse 2]
I lift up my head and I wonder
Just who it is calming, callin' my name now
I trip on my way and I blunder
My head fallin' under a blanket of shame

[Chorus]
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

[Bridge]
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going

[Verse 3]
The people around me won't let me
Become what I need to, they want me the same
I look at myself and I want to
Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name

[Verse 4]
The stones in the sky never worry
They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say

[Chorus]
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

[Outro]
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
