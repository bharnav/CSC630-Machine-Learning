I know the stars that shine on me
Are brighter than you or I may ever be
I know there's an answer to your question
But I don't know that I could word it right

Say what you mean
Don't tell it like it could be
I'm not sure, should I just say it out loud?
Say what you mean
Don't tell it like it could be
Right at this time, I'm gonna keep that in mind

One love, is better than not enough
I'd rather have no love, than messing with the wrong stuff

Just the comfort of strangers
Always the comfort of strangers
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know the sun that shines on me
Has better times than you or I may ever be
I know there's an answer to the question
But I'm not sure that I should word it right

Say what you mean
Don't tell it like it could be
Every time you're gonna set me free
Say what you mean
Don't tell it like it could be
Right, this time, let's take it right home to see

One love is better than not enough
I'd rather have no love than messing with the wrong stuff
It's just the comfort of strangers
Oh, it's the comfort of strangers

Why, some of those are like best friends, best friends
Ones that keep you coming round again
