There’s a bridge cross my stream
Never seems to get broken
Never could, never would
Never clouds up my day
See I wanted to give
Then I just couldn’t take it
I wanted to love
And I turned ‘round and hated it

If I ever knew I tried to tell
Give of my heart but I never sell
Supermarket of the soul
Heartland truckstop, global mall
Taking flights of indifference
‘Cross a wide screen sky
Could feel so alive
You might think that you had died

I’m not skating on ice
See, I’m walking on water
And silence is finest
Don’t give me your word
Yes, silence speaks louder
C’mon give me a word
I don’t want nobody knowing
How the hurt in me works

If they ever knew they might just sell
Give of my heart then never tell
Supermarket of the soul
Heartland truckstop, global mall
And the one thing that is certain
Is the one uncertainty
If we keep doing the same thing
Nothing will work out differently

We’re all bridge builders’ daughters
With incestuous dreams
Confidentially speaking
All is as it seems

Confidentially speaking
All is as it seems
