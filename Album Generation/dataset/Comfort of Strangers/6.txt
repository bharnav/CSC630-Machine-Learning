Want to keep your dream alive?
Can I keep it with mine?
But I'm no good for you
I suppose when you get a cold bath
You, you still hold me close at night

Never liked you any less
And the world's not such a friendly place, is it?
It can grow very cold, very quickly, and for a very long time
If the sun, with some twist of fate, stops giving out it's shine

Some of the time the future comes right 'round to haunt me
Some of the time the future comes 'round just to see
Not all is as it could be
Like it's there to remind me
We've got to wait and see

Didnâ€™t ask to be conceived
In a loveless embrace

Still we learn to be a warm sun
Around a very cold galaxy
It's just like you said it could be
Oh, it's like you said it would be

Some of the time the future comes right 'round to haunt me
Some of the time the future comes 'round just to see
That all is as it should be
Like it's there to remind me
We've got to let it be, yeah

Some of the time the future comes right 'round to haunt me
Some of the time the future comes 'round just to see
That all is as it could be
And it's there to remind me
We've got to wait and see
We've got to let it be, yeah
Wait and see, wait and see
