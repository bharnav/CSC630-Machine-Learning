It's true your love has been a lesson
And it's taught me more than any other blessing
You're the one that can wrestle me
C'mon hold me down now one, two, three
I get too weak to fight from all this laughing

And I am not even yours to run to
And you are not even mine to cry to
And we are not even here to speak of

You go your way, my love, you go your way
You go your way, my love, you go your way

It's true that I have got a head full
Of voices saying the first thing that's in their heart
And I go to throw a ball with my best intention
And it gets caught up and carried away
In completely the opposite direction

And now you're not really mine to run to
Why you're not even mine to cry to
And now you're not even here to speak of

You go your way, my love, you go your way
You go your way, my love, you go your way

And you are not even mine to run to
You were never quite mine to cry to
And we are not really hear to speak of

You go your way, my love
You go your way
You go your way, my love
You go your way
With not one shadow of a doubt
With not one shadow of a doubt
You go your way
You go can your way

You go your way, my love
You go your way
You go your way, my love
You go your way
With not one shadow of a doubt
With not one shadow of a doubt
You go your way
You go your way
