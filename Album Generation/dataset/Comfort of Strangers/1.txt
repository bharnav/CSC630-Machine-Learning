For those who preach forgiveness
Whilst they're practicing revenge
Man will do to man
But nature's got it all in hand
It ain't free
It ain't fooled you'll see

There are no rights for the many
The ones already damned
The fear born into grace
They're gonna get the helping hand
It ain't free
It ain't fooling me

And there's nothing to hide
And there's nothing to save
And there'll always be something
Your countenance to give it away
Not much more to say
Not much more to say

For those who are obsessed
With his reflection as he is
Nature has a cause
You know you ain't never
Gonna be that blessed
It ain't free
It ain't fooled you'll see
And there's nothing to hide
And there's nothing to save
And they'll always be something
Your countenance to give it away
Not much more to say
Not much more to say...
