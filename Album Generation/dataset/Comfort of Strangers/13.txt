These memories are just pieces of sky
Pieces of something much bigger than I
To anyone else just endless blue
I see time framed an image of you
These memories haunt me like a moon
Holds a sea like the sky holds a sun
The sea holds my tears and carries me
My heart is too heavy for one
When it's over, it's over
I best get busy living, been a long time gone
A dress made of air and webs and you
The wet dreams evaporate as they come true
To anyone else just endless blue
An invisible kite string connects me to you
I know that it's selfish to think you'd come here
There's so many people that must need you near
There's so many people that need to know
That you're still with them even when you go
That you're still with them even when they don't know
And it's over, it's over
I best get busy living, you been a long time gone

How do you know how much you've been missing?
Does it add up to some names on a list?
Do you know we're just pieces of sky?
Pieces of time that keep drifting by
