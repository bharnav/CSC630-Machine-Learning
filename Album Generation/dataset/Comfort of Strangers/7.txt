My love's a star you only saw the traces of
What went before is not no more, it's the embers of
People always catching names too late
And we're all sorry there's no time to make the change

I could hear rebellion rising
I could feel the stars aligning
I could see the wave rising
But I never did seem to find my way back home

My love's a ball I threw to you
Once I was gone, you caught it too
Love ignored erodes in time, changes shape, went and changed your mind
All I really needed was someone to take me home
Enough absinthe can crush your spirit to the bone

And I could feel rebellion rising
I could hear the stars aligning
I could see the wave rising
But I never did seem to find my way back home
No, I never did wanna find my way back home
