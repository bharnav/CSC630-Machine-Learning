Curl up inside me
C'mon hide for a while
Look in your eyes, I see
Looking back is a child
That we, we dance a fine line
We didn't take much time
You can't watercolour a fire cracker
And you, you're laying face down
With your heart of soul
Selling it cheap on the commercial road

Where is the love in your heart?
C'mon. put a little love in your heart
Where is the love in your heart?
C'mon. put a little love in your heart

Magpies and maelstroms
Always hard hitting hailstorms
No blame, no forgiveness
We consent and we complete this
And we, we dance at the precipice
When we get close like this
You can't put out a fire with no crocodile
And me, I'm laying face down
So tell me what Neil Young said
You pick a flower then it's dead

Put a little love in your heart
C'mon, put a little love in your heart
I don't care how much religion you've got
You gotta put a little love in your heart

And you, you look at me in disbelief
Like you could teach me God
When all of a sudden
I'm consumed by love
And you are all lighting up
With your heart of gold
And everything we touch just turns to soul

Put a little love in your heart
You know, you put a little love in my heart
I gotta put a little love in your heart
C'mon, put a little love in my heart
C'mon, put a little love in your heart
I wanna feel a little love in my heart
I'm gonna put a little love in your heart
A whole lotta love in your heart
Whole lotta love in your heart
There's a whole lotta love in your heart, heart, heart

Curl up inside me
C'mon hide for a while
