Home is where the heartbreak
Wraps cold around my bones
Forgive me if I promise
To forget what I have known
Ignores and never mentions
I just came waltzing in
With stories tied together
With broken bits of string

Time moves so sure
Runs rings around he treees
Its silence mocking
In the wind against the leaves
For all your loss and gain
The soul defines its suffering
An illusion is hope born from fear
And now you're right back here
Safe in my arms my dear

All is as I left it
Never more so what it seems
My bed is as I made it
Just not what went between
And I still feel alive
In what is no longer there
The shadows slide behind
Drawing clouds across the air

Time moves so sure
Turns rings around the trees
Its silence whispers
In the wind against the leaves
For all your loss and gain
The soul defies its suffering
An illusion is hope born from fear
But now I'm right back here
Safe in your arms my dear
