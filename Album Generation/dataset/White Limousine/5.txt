One day maybe
When I grow up
A son you will have found

When I change my ways
One of these days
I know I'll make you proud

What I never say
Because of busy days
Is all I want for you

I'm just not the best
At being friends
But that's what we should do

When I see you happy
When you laugh
I'm never sad

Fantastic toys
And corduroys
Everything you gave

Took me to school
I tried to be cool
And you let me get away with it

What I want to say
A thing I pray
For you to shine inside

The fighting words
How they sound absurd
When it's you who gave me life

When I see you happy
When you laugh
I'm never sad
I don't want to be sad
And you shouldn't be sad
We shouldn't be sad

What I never say
Because of busy days
Is all I want for you

I want to love
Like a mother's son
To always see you through

When I see you happy
When you laugh
I'm never sad

We shouldn't be sad
