Here and there
Haunting my closets and drawers
My evermore

Now and then
Forgetting that everything's changed
I call her name

And I heard the stories
She tried to tell me
(But) I don't believe in ghosts

I hear a sound

Maybe it's her coming home
But I'm alone

No, I've never seen one
I've never been one
I don't believe in ghosts

So I won't think of her
I won't remember
I don't believe in ghosts

She knows...
She knows...
