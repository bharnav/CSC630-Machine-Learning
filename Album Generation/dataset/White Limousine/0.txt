Hey Casanova
You don't look too good
But I know times are tough

You never found your paradise
Like you said you would
And it's all catching up

It may be that will never change
You may never come to your promised land
And it's a gray morning

With all you have
Still you turn your back
You're given every chance
How can you ask for more than that?
But still you have to ask

Hey tragic hero
Did you get passed by?
Well what do all those heathens know...

Have a seat, a cup of wine
And have a good cry

And then it's time to go

'Cause you're living up to your own worst cases
You're looking for hope in some pretty strange places
And that's a grey mourning

With all you have
Still you turn your back
You're given every chance
How can you ask for more than that?
But still you have to ask
I really need for you to ask

With all you have to ask
Still you're turning
Turning
With all you have
Still you're turning
Turning

Hey you lone ranger
Is it cold tonight
So far beneath the stars
Maybe the desert will do you good
