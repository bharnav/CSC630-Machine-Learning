I guess they think it's what we want
A smooth and easy ride
Of constellations of ceiling lights
Hennessey and Naugahyde
America, America, this is our reward
Everything is boring, everyone is bored

Maybe a white
Maybe a white limousine
Maybe a white, white, white, white limousine

Who's the smart guy at the wheel
Runnin' out of gas
Likes to wear a flightsuit
And fly around for laughs

Maybe a white
Maybe a white limousine
Maybe a white, white, white, white limousine

I feel incentives for the pharmacy
Hey I'm feelin' better already
I don't want to be clear
It's too much for me
I'm makin' up
Oh, I'm makin' up
For lost time
For all the lost time

Maybe a white
Maybe a white limousine
Maybe a white, white, white, white limousine
Maybe a white
Maybe a white limousine
Maybe a white, white, white, white limousine

We have won the war
We have won the war
