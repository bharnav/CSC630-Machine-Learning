So you wrote me a letter which I thought was really kind
I don't recall which song it was but there was one you really liked
And you asked me, so innocently
Of my inspiration
Why I write the songs I sing, the reasons why I make them

Well nothing here is what it seems
I'll risk the wreckage of your dreams
It's so that you are always shopping
To steal away the cash your dropping
Listen to me when I say
Your fantasies are built to fade
So there you are, you're always shopping
Don't even try, there is no stopping

Don't misunderstand me, it always makes me smile
When I can serenade you as you're rollin' down the aisles
On this journey of your souls desires, the paradise of goods
You're doing just exactly what I think you should

Well nothing here is what it seems
I'll risk the wreckage of your dreams
It's so that you are always shopping
So while you roll you're really rocking

Listen to me when I say
Your fantasies are built to fade
So there you are, you're always wanting

What you don't have is always haunting

There's still one thing I have to say - my confession's not complete
I've made is sound as if all this has nothing to do with me
There surely is not anything further from the truth
When I have pretty things to gain and only useless things to lose

I wish there were another way
But I must keep the wolves at bay
I hope that you don't find it shocking
Rock and Roll is built on shopping

If you're searching for my soul
Come check out my chains of gold
Grab your purse and let's go shopping
For lingerie and silky stockings

Lets go shopping together
So that we can find ourselves
So that we can buy ourselves

Let's go shopping together
'Cause We are always by ourselves
'Cause We are always by ourselves

Lets go shopping together
So that we can find ourselves
