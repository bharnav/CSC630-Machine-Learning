How many times on this merry-go-round
Over and over again
Up on the horse was a weak, foolish child
Who never believed it would end

How many smokes 'til I'm satisfied
How many drinks 'til I'm happy
How much of the day will I watch fade away
Until there is no one to ask me

I was gone, so gone
Gone, so gone
For a while

How many times will I sleep by your side
Turning and dreaming and scared

Of fair grounds that shut down as you ride away
And my horse won't go anywhere

I was gone, so gone
Gone, so gone
For a while

I was wrong, so wrong
Wrong, so wrong
For a while

How many songs will I try to write
All with the same thing to say
I've got two tickets left, won't you please stay with me
For the very last ride of the day
