Turning the wheel to emptiness
They're when you breathe your final breath
No one will hold you anymore
Haven't they told you baby
You're always alive
Always alive

Leaving the plane of time and space
Leaving the mask of every face
Just like the Sun and every ray
Might as well smile 'cause baby
We all die one day
We all die one day

Not square, not round
The silence in the sound
Not short, not long
The quiet in the song
(It carries you along)

Some of the people here believe
Reading a book of prophesies
Some of you sigh and turn away
Nobody knows, so what's the play?
You're here now
You're here for now

And what does it matter anyway
Whatever I sing or what you say
Taking a chance we place a bet
But it ain't gonna get you
To black or red
This time around
This time around

No cause, no condition
Who knows your position?
Not you, no other
What will you discover?

You never disappear
So tell me why you fear
Neither are you born
Sometimes still you mourn
Never do you arise
You're never low or high
No one acts, no one is made
Nothing glows, nothing fades

Nothing fades.........
