I wouldn't mind
If everyday
Was like the day
I had just yesterday
You and I
Hanging on every kiss
On all of this

I wouldn't mind
If all of my nights
Were like the nights
You held me so tight
Your lips, so close, so close
On the back of my neck
Little sounds, little breaths

But these times
They just won't stand still
They slip away
And haunt me until
The next time
You take me in
Take me in (again) and
Let me begin

I wouldn't mind
If all my big plans
Fell apart
Left me empty-handed

I'll start again, like new
If you're with me
How can I lose?

But these thoughts
Are only just that
Nice thoughts
Nothing like facts
And the facts, as the are
Are harder to take
'Cause there's a part of me
That's ready to break

And I'm afraid
Yes, I am afraid
That you will go
That you'll go away
And believe, that I'll be O.K
That I'll be fine
That I will not mind, in time

(And yes) I wouldn't mind
If things weren't as they are
I wouldn't care
If it weren't for my heart
And that is why
Still I try
To give you every reason
