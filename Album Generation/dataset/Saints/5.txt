[Verse 1]
It's written
With your name on it
It's written
It's written
With your name on it
It's written
The aleph is what we stand on
Mirror images of everything
Burning in your eyes

[Chorus]
The reflection in your eyes
Speaks to me on love's eulogy
It was only a game that you wanted to play
I won't be the same

[Verse 2]
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
To all that you hold
I knelt down to kiss you
But you wanted to
Die in your own arms

[Chorus]
The reflection in your eyes
Speaks to me on love's eulogy
It was only a game that you wanted to play
I won't be the same

[Outro]
You were the one to call me hopeless
You were the one to call me dear
You were the one to call me hopeless
You were the one to call me dear

Standing side by side, eyes full of fear
