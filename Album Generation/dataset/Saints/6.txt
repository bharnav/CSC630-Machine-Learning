[Verse 1]
I saw the future in a tree outside
There was your heart, and there was mine
This love, torn apart by every word
Is hopeless love all we have
Is hopeless love all we have
Is this what we dreamed?

[Chorus 1]
I cannot go
Take this heart, and let it die slow
Tear away from the pain
Tear away from the red

[Verse 2]
Are we trading in our hearts for emptiness
Is this love or human condition
I close my eyes to see you
Hope is in your name
Where you are, I cannot go
Take this heart, let it die, slow

[Chorus 2]
I cannot go
Take this heart, and let it die slow
Tear away from, from the pain
Tear away from, from the red
Take
This heart
From the red
I cannot go
Take this heart, and let it die slow
Tear away from the pain
Tear away from the red
