[Intro]
We all learn from our failures

[Verse 1]
I never thought
I could fall this far
So far from you
With no desire
To look back
I'll embrace this
Forever

[Chorus]
Divorcing
My adoration
As death marches
To the grave
I'll learn from this mistake
Let it break me
Let it break me
Let it break me
Let it break me
We all learn from our failures

[Verse 2]
Failure is death
And I have
Overcome it
With not a single tear
Of remembrance
I choose to forget
And start all over

[Extended Chorus/Outro]
