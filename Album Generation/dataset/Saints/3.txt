[Verse 1]
This
This was my call to your arms
Sounding silent alarms
Will you love me when you hear me lie?
This last time?

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a sea of change
This fleeting love that leaves me alone
Lift me now from this pain
You know the way to bring me home

[Verse 2]
We've dimmed our lights past darkness
Hiding our way back from this
Swallowing every glimpse of our faithfulness
Who will guide us home when we cannot see?
The weak to follow, follow the lead
It's taking over
Our lives
As we live
As we die

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a sea of change
This fleeting love that leaves me alone
Lift me now from this pain
You know the way to bring me home

[Bridge]
As we live, as we die
It's taking over our lives

[Chorus 2]
I've seen a sea of change
This fleeting love that leaves me alone
(This last time)
Lift me now from this pain
You know the way to bring me home
(As we die) [x5]
