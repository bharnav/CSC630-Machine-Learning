[Verse 1]
June fell for Johnny on the Forth of July
As the fireworks popped in the summer sky
With a spark in her eye, she just there and stared
As his face lit up to the rocket's red glare
And by September, she'd asked him for a wedding band
How could she know he was a rambling man
He walked out the door in the dead of the night
And a sleepy voice whispered, as he turned out the light

[Chorus]
"Where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"Oh, you're never gonna find
"Someone who loves you like I do
"If you get tired of running
"You can turn around and walk back to me."

[Verse 2]
He called up to tell her he missed her a lot
Texas Panhandle was as far as he got
He'd run out money, he'd run of luck
He'd run out of gas in his pick-up truck
"Hitch a ride, catch a train or a Greyhound bus
"'Cause there's a baby on the way and that makes three of us
"And I need you here beside me, I can't go it alone,"
She told him one more time then she hung up the 'phone

[Chorus]
Saying, "Where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"You know, you're never gonna find
"Someone who loves you like I do
"When you get tired of running
"You can turn around and walk back to me."

[Verse 3]
And the years just seemed to roll on by them
She missed him more and more every day
And that boy grew up to look and act just like him
And she knew some day soon he'd be old enough to fly away

[Chorus]
And she'd say: "Baby, where you gonna go?
"What you gonna do when you get there?
"Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea?
"You know, you're never gonna find
"Someone who loves you like I do
"When you get tired of running
"You can turn around and walk back to me."

[Outro]
"If you ever get tired of running
"Turn around and walk back to me."
