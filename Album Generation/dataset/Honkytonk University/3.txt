[Verse 1]
See that big blue note over there on the counter
You don't want to read that thing man
It's a real get-ya-downer
But don't you dare say nothing else bad about her
She's gone

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no don-don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
And I have to reread it
Besides, you can show it to the boys downtown
And they won't believe that
She's gone

[Chorus]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me

[Bridge]
Is this big blue note folded up in my pocket
Yeah don't laugh, it's been two months I still got it
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

[Verse 3]
You know my psychiatrist said, "Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots of reds and yellows and green?"
You know, I looked at them all, but all they looked to me like
Big blue notes

[Chorus]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing that's left to do for me

[Verse 4]
Is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane that I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
And if it don't come back to me
You guessed it
She's gone

[Outro]
Crash landing
Bye, bye, baby
