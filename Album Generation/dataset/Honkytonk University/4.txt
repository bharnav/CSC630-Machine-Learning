[Verse 1]
Do blondes really have more fun
Or they just easier to spot in the dark?
Girl, I'm just trying to cheer you up
I saw you sitting over here all alone
With a broken heart
It's hurting you real bad
Wish there was something that I had
I'd hook you up, get you through it
You might need a man to hold you till it don't
I'm just the guy to do it

[Verse 2]
Is that your pretty boy standing there
At the end of the bar? He's got some nerve
Talking loud and drinking with a redhead
Riding shotgun on his arm, he's such a jerk
I think he's a knucklehead, all those ugly things he said
Were out of line, man, he blew it
He might need someone to put him in his place
I'm just the guy to do it

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't mend your broken heart
I can't take away your pain
I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine
When you're walking in the rain
But if you need a hero for tonight
I can be the one, let me prove it
Yeah, you just say the magic words
And we'll be gone, I'm just the guy to do it

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't mend your broken heart
And I can't take away your pain
I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine
When you're walking in the rain
Oh, but if you need a hero for tonight
I'll be the one, let me prove it
You just say the magic words
And we'll be gone, I'm just the guy to do it

[Outro]
Do blondes really have more fun
Or are they just easier to spot in the dark?
