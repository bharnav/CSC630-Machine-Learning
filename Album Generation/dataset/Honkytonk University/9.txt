[Verse 1]
Now those might be the saddest
Big 'old baby blues I ever seen
How did I know, you'd been crying?
Baby, you got make-up running' down your cheek
You're just a Queen looking' for a crown
Lost when you stumbled over some silly clown

[Chorus]
Take that frown
Turn it upside down
'Cause you never know who might be
Falling in love with your smile

[Verse 2]
A broken heart that's on the mend
Takes a little time, I realise
And right now you wouldn't know
True love if it looked you in the eye
Girl, I did my best; I really tried to make you grin
And before I say goodbye, I'm gonna tell you again

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Those might be the saddest
Big 'old baby blues I ever seen
