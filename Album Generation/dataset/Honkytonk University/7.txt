[Verse 1]
Till death do us part
Is what she told that preacher man
Now she says this ain't worth dying for
She's had all she can't stand
She's boxed up momma's china
It's loaded on the truck
She's just got started packing
And I'm thinking this could suck

[Verse 2]
Now, there goes my Lay-Z Boy
And my flat top guitar
Here comes her big sister
What's she doing in my car?
As they drive off to the city
I just waved
From the top of my lungs
I hope she heard me say

[Chorus]
You ain't leaving, thank God are ya
You can't be gone fast enough
What seemed to take a lifetime
Just left in a cloud of dust
This'll make my girlfriend happy
She's the one that never thought you would
You ain't leaving, thank God are ya
Let us pray you're gone for good

[Verse 3]
She forgot her new laptop
So I know she'll be back
I'll have a hot tub full of hotties
Icing down a 24-pack
She'll cuss me like a sailor
But I don't care
I'll have a few choice words
When I come up for air

[Chorus]
You ain't leaving, thank God are ya
You can't be gone fast enough
And what seemed to take a lifetime
Just left in a cloud of dust
This'll make my girlfriend happy
She's the one that never thought you would
You ain't leaving, thank God are ya
Let us pray you're gone for good

[Outro]
You ain't leaving, thank God are ya
Let us pray you're gone for good
Adios!
