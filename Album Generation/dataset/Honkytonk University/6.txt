[Verse 1]
If you wanna go back to him, baby, get up and go
I'm tired of being a clown caught up in your sideshow
Night after night it never ends
It's like a heavyweight fight nobody wins
And I'm throwing in the towel, enough is enough

[Chorus]
Knock yourself out, break me in two
You gotta go do what you gotta do
I gave you my best shot, but you didn't fall
Head over heels in love after all
I don't wanna hear no more
Baby, there's the door
There's nothing left to fight about
Knock yourself out

[Verse 2]
Oh, let's not pull any punches
While we're standing here toe to toe
If you're gonna leave me here
Baby go on, go

[Chorus]
Knock yourself out, break me in two
You gotta go do what you gotta do
I gave you my best shot, but you didn't fall
Head over heels in love after all
I don't wanna hear no more
Baby, there's the door
There's nothing left to fight about
Knock yourself out
Oh, knock yourself out

[Outro]
If you wanna go back to him
Baby, get up and go
