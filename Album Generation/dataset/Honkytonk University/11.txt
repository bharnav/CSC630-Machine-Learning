[Verse 1]
I don't need this conversation
'Cause I don't need to see you cry
You need one more confirmation
Like I need one more reason why

[Verse 2]
I know this might not be the answer
Oh, that you came here to get
We both know that girl is something
That I'm still not over yet

[Chorus]
I can't go on using you
Girl, it feels like I'm losing' you
A love like yours is hard to find
But you caught me at a bad time

[Verse 3]
I knew that you'd be waiting
The night I made that desperate call
You weren't everything I needed
Just the softest place to fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
And I can't go on using you
Oh, it feels like I'm losing' you
A love like yours is hard to find
You've caught me at a bad time

[Outro]
A love like yours is hard to find
You've caught me at a bad time
