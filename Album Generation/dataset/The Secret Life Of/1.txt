[Verse 1]
Oh no, don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

[Chorus]
I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

[Verse 2]
It's not like I need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
Cause you're so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah, all by yourself
You're all messed up

[Chorus]
I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

[Bridge]
Now wait a minute, because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey, don't you get it?
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
Cause this is my life

[Chorus]
I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not
