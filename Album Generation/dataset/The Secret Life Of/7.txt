[Verse 1]
Feels like I have always known you
And I swear I dreamt about you
All those endless nights I was alone
It's like I've spent forever searching
Now I know that it was worth it
With you it feels like I am finally home

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

[Chorus]
Cause you leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
Can't help but surrender
My everything to you

[Verse 2]
I thought I could resist you
I thought that I was strong
Somehow you are different from what I've known
I didn't see you coming
You took me by surprise
And you stole my heart before I could say "no"

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling head over heels
Thought I knew how it feels
But with you it's like the first day of my life

[Chorus]
You leave me speechless
When you talk to me
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender, oh no
My everything to you

[Bridge]
You leave me speechless
(The way you smile, the way you touch my face)
You leave me breathless
(It's something that you do I can't explain)
I run a million miles just to hear you say my name
Baby

[Outro]
You leave me speechless
You leave me breathless
The way you look at me
You manage to disarm me
My soul is shining through
I can't help but surrender
My everything to you
