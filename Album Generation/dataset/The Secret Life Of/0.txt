[Verse 1]
Here we are, so what you gonna do?
Do I gotta spell it out for you?
I can see that you got other plans for tonight
But I don't really care
Size me up, you know I beat the best
Tick tock, no time to rest
Let 'em say what they're gonna say
But tonight, I just don't really care

[Chorus]
C'mon baby, we ain't gonna live forever
Let me show you all the things that we could do
You know you wanna be together
And I wanna spend the night with you (yeah, yeah)
With you (yeah, yeah)
Come with me tonight
We could make the night last forever
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I've seen it all, I got nothing to prove
Come on, baby, just make your move
Follow me, let's leave it all behind tonight
Like we just don't care
Let me take you on the ride of your life
That's what I said, alright
They can say what they wanna say
'Cause tonight, I just don't even care

[Chorus]
C'mon baby, we ain't gonna live forever
Let me show you all the things that we could do
You know you wanna be together
And I wanna spend the night with you (yeah, yeah)
With you (yeah, yeah)
Come with me tonight
We could make the night last forever
(Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Let's pretend you're mine
(We could just pretend, we could just pretend yeah, yeah)
You got what I like
You got what I like, I got what you like
Oh, c'mon
Just one taste and you'll want more
So tell me what you're waiting for

[Chorus]
C'mon baby, we ain't gonna live forever (forever)
Let me show you all the things that we could do
(That we could do)
You know you wanna be together
And I wanna spend the night with you (yeah, yeah)
With you (yeah, yeah)
So, come with me tonight
We could make the night last forever
(Yeah, forever)

[Outro]
C'mon baby we ain't gonna live forever
Let me show you all the things that we could do
You know you wanna be together (together)
And I wanna spend the night with you (yeah, yeah)
With you, yeah
With you (yeah, yeah)
So come with me tonight
We could make the night last forever (forever)
(Oh, oh)
