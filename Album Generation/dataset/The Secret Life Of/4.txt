[Verse 1]
You're a little obsessed with me
And I'm a little bit scared of you
The way you look and stare at me
Maybe it's time I let you know

[Chorus]
You could call me six times, but still I won't pick up the phone
You could spend all your money on me
But still, I'll say no
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me
That I am the girl of your dreams
But nobody ever asked me
I never looked at you that way
'Cause I always thought you were gay

[Verse 2]
Every time you come around
You just look me up and down
And then you try to hold my hand
I'm confused now, I don't understand

[Chorus]
You could call me six times, but still I won't pick up the phone
You could spend all your money on me
But still, I'll say no
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me
That I am the girl of your dreams
But nobody ever asked me
I never looked at you that way
'Cause I always thought you were gay

[Bridge]
You told me lies
You made me believe it would be fine
If there was nothing to see
I'd be undressing in front of you
I told you secrets that no one else knew

[Chorus]
You could call me six times, but still I won't pick up the phone
You could spend all your money on me
But still, I'll say no
You could write a million letters everyday confessing to me
That I am the girl of your dreams
But nobody ever asked me
I never looked at you that way
'Cause I always thought you were gay
