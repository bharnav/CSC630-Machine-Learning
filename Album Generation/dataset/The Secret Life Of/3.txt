[Verse 1]
I am temperamental
Like a heart without a home
I am sentimental
But you dont know me at all
I have expectations
I wanna be the one you call
And I want a conversation
But you dont know me at all

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
I am
I'm a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
I'm a revolution
Why do I have to explain
Who I am again and again?
I am

[Verse 2]
I know what you're thinkin'
I can tell what you're waitin' for
But I think that you're pretendin'
But you dont fool me at all

[Pre-Chorus]
If you knew me at all
You'd take my picture
And you'd hang it on your wall

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
I am
I'm a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
I'm a revolution
Why do I have to explain
Who I am again and again?
I am

[Bridge]
I didn't know that you've been wanting me
Oh, how's a girl supposed to know?
Just when you think that it's all tragedy
Don't worry baby, I'll go slow

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
I am
I'm a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
I'm a revolution
Why do I have to explain (Why do i have to explain)
Who I am again and again?

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
I am
I'm a revolution
Close your eyes
I am, I am
I'll blow your mind
I am
I'm a revolution
Why do I have to explain
Who I am again and again?
I am
