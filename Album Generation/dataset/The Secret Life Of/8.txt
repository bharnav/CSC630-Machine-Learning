[Verse 1]
Everyday I sit here waiting
Everyday just seems so long
And now I've had enough of all the hating
Do we even care?
It's so unfair
Any day, it'll all be over
Everyday there's nothing new
And now I just try to find some hope
To try and hold onto
But it starts again
It'll never end

[Chorus]
I'm heavily broken
And I don't know what to do
Can't you see that I'm choking?
And I can't even move
When there's nothing left to say
What can you do?
I'm heavily broken
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 2]
Almost giving up on trying
Almost heading for a fall
And now my mind is screaming out
I've gotta keep on fighting
But then again
It doesn't end

[Chorus]
I'm heavily broken
And I don't know what to do
Can't you see that I'm choking?
And I can't even move
When there's nothing left to say
What can you do?
I'm heavily broken
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

[Bridge]
Feels like I'm drowning
I'm screaming for air (Screaming for air)
Louder I'm crying
And you don't even care

[Chorus]
I'm heavily broken
And I don't know what to do
Can't you see that I'm choking?
And I can't even move (What can I do?)
When there's nothing left to say (When there's nothing left to say)
What can you do?
I'm heavily broken
I'm heavily broken
And I don't know what to do
Can't you see that I'm choking? (Choking, choking)
And I can't even move
When there's nothing left to say
What can you do?
I'm heavily broken

[Outro]
There's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
