[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Narration]
So, as you can tell I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse, so I added one extra one
Here it goes...

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Snowman
With the carrot nose and charcoal eyes
And oh, when he cries, I'm going to tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh, and on his way
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
So may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright
And may all your Christmases be white
