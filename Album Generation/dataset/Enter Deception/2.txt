Early on there came a time when I was facing
A turning point in life
So many years I tried to find it

Thinking not of what is left to see in the future
Take another chance to find
That fading light shown in the distance

Falling in place was I
As I'm walking over edge
A sea to join of wasted life
Living on a broken ledge

Deep inside a force not weak
Ever longing for a way
To break the streak that's holding me
And leads myself astray

Walking forever the life of the never
It's all clear now to me, the answer has come (alive)
One strong of heart, that'll never take follow again, never again, never again

You've seen the fellow, what a mindless mass pretender
Follow one and all alike
Trying to feel the system's calling

Assimilate with what is now, forgo all reason
Take another place in line!
Join up with all and lose your senses

One day it hit me
I would never be like that
Free to see the sense in me
Thinking not what others said

Moving to a mind pristine
That is strong of will and free
And leaving all the ones that seek
To be another sheep

Walking forever the life of the never
It's all clear now to me, the answer has come (alive)
One strong of heart, that'll never take follow again, never again, never again

So many things that I have
Found waiting for me
A vision so revealing
Pure in all its majesty

Deep inside a force not weak
Ever longing for a way
To break the streak that leads myself away...

Walking forever the life of the never
It's all clear now to me, the answer has come (alive)
One strong of heart, that'll never take follow again, never again, never again
