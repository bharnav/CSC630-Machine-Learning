I'm drained but aching for more
And the devil inside is reading
The words of the saddest poem
To be engraved on the stone of my grave

I'd kill to share your pain
(And carry the shame)
And sell my soul for you just to say

[Chorus]
I dream what you're dreaming
And feel what you're feeling
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of god

Nothing will be enough
For the ones Who keep on stumbling
In the garden of withering trust
Without the courage to leave

Oh I'd take my life for your kiss
(Grant me my wish)
And lose it all to take you across the abyss

[Chorus]

You dream what I'm dreaming
And see what I'm seeing
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the Face of God

Labyrinth in a shape of a heart
Love's secret architecture
I find myself to be lost in the
Arms of your fate

I'd kill to share you pain
(Please let me stay)
And sell my soul for you just to say
Love's name in vein
Again and again

[Chorus]

You dream what I'm Dreaming
And see what I'm seeing
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of god
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of (face of)
The face of (face of)
God

(Face of) God
