Hiding underneath
The veil of broken dreams
We find her weeping

On her once white wings
She will be carrying the weight of our deeds
And she bleeds for love
Forever gone

[Chorus]
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time
Devils dance while angels smile
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie

Finding souls to feed
The nightside of Eden
We see the struggling
For her love's last breath and walk off

[Chorus]

She's blinded by the fear
Of life and death and everything in between
We smile when she cries a river of tears
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away

[Chorus]

So alive
(Drunk on shadows)
