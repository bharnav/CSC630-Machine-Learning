[Verse 1]
Heaven ablaze in our eyes
We're standing still in time
The blood on our hands is the wine
We offer as sacrifice

[Hook]
Come on and show them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul

[Verse 2]
This endless mercy mile
We're crawling side by side
With hell freezing over in our eyes
Gods kneel before our crime

[Hook]

[Post-hook]
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
Donâ€™t let go
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
For your soul

[Hook]

[Post-hook x2]
