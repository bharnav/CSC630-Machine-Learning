Shivers run through the spine
Of hope as she cries
The poison tears of a life denied
In the raven black night
Holding hands with

Dark light
Come shine in her lost heart tonight
And blind all fears that haunt her
With your smile, dark light

In oblivion's garden
Her body's on fire
Writhing towards the angel defiled
To learn how to die
In peace with her God

Dark light
Come shine in her lost heart tonight
And blind all fears that haunt her
With your smile, dark light
