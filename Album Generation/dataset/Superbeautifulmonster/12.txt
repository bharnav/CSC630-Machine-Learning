I want you to know I needed time to rest
And, I must confess to you
I am hardest on myself
All I ever wanted was to try to do my best
And I want tell the truth now
I am unwell

After awhile, I just lay down
After awhile, my chin ain't up
Bare-knuckle fighter in the third round
After awhile, it's all bad luck

[Chorus]
Save me. Save me from myself
Drowning in the wishing well
I will try to rise above
I am never good enough

I want you to know that I needed time alone
Don't you try to tell me that you really didn't know
All I ever wanted was to never leave this bed
And I want to tell the truth - my smile is just pretend

After awhile, I got sleepy
After awhile, safety lasted
After awhile, disenchanted
After awhile, I just fasted

[Chorus]
After awhile, I just lay down
After awhile, my chin ain't up
Bare-knuckle fighter in the third round
After awhile, it's all bad luck

[Chorus]
I'm no good for you
