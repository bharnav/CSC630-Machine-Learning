I saw a girl, just the other day
With a pink umbrella in the pouring rain
Make up running all down herface
(tears in the rain are such a waste)

She said: "The world is Over"
I can't believe it's true
(How can it all be over when I am not over you?)
They say it's "over". What am i gonna do?
I'm not ready to get over you
Staring at the ceiling, laying in bed
Heard it on the radio (the DJ said):
"Stars are falling from the sky."
Well, don't get stardust in your eye!

He said : "The World is Over."
I can't believe it's true
(How can it all be over when I am not over you?)
They say it's "over". What am i gonna do?
I'm not ready to get over you

They say :"The World is Over"
I can't believe it's true
(How can it all be over when I am not over you?)

I know the world is ENDING
I'm telling you it's true
There ain't no use pretending
I'll ever get over you
I saw a girl just the other day
With a pink umbrella in the pouring rain
Make up running all down her face
(Tears in the rain are such a waste)
