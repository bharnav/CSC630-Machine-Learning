Busted! And I can't believe I trusted, implicitly
And I lusted for reality
I got rusted anxiety

[Chorus]
Come on. You can tell me
Stop yanking my chain
I know you are hiding everything
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I know?
Yeah you better believe it
Do you see what I see?
Do you understand me?
Baby, are you feeling me?

Tell me. How do you sleep?
In your bed of true deceit
Are you hungry?
Hungry for me?
Or is it just conditioning?

[Chorus]
