Now that I've got you alone
There's something I wanna say
A secret I have kept awhile
And it seems right and I feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I am right
I know this is the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, you; Making me come all undone
Yeah, you; You have become
The only one I will ever love

Now that I've given myself
Is there something that you wanna say?
Without you, I'd be unwell
And it seems right and I feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
