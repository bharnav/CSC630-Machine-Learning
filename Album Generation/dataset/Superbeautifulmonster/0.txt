Well you packed me away in the trunk of your car
You drove me so fast and so far
I tried to fight but its so hard
The only momento is this scar

Where were you when i needed you?
Somethings missing, and I can't breathe
Where were you? Where were you?
Somethings missing. You abandoned me

Oh when you look deep into my mind
That is so tired and weak from this life
On the verge of fear all the time
I feel like you left me here to die

Where were you when i needed you?
Somethings missing, and I can't breathe
Where were you? Where were you?
Somethings missing. You abandoned me

Shaking in my boots, you shook me down
You really took me down
Shaking my foundation, not to be found
Never to be found

Where were you?
Where were you?

You abandoned me
You abandoned me
You abandoned me
