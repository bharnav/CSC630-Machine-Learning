I crawl along, hang on the hem of your dress
I'm holding on. Boy don't forget
I'm a mess. I'm into you

I pull myself up to your chinny-chin chin
When I reach your mouth
You're gonna let me in
I'm into you

[Chorus]
I'm a...
Baby ladybug. Baby ladybug
I'm lost in your hair
Can you feel me there?
Baby ladybug. Baby ladybug
Well, I fly to heaven to come back
And land in your mouth

I hide, in you, my little bug games
Between your seams
I call your name
I'm into you

[Chorus]
Don't lose sight of me on the back of your neck
