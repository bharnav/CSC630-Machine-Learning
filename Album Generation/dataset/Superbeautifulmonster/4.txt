I like babytalking, popcorn without butter
And anybody who will pay attention
To these requirements

I'm an optimistic beauty. Never impolite
Easy like Saturday, mid-day
Breezy, chilled-out, dumb girl

[Chorus]
Thats life with me. I know
Around and around you will go
But, if I french kiss you
In the broad daylight
You'll fall in love..oh,oh,oh
That's life with me. I know

Well I am pretending to be a free-bouncing lover
I wear my defensive mask of optimism like a badge
And ultimately. I am much to lazy to change
I'm rather conditioned to my life of melodrama

[Chorus]
That's life with me. Thats how it will be, my friend
A roller coaster ride you won't forget
I am just a mess. I am just a mess, at best
I am just a blue-ribbon prize winner till the end

[Chorus]
