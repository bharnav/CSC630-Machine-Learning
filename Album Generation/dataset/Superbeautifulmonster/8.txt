I failed you, Henry I failed you good
I was forgotten, and I understood
But time, it stood still when you walked in
I'm too proud to inquire as to where you've been

[Chorus]
Please don't take this the wrong way
You're truly lovely, baby
But the welcome matt, it ain't out
My baby and I, will be just fine
So be a man and just turn around
And get along Henry
Be a good boy Henry
This is your song, Henry
I guess this is goodbye

I love you, Henry. Yeah I love you still
I love your kisses. And I always will
But I do not need you to raise this child
Yeah you're iron-fisted and you're mustang wild

[Chorus]
