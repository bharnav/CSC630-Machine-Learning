Ain't had a job in about a year
Living down in my parents basement
I wish that I could get outta here
Sometimes I think I need a vacation

Can't get my mother off my back
She don't have far to go to drive me crazy
Someday that bitch is gonna make me crack
Might be the last time she calls me lazy

YOU'RE A LET DOWN
PARDON ME IF I'M A LET DOWN
TO MY FAMILY
I'M A LET DOWN
1-2-3 I'M A LET DOWN
(are you like me?)

And now my sister's got a fancy car
I got a piece of shit from 1980
But at least I got my two guitars
And a one-way ticket to nowhere, Baby!

I'M A LET DOWN
PARDON ME IF I'M A LET DOWN
TO MY FAMILY
I'M A LET DOWN
1-2-3 I'M A LET DOWN
(are you like me?)
(are you like me?)
(are you like me?)

Oh, no! no! Now, I've got a dream
They don't understand. It won't be long
I'm not what I seem. See, I've got
A plan (that's right!)

Sometimes they act like I don't exist
Or else, they treat me like I'm still eleven
Heaven knows I can't take more of this
They never thought that I'd be 27
AND A LET-DOWN!
PARDON ME IF I'M A LET DOWN
TO MY FAMILY
I'M A LET DOWN
1-2-3 I'M A LET DOWN
(are you like me?)
(are you like me?)
(are you like me?)
