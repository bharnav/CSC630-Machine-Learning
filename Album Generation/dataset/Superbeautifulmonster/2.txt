Something I've been wanting to say, to you
Are you sitting down?
Pretty soon there'll be a day
When I won't be around

I'm not trying to scare you
Or play on your sympathy
Just want to remind you
That life is a symphony

So everyday
Live it like it's your last one
Every kiss
Kiss it like it's your first love
If i had one wish, then I would wish
That you would live today like everyday
Everyday is your last one

People always rushing around
Wasting time on money
Don't be just a face in the crowd
Getting high and running from something

I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But in the end it's up to you

Everyday
Live it like it's your last one
Every kiss
Kiss it like it's your first love
If i had one wish, then I would wish
That you would live today like everyday
Everyday is your last one

Dip your feet into the ocean
Let the sun beat on your skin
Soak in every emotion that you never thought you'd live
And never take forgranted
Every breath you're breathing in
Go everywhere you've never been

Everyday, live it like it's your last one
Every kiss, Kiss it like it's your first love

Everyday
Live it like it's your last one
Every kiss
Kiss it like it's your first love
If i had one wish, then I would wish
That you would live today like everyday
Everyday is your last one
Everyday
