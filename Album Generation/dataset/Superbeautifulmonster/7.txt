Boy I want to get you alone
I wanna cover you in chocolate and turn of the phone
Damn I think I'm losing my mind
What's been coming over me?

I wanna be like Pamela Lee
So you go get your camera and I'll say cheese
Baby you'll be rocking my world
At the funeral of a good girl

Well Maybe I'm going crazy
I'm the kid, and you be the candy store
Take me down Baby, and -

Do it to me now
Do it to me now!
I can't believe I just said it out loud
You make me wanna scream
And throw you to the ground
Do it, do it to me now!

You make me be a bad little girl
I don't want your diamonds
Just a necklace of pearls
So come on put your lips on mine

Maybe I'm going crazy
You're the kid and I feel like the candy store
Take me down Baby, and -

Do it to me now
Do it to me now!
I can't believe I just said it out loud
You make me wanna scream
And throw you to the ground
Do it, do it to me now!

Baby, I've never been so easy
But you're in luck boy
''cause something about you
Makes me wanna...

Do it to me now
Do it to me now!
I can't believe I just said it out loud
You make me wanna scream
And throw you to the ground
Do it, do it to me now!

Yeah! Do it to me now, (Bye bye, Bye bye good girl)
Do it to me now!(Bye bye, Bye bye good girl)
I can't believe I just said it out loud, (Bye bye, bye bye good girl)
You make me wanna scream
And throw you to the ground,(Bye bye, bye bye good girl)
Do it, do it to me now! (Bye bye)
