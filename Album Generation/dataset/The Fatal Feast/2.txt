Hey Doc i've got this fever i can't shake
At first I thought it was something that I ate
It kinda seems like my eyes are seeing red
It's really up for me to leave my bed

Skins peeling and my hair is going thin
Sensations like the walls are closing in
Could you prescribe something ?
I really want for all this pain to stop
Hey Doc its me again and i still hurt
The medicine you gave me made it worse
Now my skin has turned a darker shade of grey
The only thing I feel is hunger pains

It all started just the other night from a ? bite
Something just wasn't right
I know this pain will never stop till it gets what it wants
Its using all my thoughts
?? apart from just one thing and thats consuming brains
?? and rip apart your head until im fully fed
And its only gonna spread faster!
Bow down to your new Dead Masters
And its only gonna spread faster!
Bow down to your new Dead Masters

Till Everything Is Dead!
Everything!
Till Everything Is Dead!
