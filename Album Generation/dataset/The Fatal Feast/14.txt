How does it feel
Is it what you want expect
Do you feel for what you have done
Or do you feel regret
Just keep telling yourself
It was good
If that's what it takes to well
Make get through to another gate
Worth it worth it
Do you feel like a man
..for so long
Or would you kill again
If you keep telling yourself
It was gonna happen anyway then ..
Help you get through another gate
..delusions..gate short
Inside your turn ..after
Get anything ..yourself
..somebody have a .. all you think about is ..
Now you are the ..somebody wish some up
..they all know
Which let it go
..regret but in a way still I ..don't turn it back
..I saw..paranoia
How does it feel
