[Chorus 1]
You’re cut off
Why can’t I see?
You’re cut off
One more round please?
You’re cut off
All that I want
You’re cut off
Just two more shots

[Verse 1]
Third freaking time this week
Someone tells me I can’t drink
They don’t seem to really get that I want a lot more
They don’t really understand
That it’s all part of my big plan
I like to consume until I’m carried out the door

[Chorus 2]
You’re cut off
Conspiracy!
You’re cut off
You’re all against me
You’re cut off
What’s this all for
You’re cut off
This means war!

[Verse 2]
It always seems to end this way
Why’s this place in disarray?
Is it cool if I just lay my head at the bar?
I guess some folks just can’t relate
Or understand that I feel great
Just exactly who the hell do you think you are?

(Instrumental Break)

[Verse 3]
Don’t you give me that down face
I’m just needing one more taste
I don’t see a problem but it’s mostly a blur
I’d really like to see you pour
Than being such a goddamn bore
I just have a lisp I swear my voice isn’t slurred

[Chorus 1]
You’re cut off
Why can’t I see?
You’re cut off
One more round please?
You’re cut off
All that I want
You’re cut off
Just two more shots
