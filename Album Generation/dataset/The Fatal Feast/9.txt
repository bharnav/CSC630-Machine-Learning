I'm flashin I'm ? the ground
I can't see the sound
I can't see ? yourself
What ? my chest
I can't ? I might not be gone I'm back
And come to the sky I'm?
? the guide? my ? the pray
Now ? the day and this a kind of a test ?
Have a new ? my mind is chancing
And ? just can't make
Make you change
I have a feeling
Now ? rock this ?
Big change ? wish you can take to the ?
Your? wait
I blew it all to the?
That was ? out of my mind
Just what I'm gonna do left behind
So let you down
? so went you now

Six feet out
In the perspective fo the day
? just can't make I can't? make you change
So ? so that you ? take to the gray
Your? wait
