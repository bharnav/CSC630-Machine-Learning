I never care about what you've been taught
I got side with the things you want
When you drop down it just makes no sense
Cause I'm not ? sitting a weekend left

Bands of aggression, bound to the years
You're a ? and facing all your fears
? to the alien, replaced with a complex
To when you really conquer, whoever puts you to the test

You think you're in charge but it's all in your head
And the truth gone ? for it
You should contemplate a better plan
Bands of aggression, bound to the years
You're a ? and facing all your fears
?to the alien, replaced with a complex
To when you really conquer, whoever puts you to the test

You ? that's why we ? has been shut down
Shut down
