What is happening with your ?
Destructive way the residential disaster
Facing the ? join us or die
This ain't ? your voice ? would you follow
Feel all your stretching feel all your ?
Revenge is ours ? the last disaster

Wish I could do it again
Won't be no laughter no chance for you people to ?
I was too late ? the only one left ?
Separate classes ? feel all your structures ? while we will wait
We will survive ? take your life to kill
