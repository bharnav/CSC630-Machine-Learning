Let's wake up you people sleep
The only one ? you can't deny it makes you seek
There is no escape before our eyes ?
We are so ? we took the time and sell our soul
? walk in keep it ? they wanna ?
There was war ? put it ? make the rich poor the poor

What they endure ? spinning ? rise ? get down and tear
Listen is war
Is about time we took control
To save your soul corporate lives
Don't even care we all can die
Your decisions pulls the blood we had enough
