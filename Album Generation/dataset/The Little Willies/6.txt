Like an old machine
Sputtering along
Wheels don't turn as fast as they used to
Sometimes you take a right
Find out that it's wrong
Don't know the difference in a way
It ain't for now and then
Always help me find my way again

Another restless day
Looking for a sign
Another wasted afternoon
Maybe even though
The thought is on my mind
Don't mean that I won't see it soon
It ain't if for now and then
Always help me find my way again

So won't you roll on
Sweet baby, roll on
Roll on
Sweet baby, roll on
Keep on rolling
Sweet baby, roll on
Lead the way again

It ain't if for now and then
Always help me find my way again

Won't you roll on
Sweet baby, roll on
Roll on
Sweet baby, roll on
Keep on rolling
Sweet baby, roll on
Lead the way again
Oh, lead the way again
