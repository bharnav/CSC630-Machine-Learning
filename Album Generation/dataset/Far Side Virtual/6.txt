You might lose
On the strip hanging loose

Decide who you choose
Illusions that you use

When angel's get too much power
I can't lie, I just want the power
I can't die no no
Leave me this high in paradise

Life in L.A. burn out your face
Sunshine like it sprayed you with mace
Living with ease in the city of dreams
Palm trees are green but the money's even greener

Yuppy believers sleeping in the sewers
Big suit dreamers packing the cleaners
Hey sunshine I'll make you mine
Hypnotized in the endless summer time

When angel's get too much power
I can't lie, I just want the power
I can't die no no
Leave me this high in paradise

Tinted glass big boss first class
Ice queens in albino limousines
American dreams slicker than magazines
Humanity on speed praying for sanity

I saw Christ in the city of schemes, he had a crack pipe and some ripped jeans
Cadillac door on all fours, reality TV fresh at the source
