I saw Pete and Johnny too
Dressed up in their Sunday suits
Getting themselves all up to go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show
I fixed the gate like you told me to
Done my chores like I always do
And I won?t tell mama you let me go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show

Please Papa can I go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show
Please Papa don?t you say I can?t
I just want to see the elephant

I?ll borrow the truck from uncle Phil
You know I can drive it well
He won?t need it now that the hay?s all in
Just let me go and see the elephant

Sister she can?t go with me
This is not for her to see

Little brother you?ll get your chance
To go down and see the elephant

Little brother you?ll get your chance
To go down and see the elephant

They?re looking for a few good men
Could be war by summer?s end
Sure would hate it if I went
And never got to see the elephant

I saw Pete and Johnny too
Dressed up in their Navy Blues
Gettin? themselves all up to go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show
