[Verse 1]
She gets a little restless in the spring
She might follow the lines you sing
Bullshit though they are
'Cause sometimes that's just the thing
If delivered with panache and a certain grace
Fingertips on satin lace
Cuttin' cards and quoting Proust
Whatever turns her wild mare loose

[Verse 2]
She gets a little restless now and then
She feels the changes in the wind
Way down deep where I can't see
She can get clean away from me
With a side step and subtle shift
And the turning of a key
Locks me out and lets me drift
She'll come back if I let her be
She'll come back if I let her be

[Chorus]
And you know I'm just a little down tonight
I'm just a little down
A little messed up is all I'm sayin'
Just a little down tonight
I'm just a little down
But I believe I'll make it
Believe I'll make it

[Verse 3]
She gets a little restless I can tell
When she goes back up inside her shell
And the conversation slows
To a stop and I might as well
Be out alone on the highway
Way off in the Utah sage
Wavin' to the railroad crew
That's when I get restless too

[Chorus]
And I'm just a little down tonight
I'm just a little down
A little messed up is all I'm sayin'
Just a little down tonight
I'm just a little down
But I believe I'll make it
Believe I'll make it

[Outro]
She gets a little restless in the spring
She might follow the lines you sing
Bullshit though they are
Sometimes that's just the thing
