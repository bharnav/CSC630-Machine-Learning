Where have been? I don?t want to know
Probably some place I wouldn?t want to go
Who were you with? What did you see?
Whatcha talk about? Whatcha say about me?

Where have you been? I won?t let it drop
What were you thinking? When you gonna stop?
What were you thinking? When you gonna learn?
When you gonna give anything in return?
What were you thinking? It better be good
When you gonna act like you know you should?
When you gonna act like you know you should?
When you gonna do like you said you would?

Well it goes all night like a broken record
You know it wouldn?t take all that muchTo bring me down from all that pressureI guess you just know when it?s bad enough

Well it goes all night like a broken record
We come right back to the same old stuff
We don?t back down and it don?t get betterI guess you just now when it?s bad enough

The car?s on the curb, the key?s in the lock
Houses all dark up and down the block
Swaying on the sidewalk, sneaking through the door
Waitin? for the sound of your shoes on the floor
Waiting for the gallows, waiting for the noose
Waiting for the sound of your combat boots
?Cause the order?s come down to launch the attach
Scheduled to commence the minute I get back
