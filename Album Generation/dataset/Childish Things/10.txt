[Verse 1]
Picked you up in Pocatello
At some truck stop parkin' lot
Out beside that burned up Volvo
With the smokin' engine shot
You just left that Volvo lyin'
You never gave it half a thought
Faithless, fine, and gone

[Verse 2]
You said you came from Randolph
Up across the Wasatch Range
You kept talkin' clear to Salt Lake
Liked to drove us all insane
But now I'm flyin' down
That four lane highway screamin' out your name
Faithless, fine, and gone

[Chorus]
Batten down the hatches
I can hear my grandma say
"Boy you like to play with matches
"Gonna burn yourself someday"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna haul on back to Denver
Just as soon as I get through
And I'm burnt down to smolderin' embers
But I guess I can make do
And now I hear some guy that used to manage some band I never heard of
Is trying to manage you
Faithless, fine, and gone

[Chorus]
Batten down the hatches
I can hear my grandma say
"Boy you like to play with matches
"Gonna burn yourself someday"

She said, "Boy you like to play with matches
"Gonna burn yourself someday"
