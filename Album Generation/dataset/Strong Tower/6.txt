How lovely is
Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty,
My soul doth long
And even faint
For You
For you my heart
Is satisfied
Within Your presence
I see beneath
The shadow of
Your wings

[Chorus]
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

How lovely is
Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty,
My soul doth long
And even faint
For You
For You my heart
Is satisfied
Within Your presence
I see beneath
The shadow of
Your wings

[Chorus]
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

(My heart and flesh cry out)
For You, the Living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted, and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You

[Chorus]
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere.
