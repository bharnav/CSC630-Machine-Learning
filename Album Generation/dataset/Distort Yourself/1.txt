These nights are getting longer
Seems like I've always been awake
There is danger in the houses
A nemesis in shape

She took my metal bones
Placed them where I could feel again
You know how bad things get
When animals attack
You will need fire
When animals attack you need fire

9 lives for the madmen
Trouble for the sane
What is good for your survival
May not be good for your health

She took my mental bones
She took my soul and everything
You know how bad things get
When animals attack
You need fire
When animals attack
You need fire
When animals attack and

There's no way out
When there is no way out
When there is no way out

The more I need the less I know
How I will try to need less
Try to need less

She cooked my mental bones
She took my soul and everything
You know how sad things get
When animals attack
You need fire
When animals attack
You need fire
When animals attack
When animals attack

When there is no way out
When there is now way out
When there is no way out
