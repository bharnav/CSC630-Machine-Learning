Gonna ride out on a speedboat
Gonna ride out on the radio
Gonna fix mine where possible
Gonna find myself a phone

We're so flammable
We go, we go, we glow

Mountains
Reach so close to the sun
One love
Takes you back where you become
Over mountains

Gotta get free
Like a fat wave
Gotta get free
From the circus
There spaces for acrobats
But the jugglers
Are done

We're so flammable
We go, we glow, we glow

Mountains
We fly so close to the sun
One love
Takes you back where you become
Mountains
We fly so close to the sun

I need the heat of your love
We're falling
Seems we can't get up
I'm not losing you again

It's a step away
From overload
Did you bring any water?
We're so flammable
We glow, we glow, we glow

Mountains
We fly so close to the sun
One love
Takes you back where you become
Some days
We get so far from where we've come
Mountains

Mountains
Mountains

We fly so close to the sun
We fly so close to the sun
We fly so close to the sun
