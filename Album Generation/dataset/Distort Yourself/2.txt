Steal your love
As the good die young
Take what's yours
Before they come

All the right moves might
Still leave you in the wrong place
The strangest beauty's in the strangest places
Strangest beauty's in the empty spaces

Come on through
Come on over
You'd better not run or they shoot you down
And they're all over this town

Take your shot
As they're far between
Nature kills and so can we
Your're walking a thin line
You're making me nervous now
Something's about to go so wrong

Come on through
Come on over

You'd better not run
Or they shoot you down
We all need satisfaction
And its all over this town

Strangest beauty's in the strangest places
Strangest beauty's in the empty spaces

Come on through
Come on over

You'd better not run or they shoot you down

We all need satisfaction
And its all over
As we move closer

So come on through
Come on over

Come on through
Come on over, over ,over, oh
