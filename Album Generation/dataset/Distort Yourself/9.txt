Transformation
We become someone else
Dislocation
As we get so far from ourselves
My condition's getting worse
I can't do without
Addiction is the lust
That won't let you out

All your secrets and your lies
Walk fast out of burning buildings
Kill youth with easy listening
You gotta keep terror at a healthy distance
It's fine
From time to time

Conversations
Are something of the past
Investigations
Of everything that holds us back
Your contrition is deserved
You'd like to disappear
Find a new home
For your salty tears

All your secrets and your lies
Walk fast out of burning buildings
Kill youth with easy listening
You gotta keep terror at a healthy distance
Godspeed to sustain illusions
It's fine
From time to time
It's fine
Was the landmines
Landmines

Walk fast out of burning buildings
Kill youth with easy listening
Godspeed to sustain illusions

Godspeed to sustain illusions
Walk fast
Walk fast
Gotta keep terror at a healthy distance
Godspeed

You gotta keep terror at a healthy distance
