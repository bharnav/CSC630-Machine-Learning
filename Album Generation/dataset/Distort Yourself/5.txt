We're going down the tubes
To the underground
Look what we've gone and done
We're getting to the point
Where nothing seems to work anymore
If tolerace is dead
There'll be no rest for the living
Imagine no trouble
And a little respite

This boom box needs batteries
This boom box needs batteries
Lovers and dangerous love
Will find a way through everything
Sick at the thought of losing you
No one else in my room
Soft as the snow that comes
You move like electric window
We take love where it comes
To the world we run

She can't seem to find her feet
She can't seem to find her way up
Her face a thousand words
When all there is to say
Lord knows you need disciples
God knows you need friends

This boom box needs batteries
This boom box needs batteries
Lovers and dangerous love
Will find a way through everything
Sick at the thought of losing you
No one else in my room
Soft as the snow that comes
You move like electric window
We take love when it comes
To the world we run
Taken it back to you, taken it back
Taken it back to you, taken it back

Just trying to live
Just dying to give
And girl goes see that bridge
I'll meet you there
Could you meet me there, oh
I want my television
Comfort in a cathode ray
I want my television

Lovers and dangerous love
Will find a way through everything
Sick at the thought of losing you
No one else in my room
Soft as the snow that comes
You move like electric window
We take love when it comes
To the world we run
To the world we run
Lovers and dangerous love
Lovers and dangerous love

Lovers
Lovers
