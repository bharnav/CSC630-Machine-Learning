They got aeroplanes
Flying over you
You cannot escape
See them watching you?
Be paranoid
They have lists
The walls are listening
They know what you did

Love is stronger then hate
We are always on planes
Find mad love in a wasteland
Find space in everything you can
Find mad love in the wasteland
Find space, find space

Taste the happiness
While she's hanging out with you
From a shadows
Life comes through
Be ready then
It could be anytime
If they come for you
Let them see you shine

Love is stronger then hate
We are always on planes
Find mad love in a wasteland
Find space in everything you can
Find mad love in the wasteland
Find space, find space

Got to find my way out of the wasteland
Move as fast as I can
Find my way out of the wasteland

They got aeroplanes
Flying over you
You cannot escape
You cannot escape
You cannot escape

Find mad love in a wasteland
Find space in everything you can
Find mad love in the wasteland
Find space, find space
In everything you can
In everything you can

Find my way out the wasteland
Find my way out the wasteland
