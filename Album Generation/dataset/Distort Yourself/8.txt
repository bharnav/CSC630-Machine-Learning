This staying alive can kill you
It's taking years off of my life
Build my world within you but loneliness comes
You can cure you're iodine
The world is better for your grace
If I plead insanity can I still crash at your place?

There are only so many ambulances
To go around
There are only so many accidents
It's the universe coming down

Not trying to kill you
It's just proof of life
Not trying to kill you
One day at a time

She feeds off desire
She's in me
To worlds I'd never guessed
I am sure she'll be with me until the very end

There are only so many ambulances
Less you ask the more you see
There are only so many accidents
It's the universe and nothing's free

I'm not trying to kill you
It's just moves of life
Not trying to kill you
One day at a time
Not trying to kill you
One day, one day

Oh, life can be so unwell
Oh, speeding between heaven and hell
Oh, lately there's been so much to tell

There are only so many ambulances
There are only so many ambulances
Not trying to kill you
It's just proof of life
Not trying to kill you
One day at a time
Not trying to kill you
One day, one day, hey

There are only so many ambulances to go around
To go around
To go around
