There's been delays
Murders of emotions
Distractions in waves
Stunted elevations

Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to think for yourself
Huh? Can't seem to live without

Information age
System Overload
Shoot you for the fame
Lies flow fast like forehead sutures

We've been betrayed and
Now we are the hunted
Quartered and splayed
Poisoned by assumption

Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to think for yourself
Huh? Can't seem to live without

Information age
System overload
Shoot you for the fame
Lies flow fast like TV futures

My lows, my lows, my lows

Disinformation
Dancing on graves
All ego reminiscence
All your evil little ways, ways, ways, ways

Information age
System overload
Shoot you for the fame
Lies flow fast like TV futures

Information age
System Overload
Shoot you for the fame

My lows, my lows, my lows
My lows, my lows, my lows
My lows, my lows, my lows
