Upon any conversion of Class F Common Stock to Class A Common Stock, all rights of the holder of such shares of Class F Common Stock shall cease and the person or persons in whose names or names the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class F Common Stock are to be issued, if any, shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or holders of such number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such Class F Common Stock were convertible. Shares of Class F Common Stock that are converted into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided in this Section 6.8 shall be retired and shall not be reissued.

The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Class F Common Stock, such number of its shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class F Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

6.9	Adjustment in Authorized Class A Common Stock. The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Class A Common Stock then outstanding) by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company.

The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any director or officer of the Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding. The Company shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person only if the Proceeding was authorized by the Board.
The Company shall have the power to indemnify, to the extent permitted by the Delaware Corporation Law, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time, any employee or agent of the Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding.

Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim accruing or arising or that, but for this Article, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

Article 11
Except as provided in Article 10 above, the Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon Stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
