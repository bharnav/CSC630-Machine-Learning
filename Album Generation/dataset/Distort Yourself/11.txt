Save the robots
Save yourselves
Keep your head to the future boy
For everything it's worth

I didn't mean to collide with you
We fell so far from earth

No guru
No system
No mantra

Save the robots
Save your friends
Try a little selfless
Try whatever works

No guru
No system
No mantra
No mantra

So don't you try me
You'll never find me
I was here before
You're never found me then

No guru
No system
No mantra
No mantra
No mantra
No mantra

Save the robots
Save the robots
Save yourselves
Save yourselves
Save yourselves
