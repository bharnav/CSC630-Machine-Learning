Cool to disappear but
I missed you most days
An army of tattooed angels
Have brought me back today

I'm a waster boy
Anti-masterplan
Been stuck inside this lonely room again
You get paranoid
See vultures circling
One slip then down comes the final curtain
Until, you come, into your soul again
We'll be the worst of best friends
Doesn't feel like christmas in hollywood
Doesn't feel like we're ever going to make it home

Burn, baby burn
Strung out on a wire
Heart in a cage
You're so full of desire
You need, fast hands
To deal with all the liars
So don't burn baby burn baby burn

It's a waste of joy
I can hardly stand
Been looking for the ramp for my escape
I love animals, so close to perfect
They're the only ones who seem to know their heart
Doesn't feel like christmas in hollywood
Doesn't feel like we could ever come undone

Burn, baby burn
Strung out on a wire
Heart in a cage
You're so full of desire
You need, fast hands
To deal with all the liars
Bullet-proof skin to keep you alive
Burn, baby burn
Strung out on a wire
So don't burn baby burn baby burn

I can't hold you, i can't hold you, i can't hold you
To lose you is to never love again
To lose you is to never love again
To lose you is to never love again
To lose you...

Burn, baby burn
Strung out on a wire
Heart in a cage
You're so full of desire
You need, fast hands
To deal with all the liars
Bullet-proof skin to keep you alive
Burn, baby burn
Strung out on a wire
So don't burn baby burn baby burn

I can't hold you, i can't hold you
I can't hold you, i can't hold you
