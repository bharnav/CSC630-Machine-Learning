Forever, I'll wait here
Well, I don't know what it is you see in me
Cause I'm everything you won't believe
I'm certain you're not
Wish you'd just stop and walk away
We'll do our own separate ways
Cause it's too late
I just can't stay

Stare at you as you slit my wrist
And as we share our last kiss
Hold me as we die
Empty bottles to deal with this
Pictures to remember this
Hold me, say goodbye

The darkest night's now solid black
As I see it there's no turning back
We chose this path now we can't walk away
Cause it's too late
I feel the blood falling out
I hit the ground
It's all gone down

Stare at you as you slit my wrist
And as we share our last kiss
Hold me as we die
Empty bottles to deal with this
Pictures to remember this
Hold me, say goodbye
Hold me as we die

Memories gone by
Yesterday's lost in time
We left them without a clue
I thought myself without you

Stare at you as you slit my wrist
And as we share our last kiss
Hold me as we die
Empty bottles to deal with this
Pictures to remember this
Hold me, say goodbye
