Remembering the night again
So cold outside, the snow began
That winter stone cold like a life
Your eyes were wide enough to fill
I was so bored, it should've spilled
Chicago skyline lit the night

Cut my nose, bite my face
Tonight will last forever
Take my life with your hands

I laid with you until the end
Watching the breathe crawl from your bones
My alibi was lost that night
So take your last breathe in tonight
With the frozen sky, surround your eyes
Chicago skyline lit the night

Cut my nose, bite my face
Tonight will last forever
Take my life with your hands
