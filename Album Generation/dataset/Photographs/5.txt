We watch this blackness eat away the cold blue sky
Terrified, this is our last goodbye
The dead will walk the streets tonight
In my nightmare we never last this night

So fill your lungs this one last time
Before I wake up to nothing
Alone in the dark

Listen, you almost hear my laughing
Watching as the world ends
Lying in this six foot grave

So fill your lungs this one last time
In my nightmare there is no place to hide
This plague will take on everyone
Even the sun rise won't save us from night's fateful cry

Listen, you almost hear my laughing
Watching as the world ends
Never thought it'd end this way
Lightening, graveyard burning bright now
Watching as the world ends
Lying in this six foot grave
There's vacant space

There's nothing left but my nightmares
Ask you to stay, but it's dead here

Listen, you almost hear my laughing
Watching as the world ends
Never thought it'd end this way
Lightening, graveyard burning bright now
Watching as the world ends
Lying in this six foot grave
There's vacant space

Watch me laugh as the world dies
