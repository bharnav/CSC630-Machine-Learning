I want this
She hates this
I'm not who I used to be
You've passed by, I've still tried
To make something of me
No one believes in me
No one sees what I see
Should I just erase this all from my memory?

I can't take this
It's been too long
I'm drowning in
My own song
As I come to rest

I left home, then broke down
In a town called Misery
Surrender, I'll never be what I want to be
No one believes in me
No one sees what I see
Should I just erase this all from my memory?

I can't take this
It's been too long
I'm drowning in
My own song
As I come to rest

This world I created for myself
I forgot to bring someone else
Now I'm drowning alone
Now I'm drowning alone
I break down, I fall out
I'm burned out, and I'm lost without
With nothing to say

I can't take this
It's been too long
I'm drowning in
My own song
As I come to rest

This world I created for myself
I forgot to bring someone else
Now I'm drowning alone
Now I'm drowning alone
