His actions speak nothing
But lies, intoxicated eyes
And lonely hearts
Are held accounted for

Disease eats inside
Nothing left to hide
The sun starts to rise
As his black heart dies
As his black heart dies

You're my mistake
And I know it's wrong
Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know
These secrets, keeping us alive

Break my chest in two
(Break my chest in two)
A shallow heart for you

Half a heart is all you see
Bleeding off dependency
Got nothing left to hide
As his black heart dies
As his black heart dies

You're my mistake
(As his black heart dies)
And I know it's wrong
(As his black heart dies)

Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know
(As his black heart dies)
These secrets keeping us alive

I leave my heart to take
With blood shot eyes
Your heart will break

As this night fades again
(As this night fades again)
So broken down I've lost again
I'm lost again

You're my mistake
(As his black heart dies)
And I know it's wrong
(As his black heart dies)

Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know
(As his black heart dies)
These secrets keeping us alive

You're my mistake
(As his black heart dies)
And I know it's wrong
(As his black heart dies)

Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know
(As his black heart dies)
These secrets keeping us alive
