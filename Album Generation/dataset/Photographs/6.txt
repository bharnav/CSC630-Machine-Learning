My heart is pounding
From all of my surrounding
Enemies are closing in
In this nightmare I don't win
No one left to trust
Living in disgust
The memory brings the start again
As I suffocate, hang me out to dry

I've been here before
My twisted little nightmare
It's recurring now
I've been here before
I've got my heart tied up
Just like they wanted
I guess I'll do this again

My heart is breaking
From the words you're saying
This eerie feeling seems so strange
Let me go, I need to change
This love I confess
This night seems endless
Fill me up and drown me out
As I suffocate, hang me out to dry

I've been here before
My twisted little nightmare
It's recurring now
I've been here before
I've got my heart tied up
Just like they wanted
I guess I'll do this again

My heart is breaking
From the words you're saying

I've been here before
My twisted little nightmare
It's recurring now
I've been here before
I've got my heart tied up
Just like they wanted

I guess I'll do this again
