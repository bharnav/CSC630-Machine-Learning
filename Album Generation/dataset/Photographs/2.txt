Is this good bye?
Well you'd be better off dead
Than lying here alone
I'm desperately waiting
For the beating of my heart
It just won't come

Unless you creep into this night
Find me, rip it from my chest
Now my love is meaningless
For my death you won't confess

We have cursed this night
The blame play, start my lies

Well I'd be better off dead
Than lying here alone
I cursed you and I
With my psychopathic mind
I cut you deep, stitched you up
Until there's nothing left but scars
I know I'm wrong for what I've done
Condemn me to a life alone

We have cursed this night
The blame play, start my lies
The ambulance cries out
It won't be long till sirens fill the sky
Is this goodbye?

You're eyes are electric tonight
Despite the condition you lie
Wipe the blood off your lips
With the kiss I taste the goodbye
I taste the goodbye, goodbye

We have cursed this night
The blame play, start my lies
The ambulance cries out
It won't be long till sirens fill the sky
This is goodbye
