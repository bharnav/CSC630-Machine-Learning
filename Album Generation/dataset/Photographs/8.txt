I'm dying for you

You can keep your secrets
But that's all you get to keep
You can keep your mindset lost in misery
Keep me in the dark
With the truth is where I'll sit
Put me in the closet, but I just can't fit
I'm slowly dying by watching you

I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me
I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me

I see your pictures of the past
They haunt me
I can see the truth, but I just won't believe
And now you're skeletons are taunting me
I just can't face all my memories
I'm slowly dying by watching you

I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me
I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me

As I fall apart inside
On and on, It's killing me this time
As I suffer and I die
On and on and on and on

I'm dying for you
Yeah, I'm dying for you
I'm dying for you

I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me
I'm watching you, watching me
I'm wanting you, wanting me

I'm dying for you
