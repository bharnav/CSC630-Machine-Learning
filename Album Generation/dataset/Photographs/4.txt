Is our time gone forever?
Nothing else seems to matter
Sitting to watch the sun die
Goodbye
Feeling uninspired
Left alone and tired
Waking up to nothing
I need something

I can't say goodbye forever
But I'll say goodbye for now
This time, like last time
It's over
I'm leaving this behind

The walls are closing in now
I'm walking through it somehow
Waking up with nothing
Give me something
I've lost all sense of meaning
Staring at the ceiling
No longer believing everything

I can't say goodbye forever
But I'll say goodbye for now
This time, like last time
It's over
I'm leaving this behind

I can't stand another day without you
But I have to walk away
Infatuation's got me going crazy
Desperation makes me stay
I'm leaving this behind

This time, like last time
It's over
I'm leaving this behind

I've taken all that I can take
So I'm leaving this behind
I'm leaving this behind
