This attraction only to appearance
Becoming your religion
Looks are everything
The only thing
That means something to you

Satisfaction only on the surface
Your eyes are always focused
Go on and let it show
That there is no exception to the rule

So fill the empty space
With another pretty face
You're skin deep skin deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin deep skin deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

First impressions are over in an instant
You make your decision
Before you speak a word
You end your search
The page already turned

Every conquest filled with disappointment
Lacking any substance
Now you're out of words
The lines are blurred
You're never gonna learn

So fill the empty space
With another pretty face
You're skin deep skin deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin deep skin deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

Skin deep skin deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin deep skin deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

Look all your life for beauty this fine
So rare so hard to find
Look all your life for beauty this fine
Nevermind what's inside

Skin deep skin deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin deep skin deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize
