Liquid courage pouring down
Sober surface hits the ground
The masquerade has started now
And you have faded into the crowd

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are
How do you know when you've gone too far to get high again?

You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?
So much pressure to fit in
Never know where to begin
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?

Liquid courage pouring down
Sober surface can't be found
There's no denial, you can drown
Nothing's final so turn around

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are
How do you know when you've gone too far to get high again?

You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?
So much pressure to fit in
Never know where to begin
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?

I want this?
Do I want this?...

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are
How do you know when you've gone too far to get high again?

You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?
So much pressure to fit in
Never know where to begin
Whose influence, whose influence are you under now?
