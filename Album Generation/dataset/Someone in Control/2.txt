Let me play
And I've been dying to let you win
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?
And I wonder
But the less I get the more I give
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes you see
I want someone to notice me

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim [x2]

No regrets
Even if it's all I get
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me?
And it still hurts
It's never easy to forget
Do I wanna be
What you never asked me?

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes you see
I want you to notice me

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim [x2]

(I'm right here) - x2

And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
And I'm right here
So come and get me!
So come and get me!

And I don't wanna be
Your new victim [x4]
