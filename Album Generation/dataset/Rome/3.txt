Every girl gets her dreams
Cast into reality
Never seemed to bother me
Only just recently

'Cause you seem to believe
That we'll never be free
Always gonna be needing

Can't we be
Like the season's trees
Changeably
Just not so easily

All in all we're the same
Jumping through hoops of flames
Sounds fun, what a dangerous game
Pretty picture trapped in frame

But you seem to behave
Like we'll always be slaves
Never running away

Can't we be
Like the season's trees
Changeably
Just not too easily

'Cause you seem to believe
That we'll never be free
Always gonna be needing

Can't we be
Like the season's trees
Changeably
Just not so easily
