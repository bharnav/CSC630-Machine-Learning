Slide your feet, create the shock
Touch another, watch it pop
Live a little, live a lot
And show me everything you've got

Oh, cause it takes sometime
And just a little bit good
Reality won't hurt for longer than it should
Talking about the pain that is there
Face the fact and don't act like you don't care

Cause you gotta stop and show it
Just so I know you know it
Maybe just a little bit, oh, come on admit it right now
Cause I know that it won't be over til it's gone
So let it be gone....

And show me everything you've got
I know you're scared
But let your walls just drop
You gotta take that step and your heart and just let it pour out

Now I know it's hard
To be something that you don't think you are
But it's hard for me to even try to understand
Why you are beating your own heart
Cause you gotta try, just try to be honest
And I will be honest all these things that I say
And I'll listen clear whether brave or you're modest I'm here
Don't hold back, don't hesitate, don't disappear!

And show me everything you've got
I know you're scared
But let your walls just stop
You gotta take that step and your heart and just let it pour out

And show me everything you've got
I know you're scared
But it's time for you to stop
You gotta take that step and your heart just let it make sound

So hey, just let it pour out
And don't let your past begin to let you down
Just sing it out, just let it make sound
And as it will hurt, it will be healed and found...
Cause it's normal that emotional past can spawn emotionless dads
Mothers, and nations flags
So just show your face
No don't be afraid
No don't be afraid to show your face...

After all these things I've learned
Bad things I do and don't deserve
Can easily just shape my life
Or shape the way I start to die... No!

Cause it's up to me
If I'll dwell much longer than I should
And I'll hold my tears for years thinking it's doing me good
So just start right now
Just make a vow
You'll let your heart just sing it out, sing it out!

And show me everything you've got
I know you're scared
But let your walls just stop
You gotta take that step and your heart and just let it pour out

And show me everything you've got
I know you're scared
But it's time for you to stop
You gotta take that step and your heart just let it make sound
