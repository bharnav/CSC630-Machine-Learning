Just walk away
And gather your thoughts for the second wave
Of this argument on this epic, changing day
It's crazy to think that an hour ago all things were great
But we stand here both proud both wrong and right
Throwing cheap shots in this stubborn fight
And our lives are so intertwined in one
But we're just so stuck in this moment it's clear that were coming undone

And you see, it's hard for me to breath
When I get all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
That we can be so mad we consider to not exist
When we both know there's so much love clenched within our fists

The goodbye waves in the driveway they just resonate
And yes I am throwing it right back at her
While were drowning in rivers from our faces
We just wanna know if, this, is this over?
A trembling silence fills the air as we stand here, so impaired, so aware

I sit in this house
Alone with fresh photographs
And I just can't relax
And like cigarette smoke, I'm starting to choke on this
That half of my soul is on the road in a car with a girl in a dress...

And it's making it hard for me to breath
When I get all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
That just to say I'm right, your wrong, we both lose to win

The goodbye waves in the driveway they just resonate
And yes I am throwing it right back at her
While were drowning in rivers from our faces
We just wanna know if this, is this over?
A trembling silence fills the air
As we stand here...

So hey now, maybe we're just being stupid
Maybe we're just being dumb
Hey, maybe it's time that we stopped and we realized
Like a flag in the wind we are one
And how at first it's made so pure and lovely
But in battle can be torn to shreds
But with time and with patience and love and affection
Can be fixed with needle and thread
Because I love you and you love me
And nothing will make this leave
I said I love you and you love me
And nothing will make, make, make, make this leave
So remember me
Remember me
Remember me...
And don't walk away
