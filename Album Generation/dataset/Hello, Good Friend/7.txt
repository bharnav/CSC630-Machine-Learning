Night has found its way here
And all I can hear are memories shrill and clear
Like today a man had his way
And stole what I made
He saw that I was sincere

So use me up, then throw me away
Build your careers and "friendships"
Quote end Quote, and frankly I'm ashamed
That I left my name on her lips...
Cause when it is, they'll swear it is

So I'll fall asleep and try not to think twice
About all the things that forever
Will kick me down the steps
For being too nice
Cause everyone's searching for treasure

And they'll just dig, dig, dig
Until they can't get out
Dying dirty digging for treasure
But as for me I'm giving up and I'll take my bow
And focus on my treasure forever
Yes, I know that my treasure is heaven...
