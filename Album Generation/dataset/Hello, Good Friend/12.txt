What a perfect ending
To this film we are watching
'Cause she loves her boyfriend
Like he has loved his girlfriend

Just like the night sleeps on by
Just like the sun wakes the sky
They are so in love
Like we are so in love

So hug it tight and embrace it
Don't let the world deface it
Just let it shout with amazement
As we dance tonight

Just like the cold becomes spring
Just like the perfect day dream
Just like your pretty eyes gleam
We are so in love

Oh-ho-whoa

(Silence)

Please mister spare some change
For a poor broken man in need
I'm sick and dying walking barefoot
Please just buy me a drink

The truth is that I'd like to die
But I fear of where I could go, if that's real
'Cause take a look; I'm so drunk, stupid, and worthless
For some Jesus you feel, if that's real

So let me get this straight
Cause I have a question
You're saying he'd listen if I were to speak
Yes that's what I'm saying, in fact I was just thinking
He's probably thinking of asking you the same very thing
He wants to say "you're okay, be my friend
Let me help you and take you out of this lake that you are clearly drowning in
Make me yours and I'll make your mine"

So hey, listen up friends
Good news is coming
Soon is the end of all the world's troubles
And all of it's sin
I said hey, listen up friends
Oh, good news is coming
Soon is the end of all the world's troubles
And all of it's sin
