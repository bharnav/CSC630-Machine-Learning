I started to feel while I was
Walking down the street
Yes I did, and I started thinking
'Bout my destiny...
And how maybe, maybe just someday
I could repay all the times, you sang...

All of your warm colors
Have painted all my days
And all of the tragic tears
You took off of my face
See I've fallen off these train tracks
And nearly seen my death
And I stand here with a song that's left...

This will be my destiny
You will be my song and I will sing
So don't cover up your ears, hear me
And what I have to tell
I hope that these words they find you well

I know, I"ll know, when I see it I will know
It's home, that I'll go
When it's my turn to clock out
It's almost like dreaming
But so real I can't explain
That it's almost hard to think or say to try to be a different way...

This will be my destiny
You will be my song and I will sing
So don't cover up your ears, hear me
And what I have to tell...

So you, do you know what it is you do?
I assume, that you're thinking
"Why yes, I do."
Well I just hope and pray that you change that soon
And I would hope and pray if I were you...

If I were you
If I were you
If I were you
If I were you...
I'd be asking every single person I knew
To just please say a pray for me...
'Cause I will most assuredly die this century
And in this opportune filled life that I will leave
I hope to God that I lived for you and not for me
