Hey what you got?
You don't know anything that I'm gonna say right now
Cuz I'm not so sure why I'm here or why I want to
Keep on hanging around right now
Not that I'd do it now or any day
But sometimes I just get bummed out
About lots of things and well, just doubt

So tell me something good, you got it
Why am I so misunderstood?
Cuz I wanna know this
Cuz I'm confused and do I break into
So tell me how about you?

Hey what you got?
Something bad and I want it
Even though I know it's wrong
But I won't be blessed, yes I know this, so I can't have that
So I like good Job I gotta be strong
But man, I don't wanna be able to breath
Be able to see what's become
Of the wars of this world and the wars from my tongue

So tell me something good, you got it
Why am I so misunderstood?
Cuz I wanna know this
I'm confused and I bruise
Yes I do, so tell me how about you?

So please just tell me something good, you got it
Why am I so misunderstood?
Cuz I wanna know this
Come on baby and race me  and maybe
We'll just find ourselves... a home

I wanna be, I wanna be like that mountain
I wanna stand taller and bigger than rest
See I just want to be "it", a guy who wins all the time
I want to be a big star, a king, and rule my own life
But God I know that it's wrong
So please just make my heart right, inside, and destroy my pride

So you can tell me something good, you got it
Why I am so misunderstood?
Cuz I wanna know this
Cuz I'm confused and do break into so tell how about you?
So please just tell me something good, you got it
Why am I so misunderstood?
Cuz I wanna know this
Come on baby and race me and maybe we'll just find ourselves...

Hey what you got, something bad, and I want it
Even though I know it's wrong...
