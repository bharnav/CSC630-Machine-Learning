Don't just don't sit down
I'm wanting this to be
A super natural flood of life
And not just make believe
Singing about what's real to me
Gasping for air, trying to breathe
While being pulled from beneath

While sticking oh so hard to just stay alive
Treading over time
While I'm slowly dying
I take one last breathe and one last prayer to survive
Then the waves they break me
And the air it hits my face
My lungs then fill with this new found grace
I swallowed the air quick to awake to such a beautiful day...

I was so alone
I was to myself
Thought I was on my way
But I was missing you
So make it  oh oh
Break it out
Take this wherever you want
And I want to go
So just lead the way on this train on which I roll...

Oh oh!

I was so alone
I was to myself
Thought I was on my way
But I was missing you!
So make it oh oh
Break it out
Take this wherever you want
And I want to go...
