I just ran into a few someones today
Some ones that I never really knew
And I used to think that I had them all so figured out...

But no, none of it's true, cuz I never knew you
And now, the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So "Hello, good friend. I wanna be next to you, for my head, for my heart, for it's true."

So I'll burn all the thoughts of the things that I once said
Because you tore down the walls that the world that has put inside my head
And I just get sick of the things that we think, we think we know...

But no, none of it's true, cuz I never knew you
And now, the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So "Hello, good friend. I wanna be next to you, for my head, for my heart, for it's true."

So take me
And save me
And change me
And then make me
And embrace me
And then brave my heart for you
Because I can't go on without you
And it's time for something new

And no, none of it's true, cuz I never knew you
And now, the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So "Hello, good friend. I wanna be next to you, for my head, for my heart, for it's true."

And as they as strolled along
My heart broke out in song
From all the things and the thoughts and assumptions that I had wrong
So now I'll be on my way, to make this claim
"I'll make it famous in every way, I'll make it stay, when I will say... That no, none of it's true, cuz I never knew you. And now, the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you. So Hello, Good Friend. I wanna be next to you, for my head, for my heart, for it's true."
