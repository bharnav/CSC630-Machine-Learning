Dance until we just can't
Keep clappin our hands to the songs and
Keep dancin around to the joyful sound that the band plays
As his smiling face just shines away
It's moving through town as big as a train
April, May, June and July we'll hang outside
August through February all the time
Talking our way through March
Hanging out always till this starts
Over and over again you promise that it won't end
So I will try to find a rhyme to thank you again

And how I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea of being without you
And no this won't be a sad song
There's going to be claps and singing along
Cause sad song about now, well that would just feel wrong

Beautiful colors they came from you
So this ones goes out to the reds and yellows and blues
And of course I can't forget all the beautiful colors on the day that we first met
So I will never know the right way to say thanks
For all those nights and days you spent hanging out
But that's what this is about

How I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea of being without you
And no, this won't be a sad song
There's going to be claps and singing along

Cause you're there when to talk and you're there not to stop and you're with me

Around the clock.. You are! You are!
Around the clock - Yes you are around the clock...

And just so ya'll know everyone else is not

So I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea...

And no, well this won't be a sad song
There's gonna be claps and singing along
Cause you're there when you talk and you're there not to stop
And you're with me... around the clock, all around the clock
