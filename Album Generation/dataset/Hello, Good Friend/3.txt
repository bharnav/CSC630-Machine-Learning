Do you ever do a thing or two just to wait
When you don't have a thing to say
I'll try to take this slow, but I don't know

'Cause I don't wanna wait
For time to look for the folks who try to say
That we don't know until we're old, cause that's how it goes
But I think I know (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Please pick me I'm a terrible mess
You know I just can't help it and I just gotta confess
You do what you do and I can't ever rest, so stay

I'm gonna do everything
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it good
I'm gonna do it alright
I'm gonna write it down
I'm gonna make a sound

'Cause I'm doing everything for you
'Cause I love to be near you
Something just takes me away to a place where I'm happy
'Cause I'm doing everything for you
Yeah you know that I adore you
And I just can't take it anymore

Oh! Oh! You know I gotta know, yeah, oh no

So I'll be making up things for you to see
Like romantic lights surrounding Italy
'Cause you deserve the very best, and I'll never rest
So I'll be sure to pass that test

And I just smile and say whoa, 'cause you just gotta know
That every time you stay, it never goes away
It reaches to the stars, and shines right through the clouds and lights up this whole world

Bless your heart you've made me happy again
It's been so long and I'm sick of pretending
You've enlightened the brain in my head, so stay

I'm gonna do everything
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it good
I'm gonna do it alright
I'm gonna write it down
I'm gonna make a sound

'Cause I'm doing everything for you
Because I love to be near you
Something just takes me away to a place where I'm happy
'Cause I'm doing everything for you
Yeah you know that I adore you
And I just can't take it...

'Cause I don't wanna wait for another day cause I can feel this is right
I don't wanna make this go on for too much longer
'Cause you've got a ring-less finger, and I could go buy a ring right now
Well, actually I don't have any money but that's okay
'Cause I can figure it out

I'm doing everything for you
Because I love to be near you
Something just takes me away to a place where I'm happy
'Cause I'm doing everything for you
Yeah you know that I adore you
And I just can't take it anymore

'Cause I'm doing everything
Yeah you know I'm doing everything
