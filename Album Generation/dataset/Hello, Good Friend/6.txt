For about four years I've hated this town
Yeah, so much I just wanna get out
Since graduation was long ago
Please somebody get me out of this hole
Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
When I am thirty-four just talkin' 'bout high school years
No I don't wanna be there, and feel so stuck right here
Back and forth, side to side, oh my dear

My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
A place we'll talk about now and the past what the future holds
Hanging out with not much to do
Just aimless with each other - is what we do

Cause this ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that it's like its all we have

Whoa! Whoa!

Come on say "Oh! Oh! Get on the floor!
Dance 'till you got no more!"
I know its there somewhere
Don't worry I'll be there to rock the party all night
To rock it 'til there's light our fists in the air
Fightin' the good fight
Cause' we were singing along to Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" song
You know it's clear that tonight we belong in this place
So I step back to reflect in this town I hate
And at least just for a second I think I might stay

This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that

So I'll run away to the hopes that I have
But still I fall asleep in the arms of my past
And when I wake so helpless and thinking of that
I just lay back down

Again, everyday

So maybe later today I'll know
What I will do with my life as I know it
Maybe for now I'll drive back to that place where I belong
And hope to God it hasn't changed

This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back
Nobody can take that no no no

This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back
Nobody can take that
That is that it's like its all we have
