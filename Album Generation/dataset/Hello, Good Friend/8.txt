Hear me
When I speak
And just listen
And try not to be
Some kind of self-righteous high being
Or the opposite and mislead me
To better your mind unseen
This is a story of how we can be...

They're building you up to tear you down
They won't admit it but it's true
Their smile and advice to end with your frown
Cuz they don't want what's best for you
It's sad I know, I know
But you know I know something else
And now it's my turn to just sit back and tell... that...

You don't know just when to stop
You're living life to be on top
So start back and be real
And just admit the way you feel
And see that that we are all one big learning gang
And it's true that
We all want to be the baddest
We all have a little baggage
Even though we hide it and we always will deny it
We are driving this float down Main
In this pride parade...

And I'm not saying that I'm any better than you
Sometimes I have motives that are just so stupid
And I play the fool
But man you're killing me
The charade has got to end
So stop acting like you know everything
Because you're missing the point
You are supposed to be my friend...

You don't know just when to stop
You're living life to be on top
So start back and be real
And just admit the way you feel
And see that that we are all one big learning gang
And it's true that
We all want to be the baddest
We all have a little baggage
Even though we hide it and we always will deny it
We are driving this float down Main
In this pride parade...

Just drive, just drive
Drive me away
Take me to another place
Where I know, I know
What's happening
To my head and to my dreams
Cuz I want, I want
I need, I need
Some peace of mind and clarity
So just take, take my hand and let's flee...

You don't know just when to stop
You're living life to be on top
So start back and be real
And just admit the way you feel
And see that that we are all one big learning gang
And it's true that
We all want to be the baddest
We all have a little baggage
Even though we hide it and we always will deny it
We are driving this float down Main
In this pride parade...
