So we try and try all of our life
Working with such pride
Making cash just to survive
As we race and grade and judge always -
Other folks mistakes...
Makes us good to feel that way...

And don't you know, it never stops
Try to please the world and beat the ticking clocks but I
I'm not letting it happen this time..

No, no Because they're rooting I'll fail
And rooting she'll bail
They feel so secure when I'm in this jail but I
I'm not letting it happen this time

So I'll...
Move to the other side of the block
So we won't ever have to stop making the rounds
Having the laughs
Singing the sounds of the relaxing
And on the other side of the clock
The power switch will be turned off
And all will be well
And time will stand still
And I will be locked out from my jail
