Tear you at the seams
Set me on fire
Can't afford to wake up
Can't afford not to either

In this busted town, in this busted room, bled out clean
Dance on the ropes, an elephant, hunt ivory
And the girls their eyes piano wire
Scream set me on fire
Set me on fire

While I rock the boat
Sing to me
We'll close our eyes a spell so dangerously
Inside the hole inside your heart a diamond key
Unlock your door, climb your stairs, watch you sleep
While my criminal stood to retire
Screams set me on fire
Set me on fire
