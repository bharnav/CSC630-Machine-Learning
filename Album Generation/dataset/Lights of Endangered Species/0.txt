Lie and say to me extraordinary fades
Not without degree, hid or sent away
Across a boundless sea prison shores ebb
Where man become machine looks death to live again

When I end carry me through the streets of my youth
And something I was will sing from your mouth of proof
And Eloise, walk beside me
And with our children step this prison shores ebb
