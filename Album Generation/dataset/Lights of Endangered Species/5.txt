Well it says
Let it be unto you
They all say
Let it be unto you
A mistake of the heart
Let it be unto you
Gonna rip you apart
But let it be unto you
Let it be unto you

What you escape
Let it be done to you
What you take away

Let it be done to you
For what you war
Let it be done to you
What you ignore
Let it be done to you

Might have rubbed you the wrong way
But that's all over now
You know we could have stayed
Instead of crawling off into the wilderness
Hurled lightning down from the buildings
Done something different...
