She goes about her day
And keeps her cool until the weekend
In a place of lesser men
Order in some food, turn on the news
Hear some fool say the world is gonna end
Best spend the night under your bed

When she was a girl she learned the words every boy couldn't say
It's not your currency that spends
In a place of lesser men

She walks from work at night
Blood on bait
But I don't worry
I don't worry
How come I don't worry?
I don't worry

She goes about her day
And keeps her cool until the weekend

When she was a girl she learned the words every boy couldn't say
There's nothing worthwhile to defend
In a place of lesser men

I sleep on nails at night
But I can hear her thinking
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
Baby, don't you worry
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
