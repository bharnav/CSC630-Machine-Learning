Of all the fake they say it takes to make it
Well, I don't know, man
No matter how high you roll
You'll always know you're just the store brand

Pushing against the waves
Keelhaul years of the same program
Some of the faces change
But not the game, and not the tune
'Cause you know how it goes

Baby, these feet were made for walking away
So why don't we use them?
Living in ditches is all well and good
When you get to choose 'em

I guess I could say it's strange
But most of me knows who I ain't fooling
So the excuses change
But not the game and not the tune
'Cause you know how it goes

Darling, don't you worry
It's not hard to find
Goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere

Well, down on the corner they still talk about you
But say they don't care
Baby you know I bruise
But being polite never got me nowhere

So it's to you I move
Like stealing light and breathing fresh air
Some of my faces change
But not my name and not my tune

'Cause you know how it goes
Yeah, you know how it goes
[Alright]
