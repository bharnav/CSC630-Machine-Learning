In Hell, we will all burn brightly
Bank dollars could turn our lead to gold

Blue collar man tread lightly
Blue collar baby gonna dance
Gonna do what you're told

Our other house is a mansion
Just living in this one until it gets stolen

When the river breaks
And these palaces, they flood
All of the lives it takes
You're the only one I love
Gonna give me some ground to shake
And zero orchestra

In Hell, we will all burn brightly
Having been there, man, I wish I didn't know

My other self is a mansion
Just living in this one until it goes cold

When the river breaks
And these palaces, they flood
All of the lives it takes
You're the only I love
Gonna give me some ground to shake
And zero orchestra

Zero orchestra [x4]
