I start the day
Picture a house
On fire
Inside
These guys, they try to put it out
I go down the stairs, rub my eyes and stand there
Wonder why I can't just kick them out
If I look crazy
Wonder what the fuck's with everyone else
Gotta, gotta wait for it
Wait for it
Gotta gotta

Do you walk out the door?

Baby you gotta do what you've gotta do

What if I can't see the stars, Mildred?

I end my day
Picture a house
On fire
On fire
On fire
On fire
