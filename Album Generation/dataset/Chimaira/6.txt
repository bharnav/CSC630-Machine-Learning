Can't sleep with all this frustration
Intoxication
I no longer have regret
So what if I caused hysteria?
It's not my dilemma
I'm only here to inflict pain

I will never forgive the ones
Who pushed me away
Like a tumor
Rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day
I will retaliate

A thorn in my side for years
The man who sheds no tears
I am here to expose you
All of the poison that you take
All people you violate
Your faith can't save you now

I will never forgive the ones
Who pushed me away
Like a tumor
Rage grows inside me
Reminding me everyday
I will retaliate
I am your family
With the power
To end everything
Everything you love
You love

You should be
You should be paranoid
I guess I no longer share this vision
I guess I have a new agenda
While you sink down into your hole
I am proud to watch you lose control

I will never forgive the ones
Who pushed me away
Like a tumor
Rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day

I will never forgive the ones
Who pushed me away
Like a tumor
Rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day

I will retaliate
I am your family
With the power
To end everything
Everything you want
Everything you feel
Everything you need
Everything you love
You love
You love
You love
