Eleven five
Ninety-four
Six thirty
Morning
Woke up panicked
Sweating
With a mouth full of vomit
No idea what could be wrong
Blew it off as this illness was common
Went back to sleep
Then the phone rings
Fell to the ground
As the news was haunting

Lazarus ended his life
Ungodly sacrifice
No reason why

Eleven eight
Ninety-four
Six thirty
Evening
The first time we're seeing Lazarus unconscious
Dressed in the clothes he loved
Laid out with all of his favorites
The tears of so many friends
Looked around and this view was haunting

Lazarus ended his life
Ungodly sacrifice
No reason why

Never had an explanation
Never had a chance to watch Lazarus rise
Never had a chance to thank him
Never had an explanation
Never had a chance to say goodbye

Lazarus ended his life
Ungodly sacrifice
No reason why

Never had a chance to say goodbye
