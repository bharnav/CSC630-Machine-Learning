Your true definition of me
Your idea that Im real
All of this is an illusion
Even though you can feel
My touch and my eyes
They lie and they victimize
My touch and my eyes
Pierce through, make you realise
I never wanted this world to be better
I always wanted this world to suffer
My flesh, my blood, all my animosity
Give me strength and define me
A bloodlust, it's all I trust
No more boundaries to cross
There is nothing uncommon
Indifferent to the pain I've caused
This confession means nothing
My touch and my eyes
They lie and they victimize
My touch and my eyes
Pierce through, make you realise
I never wanted this world to be better
I always wanted this world to suffer
My flesh, my blood, all my animosity
Give me strength and define me
A bloodlust, it's all I trust
This demon cannot be hushed
These cowards will all be crushed
No longer will I hide from them
My ways are set in stone
Nobody has ever known me
A life truly spent alone
Your true definition of me
Your idea that Im real
All of this is an illusion
Even though you can feel
My touch and my eyes
They lie and they victimize
My touch and my eyes
Pierce through, make you realise
I never wanted this world to be better
I always wanted this world to suffer
My flesh, my blood, all my animosity
Give me strength and define me
A bloodlust, it's all I trust
