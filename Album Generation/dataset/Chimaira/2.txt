A blank expression
Pale eyes wide, cocked back
The sheer stagnation
Shame to all who thought this an act
The best years of this life
Felt wasted protecting a secret
Insecurities fed on like a rat

Depression
True fears of dependency
Affliction
The scars on such a fragile little body
Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualise the horrors inside

Burning sensation
To live just one day
In pure elation
Blame the ones who took this away
Can't provide shelter from
The dangers festering outside
Can't provide safety from
Monsters trapped within the mind

Depression
True fears of dependency
Affliction
The scars on such a fragile little body
Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualise the horrors inside

Shake the hand of God
As the blade moves closer
The reflection is brighter than the sun (Than the sun)
The perception becomes weaker
The sun starts to fade away (Fade away)
The blank expression on the blade
Skin calloused yet easy to pierce
On the floor, blood mixed with tears

Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualise the horrors inside

Shake the hand of God
As the blade moves closer
The reflection is brighter than the sun (Is brighter than the sun)
The perception becomes weaker
Weaker
