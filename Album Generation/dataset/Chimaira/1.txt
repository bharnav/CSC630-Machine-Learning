What a shame
Breaking down
What is getting the best of you?
Take a breath
It's not complex
I'm going to put your mind at ease
Innocent people are not meant to suffer
We're making negative energy power

This will be our truth
Can you feel us?(x5)
We're stronger
We pray on the weak and conquer
No longer care for those
Who try to condemn and oppose
We'll save ourselves

You're afraid that I'm right
I know it eats you up inside
Well listen to me and you will see
You have to let those fears fly free
The only danger in this world is to be
Weak-minded with insecurities

This won't be our truth
Can you feel us?(x5)
We're stronger
We pray on the weak and conquer
No longer care for those
Who try to condemn and oppose
We'll save ourselves

Why do you fear everyone of us?
Why do you hate everyone of us?
You crush us(x3)
Why do you feel we are wasting our time?
Go away
End this now
You need to get down off this cloud
Start focusing
And listening
And feel it's the time to change things
When I'm alone
I don't feel hopeless at all
The day must come where we can stand tall

And this will be our truth
Can you feel us?(x5)
We're stronger
We prey on the weak and conquer
No longer care for those
Who try to condemn and oppose
We'll save ourselves
Save ourselves
Can you feel?
We'll save ourselves
