Greed has caused you to become a monster
Greed has caused you to become so cold
You said you loved him
Then you put him away
Til death do us part
Means nothing to you

Greed has caused you to betray your family
Greed had caused you to become so jaded
We've got some news for you
Every dollar you save
Will cushions your pillows in hell

You act like we're blind, deaf and dumb
Betrayal has now left us numb
We're sorry we can't escape from
This choice now we must all succumb

He's been thrown away
Left for dead
This is the only father we've had
Thrown away
Left for dead (x2)
How could you choose money instead?

Thrown away

How could you choose money instead?

We will never forget
We will never forget that you're the reason
This sadness has overwhelmed us
This grief is too much to bear
How can we look you in the eyes?
How can you ruin his life?
After all the years of joy he's brought us
There is no we anymore
There is no us anymore
You will have to live your last days in infamy

How could you do this?
How could you choose to live?
Thrown away
Left for dead
This is the only father we've had
Thrown away
Away
Left for dead (x2)
How could you choose money instead?
Left for dead (x2)
This is the only father we've had
Left for dead
