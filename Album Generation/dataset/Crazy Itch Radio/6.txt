Urgh, urgh, urgh, urgh
Look at him
Look at him
That geezer
That geezer
What geezer?
That geezer
You see him, he's so dusty
He's a M-I-N-G-E-R, minger, minger, minger, minger

Run 4 cover
Run 4 cover
Run 4 cover

When you see dem minging boys you better

Run 4 cover
Run 4 cover
Run 4 cover

When you see dem minging boys you better

Slut, slut, get outta my way
Get back to the back of the queue 'cos your butters and blow
Can't have my number so leave me alone
'Cos you're wasted, wasted, wasted
Need a face lift
Pushing them pushing them mans to the side
Pushing them pushing them mans to the side

(repeat chorus)
10 time say
La la la la la la la la la la
So you think you may have a chance one day
But no way no way
'Cos you're not my type and I don't like you, right
So go away just go away
Wow just seen me a guy
That's so perfect
Knows how to work it
He's got that charm
He took my arm
Whispered in my ear things
I long to hear
But urgh, urgh, me must be tipsy
How could me think that boy was sexy
Turns out turns out he was the minger
I was so shocked nearly turned into Thriller ah
In such a rage
Me had to tell that minger to move from me face
But he never listen
Still onna me case
Onna me case in de place in de place

(repeat chorus)
Follow, follow, follow, everywhere that me went
Though me try hide, boy pick up me scent
Run 4 cover a so me try
But this boy was too quick too too sly
Appearing shouting in my earring
Nearly lost my hearing
From his breath oh my oh my
It nearly choked me to death
His breath 'cos it was so stank
And I cannot deny it, had to tell him
It stank
I'm sorry Frank but we will never be
So can you please stop pestering ME!

(repeat chorus)
Galling galloing long about your business
'Cos we don't wanna know 'cos you're ugly like so
You're too galling galloing long
You're too galling galloing long
You're too galling galloing long about your business
'Cos we don't wanna know 'cos you're ugly like so
