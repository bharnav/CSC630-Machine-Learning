And when the lights go down
That's when it bites just a little, bites just a little more
And when the lights go down
That's when I die just a little, wanna get high just a little more
When the curtain falls
And there's no more applause
When the party's over
And there's no one to hold you
Look inside yourself and find
Your own light to ease your mind
