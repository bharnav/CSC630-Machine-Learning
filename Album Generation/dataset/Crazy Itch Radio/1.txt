So there we were at a table for two
With a glass of bubbly and my brand new shoes
He found a restaurant on the internet
This Mexican place, but they hadn't finished it yet
He took my hand and said
I love your eyes, your lips, your hands, your toes
He seemed intoxicated
As he started to chat a little X-Rated
I put my fingers to his lips and I said Hush Boy
(If you want me for your girlfriend?)
Just take it slowly boy
There's no need to rush it
Hush Boy
(If you want me for your girlfriend)
C'mon boy, don't blow your chance
We all need a little romance

So the food was good
I had a chicken fajita
But he finished my plate
And had four margaritas
As we gazed into each others eyes
His ex walked in
With her brand new guy
My man he tried to chomp on me
To kiss my arms, my legs, my hips, my lips
He knocked the drinks everywhere
As he started to make an apology
I covered his mouth with my hand and I said Hush, Boy!
(If you want me for your girlfriend)
Just take it slowly boy
There's no need to rush it
Hush Boy
(If you want me for your girlfriend)
C'mon boy, don't blow your chance
We all need a little romance
Hush Boy
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Just for the first date
La la la la
Hush Boy
You shouldn't worry cos I like you
We should have some fun

Seamlessly
Those butterfly kisses all over me
Love dancing eyelashes
Sometimes dreams come true

I know I talk too much most of the time
Especially when I'm on the beer or on the wine
You just make me want to push your buttons in
Too much girl when you blush
Hush Girl you M.O.V.E. me
L.O.V.E
That's all, that's coming from me
You're so sexy when I'm treading on dangerous ground
You bite your lip I just get hard when I see you frown
I want you to be m-my one and only

Hush Boy
If you want me for your girlfriend
Just take it slowly boy
There's no need to rush it
Hush Boy
If you want me for your girlfriend
(Man)
You know I don't wanna muck things up cos I'm into you much too much
Come on give me a bit of my time before you make up your mind
(Woman)
You shouldn't worry cos I like you
We should have some fun
