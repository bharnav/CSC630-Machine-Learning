You are in my mind
As I lay down
You are in my mind
As I lay me down
You are in my mind
As I lay down
You are in my mind
As I lay me down
Don't know if this world is where I want to be
Maybe we could find a planet just 4 U and me
You're my stairway to my heaven
U mean more than all those things that I could ever imagine
So take my pleasure take my pain
'Cos you're the moisture in my rain, yeah
If you believe yes it can happen
I belong to you ultimately, yeah
