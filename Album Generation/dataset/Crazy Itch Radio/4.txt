I want you
There's not a single thing about you that I'd change
I need you
You keep on swimming round and round inside my brain
You're so much brighter
Than all the shops and city streets
You're a fighter
And that sure seems good to me
Like a fool
I still believe in you and me, boy

Hey U, Hey U
Don't waste your tears on me
That thing called love
It always gets you in the end

I'm sorry
I know I messed up quite a bit along the way
We learnt things hard
And it seems that we forgot just how to play
But I wanna take you from all this grime and all this grief
Want to help you to be all that you can be
Que sera
You're desirable to me, boy

Hey U, Hey U
Don't waste your tears on me
That thing called love
It always gets you in the end

We fall and we flounder
Need something to ground you
Took so long to find you
But then when it clicked you just flew
Will I ever sing our song again?

Hey U, Hey U
Don't go and break your heart
I told you from the start
I'll always be a travelin' man
That thing called love
It always gets you in the end
(repeat)
