I don't know what's wrong with you
Comin' all over, don't want to do
Find someone else to while away hours
Some other mug to give, give flowers
I thought I was in love with you
Thought together we'd find some truth
Never seemed at all logical
But maybe we were living in
Smoke Bubbles

(Chorus)
I, I wanna give you something more than you can ever give to me
I, I'm sorry but this thing just seems like kisstory to me

(Musical Interlude)

You were all cool with the TV on
Drinking with your friends and smoking bongs
Never really heard when you snapped away, and quipped
It blurred over, it was all a quick fix
Not like I'm not aching too
But now I'm clear what I got to do
I know at times it was magical
But maybe we were living in
Smoke Bubbles

(Repeat Chorus)
(Musical Interlude)

(Repeat Chorus)
