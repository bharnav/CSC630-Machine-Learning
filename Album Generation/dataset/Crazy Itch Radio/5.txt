City's got the best of me, collar's so tight seems there's no air to breathe
Mamma gave me dancing legs, oh Mamma my, Mamma don't cry
I'm sure I got short changed, time I got my aim right, no cocaine
Check out the bone zone, I ain't staying
I know you feel the same you're not alone so I'll be

Straight with you on the train
They'll never believe it now we're on our way
I ain't going back again
I need it like a hole in my vein, a hole in my vein
Straight with you on the train
They'll never believe it now we're on our way
I ain't going back again
I need it like a hole in my vein, a hole in my vein
(I want you, I want you)

God he been testing me, heat beating down, I just need a cool breeze
Papa gave me heart and soul, oh Papa I, Papa I tried
Here no-one gives a damn, time I got my swerve on, I'm a reborn man
I don't belong here, I ain't staying
I know you feel the same you're not alone, so I'll be

Straight with you on the train
They'll never believe it now we're on our way
I ain't going back again
I need it like a hole in my vein, a hole in my vein
Straight with you on the train
They'll never believe it now we're on our way
I ain't going back again
I need it like a hole in my vein, a hole in my vein
(I want you, I want you)

I don't belong here got nothing to prove
I'm on the train now I'm making my move
I don't belong here got nothing to prove, I'm on the train now
There goes the phone again, there goes the phone again
There goes the phone again (do do do do do do do)
Get me on the train, baby won't you get me on the train
Get me on the train, I gotta get out gotta get out, gotta get out of here
I'm on the train now, I'm on the train now (what's the point?)
Money pay the bills, stick around, die young
