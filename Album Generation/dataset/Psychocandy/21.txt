[Verse 1]
Tryna win your interest back
But you ain't having none of that
You're just like a ship in a bottle
Kiss today but fuck tomorrow
I don't know, I guess that we're all through

[Verse 2]
Fucked-up girls like drugged-up guys
That won't keep him warm at night
It's just like a grape in a bottle
It's wine today but piss tomorrow
I don't know, I guess that we're all through

[Chorus]
I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation

Amputation
Amputation

[Outro]
Amputation
Amputation
Amputation
Amputation
