Grey skies clouding up the things we used to see with wide eyes
Maybe everything was meant to be this way
Will it ever change
Or are we stuck here on our own?

It's all gone grey
It's all gone grey

I found telling you the truth the hardest thing to get out
I know it wasn't you that made me feel this way
Will it ever change
Or are we stuck here on our own?

Given one more try
I don't know if I would stay
I feel so much better now
And baby, begging me
Will leave you so empty inside
So you shouldn't even try

I know every last regret inside of me is my own
The way I hold them close has made me be this way
And I will never change
I know I'm stuck here on my own
My own

Given one more try
I don't know if I would stay
I feel so much better now
Where did we go wrong?
I know you still hold on to me
But it's time that you let go
I gave you things I had
That I cannot get back again
But I'm better off alone

It's all gone grey
It's all gone grey
It's all gone grey
It's all gone grey
Grey skies clouding up the things we used to see with wide eyes
Maybe everything was meant to be...
