You and me
A little different though we tried to stay the same
It never leaves
And when it changes, it is still a waiting game

I wait for a lonely breath
I wait to surface from this depth
Wait for the light to come
And take away these images I kept
In my head

[Chorus]
More than ever
I need to feel you
More than ever
I see the real you


You are me
A worst disaster would be waking up alone
Now we're free
We're drifting out like all the ones we didn't know

I wait for a silence here
I wait for things to disappear
Wait for the ground to stop moving underneath my only fear
If I lose you, I don't know

[Chorus]
More than ever
I need to feel you
It's all around
More than ever
I see the real you
And it surrounds

[Bridge] x2
Everything, everything we have had
Out of sight, out of mind, given that
What I see when I dream hurts like hell and back

[Chorus] x2
