Man once sang to me
Look at you saving the world on your own
And I wonder how things gonna be
â€˜Cause the time here, it passes so slow

In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live

Find somebody to learn
Boy you gotta love someone more than yourself
And I can feel the fire of the city lights burn
And it's hard to find angels in hell

[Chorus]
Flying along, and I
Feel like I don't belong, and I
Can't tell right from the wrong, and why
Have I been here so long

In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live

Questions I can't seem to find
To the answers I already have
And you can't see the sky here at night
So I guess I can't make my way back

[Chorus]

What if I wanted you here right now?
Would you fall in the fire burn me down?
If I wanted you here right now
Would you fall in the fire burn me down?
If I wanted you here right now

In a city of devils we live
In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live
In a city of

[Chorus]

I don't belong
Don't belong
I've been here too long
Too long
