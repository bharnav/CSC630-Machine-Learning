Here it is
One more glass for these broken hands
Goes down for you
Iâ€™ve fallen in
I sink then swallow
I never meant to see this through

[Chorus]
I'm taking them all
Taking them all back for good
To a place where I know that I'm safe
Then I can fall
Then I could fall where I should
In this bottle with all my mistakes

All the days
Since I've landed
I lost the way
To find my truth
You float away
And leave me stranded
What's left to say
I'll hurt for you

[Chorus]

[Bridge] x2
I could sleep
But when I wake here, you'd still be gone
And you're my air
I could breathe if you would stay here another song
So I could stare

[Chorus] x2
