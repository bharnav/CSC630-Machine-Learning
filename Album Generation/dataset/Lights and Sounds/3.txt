[Verse 1]
He likes vampires and hit list radio
But turns it off when he hears this one song he knows
And you breathe the windows down
You're driving I-4 as you make your way back home
You ride in silence because he will not let go
And you breathe the windows down
It's a new place that you have found

[Chorus]
I've been up late writing books
All about heroes and crooks
One of ‘em saves you from this
The other one steals you and then
Sure things fall
And all sure things fall

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to get so high?
It didn't work at first, we tried it two more times
And we could breathe the windows down
I was thinking of the temperature outside
Cool like the water that was running from our eyes
And we could breathe the windows down
It's a new place that we had found

[Chorus]
I've been up late writing books
All about heroes and crooks
One of ‘em saves you from this
The other one steals you and then
Sure things fall
And all sure things fall

[Bridge]
He can take you all the way to church this time
But don't forget, you summed it up in fifteen lines

[Chorus]
I've been up late writing books
All about heroes and crooks
One of ‘em saves you from this
The other one steals you

[Outro]
Of all of the places I’ve looked
And all of the pictures I took
One of ‘em’s here with me now
I'm finally finding out how
Sure things fall
All sure things fall
