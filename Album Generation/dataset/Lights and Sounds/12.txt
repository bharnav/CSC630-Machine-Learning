[Verse 1: Ryan Key]
I could tell you the wildest of tales
My friend the giant and traveling sails
Tell you all the times that I failed
The years all behind me, the stories exhaled

[Shortened Chorus: Ryan Key]
And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go

[Verse 2: Ryan Key]
I could tell you of a man not so tall
Who said life's a circus, and so we are small
Tell you of a girl that I saw
I froze in the moment and she changed it all

[Chorus: Ryan Key and Natalie Maines]
And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow, flow

[Bridge: Ryan Key, Natalie Maines and both]
Son, I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 3: Ryan Key and Natalie Maines]
And you keep the air in my lungs
Floating along as a melody comes
And my heart beats like timpani drums
Keeping the time while a symphony strums

[Chorus: Ryan Key, Natalie Maines and both]
And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow
Flow, flow
Let it flow (Let it flow)
Let it flow (Let it flow)

[Outro: Ryan Key and Natalie Maines]
Son, I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me
Son, I leave you now but you have so much more to do
And every story I have told is part of you
