Hello you, how was the rest?
You made it through but nevertheless
I got you out on a wire
You be love and I'll be a liar
Tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there
Nobody’s there

[Chorus]
Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you’ve been

Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone
Even when you know what they've done
They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart
So tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there

[Chorus]

[Bridge] x3
I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way and you know how
I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way and you know how
I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way

[Chorus]

You’ve earned everything you’ve found
And painted faces frown
I'll say I knew you when
