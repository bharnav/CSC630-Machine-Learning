I work all night
For one more day that I can say I'm all alone
Alone
I just need time
And I will say what I believe and I'll come home
Home
And all I know

[Chorus]
I never thought I would wake up in bed
Watching the world coming down on my head
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never have said
This is the world coming down on your head

As life flies by
I'm not sure how I'm gonna do this all again
Again
So line by line
I write this down and I'm just trying to find the end
The end
And all I know

[Chorus]

You gave it to me
I remember it read
Youâ€™ve got the world coming down on your head
There's nothing to fight for, it's already dead
And this is the world coming down on my head

When will it all end?
When will it all end?
One of you moves, the others follow you
When will it all end?
One of you moves, the others follow you

[Chorus]

I'm not gonna swallow the lie that I'm fed
Cuz I want the world coming down on my head
I'm just gonna find out you're already dead
And I was the world coming down on your head
