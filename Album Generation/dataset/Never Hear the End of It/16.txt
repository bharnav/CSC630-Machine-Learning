Do you remember
When October disappeared in a flash
And by December
Reluctantly reliving the past
Well I had to go
You see the signs said so
A well known title comes to mind
Did you ever have to make up your mind

Can't you figure it out, yeah
Figure it out, yeah

So orchestrated
Divinely put together far in advance
You're underrated
Appearance at the Halloween dance
So we leave at last
Before the moment passed
Staying up till half past two
Writing this song for you

Can't you figure it out, yeah
Figure it out, yeah

Figure it out, yeah
Figure it out

An invitation like a spell's been cast
Now I'm under and I'm tied to the mast
Where I'll be
Adrift at half past three
Dreaming up a melody

Can't you figure it out, yeah
Figure it out, yeah
Figure it out, yeah
[So orchestrated]
Figured it out, yeah
[You're underrated]
Figure it out, yeah
[So orchestrated]
Figure it out, yeah
[You're underrated]
Figure it out
