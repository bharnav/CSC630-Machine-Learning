Falling from the sky
You’re free finally
You took me by surprise
Crashing down in front of me
But it’s all right

You open up your eyes
To show how they see
You open up your heart
To show how it beats
You open up your hands
To show how they can bleed

It’s all right, it’s okay
Everything will work out fine today
Because

I understand

Spinning me around
I feel just how light
Jumping up and down
I feel just how high
Turning up the sound
Loud

It’s okay, it’s all right
Everything will work out fine tonight
Because

I understand
I understand
You

I understand
I understand you
I understand
I understand you

Time to waste I've burned through all I need
Spend some time hanging around with me
We don’t even have to feel the same way
‘Cause everything will work out fine today

I understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
