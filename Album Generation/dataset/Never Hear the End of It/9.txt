I got the feeling that there's something wrong
But I can't put my finger on it
This is a sense it won't last too long
And now I can't feel my fingers
Did you have to anyway
Or could you save it for another day
If I was you I'd want that feeling back for good

I got the feeling that there's something wrong
I got the feeling that there's something wrong
