(Is it only when you're lonely)

So many times knowing I'm wasting time
Too many people behind me in line

They're gonna try
All the things in their lives that they'd never try
And if they succeed
Will they still have a spot right between their eyes

This thing about imagination
Is that it takes most people every single day
To know they have one
This thing about identification
Is that it fools most people just give their lives away

So many times I knew I wasted time
Too many people behind me in line
Breaking the banks and being of two minds
About all these people behind me in line

They're gonna try
All the things in their lives that shouldn't try
But I'm gonna learn
To believe in my life until the day that I die

The thing about imagination
Is that it takes most people every single day
To know they even have one
And this thing about identification
It just fools some people just give their lives away
When they've only got one
Or maybe two
