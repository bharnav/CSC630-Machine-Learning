I can't sleep
Even though I want to
My nerves are shot
Right between plenty of highs

I can't sleep
I'm always looking for you
I'm digging in deep
Way beyond the matter of
What we keep
And how we gotta let it all go

I can't sleep
Even if I try to
See all the sheep
Demanding my attention
I can't sleep
I think I'm gonna let it all go
