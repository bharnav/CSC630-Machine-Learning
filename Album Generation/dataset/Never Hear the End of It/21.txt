Hello
Can I have a show
Of hands who have taken something before
If so
Is this devil you know
Ever able to help you anymore

Maybe I can make it happen
I can help you work and love
Maybe I can make it happen

I'm a pro
But business is slow
So I'll be peddling my opinions again
Although
I don't want to take no
For an answer
I'm known to now and then

Well maybe I can make it happen
I can help you work and love
Maybe I can make it happen
Live the life you're dreaming of

Who wants to live a life that's full of smoke and mirrors
(Oh the humanity)
The choking and the vanity
We know this but promises of love and careers
(Keep everyone intimidated)
But not you
My love
You
Can see the truth

Friends are foes
Every one of you knows
What it's like to surrender to me
Completely
But the beautiful bow
I'll be using will wrap it up so
Neatly

Well maybe I can make it happen
I can help you work and love
Maybe I can make it happen
Maybe I can help
I can help you work and love
Live the life you're dreaming of
