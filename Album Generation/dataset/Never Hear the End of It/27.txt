It's not the end of the world
But into a ball you are curled
Winter will pass when it does
You can go ‘cause it isn't what it was
Say the snow made us do it just because

While we weighed the pros and the cons
The sun had unfrozen my palms
Winter had come to an end
I don't know if you will call me your friend
Say it's so or I'm liable to pretend

Now you've made your mark on the world
At times into a ball I have curled
So I had to move on
But I'll always be fond of you

Winter was hard on us all
Bundle up ‘cause it already feels like fall
I'm all right but I don't mind when you call
We can talk about our brief time in the sun
