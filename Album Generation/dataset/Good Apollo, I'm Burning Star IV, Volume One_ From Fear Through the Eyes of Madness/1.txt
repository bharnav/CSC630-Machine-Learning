[Verse 1]
If beauty sits the child's kiss of laughter I amend
Can you catch her if she runs?
With this I would share with you
All of this count to no end

[Verse 2]
Behind your sealed eyes
You miss all that I've done for you
Will you catch me when I run?
If timing plays evident
What will you say when you're late?

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay with me and fall asleep
Pray to God for no bad dreams
Stay with me and fall asleep
Pray to God for no bad dreams

[Chorus]
Here, I'm still waiting here, my dear
For one kiss from you
So here, I'm still waiting here, my dear
To kill all of you
To kill all of you
