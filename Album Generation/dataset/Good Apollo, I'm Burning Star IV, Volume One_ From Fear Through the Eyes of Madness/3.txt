[Verse 1]
I can feel it in the way your blood and heart beats
(My body's cold and it thinks that I'm already gone)
Or is it in the way your body moves?
(I'd like to tell you, but I think that you already know)
The words I drag out from your mouth speak
(So listen up world, listen up world)
In her vision, I have given company
(They see no evil in leading their bodies from home)

[Chorus]
Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are
(Ten Speed, if I must... then I must!)

Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are

[Verse 2]
If written wrote me even chance and the choice to save you
I wouldn't answer if it even had to ask
In her figure, I've instilled a taste of my own
(So listen up world, listen up world)
To make it easier to take what life I'm owed
(As the curse has returned from the hell of your
Heart and your soul)

[Chorus]
Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are
(Ten Speed, if I must... then I must!)

Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are

[Bridge]
Nobody knows but you
Nobody knows but you
'Cause I don't want to ride, tonight
No, I don't want to go
I don't want to ride, tonight
Or maybe I don't want to go

[Spoken:]
"But are you going to kill her off?"
"It's not your decision. I love the character, she stays."
"Yeah, well the only thing love's done is put you in this position; I say kill her off!"
"Yeah, but you say a lot of things... and how does that work? You're a bicycle"

[Chorus]
Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are
(Ten Speed, if I must... then I must!)

Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all
(No, but I don't buy it)
Like anything you do, as anyone you are

[Outro]
'Cause I'm...
Ten Speed in God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed of God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed in God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed of God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed in God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed of God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed in God's Blood and Burial
Ten Speed of God's Blood!
