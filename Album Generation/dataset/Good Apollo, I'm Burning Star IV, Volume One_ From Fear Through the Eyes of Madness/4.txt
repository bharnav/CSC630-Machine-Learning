[Verse 1]
Home, a silence between glares
That stutters words misleading here
Give me all you got
With one shot sent to lend me

No, here across the grass
Between the glass
I know you're not the one
I left to wait here, helping

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I left in a sudden rush and never said why
You couldn't know that I had no goodbyes

[Chorus]
But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo
The way that you would've been if
I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo
How important I could've been to you

[Verse 2]
Press the steps I take to cross your door frame if
You decide to answer when my fist swings hello

[Pre-Chorus]
I left in a sudden rush and never said why
You couldn't know that I had no goodbyes

[Chorus]
But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo
The way that you would've been if
I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo
How important I could've been to you

[Bridge]
Casting quarters into wells that hold our dreams
You won't believe me if I told you so
Casting quarters into wells that hold our dreams
You won't believe me, I wouldn't if you told me so

[Chorus]
But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo
The way that you would've been if
I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo
How important I could've been to you
