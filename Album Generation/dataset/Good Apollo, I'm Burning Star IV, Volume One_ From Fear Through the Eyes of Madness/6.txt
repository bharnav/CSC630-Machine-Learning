[Verse 1]
If hello could only drop its 'O'
And it stayed in the front door's way
Of your home, would you live there still?
Could that make you everything I hate?
Wait...

[Interlude]
Do you remember why you did it? (No, I don't)
Do you remember why she left?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?

[Verse 2]
Is there price to burn this paradise?
Where you left all parts that hurt to mend
If I don't stay awake, will she come here again
For my wish of only one last kiss?

[Interlude]
Do you remember why you did it? (No, I don't)
Do you remember why she left?
(Unless you did what you thought would be friend)
Do you remember why you did it?
Do you remember why she left?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good

Whoa, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good

Oh, I hope you die, right now
Will you drink my chemical?
Oh, and if you cry out loud
It'll only make me feel too good

[Chorus]
(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good

(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good

(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
It'll only make me feel too good

(Once upon your, once upon your)
I hope you die, right now
(Once upon your dead body)
I hope you die, right now
