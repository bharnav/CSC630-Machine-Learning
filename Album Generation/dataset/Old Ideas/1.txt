[Verse 1]
Tell me again
When I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst

Tell me again
We're alone and I'm, I'm listening
I'm listening so hard that it hurts

[Chorus]
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you want me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Verse 2]
Tell me again
When the victims are singing
And the Laws of Remorse are restored

Tell me again
That you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the lord

[Chorus]
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Verse 3]
Tell me again
When the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin

Try me again
When the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in

[Chorus]
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you need me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Pro Tools solo]

[Verse 4]
Tell me again
When the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb

Tell me again
When the rest of the culture
Has passed thru' the Eye of the Camp

[Chorus]
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Coda]
