[Verse 1]
Had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Begging my crazy to quit

[Bridge 1]
Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

[Verse 2]
Had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all

[Bridge 2]
I'm tired of choosing desire
I've been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

[Bridge 1]
Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone
