[Instrument Break]

[Verse 1]
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 2]
There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 3]
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

[Verse 4]
And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique
