Are you real?
Are you real or just a dream?
It's been so long I don't know

I can feel
I can feel you with me now
Even though you're far away

And some are special
Come back, racing through your mind
You are special;
Your light, your heat will never die

I was lost
I was lost and I found you
I will know no further love

People move
Come in close, and fall away
Your love, you refuse to fade

And some are special
Come back racing through your mind
You are special;
Your light, your heat will never die

So regretful
How could I ever be so blind?
You are special
I thought I'd never lose my mind

I was pulling far away;
You were begging me to stay
And I thought I was losing you
Funny how the opposite was true

Real enough, whole enough
I'd settle for a lie

Some are special
Come back racing through your mind
You are special;
Your light your heat, will never die

So regretful
How could I ever be so blind?
You are special
I thought I'd never lose my mind
