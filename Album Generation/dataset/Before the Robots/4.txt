North light comes uninvited
Through the window to where you lie
Disjointed, dust and silence
Quite at a loss

CHORUS:
I feel strange
I feel changed
I feel strange.....overcome...overcome by you

I fell in too deep
But i learned to swim
In an undertow
Since i'm giving in

I feel strange
I feel changed
I feel strange...overcome...overcome

I'm a little bit wiser, I'm a little bit sadder
I'm a little bit less, you might have guessed
But if you could be staying
Tell me now, darlin', I think I'm fading
I swear I'll never trade your love for a lie

(CHORUS)
(overcome..overcome...
Sometimes it helps me to give it up
In some ways you're never gonna get it
Some nights i feel i'm gonna give it
Sunlight...every night
Overcome...overcome)

...hold still, come on and save me
...hold still, come on and let me
...hold still come on again...
...hold still, come on and let me
...hold still, come on and let me
