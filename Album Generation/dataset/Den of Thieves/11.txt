I'm a fighter and I find it hard to let things die
But I have you and you believe that things work out in time
If I could for you I would turn water into wine
I ask you what you want and you say
"The Whole Blue Sky"

Out of the past into the dark
Stumblin' around Montebello Park
Looking for peace we'll find it somehow
They didn't owe us then
They don't owe us now
I will always love you this way
I will remember these days

Harder times we wonder if it's worth our while to try
Aimless generation wakes to watch the world pass by
Those who get ahead in life are those who live a lie
Feeling life is all fucked up you
Cry, cry, cry

Out of the past into the dark
Stumblin' around Montebello Park
Looking for pease we'll find it somehow
They didn't owe us then
They don't own us now

It's time I set a vigil to the past and say goodbye
It's time these little visions gonna haunt me 'till I die

I will always love you this way
I will remember these days
I will always love you this way
I will remember these days

I set a vigil to the past and say goodbye
These little visions gonna haunt me 'till I die

I will always love you this way
I will remember these days
I will always love you this way
I will remember these days
I will always love you this way
I will remember these days
I will always love you this way
