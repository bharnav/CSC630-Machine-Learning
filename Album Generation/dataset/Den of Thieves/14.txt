Hello my name is Ishmael
Forget the one about the whale
I'll tell you of a broken-hearted sailor

Maggie took my loyalty
I treated her like royalty
What starts out with such promise ends in failure

Oh my love I can't stand to be alone
But I been drinkin' too much
I better go home
And I think here I'm better of alone
But I been thinking too much
I better go home

All hail the Queen of cruelty
She has duty been anointed
These final word "her majesty" had to say
"He who expects nothing never will be disappointed"
Nothing's what she left me so I guess i'm OK

Oh my love I can't stand to be alone
But I been drinkin' too much
I better go home
And I think here we all stand alone
But I been thinking too much
I better go home

Lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie

A promise made to a tab unpaid
It's home I wade to my bed unmade
A fool to think that I could ever change her
A king upon my barstool throne
I vow to never drink alone
I only drink with friends or total strangers

We're all broken hearted here
We're all broken hearted here
We're all broken hearted here
We're all broken

Oh my love I can't stand to be alone
But I been drinkin' too much
I better go home
And I think here we all stand alone
But I been thinking too much
I better go home
I better go home
I better go home
I better go home
I better go home
I better go home
