For the traveling kind it's nice to have some time
To stay a while for now
I been runnin' to find a little piece of mind
To rise above the clouds
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
To be with me

For the traveling kind it's hard to find a love
To come along and ride
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
To be with me

I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
To be with me

My mind been learnin' for ya
My heart's been burnin' for ya
My soul's been yearning for ya
I'm nothing and I should be everything

For the travellin' kind tryin' to buy some time
Before we say goodbye

I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
To be with me

I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
I don't want to wait til you know how
To be with me
