Tomorrow's always far away
When you are stuck in yesterday
And time keeps you locked up and lost inside
It doesn't matter for today
Makes you old before your day, it's always rainin'
Don't stay in, no escapin' your destiny

My heart is not the type to sway
It's good for any other day
So if you say that you will stay, and you'll be mine
Oh, you'll make everything OK
I pushed the whole world far away, it's always rainin'
Don't stay in, no escapin' your destiny

I'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine
I'm makin' sunshine
I'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine
I'm makin' sunshine

There was a time I was afraid
I had my strength to steer at bay
But now's the time to stand away
And take what's mine
The lesson's done, my dues are paid

I'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine
I'm makin' sunshine
I'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine
I'm makin' sunshine
I'm right on time, I'm makin' sunshine
I'm makin' sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
