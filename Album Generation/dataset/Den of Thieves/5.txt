Better stop pretending
That this is never ending
It seems the dream is over
And not worthy of mending

Living at a standstill
Pushing rocks uphill
A mountain full of feathers
With no natural skill

Oh my girl please don't give in
Don't listen to your stupid friends
I hear them going off again
So she's leaving

Planting dead flowers
In a cold October
Cemetary blackbird
Flying all over
Where's this going to take me
A mountain full of misery
Careless Abandon
All alone and empty

I found love to take me home
But she don't want to live alone
I'm always out on the road
So she's leaving

Oh my girl please don't give in
Don't listen to your stupid friends
I hear them going off again
So she's leaving

Comfort me from all the wrong
Could I whisper you the song
Dry your eyes the whole night long
Take your heart before it's gone

I found love to take me home
But she don't want to live alone
I'm always out on the road
So she's leaving

Oh my girl please don't give in
Don't listen to your stupid friends
I hear them going off again
So she's leaving
So she's leaving
So she's leaving
So she's leaving
