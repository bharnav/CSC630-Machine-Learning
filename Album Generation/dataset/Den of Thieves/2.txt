You cry, you cry

I am leaving, good bye love
I am waiting for no one
Trust my feeling on the ride
Nothing's saving us this time
My heart's telling me to run

I got my mind made up and i'm movin on
I got my mind made up and i'm movin on
I got my heart reset and my head back on
I got my mind made up and i'm movin on

You cry, you cry
Way too much for me

Lost child wanted all you see
You're in love with not losing me
Fighting for our love ain't right
If all we ever do is fight
Nothing should be this hard

I got my mind made up and i'm movin on
I got my mind made up and i'm movin on
I got my heart reset and my head back on
I got my mind made up and i'm movin on

You cry, you cry (all alone yeah)
You cry, you cry
You cry, you cry
You cry, you cry
Way too much for me
Way too much for me
Way too much for me
Oh yeah

Listen up
The time's come for me to say
I'm givin up
I never loved you anyway
Gotta fly
Never gettin in my way
This is my
Independance day

You cry, you cry
You cry, you cry
You cry, you cry
You cry, you cry
Way too much for me
You cry way too much for me
You cry way too much for me
Bye bye, yeah
I'm gone
You cry way too much for me
