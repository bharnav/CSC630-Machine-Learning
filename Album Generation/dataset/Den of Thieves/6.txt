A moment in time, despair and fear, nothing's ahead, you are right here
Near is the pain, tragedy changing you dear?
Catastrophe, everything's gone, nothing today, was agreed upon
You had no choice, as you watched the curtains be drawn

Hands in the air
Prayers and hymns
Everyone's here
It's time to begin
All that was there, and what might have been
Is no longer here, it's time to begin

Yearning

The hour is late, it's almost dawn, without an end, we can't go on
As dark as it seems, soon you will see the days sun
Perchance to dream, there is the rub
Permanant sleep, nice dreams will come
Try to have faith to carry you on as you run

Hands in the air
Prayers and hymns
Everyone's here
It's time to begin
All that was there, and what might have been
Is no longer here, it's time to begin

Yearning
Yearning
Yearning, and hurting
Learning

Waiting for will it take you, taking all your time
Waiting for will it take you, taking all your time

Yearning

Hands in the air
Prayers and hymns
Everyone's here
It's time to begin
All that was there, and what might have been
Is no longer here, its time to begin

Yearning
Yearning
Yearning
Yearning...
