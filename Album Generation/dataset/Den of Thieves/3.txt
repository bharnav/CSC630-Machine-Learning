Traveling girl run away
Wanderlust to kill the pain
You thought my love would save your soul
You feel apart you left me cold

What was sweet is now a sour taste
What was love now is laid to waste

Sweetness
When are you coming back
When are you coming back to me

Your wine soaked cries and cocaine lies
The broken dreams in your bloodshot eyes
I pine for you
I need you so
I fall apart when you go

Distilled in the driving rain
When you gonna come back again

Sweetness
When are you coming back
When are you coming back
Sweetness
When are you coming back
When are you coming back to me

Without the will or know-how
Where will you go now

Sweetness
When are you coming back
When are you coming back
Sweetness
When are you coming back
When are you coming back
When are you coming back to me
To me
