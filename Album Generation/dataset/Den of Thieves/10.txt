Your stubborn skin
Is wearing thin
You beared your soul
I waltzed right in
You gave me everything
And I just made you feel so very

Naked
And you don't remember
How you let yourself
Become so unraveled

You spilled your guts
On my best shoes
I keep it in
You let it loose
It's only love that makes you
Feel like getting so completely

Naked
And you don't remember
How you let yourself
Become so unraveled
You're naked
Pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your
Second skin to settle in

My hardened heart
Can't hide me now
It loves as much
As I allow
And in the end
The eyeball on me
Will just drag me down
And I'll be

Naked
Nothing, but a heartache
And I know
There's nothing that can hide me now
I'm naked
Nothing, but a heartache
Going out exactly the way you came in
