If you break
That's all you can do
My mistake
Was I thought more of you
If you find yourself beside me
Looking for some faith

I can't say
That our world is safe
When i'm on my way
To another lonely place

Lasting heartache
Is now in view
A cold dark shade
That once was you
If you find yourself beside me
Looking for some faith

I can't say
That our world is safe
When i'm on my way
To another lonely place
I can't say
That our world is safe
When i'm on my way
Though i'm sad to leave these
Pale eyes on a sullen face
Frail ties and time misplaced
Time Misplaced

So if you break
That's all you can do
My mistake
Was I thought more of you
But colours bleed through
Colours bleed through
And you who I thought that I knew
Colours bleed through

I can't say
That our world is safe
When i'm on my way
To another lonely place
I can't say
That our world is safe
When i'm on my way
With the will to leave this place

Colours bleed through
Colours bleed through
