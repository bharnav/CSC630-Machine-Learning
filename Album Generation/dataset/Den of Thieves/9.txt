You're burning out, you're burning out
It's never the same again
They show you all, they show you all
The secrets to keeping thin

How Ana & Mia stay beautiful all day

The pressure's on, girl you're gone
You learning how to pretend
No one knows the sickness grows
Following deadly trends

How Ana & Mia stay beautiful all day
Mother you should watch your girl tonight
She's gone
Mother you should watch your girl tonight

It sucks you in so it begins
Turning your insides out
Skin and bones, you're all alone
It's killing you slowly now

How Ana & Mia stay beautiful all day
Mother you should watch your girl tonight

She's gone
Mother you should watch your girl tonight
Mother you should watch your girl
She's beautiful and it's misleading
Saw her on the sidewalk bleeding
Sickened but the sight of eating
This pressure on perfection's got to end

You're burning out, you're burning down
You're never the same again
They showed you all, they showed you all
The secrets to keeping thin

Mother you should watch your girl tonight
She's gone
Mother you should watch your girl tonight
She's gone
Mother you should watch your girl
Mother you should watch her world
Mother you should watch your girl tonight
She's gone
