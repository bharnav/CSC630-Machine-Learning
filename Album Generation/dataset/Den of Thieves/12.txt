Out on the rails
Out on the rails keep riding further
Time never fails
Time never fails please help me forget her
Teeth biting nails
Teeth biting nails i can't keep it together
Telling the tale
Telling the tale she's gone forever
So go train
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
Words on the wall
Words on the wall serve to remind me
You had it all, I had it all all that is history
It's what you called
It's what you called promise to pity
Freedom to fall
Freedom to fall mending my misery
So go train
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
Go train
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
Unjustified love, you don't know me, you don't know me
Unjustified love, you don't know me, you don't know me
Out on the rails
Out on the rails I can't get any further
Time never fails
Time never fails
So go train
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
Oh yeah
So go train
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
I got myself to blame
So go train
