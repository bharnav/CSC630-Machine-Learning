No one makes it out alive
But I know where the killer hides tonight
No one makes it out alive
But I know where the killer hides

I saw this night and the next
Erupt in flames for years ago
They scurry like roaches
Stomped out by fire
I warned these insects not to move
But no one ever listens

Don't believe this girl
She preaches mayhem
She's the devils bitch and a liar
I want to see the look in her eyes
When her body parts ways with life

No one listens to the damned
No one listens to the damned
At six miles up you will explode, I can see it all
No one listens to the damned
At sea level you will be drowned, I have seen it all
No one listens to the damned
Beneath the surface, the monster will have you
No one listens to the damned
But god damned, no one will believe me

No one listens to the damned
