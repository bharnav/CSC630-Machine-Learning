How he knows every wretch's death
And none of them are crystal believers
They all shiver under fate's icy breath
But turn their face to the seeming deceiver
Alarm!!
To all the foul aberrations
(parasites...)
Who feed off the disgust of the masses
All joined together to make a scrap of a living
The eye sees all. The eye says so
Like the foul, gasping breath of those who are paying
He sees all. He says so
Behold!!
Their defective bodies in wonder
The creeps and whores, the wicked and deformed
Amazement paints the faces in the rickety bleachers
They scream for more of the modern horror:
Such monsters steal the eyes of the healthy
And bind their souls away in the limelight
(only one knows their awful end)
A justified torturous completion
Of all their wrong doings and black sins
Forcasted in crystal visions
Slouched over the clear Seeing Eye
He marks down each death and he quivers...
How he knows every wretch's death
And none of them crystal believers
