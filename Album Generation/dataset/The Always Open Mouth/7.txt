Have you seen me lately?
I am the dog sized bird on the tracks
I have an unhealthy handful of options
And a couple of trains on my back

I'm picking at remains of other lives
And watching colors and tragic looking passerbys

I am the dog sized bird
Picking at bones
Losing my nerve
Constantly calculating

There's time between trains, I know
There's time between trains, I know
And a right moment
To find a new set of tracks

There's time between trains
I know exactly how long

But I'm testing my conviction
And I may be primed for picking at any time
