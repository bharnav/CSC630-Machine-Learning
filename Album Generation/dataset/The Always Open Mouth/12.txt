OH MY GOD
What have we learned?
OH MY GOD
We're doomed from the start

It's time to admit we're wrong and move on
Kick our habits, self improvement
Is anyone getting nervous?

We should all be afraid to die

I don't care as long as we, as long as we get there
Get there

Fought, you fought and you got what you want out of me
Caught, don't get caught, you'll be fucked if you know what I mean

Are you scared you can't tell me what your life's about?
Thought provoking, it's all we need
It's all we need

THE FEAR OF GOD IN US
IN ALL OF US
