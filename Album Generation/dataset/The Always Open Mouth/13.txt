Please forgive us children, yes we know exactly what we do
We've been shitting where we sleep since we were young
Dear god, it's me, King Blasphemy. I'm quickly nearing death
Forgive me now, I cannot die a swine

The whole world is on drugs
Can't you smell us?
We're the filthiest of pigs
Can't you see us?
We're the shame of family
Can't you smell us?
First to show and last to leave
Won't you end us?
The whole world is on drugs

Everything will not be made right...
