Just like I came into this world
All by myself, I will leave it
I stared into the serpents eyes
And then for once I felt alive
Just like I came into this world
All by myself, I will leave it

And if this world wasn't built for me
There is no point at all
Hold onto your vice and I will hold onto mine
Think it but don't say it...
Your day will come

Twenty-seven invincible years
Where do you go where nowhere feels like home?
And I can't sleep a wink so i'll tell you when I get there
I'll walk into the light
But the lights fading away
