Aaw... gonna take it to the limit... yeah!
Come on...

I've been pushin' my load uphill
An' my back is bent
Now I'm lookin' for a thrill
'Cos the jiuce ain't spent
Slippin' in for satisfaction
Gimme a piece of your sweet love action
'Fore the night is thru'...
Gonna rescue you

'Cos I'm a hellraiser
Funchaser
Hellraiser
Boneshaker!!

You sink me into oblivion
When you let me in
You make me feel a'lik'a one in a million
When you moan'n'grin... aw!
Froget about the neighbours
Lettin' it all hang out
We're rockin' this joint
I love to hear you scream and shout...
Aaaawww!!

I'm a hellraiser
Funchaser
Hellraiser
Boneshaker!!
No one's beggin' for mercy... slippin'an'slidin' it in

Aww alright!

[Chorus 3x]
Come again... baby
Mmmmmm gonna slide it right in... aww!
