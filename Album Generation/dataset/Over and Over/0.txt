[Verse 1]
Over and over
They just say no Sir
And now it's a big blur
I hid it up my sleeve

[Verse 2]
You gotta believe me
Hey I need it badly
And they never see me
Those sentimental fools

[Pre-Chorus]
And I got the west coast sunshine
But it don't mean a thing

[Chorus]
I'm getting over like I knew that I would
I'm feeling older than a younger man should
But one of these days I'll finally make good
And hide another mistake

[Verse 3]
I'm out on the sidewalk
I'm put in a headlock
I tried but I can't stop
I put it in my shoe

[Pre-Chorus]
And I got the west coast sunshine
But it don't mean a thing

[Chorus]
I'm getting over like I knew that I would
I'm feeling older than a younger man should
But one of these days I'll finally make good
And hide another mistake

[Bridge]
This is a model tongue
This is the start of what's already done
This is the part that you eat when there's nowhere to turn

[Chorus][x2]
I'm getting over like I knew that I would
I'm feeling older than a younger man should
But one of these days I'll finally make good
And hide another mistake
