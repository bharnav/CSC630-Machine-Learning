[Verse 1]
I know you can and you should but you won't dear
Took out a part of your heart when they don't cheer
Was it a medal you got when you woke there?
On your own dear

[Verse 2]
When you were young you were hung up and lied to
Every man with a plan got inside you
Was it the bottle you dropped when they found you?
On your own dear

[Chorus]
And it's clear right on the page
This is your battlescar
And it's clear, clear as the day
You got your battlescar
Hey I know, ya I know, ya I know

[Verse 3]
Now that you're tossed on a sea of emotion
Every cut is as deep as the ocean
Was it a drag when you woke up so lonesome?
On your own dear

[Chorus]
And it's clear right on the page
This is your battlescar
And it's clear, clear as the day
You got your battlescar
Hey I know, ya I know, ya I know

[Verse 4]
The fun that you don't really need
Opens you up like books
That you don't even read
And pays you a lot to talk
When you don't even know
This scar will fade in time

[Chorus]
And it's clear right on the page
This is your battlescar
And it's clear, clear as the day
You got your battlescar
Hey I know, ya I know, ya I know
