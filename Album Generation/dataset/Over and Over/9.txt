[Verse 1]
Reading bones in a record
Silly tunes break
Hoping to shake
Out of bounds up and down pick a cliche

[Verse 2]
Any thought is a lesson
Beating 'em through
Eating time too
Smoking crack in the back waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Flit slide and heat slide and breeze before me
Making trouble out of junk
Flit slide and heat slide and singing sorry
Staying home just like a monk

[Chorus]
But Jesus is good
The angels all screamed he could
But I'm waiting here just to leave
All this life's just too much to believe

[Verse 3]
Making art like a beggar
Looking for crumbs
Asking for some
Easing out your teasing mouth you sit back and hum

[Pre-Chorus]
Flit slide and heat slide and breeze before me
Making trouble out of junk
Flit slide and heat slide and singing sorry
Staying home just like a monk

[Chorus]
But Jesus is good
The angels all screamed he could
But I'm waiting here just to leave
All this life's just too much to believe

[Verse 4]
Getting high off a record
Laying back too
Hoping to prove
All the phones easy moans all in the grooves

[Pre-Chorus]
Flit slide and heat slide and breeze before me
Making trouble out of junk
Flit slide and heat slide and singing sorry
Staying home just like a monk

[Chorus]
But Jesus is good
The angels all screamed he could
But I'm waiting here just to leave
All this life's just too much to believe
