[Verse 1]
I got a lot of something you ought to try
I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life
I got a lot of catching up left to do
Just for me and for you

[Verse 2]
And at the heart of something I wanna say
I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your days
I got a lot of things that I'm gonna prove
Just for me and for you

[Chorus]
Rollin and a reelin with your friends down the stairs
Knockin on the ceiling just to see if I'm there
When you see me bleeding, don't you know that I care?

[Verse 3]
I got a lot of something you oughta be
I'm gonna haunt you till you want me to leave
I got a lot things that I'm gonna do
Just for me and for you

[Chorus]
Rollin and a reelin with your friends down the stairs
Knockin on the ceiling just to see if I'm there
Won't you see me bleeding? Don't you know that I care?

[Bridge]
All of that I've done
No it don't bother me (I can't)
I don't even think that we are (Let them talk)
'Cause they could never see
That I know who you're thinking of

[Outro]
I got a lot of something you ought to try
I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life
I got a lot of catching up left to do
Just for me and for you
Just for me and for you
Just for me and for you
Ah yeah for me (yes) and for you
