[Verse 1]
I don't believe anybody else
Fantasy, falling for yourself I, I
And don't believe anything you like
Got to keep pulling at your life I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm 18
With the bowls on the scene
And the big poster wet dream
Wating for my by the way
Praying for a runaway

I had songs in my throat
I had the t.v. remote
And when a box would come
I could always ask for some
Lazy eyes would just slip out from their...

[Chorus][X2]
Please don't tear off my head
The things that I said
Only make me see god

[Verse 2]
And if I keep calling from the back
Turn to see anybody crack I, I
I got my knees stuck up in my head
But then you know all the things I said I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm 18
With the bowls on the scene
And the big poster wet dream
Wating for my by the way
Praying for a runaway

I had songs in my throat
I had the t.v. remote
And when a box would come
I could always ask for some
Lazy eyes would just slip out from their...

[Chorus][X2]
Please don't tear off my head
The things that I said
Only make me see god

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm 18
With the bowls on the scene
And the big poster wet dream
Wating for my by the way
Praying for a runaway

I had songs in my throat
I had the t.v. remote
And when a box would come
I could always ask for some
Lazy eyes would just slip out from their...

[Chorus][X3]
Please don't tear off my head
The things that I said
Only make me see god

[Bridge]
Oh but...

[Outro]
Please don't tear off my head
The things that I said
Only make me see god, god, god
