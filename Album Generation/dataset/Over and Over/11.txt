[Verse 1]
Got a new revelation
Wrote on the wall
Ya, I got a new inspiration
Watching you fall

[Verse 2]
I put a hole in your pocket
That you never saw
Ya, I put a hole in your pocket
You never saw

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you wanna get back all your love
That you say is coming in from above
And you promise that you got a new tune
Well that's not enough

[Verse 3]
Got a new concentration
'Cause you never call
Ya, I got a new invitation
Watching you crawl

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you wanna get back all your love
That you say is coming in from above
And you promise that you got a new tune
Though you never even know what to do
No, you never even know what to do

[Chorus]
What's the point of talking if that's not enough?
If that's not enough
What's the point of talking if that's not enough?
If that's not enough
What's the point of talking if that's not enough?
If that's not enough
What's the point of talking if that's not enough?
If that's not enough

[Verse 4]
Got a new revelation
Wrote on the wall
Yeah, I got a new inspiration
Watching you fall

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you wanna get back all your love
That you say is coming in from above
And you promise that you got a new tune
Though you never even know what to do

[Bridge]
No, you never even know what to do
No, you never even know what to do
No, you never even know what to do
No, you never even know what to do
No, you never even know what to do

[Outro]
Well, that's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
That's not enough
I said, that's not enough
