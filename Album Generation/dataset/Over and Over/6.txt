[Verse 1]
Won't you be good to yourself?
And don't you feel like coming home?
It'll be good
It'll be like coming home

[Verse 2]
Blend all your days into weeks
Keep all your thoughts to yourself
It'll be good
It'll be like coming home

[Chorus]
Because you need a place to stay
And I've been feeling dead since you went away
You better believe what I tell you 'cause you're coming home

[Verse 3]
And won't you bring light to my day?
And won't you be somebody new?
It'll be good
It'll be like coming home

[Verse 4]
And tell me that you wanna be
With nobody else but me
It'll be good
It'll be like coming home

[Chorus]
Because you need a place to stay
And I've been feeling dead since you went away
You better believe what I tell you 'cause you're coming home

[Verse 5]
But oh, it's not a joke
It's got a butler, and a maid, and a stove
It's nothing new
It's up to you
And when I feel it
I hope you feel it too
Did you hear it?
Yeah I heard it
And I think she's coming home to me

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la...

[Chorus]
Because you need a place to stay
And I've been feeling dead since you went away
You better believe what I tell you 'cause you're coming home

[Outro
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
Tell me that you're coming home
