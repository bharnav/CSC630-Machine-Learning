[Verse 1]
I've been sinking through the drain of love
Lift my eyes to skies of up above
Listen to me this is how I feel
Since I knew you all my thoughts are real
You're the only one I wanna do
Everything's new
And it's all cause of you

[Verse 2]
I've been moving cause my heart is true
Telling everyone I know 'bout you
Tell your mama that you won't be home
Let your daddy know you're not alone

[Verse 3]
All I wanna do is make you mine
I said I'd love you honey anytime
Don't believe the things they say about me
And all those things you know I'd never be
You're the only one I wanna do
Everything's new
And it's all cause of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now honey, honey, honey I can walk, walk, walk
I caught you kneeling in the alley with the baby talk
Now listen to me baby if you can't sit still
I know your sister will

[Chorus]
There ain't no blood on my hands love
There ain't no blood on my hands love
There ain't no blood on my hands love
The sun is up and I understand it's me

[Verse 4]
I've been moving cause my heart is true
Telling everyone I know 'bout you
Tell your mama that you won't be home
Let your daddy know you're not alone

[Verse 5]
All I wanna do is make you mine
I said I'd love you honey anytime
Don't believe the things they say about me
And all those things you know I'd never be
You're the only one I wanna do
Everything's new
And it's all 'cause of you
All 'cause of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now honey, honey, honey I can walk, walk, walk
I caught you kneeling in the alley with the baby talk
Now listen to me baby if you can't sit still
I know your sister will

[Chours]
There ain't no blood on my hands love
There ain't no blood on my hands love
There ain't no blood on my hands love
The sun is up and I understand it's me

[Outro]
And it's all 'cause of you
