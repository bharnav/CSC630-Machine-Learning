[Verse 1]
Everybody loves me but me ooh ooh ooh ooh eee
I feel so big but then I'm small
I wrote the writing on the wall
But I'm just looking out for me

[Verse 2]
Well everybody needs me but me ooh ooh ooh ooh eee
I got the big old fashioned head
I can't believe what It just said
But it's just looking out for me

[Chorus]
But when my heart was good I knew I had it coming
My love is long and sick and tired of running
And I get hard just thinking 'bout my dreams

[Verse 4]
Feeling lazy like tired and lazy like
Anybody can
Feel the need to know where I need to go
There's gotta be a plan

[Verse 5]
Now I'm older too
But all I wanna do
All I need to know
Does it got to be so slow?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody loves me but me ooh ooh ooh ooh eee
I got the big old fashioned head
I can't believe what It just said
But it's just looking out for me

[Chorus]
But when my heart was good I knew I had it coming
My love is long and sick and tired of running
And I get hard just thinking 'bout my dreams
On my dream

[Verse 6]
Feeling lazy like tired and lazy like
Anybody can
Feel the need to know where I need to go
There's gotta be a plan

[Verse 7]
Now I'm older too
But all I wanna do
All I need to know
Does it got to be so slow?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody loves me but me ooh ooh ooh ooh eee
I feel so big but then I'm small
I wrote the writing on the wall
But I'm just looking out for someone to say
Hey you're okay, see?

[Outro]
It's for someone to tell me
Someone to tell me
It's for someone to tell me
Ah, for someone to tell me (Here)
Oh, for someone to tell me
Oh, for someone da da da doo
For someone to...
