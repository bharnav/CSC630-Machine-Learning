[Verse 1]
Open your ears this is a story
It isn't clear is he a fool or a god?
But I don't care who knows it
And I don't care who sees
Lift up my head and roll into a dream

[Verse 2]
Get out the way, he's never sorry
Lives in a play, he knows it's always your fault
But I don't care who knows it
And I don't care who saw
I turn my head and hope that it'll stop

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody cares what you've been through
And nobody cares how much you do
And nobody cares what kind of drugs you're on
I can't take anymore fun

[Verse 3]
Help on the way, isn't she pretty?
It's a new day, he feels like a comic book god
But I don't care who knows it
And I don't care who sees
Lift up my head and roll into a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody cares what you've been through
And nobody cares how much you do
And nobody cares what kind of drugs you're on
I can't take anymore fun

[Bridge]
But then you shake
And then you moan
Come to find out
You're alone
But then you choke
You got another thing stuck in your throat
Then you find out
You were home

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody cares what you've been through
And nobody cares how much you do
And nobody cares what kind of drugs you're on
I can't take anymore fun

[Outro]
And nobody cares what you've been through
And nobody cares how much you do
And nobody cares what kind of drugs you're on
I can't take anymore fun
