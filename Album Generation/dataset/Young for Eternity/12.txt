At 1am, she's just waiting
Like a shadow, black eyes
Black hair but she don't care
That I want her, that I need her

Oh, I need her
I need her heart
'Cause mine is broken
I need her heart
Cause mine is broken

At 1am, he's just walking
Like a demon, blue eyes
Black hair but he don't care
That I want him
(Oh)
That I need him
Oh yeah, I need him

I need his heart
'Cause mine is broken
I need his heart
'Cause mine is broken

At 1am
At 1am
At 1am
At 1am
At 1am
At 1am

Got this feeling
Got this feeling
Got this feeling
Got this feeling

Got this feeling
Got this feeling
Got this feeling
Got this feeling
(Oh)

At 1am
At 1am
