Mary is my best friend
She makes me my tea
She let's me stay around her place
When there's nowhere else to be
There's nothing in her bedroom
Just a bed and a TV
And it's okay if I'm in her way
I just sit and drink my tea

I'm so lonely
I ain't done much lately
When you come looking
You'll find me sleeping soundly
Mary

Mary keeps me smiling
Even when I'm down
She let's me stay around her place
When there's no-one else around

There's nothing in her bedroom
Just a bed and a TV
And it's okay if I'm in her way
I just sit and drink my tea

I'm so lazy
I ain't done much lately
When you come looking
You'll find me sleeping soundly

And when she comes around
She says I always look so down
And yeah, she's always right
She makes me feel alright

I'm so lazy
I ain't done much lately
When you come looking
You'll find me sleeping soundly
Mary
