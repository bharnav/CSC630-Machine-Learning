[Verse 1]
You are the sun
You are the only one
My heart is blue
My heart is blue for you

[Chorus]
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen

[Verse 2]
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock n' roll

[Chorus]
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen

[Verse 3]
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock n' roll

[Chorus 2]
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen, yeah
Be my, be my, be my little rock n' roll queen
