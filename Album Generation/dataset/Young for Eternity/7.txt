When I walk on the city pavement
It's like a trigger going off in my mind
These times are a lonely saviour
That's all I need to find

Sitting on a city pavement
Sitting on a city pavement
Sitting on a city pavement
Sitting on a city pavement

Like colors on a streetlight sidewalk
Dark fight going on in my mind
These times are a lonely saviour
That's all I need to find

Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a city pavement

Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a pavement
Sitting on a city pavement
