[Sample: Big Data]
You understand I've got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous

[Verse 1: Left Boy]
You don't wanna fuck around with me
You're talkin' to a goddamn god
Born and raised in the Vienna, rap' doch Deutsch, baby (not)
But I do come through with that one-two step
R-rackity club I ain't fucked up yet, yeah
Give me that mic baby
One, two checks
30k all day when we play these sets
Baby, you can get what you want, yeah
Daddy's goin' real, real strong
Can't fuck with the fam 'cause we so on
In the lights of the gigs, we can hold on
Yeah, been there, done that, L-E-F-T on a real big comeback
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you want that?

You understand I've got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous

[Verse 2: Left Boy]
Dangerous, ooh! That sounds good, yeah
Talk to me baby, like I'm your dude
'Cause right now, I'm in your hood
In your house, in your bed, in your sheets
Hey, DJ, spin that tune
If you don't fuck with us, then motherfuck you
Made Jour Label, that's the crew
Nobody does it like we do
Step in my zone and it's (danger)
Bring that motherfuckin' house down
Come through dress like space ranger
Oh, there's a new sheriff in town
Ah, blood on the dancefloor
Or tryin' to get in the back door
Let them all in, it's alright
Party like we're all going to die tonight

[Bridge]
Party like we're all going to die tonight
Party like we're all going to die tonight

[Outro]
Dangerous, ooh! That sounds good, yeah
Talk to me baby, like I'm your dude
'Cause right now, I'm in your hood
In your house, in your bed, in your sheets
Hey, DJ, spin that tune
If you don't fuck with us, then motherfuck you
Made Jour Label, that's the crew
Nobody does it like we do
