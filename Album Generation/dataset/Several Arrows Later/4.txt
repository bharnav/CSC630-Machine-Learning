Let's go for a swim
Out into the waves
When the lifeguards leave
It's ours for the day

Let's feel like we're brave
Let's give it some meaning
Even if it's shallow
Even if it is fake

It is safe as long as i see you way out in the water
With no thought of going under
We could be out here for hours

Lying in the sand i fall asleep and dream of the summer
When we'd slip behind the pool and go with nature
We'd lie beside the chlorine bottles
After sometime sleep and dream of summers
When things could not be so easy

If you're looking for something
Out in the waves
At least it is something
You know that you're safe

It is sound as long as i see you way out in the water
With no thought of going under
We could be out here for hours

Lying in the sand i fall asleep and dream of the summer
When we'd slip behind the pool and go with nature
We'd lie beside the chlorine bottles
After sometimes sleep and dream of summers
When things could not be so easy

I see birds above the waves sit on the air and wait for something
I know someday i'll be done with all this waiting
So i'll lay down on the couch after sometime sleep
And dream of the summers
When things could not be so terribly easy
