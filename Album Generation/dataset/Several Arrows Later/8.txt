In complete darkness
I lose balance
I'm getting dressed you're still asleep
Think you're a fake
At not being awake
I reach the door your breath has changed
I do not stop
Turn all the locks
Don't hold your breath you shouldn't wait

The birds and cars
Speak up when they reach morning
I know some day
The spring will return again

I'm returning to
A small green room
At 5:15 the sky has changed
From black to blue
Still hardly day
These brooklyn stars are small and strange
I'm under roads
They're going home
Next to statues of saints of snow

Perfect plans cannot be made
I hate fights about merging on to interstates
I think people should realize
There are other lanes
Not just theirs for only them
To get them home again
To go home again

In complete darkness
I lose balance
I'm getting dressed you're still asleep
Don't hold your breath you shouldn't wait
There's no one there for you to save

I know some day
The spring will return again
The birds and cars
Speak up when they reach morning
I'm not gone yet
I want more of everything
