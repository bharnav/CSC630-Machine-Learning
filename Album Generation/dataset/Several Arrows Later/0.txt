Went to where the people were on a saturday night
Seems like it always seems
Where i go i want to leave
I thought we were doing fine with our lives
There are people who will tell you
There is always something better

If you don't know or care you'll be alright
I heard it's modern to be stupid
You don't need to talk to look good

I surprised myself as my mouth started speaking
There is nothing left of my nerves
As i lean over to ask her

Pardon the intrusion
Could we leave before it gets bad
I might smash up all these windows
And set fire to the curtains
Until it goes on and eats it with its blue and red orange
Until the fire burns and eats it with its blue and red orange

If you don't know or care you'll be alright
I heard it's modern to be stupid
You don't need a thought to look good

Pardon the intrusion
Could we leave before it gets bad
I might smash up all the windows
And set fire to the curtains
