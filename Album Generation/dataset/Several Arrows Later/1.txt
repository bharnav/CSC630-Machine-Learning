Did you go to montreal
Or hide behind the package store
You're hanging out with your old friends
With them they knew you'd see the end

You're in so much trouble
Can't hide in your covers
It's forgetting that would beat it all
Easier when they don't ever call

I don't think i want to think about it
How the fall is coming down
The light is leaving and it's hard to breathe
Buried in a pile of leaves

We don't want to make mistakes
We don't want to be the same
I hand the finger to my fate
He doesn't know and he cannot see that far

I don't think i want to think about it
How the fall is coming down
The light is leaving and it's hard to breathe
Buried in a pile of leaves

We don't want to ever change
We don't want to make mistakes
I hand the finger to my fate
He doesn't know me and he cannot see that far

Nights get so long and cold
Fewer places we can go
You're in so much trouble
Can't hide in your covers

I don't think i want to think about it...

You're in so much trouble
Can't hide in your covers ...
