Spring provides

The spring provides
Reminders through your life
When branches scrape your pane
They call you out again

The question light
You only see at night
Stay on the edge of crowds
They'll say their secrets loud

The numb deceits
We fled for idle streets
Now second guess our sky
Something is passing by

I will not wait
For anyone
To get ready
You took too long
I am not full
On going out
I don't care if
I talk too loud

The lights lie down
On friday night
There's nothing in the sky
There's so much out there we can't see
I feel it passing by

I will not wait
For anyone
To get ready
You took too long
I am not full
On going out
I don't care if
I talk too loud
(i'll listen to what you say
I will still just turn away
Sharper stars and sharper skies
That's where i want to place my eyes)
The lights lie down
On friday night
There's nothing in the sky
There's so much out there we can't see
I feel it passing by
