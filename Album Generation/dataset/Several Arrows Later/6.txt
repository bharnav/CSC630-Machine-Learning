Looking down on the smallest thing
I squint so i can focus
You hold your hands like they were broken
See me look and say your joking
No, i don't think i get it
Would not show i don't know it
No it's best not to show up

In the city you must make yourself light
In the city you don't have to decide
Sometimes check yourself make sure your alive

Targets stare you down at night
Look away they can't destroy you
Please stop pacing and distracting
I'm not sure that love this acting
No, i don't think get it
Would not show i don't know it
Yes it's best not to show up

In the city you must make yourself light
In the city you don't have to decide
Sometimes check yourself make sure your alive

No, i don't think get it
Would not show i don't know it
Yes it's best not to show up

In the city you must make yourself light
In the city you don't have to decide
Sometimes check yourself make sure your alive

Looking down on the smallest thing
I'm not seeing anything
