The future is belligerent
Tells me work and worry
Even without sense
You stick to plans

Concepts are embarrassing
When you let them drink
They tell you what they think
I'm not listening

I look back to the trees and the wild
I look back to see you smile

My street is ambivalent
It makes sure to tell me
Doesn't have to know
If i come or go

I look back to the trees and the wild
I look back to see you smile

I've heard of people building houses
I heard they use their arms
Somewhere so much stronger
I think i wander

I look back to the trees and the wild
I look back to see you smile

I can beat myself up
With success and daring
Better than you could
I think i'm pretty good

I look back to the trees and the wild
I look back to see you smile...
