All these things within my pockets
Might belong to someone else
Or so it seems
They're just like me
They could be wrong

I spent seven hours waiting
For a bus that comes and goes
If i don't wait
Then i can't be late
For something more

We were supposed to go on
And to much bigger things than we've done
With stitches and make-up you'll hold it together for me
No one's feeling bad
It's as honest as beliefs that anyone has

It's officially been stated
And my state is of distraction
All the waves
Can't wash away
What's way too strong

I'm a servant of a purpose to provide a service
I don't know its name but i've been awake for way too long

I don't know if this is right
I know that it's not wrong at all
With my arms and your legs i'll keep it together for you
No it's not that bad
It's as honest as beliefs that anyone has

My eyes close and open to yours
As yours open and close to mine
It's ok
Your hair in my face
As we both fade

We were supposed to go on
And do much bigger things than we've done
With stitches and make-up you'll hold it together
With my arms and your legs i'll keep it together
For you
