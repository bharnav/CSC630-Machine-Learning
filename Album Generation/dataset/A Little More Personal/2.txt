[Verse 1]
I've got time to watch you spin around in circles
Falling through the cracks inxide your mind
That's fine
I've been through the darkest hour
Made it to the other side of you
I can live without you

[Chorus]
I live for the day
I live for the night
That you will be desperate and I am inside
I live for the tears to fall down your face
I live for the words you finally say
I live for the day

[Verse 2]
You are high, thinking you're invincible
So busy building castles in the sky
You're done, and you don't even know it
But your eyes have started showing that it's true
Trying to live without love

[Chorus]
I live for the day
I live for the night
That you will be desperate and I am inside
I live for the tears to fall down your face
I live for the words you finally say
I live for the day
I live for the day

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Ohh
The day
Oh, oh, ohh
I can live without you

[Chorus]
I live for the day
I live for the night
That you will be desperate and I am inside
I live for the tears to fall down your face
I live for the words you finally say
I live for the day
I live for the day

[Outro]
Oh, wanna see you crawling
Oh, wanna see you crawling
Oh, wanna see you crawling
I live for the day
