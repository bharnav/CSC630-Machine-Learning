[Verse 1]
You were the one thing that I could count on
You were my everything
And then I found out that we mean nothing
From someone on the street

[Pre-Chorus]
And I never saw it coming, never saw it coming
No, I never saw it coming, never saw something
I believed all the things that you said, I believed in you

[Chorus]
Well, if you were me
Would you push you?
Would you turn the other cheek and forgive you?
Would you cry out?
Would you break down?
Or would you wait for karma to come around?
Would you give up?
Would it be enough to make you never ever wanna be in love?
What would you do, what would you do?
If you were me, would it be through?

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's left to talk about but
I found it hard to leave
Without some closure
How could you want her
When you were still with me?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I never saw it coming, never saw it coming
No, I never saw it coming, never saw something
I believed all the things that you said, I believed in you

[Chorus]
Well, if you were me
Would you push you?
Would you turn the other cheek and forgive you?
Would you cry out?
Would you break down?
Or would you wait for karma to come around?
Would you give up?
Would it be enough to make you never ever wanna be in love?
What would you do, what would you do?
If you were me, would it be through?

[Bridge]
You turned something so good so bad
Threw out all the things that we had
Put yourself in my shoes, it's sad
I believed all the things that you said, I believed in you

[Chorus]
Well, if you were me
Would you push you?
Would you turn the other cheek and forgive you?
Would you cry out?
Would you break down?
Or would you wait for karma to come around?
Would you give up?
Would it be enough to make you never ever wanna be in love?
What would you do, what would you do?
If you were me, would it be through?
Would it be through?

[Outro]
What would you do if you were me?
If you were me, what would you do?
What would you, what would you, what would you do?
