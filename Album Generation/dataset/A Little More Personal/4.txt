[Verse 1]
I was born a fighter
I was born on a rainy day
I've had my share of pain
But you've missed most of that
So many other things you had to do
You looked after you
Do you remember what you did?
Do you know just what you've missed?
Do you care about what I have to say?

[Chorus]
You took my innocence away
I never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes
Thanks for the break through
But you won't bring me down
I always come around
You took my innocence away
But the best of me stayed

[Verse 2]
It could be your blood running through all my vains
That ties me to your fate
If I could just close my eyes
I'd blackout all the reasons why
We're still in this place
What you want is what you got
You should've tried to make it stop
I guess you couldn't find a way to let me in

[Chorus]
You took my innocence away
I never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes
Thanks for the break through
But you won't bring me down
I always come around
You took my innocence away
But the best of me stayed

[Bridge]
Loneliness has filled my soul
And it creeps inside
It takes control
And I don't know how to begin giving up on everything

[Chorus]
My innocence
You took my innocence away
I never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes
Thanks for the break through
But you won't bring me down
I always come around
You took my innocence away
But the best of me stayed

[Outro]
The best of me stayed
But the best of me stayed
Oh, but the best of me stayed
