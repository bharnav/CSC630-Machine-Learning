[Verse 1]
I can tell you things nobody knows
Up and everywhere, nobody goes
Nothing gets me off the way that you do
You drive me crazy when you step in the room

[Chorus]
Something 'bout your lips, something 'bout your kiss
Something 'bout your eyes, keeps you on my mind
Though it was nothing
Turns out it is something
You're the one that keeps me up every night
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
Yeah, yeah, well, I think I do

[Verse 2]
Crawled under my skin and I feel you there
You're with me all the time, you come everywhere
But when I needed space, I push you away
But then I want you back, you're hard to erase

[Chorus]
Something 'bout your lips, something 'bout your kiss
Something 'bout your eyes, keeps you on my mind
Though it was nothing
Turns out it is something
You're the one that keeps me up every night
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
I think I do

[Bridge]
You're hard to erase
I think I do, I think I do
Do, do, do
Do, do, do

[Chorus]
I can tell you things, nobody knows
Up and everywhere, nobody goes
Nothing gets me off the way that you do
You drive me crazy when you step in the room
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you
Who, who, who, who loves you

[Outro]
I think I do
Love you
Who loves you!?
