[Verse 1]
It's lonely sometimes in the fast lane
People come and go like rain
And I look around for a hand to hold
But there's no one here today
Everyone has gone away
And left me in the fray

[Chorus]
So don't wish upon a star
'Cause a star can only get you so far
And it doesn't matter who you are
'Cause the sky looks better from the ground
Anyway, you never know what you got
And even if you do, it don't mean it's gonna stay
Tomorrow is another day
You only live once and I'm living for today
I'm living for today

[Verse 2]
So I drive around the superficial town
With a smile on my face
No one really knows how I feel inside
And I'm keeping it that way
It's my story to replay
And the fast lane's where I wanna stay

[Chorus]
So don't wish upon a star
'Cause a star can only get you so far
And it doesn't matter who you are
'Cause the sky looks better from the ground
Anyway, you never know what you got
And even if you do, it don't mean it's gonna stay
Tomorrow is another day
You only live once and I'm living for today

[Bridge]
Well I, I can't find (I can't find) my sanity (my sanity)
I'm about to lose my mind (I'm about to lose my mind)
And I, (and I,) I can't find (I can't find) my sanity (my sanity)
Well, I want to lose my mind (well, I want to lose my mind)
And if only I can show me that nobody's gonna bring me down

[Chorus]
So don't wish upon a star (don't wish upon a star)
'Cause a star can only get you so far
And it doesn't matter who you are (doesn't matter who you are)
'Cause the sky looks better from the ground
Anyway, you never know what you got (never know what you got)
And even if you do, it don't mean it's gonna stay
Tomorrow is another day (tomorrow is another day)
You only live once and I'm living for today
