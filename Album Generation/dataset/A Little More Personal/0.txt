[Verse 1]
I wait for the postman
To bring me a letter
I wait for the good Lord
To make me feel better
And I carry the weight of the world
On my shoulders
A family in crisis
That only grows older
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?

[Chorus]
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I am broken
But I am hoping
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I am cryin'
A part of me's dying
But these are
These are
The confessions of a broken heart

[Verse 2]
And I wear all your old clothes
Your polo sweater
I dream of another you
One who would never
Never leave me alone to pick up the pieces
A daddy to hold me
That’s what I needed
So why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?

[Chorus]
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I don’t know you
But I still want to
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
Tell me the truth
Did you ever love me?
'Cause these are
These are
The confessions of a broken heart
Of a broken heart

[Bridge]
I... love you
I... love you
I... love you
I...
I love you

[Chorus]
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I don’t know you
But I still want to
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
Tell me the truth
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?

[Refrain]
These are
The confessions of a broken heart
Ooh, yeah

[Outro]
I wait for the postman
To bring me a letter
