[Verse]
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I love you to love me

[Pre-Chorus]
Shine up my high heel shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Felling all alone without a friend, you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

[Verse]
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

[Pre-Chorus]
Shine up my high heel shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Felling all alone without a friend, you feel like dying
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

[Bridge]
Felling all  alone without a friend, you feel like dying
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

[Verse 3]
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me

[Outro]
I want you
I want you
Ahh
