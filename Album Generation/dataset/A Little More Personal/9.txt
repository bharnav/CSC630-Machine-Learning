[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo

[Verse 1]
And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby
Nothin' else mattered
Well, He was no more (He was no more)
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within' him
But the moment
That I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo

[Verse 2]
Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow, yeah, yeah
And the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With their words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
Nothin' else mattered

[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo

[Verse 3]
The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colours
But the sea
Does not change
So with the slow graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen

[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, said, whoo
