[Intro: Lindsay Lohan & Male]
Ah, no, I like when people talk in the beginning of songs
I think that's kinda rad
I don't think you should use it
Well, something kinda introspective
Something that means a bit to me
Like a little more... personal?

[Verse 1]
You say you gotta go, but what does that mean
Do you wanna be together, or is it just me?
Sometimes I think you're in until I think your out
It's like I'm swimming in the deep end, pull me out
Wanted to feel, wanted to know
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven I can call my own

[Chorus]
Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
'Cause the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

[Verse 2]
Its like we do a dance where no one wants to move
But if I take the first step
Maybe we can find a groove
I'm really trying hard To not just walk away
I think that it's about time someone said
Wanted to feel, wanted to know
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven I can call my own

[Chorus]
Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
'Cause the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

[Bridge]
I wanna know what goes on in your misery
I think that I could have the key to run back everything

[Chorus]
Can we try a little more personal?
'Cause the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal
Can we try a little more personal? (a little more personal)
Can we throw away all the casual? (a little more personal)
'Cause the more I know about you (a little more personal)
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

[Outro]
You say you gotta go, but what does that mean?
Do you wanna be together, or is it just me?
