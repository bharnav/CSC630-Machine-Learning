[Verse 1]
I should've known, the day we met
The way you turned and waved at me, I never will forget
Two years later, who'd have guessed
That we would make it this far just to put it all to rest?

[Chorus]
And if it's alright, I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that it's time that we moved on
And if it takes all night, I'll wait here
Till the daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
It's alright, we were wrong

[Verse 2]
If you're crazy, then I'm insane
Two people with the same condition
It never goes away
It's not our problem anymore
But let's just call it even when I'm walking out that door
And, oh, it won't be easy, 'cause it was hard from the start

[Chorus]
And if it's alright, I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that it's time that we moved on
And if it takes all night, I'll wait here
Till the daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
It's alright, we were wrong

[Bridge]
We must have met for some reason
It's in the sky, something from up high
(We) must have lived for some reason
It wasn't a lie, it just wasn't right
It just wasn't right

[Chorus]
And if it's alright, I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that it's time that we moved on
And if it takes all night, I'll wait here
Till the daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
And if it's alright, I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that it's time that we moved on
And if it takes all night, I'll wait here
Till the daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
It's alright we were wrong
It's alright we were wrong
It's alright we were wrong
Ohhh It's alright we were wrong

[Outro]
I should've known
The day we met
