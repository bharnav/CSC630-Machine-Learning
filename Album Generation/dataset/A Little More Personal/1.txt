[Verse 1]
I found my box of letters
Lying on the ground
The ones you used to write me before it all went down
I even got a paper cut trying to figure out
What to do with all these memories

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're not who you used to be
And I wonder where you've gone

[Chorus]
Have you fallen in a black hole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love?
Where's the love?

[Verse 2]
Remember all those hours laughing on the floor
Those days ain't doing nothing fell like nothing did before
I don't need those stickers or that money after all
I'll trade them for an old message you've called'
'Cause it's not how we used to feel
And I wonder what went wrong

[Chorus]
Have you fallen in a blackhole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna go there, and I wanna know where
Everything that meant something to me lives on
I found a box of letters, used to make me smile
But now I feel so lonely

[Chorus]
Have you fallen in a blackhole?
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
A black hole
Somewhere there's a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times?
What happened to the moments where we had so much?
Where's the love?
Where's the love?
Where's the love?
Where's the love?
Where's the love?

[Outro]
As you're falling in a black hole
As you're falling in a black hole
As you're falling in a black hole
