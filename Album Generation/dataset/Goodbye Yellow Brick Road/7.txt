[Verse 1]
I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think i don't have a clue
Baby you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

[Chorus]
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
Because you can tell by the lines i'm reciting
That i've seen that movie too

[Verse 2]
It's a habit i have, i don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your b films
Because i've seen that movie too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
Because you can tell by the lines i'm reciting
That i've seen that movie too
