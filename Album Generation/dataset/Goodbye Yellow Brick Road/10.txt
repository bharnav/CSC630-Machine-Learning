[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm going to put buckshot in your pants
If you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath
The mess you've become
Well you may have been a pioneer
In the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job
Washing other people's stairs

[Pre-Chorus]
I should tell
I should tell
I should tell

[Chorus]
I'm going to tell the world
You're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down
Scrub her back
And turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she
I bet she
I bet she
Oh, I bet she
Hasn't had a bath in a year

[Verse 2]
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Dirty little girl... (repeat)
