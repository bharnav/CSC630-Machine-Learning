[Funeral for a Friend: long instrumental]

[Love Lies Bleeding:]

[Verse 1]
The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die

Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

[Chorus 1]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Verse 2]
I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change
Comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

[Chorus 2]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Piano solo break with band slowly building back up]

[Guitar solo: Davey Johnstone]

[Chorus 3]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Ad-libs]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo!

Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo!

[Intense band outro on fade-out]
