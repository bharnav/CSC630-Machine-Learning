Young man, old man
Don’t matter
If you're a big man, strong man
I’m comin’ at ya
Anybody get in my way
I won’t have it
Be the first one comin' through the barricade

Don’t get me all fired up
Time to fight
Better get your hands up
And realize
That the goin's 'bout to get rough
So get tough
When your name is called I see ya standin’ tall

If anyone comes against you
Gonna have to come through us all
We got nothing to lose
And we're not giving up so

Stand
If you want it all
Stand
Against the odds
Stand
You can never fall
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em
Stand
It’s your wakeup call
Stand
You’re against the wall
Stand
If you want it all
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em

Get off the wall boy
Think it’s time
Gonna stomp them hard and
Draw a line
In the sand no crossin’
It’s your loss
If the game is called, it’s too late to fall

Get up rise up
Come together
Wanna see your fist up
If you want it
Then you know you never give
We've had enough
We’ve come too far
Gonna take what’s ours

If anyone comes against you
Gonna have to come through us all
We got nothing to lose
And we're not giving up

Stand
If you want it all
Stand
Against the odds
Just stand
You can never fall
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em
Stand
It’s your wakeup call
Stand
You’re against the wall
Just Stand
If you want it all
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em

How bad do ya want it?
Ya know ya gotta have it
Tell me if you need it
Oh you gotta take it

You gotta get up, rise up
Come together
You gotta get up, rise up
Come together

Stand
If you want it all
Stand
Against the odds
Just stand
You can never fall
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em
Stand
It’s your wakeup call
Stand
You’re against the wall
Just Stand
If you want it all
You gotta stand up, stand up.............to 'em
