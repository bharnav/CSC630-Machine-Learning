The house is quiet and you haven't called again
Are we still together?
You tell me you've been out all night with your friends
Baby I know better
It’s getting hard for you to hide behind these lies
I see the game that you're running
And now you can’t even look me in the eyes
Ya shoulda seen this coming

I’ll be gone tomorrow
Did you get that message yet?

One more lie
I don’t believe
And now I’m leavin’ ya lonely again
And when you wake
From your broken dream
I hope the pain in your world never ends
One more lie

Who's to say that you're the only one to blame?
I shoulda paid more attention
I guess I never realized who you became
And it’s too late to erase it

I’ll be gone tomorrow
Did you get that message yet?

One more lie
I don’t believe
And now I’m leavin you lonely again
And when you wake
From your broken dreams
I hope the pain in your world never ends
One more lie
One more lie

[Solo]

One more lie
I don’t believe
And now I’m leavin you lonely again
And when you wake
From your broken dreams
I hope the pain in your world never ends
With one more lie
I don’t believe
And now I’m leavin’ you lonely again
And when you wake from your broken dreams
I hope the pain in your world never ends
One more lie
One more lie
One more lie

Did ya get the message?
