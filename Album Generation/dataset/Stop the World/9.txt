I stumble home in the dark
This waste is taking its toll on me
Another cut on my face that I can’t explain
Oh well, what the hell

The only thing that I’ve been told is
The world will leave you cold
So watcha gonna do when you fall?

I don’t wanna be left here
I don’t wanna lose my mind
Oh yeah
Every time I close my eyes
I don’t wanna live in fear
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah
You can save me for tonight
Oh yeah
But what about the rest of my life
What about it
What about it

I call her on the way down
She tells me nothin’ I say makes sense
She’s all tied up with a friend
And she can’t come around
Oh no gotta go

So watcha gonna do when ya fall?

I don’t wanna be left here
I don’t wanna lose my mind
Oh yeah
Every time I close my eyes
I don’t wanna live in fear
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah
You can save me for tonight
Oh yeah
But what about the rest of my life
What about it
What about it

How many times can ya hit the wall?
Will I get out or will I end it all?

Another day and I’m dead
Another lie to forget
Another scream in my head
I gotta get away

I don’t wanna be left here
I don’t wanna lose my mind
Oh yeah
Every time I close my eyes
I don’t wanna live in fear
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah
You can save me for tonight
Oh yeah
But what about the rest of my life
What about it
What about it
