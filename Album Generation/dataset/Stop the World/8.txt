You got me wrapped around your finger
Who I am I don't know anymore
Got me blinded by your circumstance
I’m stuck in the middle

See I know how the story goes
If you love it gotta let it go
Cuz I'm starting to see what I wanna be
And I'm not giving up on it

I, I gotta get away
I gotta make a change I don't wanna give you up
But this is more than I can take
I gotta set you free, I wanted to believe
But I finally had enough.............I gotta break away

Can’t you see this time is passing?
It’s gone before you know it
And I don't think you really understand
But now I see it

I think you know how the story goes
If you love me baby let me go
Cuz the chains that bind are yours not mine
And I won’t be you prisoner

I, I gotta get away
I gotta make a change I don't wanna give you up
But this is more than I can take
I gotta set you free, I wanted to believe
But I finally had enough.............I gotta break away

And I don’t know where this road is taking me
But I’m movin’ on
And I’m never lookin’ back
