I’ve laid with fools
Shook hands with the devil
To break free from the rules
I must confess
I’d take more than my share
So you could have less

I live like a martyr without any cause
I’d die to myself if you'd only help me

Stop the world from spinning me around
I wanna stop the world
And start all over
Stop the world before I hit the ground
I wanna stop the world
From taking over me

I’ve been a thief
And I’ve paid for the privilege
With tears of grief
And I, I’m to blame
And my loneliness burns
Like a ragged flame

And there’s blood on my hands
I can’t make it go away
But nothin' can keep me from tryin’

Stop the world from spinning me around
I wanna stop the world
And start all over
Stop the world before I hit the ground
I wanna stop the world
From taking over me

With me or without me
This world keeps on turning
Keeps me down

I live like a martyr without any cause
I’d die to myself if you'd only help me

Stop the world from spinning me around
I wanna stop the world
And start all over
Stop the world before I hit the ground
I wanna stop the world
From taking over me

Stop
Stop
Stop
Stop
