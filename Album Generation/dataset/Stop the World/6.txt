When the hammer comes down
You’re gonna hear the sound
I’m a poor man sinner
Gonna turn this thing around
The fat lady's singing I don’t really care
I ain’t no twenty one and this ain’t no truth or dare

I wanna be what you wanna see
At least until the sun comes up
And I wanna feel that this love is real
Until we say goodbye

She’s a high heel walker
I’m a real smooth talker
And I ain’t gonna take a maybe
Cuz I’m a love hitch hiker
And I think I really like her
But I ain’t gonna call her baby (baby)

But I ain’t gonna call her......back

When you wanna make a stand
You gotta be a man
This world is full of promises
You need to understand
The train left the station
And I really don’t care
You ain’t no Ginger Rogers
And I ain’t no Fred Astaire

I wanna be what you wanna see
At least until the sun comes up
And I wanna feel that this love is real
Don’t wanna say goodbye

She’s a high heel walker
I’m a real smooth talker
And I ain’t gonna take a maybe
Cuz I’m a love hitch hiker
And I think I really like her
But I ain’t gonna call her baby (baby)

I think I wanna call her......back

This ain’t no revolution
You know I’m only lookin for a solution
I got a proclamation
Of Desperation

[Solo]

I wanna be what you wanna see
Don’t wanna say goodbye
Goodbye

Cuz I’m a love hitch hiker
And I think I really like her
But I ain’t gonna call her baby
She’s a high heel walker
I’m a real smooth talker
And I ain’t gonna take a maybe
I was a love hitch hiker
But I think I really like her
And I ain’t gonna call her baby (baby)

I wanna be what you wanna see
Till the sun comes up
But I ain’t gonna call her baby
I think I'm gonna call her
