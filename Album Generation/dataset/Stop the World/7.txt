Hey Sally what’s the matter with you
You went downtown messin' round
Thinkin' that you could never lose
But the weight of all your lies left you cold
Hey Sally what’s your next move
You took a couple of wrong turns baby
Cuz you never really had a clue
That the road you're goin' down you'll walk alone
And you'll never know you can turn around
Till someone tells ya so

You gotta stand up
When you fall down
Why do ya stand for what you know is wrong?
Oh Sally, Sally come home tonight
You been lookin' round
But you never found
The love you needed for so long
Oh Sally, Sally come home......tonight

Hey Sally I know just how ya feel
You know where you wanna go baby
But ya never wanna take the wheel
But you’re wastin' all your time lookin' back
And the only way to get there
Is for you to understand

You gotta stand up
When you fall down
Why do ya stand for what you know is wrong?
Oh Sally, Sally come home tonight
You been lookin' round
But you never found
The love you needed for so long
Oh Sally, Sally come home......tonight

I’m not here to tell you pride comes before the fall
But if you don’t come, you don’t come back
And you could lose it all

Hey Sally you're nobody's fool
And no matter what they say ya know I still got faith in you
I still have faith in you

You gotta stand up
When you fall down
Why do ya stand for what you know is wrong?
Oh Sally, Sally come home tonight
You been lookin' round
But you never found
The love you needed for so long
Oh Sally, Sally come home......
Come home tonight
