When I close my eyes
If only for a moment
I can see the light
But the darkness is callin’
Pulling me down, taking me under
The emptiness below
Can’t hold it back, I’m letting go
Of the innocence again

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

Every single lie
Every promise broken
Leads me to the other side
Of a life going nowhere
Pulling me down, taking me under
The emptiness below
Can’t hold it back, can’t let it go
Will I ever live again?

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

I found a little salvation there under the midnight sun
I gotta fight this fear inside of me
Cuz I got nowhere to run

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

Will you rise above the pain
Or come undone
