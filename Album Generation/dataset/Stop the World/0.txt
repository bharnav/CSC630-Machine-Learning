I’m watchin’ you
You're watchin’ you
Captured by the mirror that you're lookin through
I know you know
We gotta go
But you're puttin’ on a one woman fashion show
And every time
You change your mind
Is another minute gone that I gotta find
Movin’ fast, I hit the gas
Tearin’ up that road

Whoa
Ya look so right baby can’t be wrong
Whoa
I know it was worth the wait

The upside of vanity
Is what you do to me
Brings me to my knees
It’s livin’ on the edge
It’s how to get ahead it’s the
Upside of vanity
It’s what you do to me
You are my TV
The upside of vanity
Upside of vanity

I’m watchin you
They're watchin’ you
Take another turn baby look at you
Camera flash
Gotta make it last
Give a little, a little more
Oh and every time
I feel inclined
To give another second thought to my jealous mind
Need I remind myself that I’m the
One takin’ you home

Whoa
If I’m your fool baby that’s alright
Whoa
You know I’ll never give it up

The upside of vanity
Is what you do to me
Brings me to my knees
It’s livin’ on the edge
It’s how to get ahead it’s the
Upside of vanity
It’s what you do to me
You are my TV
The upside of vanity
Upside of vanity

I’m diggin’ your walk
I’m diggin’ your talk
I wouldn’t leave home without you
Cuz when the lights are on ya
I know they'll be starin’ at ya
You make me look good
I knew that you would
The center of attention
And when the night is over
And when the night is over
And when the night is over
And when the night is over

The upside of vanity
Is what you do to me
Brings me to my knees
It’s livin’ on the edge
It’s how to get ahead it’s the
Upside of vanity
It’s what you do to me
You are my TV
The upside of vanity
Upside of vanity

Is what you do to me
It’s livin’ on the edge
