[Verse 1]
Slip around some universal corner
(Like a woman)
Slip around some corner, pick up the phone
(Like a woman)
She must build a fire next to the pay phone
Heat is the point, smoke on the receiver

Light up to its universal ringing
(Like a woman)
Picking it up, her heat finds the night and rises
And rises

[Verse 2]
She lets you in on her perfect secret
(Like a woman)
She wants a man who knows all the right places
(Like a woman)
Washing his feet with her tears, she'd dry them with her hair
Among the undefiled, she's gone wild

Her sins will sin from behind her
(Like a woman)
Dropping the phone, she leaves it dead to the dead men
The dead men

[Chorus]
Screaming Magdalene
So alone, she picks up the phone
Screaming Magdalene
I'm so waiting, is there anyone so waiting?
Screaming Magdalene
She is running

[Verse 3]
Slip around some universal corner
(Like a woman)
Slip around some corner, pick up the phone
(Like a woman)
She must build a fire next to the pay phone
Heat is the point, smoke on the receiver

Light up to its universal ringing
(Like a woman)
Picking it up, her heat finds the night and rises
And rises

[Chorus]
Screaming Magdalene
So alone, she picks up the phone
Screaming Magdalene
I'm so waiting, is there anyone so waiting?
Screaming Magdalene
She is running
