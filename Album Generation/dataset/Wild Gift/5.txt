Baby, you look like somebody
Oooh, to know
Like a rose comin' out of a photo
All your lipstick shows

I don't wanna make you cry
I don't wanna even try
I just wanna say I met you
It's who you know

Oh, you can talk to me
Make my life complete
When I think of the ways I can use you
Get me off the street

Then we spend the night in bed
And I can't lose my head
Even in loving
It's who you know
It's who you know

Baby, you look like somebody
Oooh, to know
Like a rose comin' out of a photo
All your lipstick shows

I don't wanna make you cry
I don't wanna even try
I just wanna say I met you
It's who you know
It's who you know
