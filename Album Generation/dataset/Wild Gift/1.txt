[Verse 1]
I play too hard when I ought to go to sleep
They pick on me 'cause I really got the beat
Some people give me the creeps

Every other week, I need a new address
Landlord, landlord, landlord, clean up the mess
Our whole fucking life is a wreck

[Chorus]
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it, it's kiss or kill

[Verse 2]
Coca-Cola and a Motorola kitchen
Naugahyde and a tie-dye t-shirt
Last night, everything broke

[Chorus]
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it, it's kiss or kill

[Verse 3]
I play too hard when I ought to go to sleep
They pick on me 'cause I really got the beat
Some people give me the creeps

Every other week, I need a new address
Landlord, landlord, landlord, clean up the mess
Our whole fucking life is a wreck

[Chorus]
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it
We're desperate, get used to it, it's kiss or kill
