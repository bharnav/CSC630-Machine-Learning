Give me love, give me happiness
Give me hope, give loneliness
Give me fight, give me bad desire
Give me chills, warm it up with fire
'Cause in a system we are well prepared
No one ever said that life was fair
Give me something that I could admire
Show me something that I could inspire
She's my lover
She's my lover now
And there's no other
No one else around in my heart
Give me love, give me happiness
Give me hope, give loneliness
Give me fight, give me bad desire
Give me chills, warm it up with fire
In a system we are well prepared
No one ever said that life was fair
Give me something that I could admire
Show me something that I could inspire
She's my lover
She's my lover now
And there's no other
No one else around in my heart
Give me love, give me happiness
Give me hope, give loneliness
Give me fight, give me bad desire
Give me chills, warm it up with fire
'Cause in a system we are well prepared
No one ever said that life was fair
Give me something that I could admire
Show me something that I could inspire
