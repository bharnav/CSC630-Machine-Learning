Well, I feel darkness and I feel rain
I want to kiss you but must refrain
I’ve already got someone to run to
I think you’re pretty just the same
Oh, believe me when I say
That society will make us pay
Oh no, sneak into my room
Under the covers, staring at the moon
And we can touch all night
Lie to your boyfriend, tell him what you like
Cause he's just a punk and I'm in a funk
Well I must admit I feel the same
But if we kiss then I'm to blame
I’ve already got someone to run to
But I find you pretty just the same
Oh, believe me when I say
That society will make us pay
Oh no, sneak into my room
Under the covers, staring at the moon
And we can touch all night
Lie to your boyfriend, tell him what you like
Cause he's just a joke and that's all she wrote
