I feel like dancing, on your grave boy
With holy water, I will not be afraid
'Cause like my father, well yeah, I have been betrayed
But unlike my brother my love has gone astray
But I've got fire
And I've got water
Unlike my mother
I'll sleep in this bed I made
Let's go dancing
Just one more night, baby
And in one more hour
I may not be around
Ooh
I feel like dancing, on your grave boy
With holy water, I will not be afraid
'Cause like my father, well yeah, I have been betrayed
But unlike my brother my love has gone astray
But I've got fire
And I've got water
Unlike my mother
I'll sleep in this bed I made
Just let's go dancing
One more night baby
Let's go dancing
One more night baby
In one more hour
I will not be around
I will not make a sound
