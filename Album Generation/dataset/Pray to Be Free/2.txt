I left you hung to dry
Left to die
Left to die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die

I left you out for dead
Let it be said
Let it be said
I'm so sorry

If you need some time
We can meet upon Monday, oh Monday

If you consider me
Some sort of enemy
I understand
But I am just a man

Oh it would be unwise
To take stands on that side
A declaration of the end

You say I've hell to pay
That's what you say
I've hell to pay
Anyway that's what you say

I left you out for dead
Let it be said
Let it be said
I'm so sorry

I've been all over town
Trying to find you
Because I hear you're mad
Oh, I hear you're mad

Still nowhere to be found
Your phone is dead
And it makes me feel bad
But, I don't feel that bad

If you consider me
Some sort of enemy
A declaration of the end

I left you hung to dry
Left to die, left to die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die

I left you out for dead
Let it be said
Let it be said
I'm so sorry
