[Intro: Layzie]
Yeah (yeah)
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind (hey)
Mind (hey) mind (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind

[Thin C]
Touchdown in the endzone, kicked it like a field goal
Get the extra points, tell me what's the real score?
Tell me who's the real hoe? Baby it's official
I'll referee (brrrrrr) bitch blow the whistle

[Layzie Bone]
Tell her to blow it, ain't no stoppin man, get this motherfucker poppin man
Treat it like a prostitute and I'm in the game, this strong arm robbery man
Touchdown in the endzone mean money man, better get some
Field goal, now my friends on, countin Benjamins in the real zone
What's the real score? Bitches is wantin to constantly stay on the dick
What we here fo'? To get mo', that's why we be mobbin so thick
Quick to scream out Thug Nation, put the screen on the hation
Ain't no time gon' be wastin, y'all been patiently waitin
We have them T-shirt and panty parties, bitches be doin us favors
Wanna thank ya for the flavor, you know I'm never gon' savor
What you gave up, was precious doll, you the shiznit, you put it down
I love it when you get wild, I love you screamin "Touchdown"

[Chorus: Thin C] + (Dre Ghost)
Put your hands in the air (bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
Put my nuts on your chin (bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
Now do it again and again bitch (bitch go ahead and give me somethin!)
(Won't you show me somethin, go ahead and show me somethin!)
What your momma name is? (Bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
Did she really have kids? (Bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
And who the fuck your next of kin? (Bitch go ahead and show me somethin!)
(Won't you show me somethin, go ahead and show me somethin!)

[Layzie Bone]
Don't break down it ain't over, over
Don't leave now, it ain't over, feel the party gettin started girl
You flawless should be against the law, got a nigga wantin to break you off
Come here girl, take that off, that body right there was made to floss
Made for me, give Thin a piece, give Dre a shot, he rock the cock
L.D.T. make panties drop, oh you one of them kind that like to block?
Oh you like to watch? Get you some popcorn, and watch the movie
Kick up your toes, I suppose, you gon' be comin up out of your clothes
And there you go, nobody knows, behind closed do's
Freaks exposed, ladies and hoes, wanna do me right after the show
Hey, ain't nothin wrong, with a little bit of bumpin and grindin
Tell me yo' age, show me yo' license, we ain't goin out like Tyson
Better try again, we dig you too, but the main thang is cooperatin
Cause that-a way you would get some play, and it just might make yo' day
Cause the official don't blow the whistle, when you steppin out of bounds
In yo' city or in yo' town, this how it's goin down

[Thin C]
Touchdown in the endzone, kicked it like a field goal
Get the extra points, tell me what's the real score?
Tell me who's the real hoe? Baby it's official
I'll referee (brrrrrr) bitch blow the whistle
Ay, ay, ay.. ay, ay...
Ay, ay, ay.. ay, ay...

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Grannys, aunts, sisters, nieces
We don't give a fuck, we love dime pieces
Got me a condom, let me release this
Let me see them Victoria Secrets
Fuck the drama, you can keep it
Slide down the pole
Laffy Taffy's and Tootsie Rolls
Fuck that, show me the pussy hole
I'm to the point, such a thug
And should I say, they show me love
Went to the room, straight from the club
All y'all broads can leave with us
You a good sport, and we with that
Charity baby, give back
Shower me baby, dig that?
Let me hit that, let me hit that
