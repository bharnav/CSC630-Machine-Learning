Oh, comfort me brother
Something's heavy on my mind
Now I sit and wonder
Why it is it that I can't find

Can't find peace all on my own
Can't seem to get there on and on
So come hear me brother
I won't lie

Now I have been broken
No longer am I blind
My lesser has spoken
Most of me is left behind

Won't find freedom here on my own
Can't seem to get there all alone
So come hear me brother
I won't lie

You never leave me
You'll always be part of the person I'll become
And I'll never leave you
You give me memories that I know could never leave

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

You never leave me
You'll always be part of the person I'll become
And I'll never leave you
You give me memories that I know could never leave

Won't find peace all on my own
Can't seem to get there on and on
So come hear me brother
I won't lie
So come hear me brother
I won't lie
