I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I'll still get along in a little while

I know sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I take too long
But I know where I'm headed
I know I'll belong

I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I'll still get along in a little while

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't mean to leave you
When I'm up and I'm gone
You see I know where I'm headed
With you, where I belong

[Chorus]
I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I'll still get along in a little while
I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I'll still get along in a little while

I know I didn't call
Sometimes when I don't call
I know I didn't call
I'll be alone
Sometimes when I don't call

[Fade]
