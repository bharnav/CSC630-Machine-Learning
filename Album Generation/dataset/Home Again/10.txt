Uh, when I leave, don't you cry
When I'm getting on the lucky side
Who will leave me alone?

Uh when I've passed don't you cry
When I'm long and gone, will I decide
Who will leave you alone?

Just you live your everyday, like you're running out of time
Say the things you say, don't leave everything behind
Try to find new somethings that won't fade away in time
These are things I'll always see on your side

Oh, when I'm lost, don't you cry
When I've gone away will at his side
Who will leave me alone

Uh, when I'm sleeping don't you cry
When I close my eyes, without your side
Who will leave you alone

Just you live your everyday, like you're running out of time
Say the things you say, don't leave everything behind
Try to find new somethings that won't fade away in time
These are things I'll always see on your side

Try to find new somethings that won't fade away in time
