Vanessa:
Ooh... Ooh...

Mollie:
As I walk into club at night
I can feel the burn of hungry eyes
They love to look me up and down like (Vanessa: Ooh)
And everyone's exposing talent
Like some freaking beauty pageant

Rochelle:
So I flung the crown onto the ground and I ripped up the sash
And I traded the ball gown for a LBD and a bunch of cash
But you bet that I kept my heels on when I went up to dance
And the whispers around with a frown saying 'girl that ain't pretty'

Una:
Hey-ey-yeah, then I'd rather be ugly
Baby, I say okay-ey-yeah, just as long as I love me

Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't give a damn
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you can
Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't really care
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you dare

Frankie:
Sure, you gotta love an attitude
But this scene is steaming up with rude
Posers posing like a fashion shoot (Vanessa: Ooh)
And everyone is dishing fouls
Like they're freaking Simon Cowell

Una:
So I flung the crown onto the ground and I ripped up the sash
And I traded the ball gown for a LBD and a bunch of cash
Yeah, you bet that I kept my heels on when I went up to dance
And the whispers around with a frown saying 'girl that ain't pretty'

Hey-ey-yeah, then I'd rather be ugly
Baby, I say okay-ey-yeah, just as long as I love me

Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't give a damn
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you can
Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't really care
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you dare

Vanessa:
'Cause I can feel the kick drum in my body like a heartbeat
And it's somewhere deep inside that dirty bass I lose me
In corner of my eye I saw someone falling off their seat
And the whispers around with a frown saying 'girl that ain't pretty'

Una:
Hey-ey-yeah, then I'd rather be ugly
Baby, I say okay-ey-yeah, just as long as I love me

Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't give a damn
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you can
Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't really care
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you dare

Hey-ey-yeah, then I'd rather be ugly
Baby, I say okay-ey-yeah, just as long as I love me

Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't give a damn
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you can
Baby, I say okay, I don't give a, don't really care
I say okay, come and lay it on me if you dare
