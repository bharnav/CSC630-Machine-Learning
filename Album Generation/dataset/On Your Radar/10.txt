Rochelle:
Early in the morning
I sit up in my bedroom, oh
Baby, in the perfect silence I can't hide it
It's about enough now

Vanessa:
Baby we've been stalling
And I've been telling fairytales
This is taking all my focus, I can't do this
There's so much you don't know

Frankie:
And I been fighting dark demons
Trying to make way for light
But I just dig myself deeper down
I gotta make it right

All:
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies

Mollie:
You've been kinda perfect
And we would be a perfect match
If I only had it in me, I'm so sorry
Never meant to hurt you

Vanessa:
And I been fighting dark demons
Trying to make way for light
But I just dig myself deeper down
I gotta make it right

All:
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies

Una:
Bad excuses, baby, it's true and I can't excuse this
'Cause white lies turn to black lies and I lose
Oh woah oh

All:
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies

Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies
