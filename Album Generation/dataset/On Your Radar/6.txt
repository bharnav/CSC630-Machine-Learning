Rochelle:
There's always an 'I'm sorry' after every outburst
Another apology
There's always a make up after every freaking break up
So tell me why we're doing this

Vanessa:
Why, oh why do we play this game, always want the last word?
It's a war that no one can win, we just keep getting hurt

All:
You're the only one that can make me this mad
Why can't I walk away, walk away?
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
I can't walk away, walk away
But I want you for myself, I still want you for myself
I want you for myself because I want you for myself

Una:
You creep under my skin and then you ruin my make-up
You know exactly how to tick me off
And yet I can't resist you when you're kissing my face off
When everything's forgiven and forgot

Vanessa:
I try and try to convince myself that this ain't gonna work
Why, oh why is the thought of you being gone so much worse?

All (Una):
You're the only one that can make me this mad
Why can't I walk away, walk away?
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
I can't walk away, walk away
But I want you for myself (I want you for myself, yeah)
I still want you for myself
I want you for myself (I need you for myself)
Because I want you for myself (Myself, yeah)

Vanessa:
(Why, oh why) Why (do we play this game?) do we play this game?
(Why, oh why) Oh-oh (we just keeping getting hurt?)

All:
You're the only one that can make me this mad
Why can't I walk away, walk away?
You're the only one that can hurt me this bad
I can't walk away, walk away
(Una: I want you for myself, yeah)
But I want you for myself (Vanessa: I want you for myself)
I still want you for myself (Una: I need you for myself)
I want you for myself because I want you for myself (Rochelle: Myself)
