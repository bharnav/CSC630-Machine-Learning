Rochelle:
So here we are again, I'm almost giving in
I'm over listening 'bout who you're with or where you've been
I got drunk with my friends, a list from one to ten
Are you the man that I need, I need? (No)

Vanessa:
If I was doing this, would you put up with this?
Do what your mama said, love or leave alone, I'm gone

'Cause all you ever do

Rochelle:
You promise me, me, me the, the, the world
You promise never to let down a girl
But now I know, it's time to go

Frankie:
Tonight I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you
I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you

Your womanizing ways, although you say you've changed (No)
I guess I always be your option, not priority

Una:
The best you'll never have, one day you'll wish me back
There won't be no one like me, me (No)

Mollie:
If I was doing this, would you put up with this?
Do what your mama said, love or leave alone, I'm gone

'Cause all you ever do

Rochelle:
You promise me, me, me the, the, the world
You promise never to let down a girl
But now I know, it's time to go

Frankie:
Tonight I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you
I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you

Vanessa:
Promise this, promise that, but you won't get me back
You won't find me home alone

Una:
Promise this, promise that, but you won't get me back
Someone else will love but you don't

Rochelle:
You promise me, me, me the, the, the world
You promise never to let down a girl
But now I know, it's time to go

Frankie:
Tonight I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you
I'm gonna go and party, party, go without you
