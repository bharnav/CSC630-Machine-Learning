Rochelle:
My love tonight, I can't control my love tonight
I think I found my pure delight, you got me at the speed of light

Vanessa:
It feels so right, I think this love, it feels so right
When I close my eyes
I can't help but wonder what it Would be like

All:
If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me

Vanessa:
You've stoked a fire and fanned a live desire
I blinked an eye, who enters in my life?

Rochelle:
Then you transpire, I can't believe my eyes
Two hearts
Vanessa:
Two lives
Rochelle:
Wrapped up and intertwined

All:
If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Frankie:
My love tonight
Mollie:
I can't control my love tonight

All:
If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go
Oh, you can do what you want with me, do what you want with me

Vanessa:
I think you are lovely, got that kind of smile
That makes me happy that you love me, love me, love me, love me
I wish you would hold me, got that kinda body
Makes me happy when you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
