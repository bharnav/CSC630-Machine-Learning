Una:
Some girls won't make no play
Happy to sit and wait
I won't be waiting all night

Frankie:
Some girls, they bite their tongue
I'll tell you straight up front
Got my attention tonight

Rochelle:
Beats are flowing, looks you're throwing
Get the fire up inside of me
Ain't no stopping when I lock in
Boy it's on if you can stand the heat

Una:
'Cause you turn me, turn me right here, right now
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
I can work you baby, I'll show you how
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Mollie:
I'm working up a sweat
Dripping down my neck
I got you right in my sight

Rochelle:
Come, baby, be my sin
Don't worry bout a thing
Just satisfy me tonight

Una:
Beats are flowing, looks you're throwing
Get the fire up inside of me
Ain't no stopping when I lock in
Boy it's on if you can stand the heat

'Cause you turn me, turn me right here, right now
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
I can work you baby, I'll show you how
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Mollie:
Beats are flowing when I lock

Una (Vanessa):
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
(I'm gonna move on you, move on you)
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
(I'm gonna move on you, move on you)

'Cause you turn me, turn me right here, right now
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
I can work you baby, I'll show you how
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

Vanessa:
When the lights go down
