[Intro: Vanessa]
Blow my mind, DJ blow my mind, come on
Blow my mind, DJ blow my mind

[Verse 1]
I put my head against the speakers
Singing blow my mind, DJ blow my mind
I put my head to the speakers
Singing blow my mind, D-DJ blow my mind

[Hook/Chorus: All]
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive

[Verse 2: Rochelle]
We make the party super naughty
Dancing on the bar, we're dancing on the bar
We make the party super naughty
Dancing on the bar, d-dancing on the bar

[Pre-Chorus: Una & Mollie]
(We're all) animal, (We're all) animal
Animal, animal-mal-mal-mal-mal
(We're all) animal, (We're all) animal
So get your claws out, get your, get your claws out

[Hook/Chorus: All]
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive
All fired up, I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive

[Verse 3: Frankie]
We're so close to the edge of desire
Feel so hot, hot, got that fire
We're so close to the edge of desire
Feel so hot, hot, got that fire

[Mollie]
We're so close to the edge of desire
Feel so hot, hot, got that fire
We're so close to the edge of desire

[Vanessa]
Blow my mind, DJ blow my mind, I put my
Blow my mind, DJ blow my mind

I put my head against the speakers
Singing blow my mind, DJ blow my mind
I put my head to the speakers
Singing blow my mind, D-DJ blow my mind

So keep me on your radar
Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar
Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar (All fired up, I feel alive)
Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar (All fired up, I feel alive)

Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar (All fired up, I feel alive)
Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar (All fired up, I feel alive)
Keep me, keep me, keep me on your radar (All fired up, I feel alive)
