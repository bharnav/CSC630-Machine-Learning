[Verse 1]
The sun goes down and that's the time that it hurts so bad
I feel the weight of the love we had
I can't move on without you and I've lost myself
You're like a habit that I can't help

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't hide from this feeling
Don't you know?

[Chorus]
I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore
And I can't let it go and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
You're still my last call

[Verse 2]
We don't change, we still talk every single day
Even though there's nothing much left to say
Ooh, and I have tried all that I can but I can't break free
There's no denying you're a part of me that I can't throw away, oh

[Chorus]
I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore
And I can't let it go and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
And you're still my last call
You're still my last call, oh woah

[Bridge]
The last thing I do
The last thing I say
The last thing I do

The last thing I do
The last thing I say
The last thing I do

Is hear your voice say "I love you"

[Chorus]
I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore
And I can't let it go and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
You're still my last call
You're still my last call
