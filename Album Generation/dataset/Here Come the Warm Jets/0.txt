Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long glance and you go
Oh oh oh

Goes to show
How winds blow
The weather's fine and I feel so so-so

Birds of prey
With too much to say
Oh what could be my destiny, another rainy day?

Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more needles in the camel's eye

Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long glance and you go
Oh oh oh oh oh

Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more needles in the camel's eye
