[Verse 1]
Let's get it straight
Let's get it straight from the top
You're beginning with your usual main ingredient
You're good at talking
When you say it, are you meaning it?
I don't wanna give you my heart
If you're not completing it
I'm blown away at how your family
Your friends just accept it though
No one's ever told you no
Can't expect you to know how to love
When it was somethin' you were never taught

[Chorus]
But honesty is the one true way to start again
Just be good to yourself, and love goes unspoken
Instead of always broken
But honestly, when your heart decides to let someone in
Just be cautious of the next one

[Verse 2]
You win
I never wanted to play what was meant to screw me up
But I see you're into playing it
Makes me feel sorry for the way you like displaying it
Now the truth is really told, you are betraying it
I gotta say, I don't think I ever felt you hold us up
Were you embarrassed by me?
Oh, somethin' I'm gonna have to pay for

[Chorus]
But honesty should've been the one true way to start again
Just be straight with yourself, and love goes unspoken
Instead of always broken
But honestly, if your heart decides to feel again
Just be careful of the next one

[Bridge]
How completely let down
How completely let down I feel
How completely in awe
When I can see it all
Now I can see it all

[Chorus]
But honesty could've been the one true way to love again
Just be straight with yourself, and love goes unspoken
Instead of always broken
But honestly, if your heart decides to love again
Just be thankful for the next one
Thankful, thankful, thankful

[Outro]
I'm gonna see it all, I'm gonna see it all
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna keep it up, I'm gonna keep it up
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna see it all, I'm gonna see it all
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna keep it up, I'm gonna keep it up
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna see it all, I'm gonna see it all
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna keep it up, I'm gonna keep it up
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna keep it up, I'm gonna keep it up
I'm gonna keep it up, I'm gonna keep it up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
