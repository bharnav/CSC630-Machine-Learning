Let me start with "I've let you go"
But you don't get it, though
Politely, I've asked you to leave
But still, you follow

It's hard when you're full of heart
When the house you built just falls apart
Well, keep the paint fresh, keep the outside clean
Make sure the neighbors see you wear that ring
Don't tell them a thing, they don't know you like me

You're the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
Everybody stop, wait, look, see
You're the girl that could lie to my face
And fabricate a flood to get through to me
I went away and you found a replacement
So call him, don't call me
To the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
You drama everything

I heard a good friend once say
"You got one life, live it, 'cause they'll take it away"
From both of us, one day, you know they will
So colour it up, colour it up
Say your last goodbye, I don't give a fuck
Bottoms up, just watch me walk away

I'm here to say that -
I don't need your sorry dreaming
What makes you think you can -
Tell me how I to feel, or how hard I should fall?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, now you listen

Oh my, you're not anything I need in my life
No, you're not anything I even want
'Cause they don't know you like me

You're the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
Everybody stop, wait, look, see
You're the girl that could lie to my face
And fabricate a flood to get through to me
I went away and you found a replacement
So call him, don't call me
To the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
You drama everything

Here's what you gotta do:

Hold your head high
Shoot first, man, don't ask why
Yeah, you won't feel the pain at all
Well, I guess I grew this mind
I think for myself and I'm fine
No, I don't need anything from you at all
They don't know you like me

You're the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
Everybody stop, wait, look, see
You're the girl that could lie to my face
And fabricate a flood to get through to me
I went away and you found a replacement
So call him, don't call me
To the girl that cries, "Water in the basement"
You drama everything

(Fabricate a flood to get through to me)
(So call him, don't call me)

You drama everything
Drama
So much drama
