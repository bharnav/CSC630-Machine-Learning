Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh

Take my hand
Maybe we should run away
Maybe we should disappear
Leave everything behind
Like the useless things
Boxes labeled memories
The sudden health emergencies
Yeah, we could leave those things behind

Show me, show me arms that reach for all we can be
Through understanding, I tried forgiveness
I faced the past, it's what I witnessed

Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you?
I only hear your words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
You can catch me if you wanted to, oh

Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh

Now, why you gotta say goodbye
When you know you could've come with me?
No, can't afford to leave and stay
You're gonna have to just build one way

So tell me, tell me all the things you told me we could be
Through understanding, I tried forgiveness
I faced the facts, it's what I witnessed

Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you?
I only hear your words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
You can catch me if you wanted to
I only feel the chills when I'm with you
I feel like I'm so high, I'm feeling so high
C-catch me, c-c-catch me

Why does a heart always have to break?
(When you're trying way too hard), have to break
(Yes, she'll see right though you), have to break
Oh communication, yeah, conversation
It breaks down
Now there will be nothing to talk about
(Absolutely nothing, just blah blah blah)

Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh

Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you?
I only hear your words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
You can catch me if you wanted to
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Whoa-ah-oh ah-ah-oh
Can catch me, c-c-catch me
Oh
