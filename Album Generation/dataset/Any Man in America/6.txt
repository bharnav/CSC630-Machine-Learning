No joke, took a breath and then awoke
I was standing in an airport, looking like a joke
Saying "Sir, can you help me? Ma'am, could you please?"
So they led me to the payphone, flaggin' down the police

"Mr. Officer, I know who I am, but the rest of me
My memory, I just don't understand
I do know that I'm unsafe, man with a plan
Of gettin' on a plane, fly away to kill a man"

Like a freight train, threat to myself
I gotta history of blackouts, bad mental health so…
Both cops, each arm alarm
No harm, disarm, pat down, do the body check

Next thing, I was walking on the airfield
Backseat, I was headed to the hospital
I’m sorry for the drama that I bring
Through the screen he said, "Son, you did the right thing"

Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you can stand with your dick in your hand
Why you acting like a pussy, man?
Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you can stand with your dick in your hand
You acting like a pussy, man

I was faithful to the wifey, now we separated
Used to try to win her back, I underestimated
Like a stone sinks down into the complicated fact
That you gave that ass up and never fucking dated

See, you're better than that
You're a diamond, he's a rough real tough man
Call a brother back
Just a pussy with a dick, stand up and be a fucking man
Hiding from the husband, scared to make a peep and
Livin' up in Lincoln, now I'm in the deep end
Think I'm gonna break in, smash your fucking face in
Cut you up with lemon juice and watch you try to fuck then

Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you stand with your dick in your hand
Why you acting like a pussy, man?
Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you stand with your dick in your hand
Acting like a pussy, man

Is that beat up...is that beat up yet?
(Please help me understand)
(Why can't talk man to man)
Is that beat up...is that beat up yet?

I wish that I were man enough to turn my back and leave
To forget all the tricks you pull, and hide them in my sleeve
I know what's best for table play, I know what's best for me
I know this life is way too short to let you kill a dream

I know you're capable to only love me when I’m there
I know it's hell to keep the peace inside your heart and head
But I'm always gone and what you're left with is my song
You're sick of listening to anything turn me off instead

You used to call me cool, believed in what I'd say
Never seen me as a failure or a motherfucking fake
But over time, we changed into this little ball of hate
We shared a bedroom, but the bedroom had a bed we never made
So I'm done with holding this in, I'm done with being a friend
I'd like it all to just end, like brand new ink on a pen
No one can stop me, try to stop me
Just try to stop me

Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you stand with your dick in your hand
You're acting like a pussy, man
Please help me understand
Why you can't talk man to man
But you can stand, limp dick in your hand
You're acting like a pussy, man
