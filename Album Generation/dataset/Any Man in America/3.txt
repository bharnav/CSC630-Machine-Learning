(Come here... babe, why are you crying?
"Because I want to stay with you"
Your mommy loves you very much)

Communication
I wait to see if we could ever get together and talk like we used to
We get together and we talk
Like we used to, but you don't want to

You want a separation
And now that's strike three
I tried everything, I work so hard for you
To constantly hear how I fail and abandon you

I put my heart in a dream (My heart)
And now that dream, it makes sure the baby
She has food to eat
And your fancy house gets paid for, you hear me?

You never learned one thing
No, you never believed in me
So if you're gonna leave, get out
Just remember this is what I'm all about:

I do it for the love, I do it for the rain
I do it for the passion, I do it for the pain
I do it for the rush, I do it for the doubt
I do it for my daughter, man, 'cause she's what I'm about
I do it for my mom, I do it for my dad
Do it for my sanity, it's hanging from a thread
I do it for the audience who understands the need
Standing on the stage, cut the shit and let it bleed

So pack it up, pack it in, write it up, write it down
Just remember that I've told you, it's what I'm all about
(Wait-wait-wait...)

I missed the tour where you told me not to come home again
An ex-boyfriend was taking my place at our first Lamaze
(You've gotta be kidding me)

How hard that was because
'Cause your voice so crooked and wrong
You bury your intentions like a motherfucking nuclear bomb (Nuclear bomb!)

I lived in a hotel room 'til the day she was born
And I never knew what words to say
That could get us through our first chance at divorce
You promised change and I believed
I walked right back into the same
So if you're gonna leave me, go away

I do it for the love, I do it for the rain
I do it for the passion, I do it for the pain
I do it for the rush, I do it for the doubt
I do it for my daughter, man, 'cause she's what I'm about
I do it for my mom, I do it for my dad
Do it for my sanity, it's hanging from a thread
I do it for the audience who understands the need
Standing on the stage, cut the shit and let it bleed

I do it for my brother, I do it for his wife
I do it for my manager, 'cause God, he saved my life
I do it for the confidence, I do it for release
I do it 'cause I'm sick of feeling sadness, full of peace
I do it for the sunshine, for my friends
I did it for you, for you over and over and over again
But you would never understand, so fuck it!

So pack it up, pack it in, write it up, write it down
Just remember that I've told you, it's what I'm all about
(Get out! Go away!)

I do it for the love, I do it for the rain
I do it for the passion, I do it for the pain
I do it for the rush, I do it for the doubt
I do it for my daughter, man, 'cause she's what I'm about
I do it for my mom, I do it for my dad
Do it for my sanity, it's hanging from a thread
I do it for the audience who understands the need
Standing on the stage, cut the shit and let it bleed

I do it for the love, for the love
Do it for the love, for the love
I do it for the love, do it, do it, do it
For the love, for my daughter

So pack it up, pack it in, write it up, write it down
Just remember that I've told you, it's what I'm all about
