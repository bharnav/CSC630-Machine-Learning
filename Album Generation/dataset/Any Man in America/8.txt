("If you think your marriage is so great, why the fuck are you turning to other people's wives for comfort? "
"Can... can I tell you what, what was going on here? "
"Yeah, please do.")

Did he really get to take you home?
I'm surprised that you chose him
Surprised that I'm not in a halfway home
I'm not surprised I never saw you around
When they brought me home

So who does this separation work for?
So which one of us will wage war, war?
It's not about the feelings that we shared before, no
'Cause your words don't calm anymore, no more
What did you want me for?

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

And did you really think I'd take it?
When information fabricated
Look, I give you credit for pathetically thinking
That you could make this up, watch this
She turns about face
He stays in her house, invading your space
Helpless, you know that I'm away
A mac truck sitting in a hotel, crazy
Red light on the phone
Blinking like it's telling me
There's something wrong or right, you don't
I need to know

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too-
Yeah, you waited too long

This is urgent
Call 'em emergencies
I don't know how to stop 'em
More cap-gun than a pistol
You fill your clip with lies
Then load each one and fire right over my head

I need a finish line, this pressure's too high
I should have seen the end was coming sooner than I ever did
Reached down to the pit of my soul
I found things that I didn't wanna know were there
I guess the wait is over

Oh, how do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

Oh, how do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long
