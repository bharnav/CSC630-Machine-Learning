Pride, it leaves you hollow
Another attempt just to settle the score
A war, you know, the one you built it up
It's real defining; humiliation
Oh, it knocks at your door (at your door, oh)

When you say I blow up, I say you cave in
We never found the line between the real and pretend
You know you should accept it: this is really the end
I know for sure, it's what i have to do
Is follow through

And you were everything I'll ever want to be
The only one I ever need to know
I'd wait for you 'til time lay down to sleep
And I'd sneak across the world to let her know

Yeah, that's what I do; yeah, I follow through
Oh, I follow through, oh, and here I stand

Yeah, I'm too close but still you're far away
You never tried but I did
And we still remain divided

Oh, I can't believe that your heart's still beating
It's beating for me at all
How sad of you, oh, but I'm not
I'm not sad at all

When you say I blow up, I say you cave in
We never found the line between the real and pretend
You know you should accept it: this is really the end
I know for sure, it's what i have to do
Is follow through

And you were everything I'll ever want to be
The only one I ever need to know
I'd wait for you 'til time lay down to sleep
And I'd sneak across the world to let her know

Yeah, and as it falls down into night. we run away
And once again divided
But each one knows just what we have to do
We do, we have to follow through

I will lay down my heart, I will let you go
That's what's best for us all
('Cause now we stand beneath the clouds and God above)
I will lay down my heart, I will let you go
(Like we did before)
That's what's best for us all
(But this time, for her, I'll follow through)

You're everything I ever want to be
The only thing I ever need to know
I'd wait for you 'til time lay down to sleep
And I'd sneak across the world to let her know

Hold my heart, patiently
And take my hand, yeah, walk with me
'Cause when the evening comes
We'll set the world on fire
And I was wrong
Let me help you live on

And you were everything I ever want to be
The only one I ever need to know
I'd wait for you 'til time lay down to sleep
Yeah, and I'd sneak across the world to let her know

Yeah, and as it falls down into night, we run away
And once again divided
But each one knows just what we have to do
We do, we have to follow through

(Hold my heart, patiently
And take my hand, yeah, walk with me)
'Cause when the evening comes
We'll set the world on fire
And I was wrong
Let me help you live on
