I'm standin' on an open world
I've gotta try so hard for myself
Not including the ones that I love
I call my family

It's not hard when your focus is a beautiful girl
A brand new baby, she's a baby girl
And yes, she is a cutie like her mommy
She looks like her mommy

We both know who we are
And I'm not changing a thing
I've never changed before
If lovin' me is work, I'm not a job to take
I think we're headin' for the crazy-making heartbreak

I'm wonderin' why I'm sittin' here, alone again
Why you always crush me
Why it's never easy
Easy, easy, easy, it's not easy

This is you, this is me
You won't be a part of what we need to be
Not for me, for the future of us three
For our daughter, college, family, sudden health emergencies
You think it's easy, pickin' money off my Money Tree?

With two houses, both cars
I paid off your fucking credit card debt
Did you already forget? Huh?
You threaten, threaten, threaten, threaten, threaten, huh
Just fucking leave
Find a man who will put up with this shit

We both know who we are
And I'm not changing a thing
I've never changed before
If lovin' me is work, I'm not a job to take
I think we're headin' for the crazy-making heartbreak

I can't help but think
Of how good you are with our baby daughter
Half the time a single mother
When I go away, it's so that you can always stay home
And watch your baby grow, bring her up the right way
(You never take it that way)

We both know who we are
And I'm not changing -

I need support, not a slap in the face
You have to trust me, or I'm sure this will blow up in your face
Our love was such an angel, she doesn't even know
We've torn each other down in ways we don't even know

We both know who we are
And I'm not changing a thing
I've never changed before
If lovin' me is work, I'm not a job to take
I think we're headin' for the crazy-making heartbreak

I can't help but think
Of how good you are with our baby daughter
Half the time a single mother
When I go away, it's so that you can always stay home
And watch your baby grow, bring her up the right way

It's me, the one who has his family's future at heart
It's you, the one who never wants a family apart
We both know that together we can only believe
That if we cut the shit, there'd be no reason to leave
