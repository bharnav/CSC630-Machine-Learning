I'll Come Flying Through Your Door
And You'll Know What Love Is For
L'm A Bluebird, I'm A Bluebird
I'm A Bluebird, L'm A Bluebird
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I'm A Bluebird, I'm A Bluebird
I'm A Bluebird
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Touch Your Lips With A Magic Kiss
And You'll Be A Bluebird Too
And You'll Know What Love Can Do
L'm A Bluebird, I'm A Bluebird
L'm A Bluebird, L'm A Bluebird
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Fly Away Through The Midnight Air
As We Head Across The Sea
And At Last We Will Be Free

All Alone On A Desert Island
We're Living In The Trees
And We're Flying In The Breeze
