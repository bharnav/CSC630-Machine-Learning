[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning with a head like 'What ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I play along when I hear that favorite song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better know when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like magic's solely yours tonight

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

[Hook]
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you...

[Verse 2]
Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

[Hook]
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you...

[Bridge]
You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light...

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

[Hook]
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you...
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you...
