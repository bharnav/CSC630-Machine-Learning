That's better now, much better now
It's easy lying here, through all that sweat
Did I forget, how much I love you dear

The tensions all been released
We're slumbering now in peace
So yes, somehow, it's better now

I feel it clear in my mind
It seems to work every time

That's better now, much better now
It's easy lying here, through all that sweat
Did I forget, how much I love you dear

I feel it clear in my mind
It seems to work every time
So yes, somehow, it's better now
