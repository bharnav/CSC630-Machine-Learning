Last night picture of flouted desire
Is broken, defeated, he’s lost all his fire

He knows she won’t take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she can’t take him back
Aww, he just can’t face the fact

Last night champion of violent emotion
Has canceled a decade of tender devotion

He knows she won’t take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she can’t take him back
Aww, he just can’t face the fact

Such a way to end
Such a tragedy
Such a waste, waste

Last night picture of flouted desire
Is broken, defeated, he’s lost all his fire

He knows she won’t take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she can’t take him back
No matter how much he tells her he loves her

He knows she can’t take him back
Ahh, he just can’t face the fact

Yeah, Yeah (X 30)
