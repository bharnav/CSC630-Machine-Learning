Her parents are of low wit
But she's brighter than them, She's brighter than them
Spills her words like a poet
She's brighter than them, She's brighter than them

All the men I know agree
She's the finest thing you'll see
But they don't really know it
Cause I'm righter than them
I'm righter than them
I'm righter, righter

Right there in her demeanor
You can feel her soul coming over in waves
Dirtier and cleaner
Than the kind of soul that Jesus saves
What's the matter with this girl
She could claim the whole wide world
But she thinks that obscener
Cause she's brighter than me, She's brighter than me
She's brighter, righter

Watch her face, look at her eyes
She was born to shame the dawn and the sunrise

Watch her face, look at those eyes
She was born to shame the dawn and the sunrise

Her parents are of low wit
But she's brighter than them, She's brighter than them
Spills her words like a poet
She's brighter than them, Much brighter than them

All the men I know agree
She's the finest thing you'll see
But they don't really know it
Cause I'm righter than them, I'm righter than them
She's brighter, brighter
