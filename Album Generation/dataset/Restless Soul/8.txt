I couldn't see, what I once saw
In your lovely face, once your lovely face
Became common place

And the eyes, that I liked
Seemed to lose their shine
As they passed through time
Till they looked like mine

But then last night, I heard your voice
I rubbed my eyes and there and then
That fine baby with and arrow
Stupid cupid struck again

I'd forgotten, every reason
Why I said, "I do"
But now I see what I saw in you

Oh, last night I heard your voice
I rubbed my eyes and there and then
That fine baby with and arrow
Stupid cupid struck again

I'd forgotten, every reason
Why I said, "I do"
But now I see what I saw in you
Oh, now I see what I saw in you
