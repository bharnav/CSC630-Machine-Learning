Hey!
Everyday I try not to lie
But I lie, and you’re the reason why
Everyday I try not to see
That you’re my favorite female company
Everyday I try to regret
The way that I feel, But I can’t do it yet

Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try and everyday I fail

Everyday I try to respect
All the things that all night I reject
Everyday I kid myself on
That today’s the day when I’ll be strong
Everyday the truth closes in
And I know for sure that I can never win

Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try and everyday I fail

Well the people all agree
That the truth will set you free
And they tell you to love it
Till the truth has them in chains
And a lie would cause less pain
Then you know you can shove it
Shove it

Everyday I try to regret
The way that I feel, But I can’t do it yet

Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try not to lie
Everyday I try and everyday I fail
Everyday I try and everyday I fail
