My jokes don't work any more
I must have told you that one before
Cause you're turning away, turning away, turning away

You come and go as you please
I don't make you weak at the knees
When you're turning away, turning away, turning away

Some love affairs build a love
That lasts for a lifetime
Some love affairs fire a hate
That never burns out
This love affair is dead
Because you are in indifferent
You won't say it
But I am left in no doubt

You used to say what you meant
But now you ooze contempt
When you're turning away, turning away, turning away

Some love affairs build a love
That lasts for a lifetime
Some love affairs fire a hate
That never burns out
This love affair is dead
Because you are in indifferent
You won't say it
But I am left in no doubt

My jokes don't work any more
I must have told you that one before
Cause you're turning away, turning away, turning away
Turning away, turning, turning away etc...
