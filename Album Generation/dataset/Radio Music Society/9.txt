You just walked in to the quiet quiet after the stars, yes
It's such... silent, and you sense that something's wrong
Hmmm something's surely wrong!
And you saw the letter, the keys laying on the counter
But you know just what it means, and grab the phone to call her

Now is this another awful good threat
She made cool jokes, or she made good these threats to finally leave you
Tears roll up in your eyes which you... won't let you cry, and finally

Chorus:
She's gone, bye, bye so long
Let her
She's gone, bye bye so long!
Love goes on!

Apartment stripped in silence
Still you hear each... make up
And all those crazy ways you forgive ... loved you
Now that you're all alone
You realize she filled your life with litter
Her kisses used to thrill
Now the after taste is bitter
With the memories from the mess you've endured when...

Chorus:
She's gone, bye, bye so long
Let her
She's gone, bye bye so long!
Love goes on!
