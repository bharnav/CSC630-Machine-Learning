The sounds of the city
Somehow they comfort me
On lonely mornings like this
Is someone out there like me
Walking their own lonely street
Walking their own lonely street
The sounds of the city
Somehow they comfort me
On lonely mornings like this
This emptiness inside
Loneliness i fear
In this pain i'm not alone
In this city that is my home [x3]
Woah Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Woahh
One lonely heart
Reaching out to you
Want's strength to see us through
And yell together
This one goes out to you!!!
We are not alone
In this city that is our home [x5]
