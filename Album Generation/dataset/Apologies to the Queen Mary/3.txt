[Dan Boeckner]
At the party we got chained at the wrists
Outside thereâ€™s girls saying falling bricks
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit

[Spencer Krug]
I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
Bad things happen in the night

[Dan Boeckner]
Where we built another world
Styles surround you here comes the night time
Where we built another world
Evening time

[Dan Boeckner]
I made a loud sound and shake some teeth
Outside the lights pale across the street
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit

[Spencer Krug]
I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
Bad things happen in the night

[Dan Boeckner]
Where we built another world
Styles surround you here comes the night time
Where we built another world
Evening time

[Dan Boeckner]
Where we built another world
Hang ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Hang ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Here comes the night time
