[Verse 1]
You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said, "Pretend it's whales a-keeping their voices down"
Such were the grounds for divorce, I know

[Verse 2]
On the radio and the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Said, "Look at the clouds, it's a show all on its own"
Such were the grounds for divorce, I know

[Bridge 1]
But the darling is dead
We hit it on the head
It looked like a wedding cake

But the darling is dead
We hit it on the head
It looked like a newlywed

[Bridge 2]
But I look at the lovers and the way they stand
And the way they move and the way move their hands
And look at their babies and their tiny little hands
And the way they get loved and the way they get loved, oh
Oh, look at the lovers and the way they stand
And the way they move and the way they move and the way move their hands

[Verse 1]
You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said, "Pretend it's whales a-keeping their voices down"
Such were the grounds for divorce, I know

[Interlude]
Looked like a newlywed

[Verse 2]
On the radio and the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Said, "Look at the clouds, it's a show all on its own"
Such were the grounds such were the grounds for divorce, I know
