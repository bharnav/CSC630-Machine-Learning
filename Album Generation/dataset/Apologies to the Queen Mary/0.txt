[Verse 1]
I got a number on me, I got a number
Won't make it through the high noon sun
I am my father's son
I am my father's son
His bed is made
I was a hero early in the morning
I ain't no hero in the night

[Verse 2]
I am my father's son
And I'll build a house inside of you
I'll go in through the mouth
I'll draw three figures on your heart
One of them will be me as a boy
One of them will be me
One of them will be me watching you run
Watching you run into the high noon sun
Watching you run farther than guns will go
You are a runner with a stolen voice
And you are a runner and I am my father's son
