I won't forget that day
I won't forget her name
What has hell done to her
Her pain's flowing in my blackened soul's veins

Libera animas
Omnium defunctorum
De poenis inferni
Ne cadant
Ne cadant in obscurum

Libera animas
De poenis inferni

Cold frozen night
(Bleeding sins and lies)
Nocturnal rhyme
(Of unholy pride)

Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!)
Storm the gates of hell!

May you be the one
The everlasting flame of hope
Glorify the angels
And fight their holy war
Let me face the beast
And every single devil's son
I will free my mind
And I will save her soul

Many don't realize
What it's capable of
What "evil" really is
Far beyond its meaning as a mere word

Requiem aeternam
Dona eis, Domine
Requiem aeternam
Lux perpetua
Lux luceat eis

Requiem aeternam
Dona eis, Domine

Her lovely smile
(Brutalized and raped!)
Her crystal eyes
(She won't see anymore!)

Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!)
Storm the gates of hell!

May you be the one
The everlasting flame of hope
Glorify the angels
And fight their holy war
Let me face the beast
And every single devil's son
I will free my mind
And I will save her soul

Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!)
Storm the gates of hell!

May you be the one
The everlasting flame of hope
Glorify the angels
And fight their holy war
Let me face the beast
And every single devil's son
I will free my mind
And I will save her soul
(3x)

Why youâ€¦ why?
I will free you!
