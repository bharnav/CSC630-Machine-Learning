To many vultures buzzing round. (nan naaa na nana)
They don't even wait see if we get in the ground. (nan naaa na nana)
They over the victim like a gun. (nan naaa na nana)
Running this world on danger signs

It's all bittersweet
It's all bittersweet
Now everydays like you feeling love
And you just gotta let it go, Let it go

Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!
Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day
Take your life!

Trying to start anew again
Diamonds and a girl i never seen
Heavy hearts and blistered hands
Not even death can spoil my pain

It's all bittersweet
It's all bittersweet
Now everydays like you feeling love
And you just gotta let it go, let it go

Want some of that power?
Want some of that power?

Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!
Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day
Take your life!

[low voice singing]

I am not forsaken it!
Both fucked up we are breaking it!
Hands up now we are making it!
Washed up for faking it!
I! [x16]
No we are not forsaking it!
Walls break down we are breaking it!
Answer now we are making it!
Oooooohooooooo let it go oooooohh

Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!
Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!
Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!
Want some of that power
Take your life, back
Take your life!

One other day, one other done day
Take your life!
One other day, one other done day
Take your life!
