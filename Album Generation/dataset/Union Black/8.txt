Tune so good you gotta play this twice man
Badman ah Badman

Four of us on the stage and we don't want no war
We're bringing vibes and rocking for sure
Hyping up the crowd
We get the place crazy
Why?
We're bringing it

Someone said to me that there just ain't nothing like it
The way we get the room to unite
Sonic algamation making worlds dem collide
Why?
Skindred are bringing it

The reason why I'm telling you
I believe it
Now can I get a witness who means it
So completely from the heart now
And they've seen

The way we make it lively
Live

Dem pon a mission to rock the whole place

The way we make it lively
