Enough of them running it bow
Enough of them running it now
Enough of them running it bow
Enough of them, well

Well you know say that we come
We come to get the job done
We step in hot like the sun
An while erase everyone
I'll knock you right of your feet
And I'll get you out of your seat
I'll slap the black off your skin
Don't need no reason

Don't waste your time talking to me, I CONTROL
Don't waste your time begging to me, I CONTROL

Coz I'm gunner own you (Own you)
Totally control you (Own you)
Yes I'm gunner own you (Own you)
Defile and disown you

Control your soul, control your soul
Control your soul, control your soul

Right, this is the rise and fall
I'll take the weak and the small
I and I will come crush them all
So you will hear when I call
This is the spot, it's the place
With all the flesh you can taste
I'll slap the white off your skin
Don't need no reason

Don't waste your time talking to me, I CONTROL
Don't waste your time begging to me, I CONTROL

Coz I'm gunner own you, own you
Totally control you, own you
Yes I'm gunner own you, own you
Defile and disown you

Control your soul, control your soul
Control your soul, control your soul

Own you
Own you
Own you
Own you
Own you
Own you
Own you

Coz I'm gunner own you (I'm gunner own you)
Totally control you (Totally control you)
Yes I'm gunner own you (I'm gunner own you)
Defile and disown you (Totally control you)

Control your soul, control your soul
Control your soul, control your soul
