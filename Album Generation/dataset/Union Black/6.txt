Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their life count?

If you got breath, then you're part of it
Sometimes like a maze, you get lost in it
The bed you make, you better lay in it
If you don't try, you'll never know
The living dead don't say a lot
And if you don't roll the dice you'll never lose a lot
Put it off today and say you'll do it again
But what are you all waiting for?

Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their-
And live it everyday
Everything will work out that way
You hear what I say

I know you're able to hit the spot
If you crack this safe you can take the lot
From oranges you can't make lemonade
But you know some fools, they always try
Look at your life, are you satisfied?
Can you really take the pain that you hide inside?
Living in a glass house throwing bricks
So what's inside is all on show

Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Gonna make their life count?
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their
Who's gonna make their-
And live it everyday
You gotta make it happen and do it your way
And live it everyday
Everything will work out that way
You hear what I say

So stand up and be counted
Make them know that
Who's gonna make their mark
And who's gonna make them
This is a competition
So you got to make a decision
So uno get on your marks
And get set
And get ready
And go

I'm gonna make my mark
Mark my mark
Make my mark
Make my mark
SAY IT!
[Repeat]

And live it everyday
You gotta make it happen and do it your way
And live it everyday
Everything will work out that way
You hear what I say

Live it
Live it
[Repeat]
