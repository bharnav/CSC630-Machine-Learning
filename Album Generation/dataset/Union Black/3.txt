Yo, you're not real, you're fake
Running your mouth, but you made a mistake
I see through you, like a pane of glass
One shot of trouble and you're out like 'ras'
Screaming about I'm not into this, bless
I never really wanna get into this mess
You were goin on like you're a gangster
When you were the first to run outta here
You got a real fake tan goin on luv
Why you talkin like you're black then for bruv
There's a perfect storm comin on like Pinocchio
Your nose it just grew...
Faking and frauding, I do believe mans talking
Real life gets boring, the truth we're all distorting

Don't ever tell no one cos it's a secret
And if they find out I know I never leaked it
A crippled broken soul means to an ending
A thousand million of us just pretending
Living a lie still
Living a lie
Living a lie
I know what you are!

Who gets caught in a relationship
Where they can't go out and they're pussy whipped
All I wanted was a one night stand
Not worries with a woman who's spending grands
This was not supposed to be me
Caught in a place where I don't wanna be
Fucked now, that's my reality
There's too many people dem are sleeping with the enemy
So what the fuck do you stay with him for mum
But that's the way your dad's always been son
Too much of this shit going on
And I can't tell who's faking and frauding
I do believe man's talking
Real life gets boring, the truth we're all distorting

Don't ever tell no one cos it's a secret
And if they find out I know I never leaked it
A crippled broken soul means to an ending
A thousand million of us just pretending
Living a lie still
Living a lie
Living a lie
I know what you are!

You're a fucking liar!
You're a fucking liar!
You're a fucking liar!
You're a fucking liar!
You're a fucking liar!
You're a fu-fu liar!
You're a fucking liar!

Don't ever tell no one cos it's a secret
And if they find out I know I never leaked it
A crippled broken soul means to an ending
A thousand million of us just pretending
Living a lie still
Living a lie
Living a lie
