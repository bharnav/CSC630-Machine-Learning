[Verse 1 - Benji Webbe]
A bare vexation ah' run through my brain (right)
Yes I'm bex with all of dem again
The way how I'm feelin', I cannot refrain
I wanna tell dem so I'll tell dem right now
It don't work when I count up to ten
'Cause I still wanna blast at all of dem again
I try to exorcise the demons
But I still get mad like riot, riot!

[Pre-Chorus - Benjie Webbe]
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning

[Chorus]
Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

[Post-Chorus - Jacoby Shaddix]
You better tread lightly
You better back down
I feel it igniting
I'm losing it now

You better tread lightly...

[Verse 2 - Jacoby Shaddix, Benji Webbe]
Well anger management
Is what they are needin'
'Cause bones getting broken
And noses are bleedin'
Dem da ting we don't need right now
So dress back for me fuse it blow
If me see red the whole place will know-ah
You better warn them and let them know

[Pre-Chorus - Benjie Webbe]
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning

[Chorus - Benjie Webbe]
Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

[Post-Chorus - Jacoby Shaddix]
You better tread lightly
You better back down
I feel it igniting
I'm losing it now
You better tread lightly
You better back down
I feel it igniting
I'm losing it now

And right about now we're gonna show a little anger

[Pre-Chorus - Benjie Webbe]
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning-ah
Warning, warning, warning, warning

[Chorus - Benjie Webbe]
Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

Warning, warning, warning, warning
Don't wake the lion, a dangerous ting
Warning, warning, warning, warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

[Outro]
Warning
It's dangerous, dangerous
Warning
It's dangerous, dangerous

Dangerous!
