Noone can do this alone!
I wanna trade this dirty hat for a crown
Inside my shoe there's a stone
And were it came from nobody knows
Now this is a mission (yeah yeah)
Suffer these decisions (yeah yeah)
Still with all i'm saying time will tell

Were stepping up and we ah go really let them know
We are the champions victorious right now
You play the game, the aim to win, to wipe the smile right off ya face
For he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day!
Game over! pass the controller
Game over! pass the controller
Your done dead already and you got to move over

I know i gotta do this alone,I wanna be tha king that sits on the throne!
You can't get blood from a stone,gravity's gunner keep us all on da ground
I ain't in submission now suffer your decisions
Still with all i'm saying time will tell

Were stepping up and we ah go really let them know
We are the champion victorious right now suffer with decisions
You play the game the aim to win, to wipe the smile right off ya face
For he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day!
Game over! pass the controller

Your done dead already and you got to move over
