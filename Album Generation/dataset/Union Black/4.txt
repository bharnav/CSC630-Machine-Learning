Now people, certain people dem a deal with the guns and the crack and coke and dem ting der you see
We got no respect and we no response fe dat seen Skindred sound, Union Black
Bring it, right

Every day another shot goes bang
You've got to know, and got to understand
Every day another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Now everyday you see the sun come up
Another chance to go and show some love
And everyday another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Oh yer!

Union Black radio station, bringing music to the people
Dem hear this community oh yer!

Guntalk, in the neighbourhood
And the bad youths dem ain't up to no good
Wanna be gangsters in addy community
Making life hard for you and me
You see the rudie, him ah fire him shot
When him lick a shot you know ah you get drop
That's the way it is, and it ain't no good
We could live much better in this neighbourhood...

Every day another shot goes bang
You've got to know, and got to understand
Every day another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Another chance to go and show some love
And everyday another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Well well well well well well wella well well well
Coz we no want them kinda ting in addy neighbourhood
Well well well well well well wella well well well

Guns are blazing, like in the old wild west
Youths are saving up to buy a bullet proof vest
Watch the bad mans, dem no care about you
Quick to draw a gun and that's the end of your crew
This is crazy, how they want to live
Everybody wants revenge and no-one wants to forgive
For territory, they will end your life
There's so much drama, daily strife!

Every day another shot goes bang
You've got to know, and got to understand
Every day another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Now everyday you see the sun come up
Another chance to go and show some love
And everyday another youth gets drop
And I and I we just ain't down with that

Oh yeah

Every day another shot goes bang
Every day another youth gets drop
Every day another shot goes bang
Every day another youth gets drop
Every day another shot goes bang
Every day another youth gets drop
