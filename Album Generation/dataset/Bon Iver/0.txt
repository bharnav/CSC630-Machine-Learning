[Verse 1]
Iâ€™m tearing up
Across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake
I'm raised of make

[Chorus]
Still alive, you who love
Still alive, you who love
Still alive, you who love

[Verse 2]
In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, it's pouring; wire it up
You're breaking your ground
