You asked me to write a tune
All about the things that go wrong
And then you asked me to come home soon
To the place where I belong

But you stand on the other side
Of the line in this place
And you can't see me, you are blind
And this you can't fake
No this you can't fake

And sometimes, sometimes I wanna be
I scream that I wanna be anyone but me

And I don't know if I can write about
Chosen walls and the things you feel
And I don't know if I can sing aloud
Closing doors showing you what's real

But I know when I close my eyes
Late at night there's only one thing
The night's shown that she can lie
It's your fight, show me something
Can you show me something?

And sometimes, sometimes I wanna be
I scream that I wanna be anyone but me

What do you want me to say
All I know is love, it's okay
I'll write what I know
And you do the same
Tell me I'm sane

But sometimes, sometimes I wanna be
I scream that I wanna be anyone but me
