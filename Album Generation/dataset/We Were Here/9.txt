What if you could wish me away?
What if you spoke those words today?

I wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone
It's come to this, release me
I'll leave before the dawn

But for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do

What if you could hear this song?
What if I felt like I belong?

I might not be leaving oh so soon
Began the night believing
I loved you in the moonlight

So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do

I could've treated you better, better than this
Well I'm gone
This song's your letter
Can't stay in one place

So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do
