So we're alone again
I wish it were over
We seem to never end
Only get closer
To the point where I can take no more
The clouds in your eyes
Down your face they pour

Won't you be the new one?
Burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
Walk me down your broken line
All you have to do is cry
Yes, all you have to do is cry

Hush, my baby, now
Your talking is just noise and won't lay me down
Amongst your toys in a room where I can take no more
The clouds in your eyes
Down your face they pour

Won't you be the new one?
Burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
Walk me down your broken line
All you have to do is cry
Yes all you have to do is cry

Photographs and brightly colored paper
Are your mask you wear in this caper
That is our life
We walk right into the strife
And a tear from your eye brings me home

Won't you be the new one?
Burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
Walk me down your broken line
All you have to do is cry
