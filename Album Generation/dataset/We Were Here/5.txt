Shoelaces untied
You can dry your eyes
Perfect shadows lie behind us
And this is the day I make you mine

The way your hair lies
Sometimes unrecognized
All the way from Nice, today
On a train
Nothing to say, but there's still time

And you are the one I've been waiting for today
And here comes the sun, it's been baiting morn' today

Lately I've lost my tongue
Today you found a song
Unknown our love has grown
And I thank God you came along

And you are the one I've been waiting for today
And here comes the sun, it's been baiting morn' today

You looked right through me, there was no one else
I sat beside you and became myself today
Today

And you are the one I've been waiting for today
And here comes the sun, it's been baiting morn' today
