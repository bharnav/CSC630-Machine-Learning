Somehow I'm leading someone else's life
I cut a star down with my knife

And right now
I still see the way the moon
Plays this tune
Though our nights died

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

And somehow
I'll make tonight our own
I'll show you every way I've grown
Since I met you

And right now
I'll be the boy in your next song
I'll learn the parts and play along
If you let me

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

If you let me, I'll show the world to you
Yes if you let me, I'll know just what to do

Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes

When I'm lost in your eyes
I see a way for me
