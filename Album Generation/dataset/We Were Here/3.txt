You're Sylvia Plath
As you drift from the bath
I hand you a robe
And so it goes
The moment'll pass

You're Simone de Beauvoir
As you get out the car
The way you read me
No one can see me
Is who you are
And these photographs keep me alive

Babe, here's your song
Babe, it took too long
To find in your eyes
My best surprise

You're Nina Simone
When you talk on the phone
You sing to me
And I'm truly
No longer alone

You're Mary Cassatt
When people tell you you're not
You're like a child
All the while
I need you a lot
And these photographs keep me alive

Babe, here's your song
Babe, it took too long
To find in your eyes
My best surprise

And I wanna know what you know
And I wanna go where you go
These things remind me of
These things remind me of
These things remind me of you

Babe, here's your song
Babe, it took too long
To find in your eyes
My best surprise
