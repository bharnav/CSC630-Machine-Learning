Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire so you can get burned, now
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire, you're gonna get burned

Every time I hear the crack of the whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalized our very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good god, I think it's illiteracy
It's only machine that make money

Slave driver the table is turned

Slave driver the table is turned baby now
Catch a fire so you can get burned baby now
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire so you can get burned

Every time I hear the crack of the whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalized our very souls

Oh god have mercy on our souls
