Can't tell the woman from the man, no I say you can't
Cause they're dressed in the same pollution
Their mind is confused with confusion
With their problems since there's no solution

They become the midnight ravers
Someone say please don't let me down
Midnight ravers, midnight ravers
Please don't let me down, down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I see ten thousand chariots
And they coming without horses
The riders they cover their face
So you couldn't make them out in smokey places

In that musical stampede where everyone's doing their thing
Musical stampede, people swinging
Musical stampede
Some people say ride on
People riding
People ride on
People riding
People ride on
People riding
Midnight Ravers

I can't tell my woman from the man
She is dressed in the same pollution
Her mind is confused with confusion
To her problems seems there's never never no solution

I've become a night-life raver
And I'm begging you please don't let me down
Night-life ravers, night-life raver
Please, please don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I see ten thousand chariots
And they coming without horses yeah
The riders they cover their face
So you couldn't make them out in smokey places

In that musical stampede
Its the musical stampede
Its the musical stampede
Some preacher say
People ride on
People riding
People ride on
People riding
Midnight ravers, ride on
