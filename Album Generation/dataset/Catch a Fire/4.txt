Four hundred years
And it's the same, the same philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years - look how long
And, the people, they still can't see

Why do they fight against
The poor youth of today?
And without these youths
They would be gone, all gone astray

Come on, let's make a move
I can see time, time has come
And, if the fools don't see
I can't save the youth, the youth is gonna be strong

So, won't you come with me?
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live
Live a good good life and be free

Look how long
Four hundred years - way too long
And people, my people, can't see

Said, it's four hundred long years
Give me patience, same philosophy

It's been four hundred years, way so long
How long? four hundred long long years
