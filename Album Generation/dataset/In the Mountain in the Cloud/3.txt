[Verse 1]
I watched the words drip from you
And pour from your mouth like a sieve
I'll end like I did begin
Jump rope the stars in a game

[Pre-Refrain 1]
But you were there too
We spit from the Moon
And found their heads down below

[Refrain]
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all

[Verse 2]
Sad inconsistencies you see
You find yourself lonely
But right next to me

[Pre-Refrain 2]
Well I was there too
Just as lonely as you
We found their heads down below

[Refrain]
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of it at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So, what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?

[Chorus]
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever

[Verse 3]
Many have come before, many have been
Where will we be? When will it end?
Many have come before, many have been
Where will we be?

[Pre-Refrain 1]
You were there too
We spit from the Moon
And found their heads down below

[Refrain]
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So, what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?

[Chorus]
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever

[Chorus]
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever

[Outro]
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll stay warm
