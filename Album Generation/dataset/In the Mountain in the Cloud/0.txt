[Verse 1]
If pain was a color to paint on you
Your heart would be the color blue
Be a gradient from there
Until your body met your hair
Which remained a silver hue

[Verse 2]
You are the one they call Jesus Christ
Who didn't know no rock n' roll
Just a mission, and a gun
To paint rainbows in Vietnam
And a heart that always told you

[Interlude 1]
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all

[Pre-Chorus]
So, who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

[Chorus 1]
They said, every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the police men don't understand
Boys, all you boys, you think it's so American
Girls, all you girls, yeah, you're so American

[Verse 3]
He may not be born of this land
But he was born of this world
He was born of all the mothers
And the colors of our brothers
And the love that was started

[Verse 4]
You by the one they call Jesus Christ
Who may not know no rock n' roll
And there may not be a Heaven
Or a place of which to send you
But you know in the end

[Interlude 2]
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all

[Pre-Chorus]
So, who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

[Chorus 1]
They said, every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the police men don't understand
Boys, all you boys, you think it's so American
Girls, all you girls, yeah, you're so American

[Bridge]
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all

[Chorus 2]
Man, oh man, you think it's so American
Man, oh man, yeah, you're so American
Man, oh man, you think it's so American
Man, oh man, yeah, you're so American

[Outro]
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
