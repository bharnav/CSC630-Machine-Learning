[Verse 1]
This can't be living now
If so then show me how
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away
Wanna love like this love was young
But will I die as I become
Blinded at the bottom of it all?

[Chorus]
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
Got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
I want a world like (The revolution comes)
My teacher taught me it would be (The revolution comes)
I wanna love like
My parents told me it would be

[Verse 2]
When I was born I defied your times
But they were nothing, nothing like mine
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away
Feels like school again
But learning's all right there
Blinded at the bottom of it all

[Chorus]
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
Got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
I want a world like (The revolution comes)
My teacher taught me it would be (The revolution comes)
I wanna love like
My parents told me it would be

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away
This can't be living now
If so then show me how
And we'll find it
At the bottom of it all

[Chorus]
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
Got it all, you got it all, you got it all
'Til the revolution comes
I want a world like (The revolution comes)
My teacher taught me it would be (The revolution comes)
I wanna love like
My parents told me it would be
