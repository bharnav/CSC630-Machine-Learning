[Verse 1]
Of all of us he had to know, he'd never grow
He'd never climb, he'd never love like the love I know
When I was two, and he was ten, they carried me
Through holograms, they twisted into cosmic seas

[Pre-Chorus]
Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now I'm two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two

[Chorus]
There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorilla's in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

[Post-Chorus]
We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off

[Verse 2]
If gathering is all we need to change the wind
For anything to die, it needs first to begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now I'm two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two

[Chorus]
There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorilla's in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

[Post-Chorus]
We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off
In time

[Verse 3]
Saw your future's not burning so bright
But if we live too long, there's love like mine

[Refrain]
We all, we all we all turn on
We all we all we all turn off

[Chorus]
There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorillas in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

[Post-Chorus]
We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off
In time

[Verse 4]
If human breed hate love and lies would be traits of mine
But I was of the future, past, and present time

[Outro]
Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now I'm two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two
