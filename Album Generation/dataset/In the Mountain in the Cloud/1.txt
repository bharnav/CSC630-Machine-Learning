[Verse 1]
We may not be hopeless
But we're still helpless in the end
Just remember you're floating
Remember the love that we were in

[Verse 2]
So inconsistently we spend
Our time with family and our friends
I know I'm not hopeless
I'm only helpless in the end

[Verse 3]
I know you love questions
But they go unanswered in the end
Did you forget you're floating?
Did you forget that we were only men?

[Chorus]
We're getting all for our time, time, time
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

[Chorus]
We're getting all for our time, time, time
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

[Outro]
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
