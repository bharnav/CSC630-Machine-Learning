[Verse 1]
Share with me the sun
You forget sometime it's ours
Can't you see, you're not the only one?
The doors all lead outside
Feel it soak into your mind
Can't you see, you're not the only one?

[Refrain 1]
As you slipped on down the length of my tongue
Did you taste the salt that I become?

[Chorus 1]
You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see, and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind

[Verse 2]
Share with me the sun
We'll forget all that is ours
You forget me and all the things that you see

[Refrain 2]
The times already came with the news
It was the word that took your brain

[Chorus 1]
You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see, and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind

[Post-Chorus 1]
There's nothing I can say or do
There is nothing I can say or do
And there's no light for me to see
And there is no light for me to see
So there was nothing left of you

[Bridge]
You, you carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea, and we all knew you

[Chorus 2]
You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see, and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind, and we all knew you
All you see, and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind

[Post-Chorus 2]
There's nothing I can say or do
There is nothing I can say or do
And there's no light for me to see
And there is no light for me to see
So there was nothing left of you
There was nothing left of you
