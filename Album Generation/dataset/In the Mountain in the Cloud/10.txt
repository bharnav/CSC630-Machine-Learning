[Verse 1]
As I finally meet my end
I won't be scared, I won't defend
The things I've done
I don't need him like you do
I don't fear him like you do

[Verse 2]
As the world revolves the sun
I hope the light that I become can
Sleep for once
I will leave it like you do
I won't lead it like you do
I won't leave it like they do
I don't need him like they do

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep forever
Never see tomorrow
Or lead or follow
I don't wanna work forever
Know what I know
Or beg or borrow

[Chorus 1]
Just like our mothers
Who gave us our homes
We'll be just like our fathers
And go out on our own
'Cause we are the colors
In all that you see
We'll be just like our brothers
And take to the streets
And take to the streets

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep forever
Never see tomorrow
Lead or follow

[Verse 3]
As my world, it hides behind
The words only your wars define
They read a lot like news
But I fear it more than you
I fear it more than you

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep forever
Never see tomorrow
Lead or follow
I don't wanna work forever
Know what I know
Or beg or borrow

[Chorus 2]
Just like old lovers
Who never leave home
We'll forget the city
Forget the roads
Cause we are all rebels
Never do what we're told
We may not grow money
But man we grow old
Man we grow old

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep forever
Never see tomorrow
Lead or follow
I don't wanna work forever
Know what I know
Or beg or borrow

[Chorus 3]
Just like our mothers
Who gave us our homes
We'll be just like our fathers
And go out on our own
Cause we are the colors
In all that you see
We'll be just like our brothers
And take to the streets

[Chorus 4]
Cause we are all children
Yeah, we are all man
It may not be much
But we do what we can
Don't need no preacher
To make us believe
That everything's perfectly
Fucked up like me
