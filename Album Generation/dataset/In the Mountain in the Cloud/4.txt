[Verse 1]
I was born without a name, a soldier for
The streets, they say, "This kid's on a mission
Running high on fame of the guillotine
No roots to find, and no one to miss him."

[Refrain 1]
My head is like a flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Well we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

[Verse 2]
My heart's shaking with a fire burning deep inside
Still the politicians, they never listen
But money was a sound I didn't care to hear
Of which the politicians, they only listen

[Refrain 2]
My head was like a flame
And my eyes were red

[Pre-Chorus]
Well we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

[Chorus]
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up
It was burning up
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up
It was burning up

[Verse 3]
I became a child of the universe
Reborn into this galactic prism

[Refrain 3]
My head was like a flame
My eyes were red

[Pre-Chorus]
Well we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

[Chorus]
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up
It was burning up
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up
It was burning up

[Outro]
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
Head was like a flame
