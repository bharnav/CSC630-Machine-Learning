We have found in past excuses shrinking hands extending service
Like some ill bought warranty selfish terms to suit the day
Before the shady last decision shameless squanders nose and vision...
Off towards that well bought place to spite the nose right in your face
Look inside that dirty hole what is there left overthrown
Over there nothing is known another place to dig that hole
Mumbled like the clever clueless building moles to hills that throw off
What's inside that mighty mountain hollow is the core alive
Makeshift plans to take control of you're the island no one flies to
Waiting for the understanding never coming to your land
Look inside your eyes behold back toward what's over .. sold
Over there is nothing grown over here is over .. gone
Who's been making feeling faking all that stutters left beside
Churning fast stir the fat and kills you while it's sleepless
Who knows who the thief is
His truth is in the secret
It's something you believe in
Come away and fall with me
Go away and falter
