Living on and on within a shell of future war destructive home
Over here the air is gone
Sold for songs so faustian
The shortened seasons now the left
The dream now wicked shadows crack
The scenes left feeling for the poor distressed
The comp: a war
They start a war
So softly changing guns of wavy rainy sounds of radar
So softly changing and you'll find out if this is so awful
So softly changing
So softly changing guns of wavy rainy sounds of radar
So softly changing and you'll find out if this is so awful
So softly changing
