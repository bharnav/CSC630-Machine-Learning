Under a cave-in beaten
Educated and believes
Unload a gun the sun
Into the breach from which it came
Aside from writing walls up
Put on as if facts to see
Reactions cause deferral
From a passed on future's needs
Pissing on clocks uncertain
Heavy breathing can he breathe
This test is way past stress points
Pushes buttons full release
They change the world for certain
Meaning and false profits made
We're spending all the future
Future's never ours to see
Hang it up
(Spin with contented vision)
Back it out
(Put it back in its place)
Fade for what my black eyes colorize
Pack it up
(Stop losing opposition)
Shake it out
(Putting up with this place)
Stained bloodied eyes red full of lies colorize
Fade out in one act
Overturning neverending dream
All coming caught up in
The moments we can never see
Aside from writing walls up
(Forever hating)
Put on as if facts to see
(Forever getting)
Reactions cause deferral
(Forever taking taking...)
From a passed on future's needs
Hang it up
(Spin with contented vision)
Back it out
(Put it back in its place)
Shade for what my black eyes colorize
Pack it up
(Stop losing opposition)
Shake it out
(Putting up with this place)
Stained bloodied eyes red full of lies colorize
The party's lost a lot of cash and forest for the trees
They're leaving this day can I never older than my trees
Eyes gonna hate
Want want wanna wanna wake up
Wanna wanna wake up
Eyes don't hate what
Wanna wanna wake up
Wanna wake up
Wanna wanna wake up
Eyes gonna hate that
Wanna wanna wake up
Eyes gonna hate that
Wanna wanna wake up
Eyes don't fake that
Wanna want to make up
Otherwise face it
Ever ever...
