Hey ya wake up sleepy head bling bling to the game
Slacking over again what is given up instead of
A million miles of pain friend
I'll see ya in another dream
Warmest disconnect by keeping all eyes in the dark
Smiling pushing through it all
Hidden in the pain hidden in the pain
(There's a part of you)
Looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(There's a part of you)
Shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
But I've seen right through
But I can't see you
Make 'em all ready he said
Dissing at ya memory sat together on a stage free
Forever watching that dickheads at my worst
It's crazy he saved me as I threw my mass at glass in pain
Mimic through a window now he's let go
So let it be
He's free
Freer than me
Freer than me
Freer than me
Warmest disconnect by keeping all eyes in the dark
Smiling pushing through it all
Hidden in the pain hidden in the pain
(Warmest)
Looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(Warmest)
Shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(Warmest)
Looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(Warmest)
Shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
Heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
