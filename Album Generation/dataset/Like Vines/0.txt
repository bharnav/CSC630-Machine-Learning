[Verse 1]
In a field outside of town we could always be alone
Carry a blanket maybe a basket - and that's it
Innocence was the key I was locked up never free
Until you turned me

[Pre-Chorus]
Like vines we intertwined (like vines we intertwined)
Carelessly growing up and growing old
Life was on our tongues (on our tongues)
And it tasted heavenly so good

[Chorus]
I wake up and I feel alone
I was just asleep
Right where I belong
Inside this sad, sad song

[Verse 2]
I knew this was a dream it was too good to be true
Coincidences were a bit much too
Who wants to wake up?
Who wants to lose it?
Who wants to live in this place?
I don't, so I'll be sleeping in

[Pre-Chorus]
Like vines we intertwined (like vines we intertwined)
Carelessly growing up and growing old
Life was on our tongues (on our tongues)
And it tasted heavenly so good

[Chorus]
I wake up but I feel alone
I was just asleep
Right where I belong
Inside this sad, sad song

[Bridge]
Blankets here keep me from cold
Holding tightly my pillows
Frantically searching for her
Inside my head she is somewhere
She is somewhere

[Chorus]
I wake up and I feel alone
I was just asleep
Right where I belong
Inside this sad, sad song

[Outro]
I wake up and I feel alone
I was just asleep
Right where I belong
Inside this sad, sad, sad (song)
