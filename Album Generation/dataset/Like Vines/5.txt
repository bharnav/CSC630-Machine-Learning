You came to me
In seamless sleep
And slipped right in
Behind my eyes
On the back of my mind

We swam a sea
Of pretty sights and chandelier skies
I swore I could feel you breathe
It was all so real to me

The light, it slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away, oh

Don't wake me up
I am still dreaming
The story's undone
Unraveled at the seams
Don't wake me up
Death is misleading
And when I fall asleep
Sleep with a ghost

I moved in the dark
The room calm and cold
The quiet hollow
I am such a haunted soul
Your ghost has gone
The bed is so cold

The light, it slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away, oh

Don't wake me up
I am still dreaming
The story's undone
Unraveled at the seams
Don't wake me up
Death is misleading
And when I fall asleep
Sleep with a ghost

Oh, you were a fire caught in a storm
Memories, like embers keep us warm
You will leave me in the morning
Leave me

The light, it slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away, oh
The light, it slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away, oh
The light, it slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away, oh
