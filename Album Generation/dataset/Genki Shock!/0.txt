There's a big bird named Toucan Sam
With a pretty colored beak just like a candy cane
I wonder if he'd be so nice (be so nice)
As to take us to Fruit Loop Paradise
Chocolate streams and ice cream dreams
Fancy flavored clouds and sun
Lots of cake and soda pop
And lollipops for everyone

I wish I was like Toucan Sam
I could fly to the rainbow and candy land
Take all my friends to a tasty place (tasty place)
Get a beak and go flying in outer space

Chocolate streams and ice cream dreams
Fancy flavored clouds and sun
Lots of cake and soda pop
And lollipops for everyone
