[Verse 1]
What stands beside the railing with the river in full view
Beautiful you
Whose hair flows down like honey cross a shoulder blade or two
Beautiful you
Who speaks to me in riddles and multiples my skull
Who offers me a lolly and bring me back for more
Beautiful you, beautiful you

[Verse 2]
Whose eyes shine like midnight underneath the cobalt blue
Beautiful you
Whose fingers reach and touch me deep when no one else get true
Beautiful you
Who laughs inside the raindrops and says just let it fall
Who never gets more crazy and parks it by the door
Beautiful you, beautiful you

[Chorus]
Beautiful you, Beautiful you
I’ll shout it from the rooftops across Lonely Avenue
The angels in infinity whisper that it’s true
Whose light shines from the darkness
Tell me who now is it, who

[Verse 3]
Who meets me on the moonlight on the way to Capnanieu
Beautiful you
Who crawled across a barbed wire fence to pick a rose or two
Beautiful you
I’ll carve it in the mountains and I’ll burn it in the sky
This world is rough but I know there’s a place for you and I
I’ll hold you and I’ll thrill you and I’ll give you what I own
Cause every single kiss you give cuts right down to the bone
Beautiful you, beautiful you

[Verse 4]
Oh, oh, oh, oh you
Who contemplates the universe in a morning drop of dew
Beautiful you
Who understands the question that there is no answer to
Beautiful you, beautiful you

[Chorus]
Beautiful you, beautiful you
I’ll shout it from the rooftops across Lonely Avenue
The angels of infinity whisper yes it’s true
Whose light shines in the darkness
Tell me who now is it, who
Beautiful you, beautiful you

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh you
