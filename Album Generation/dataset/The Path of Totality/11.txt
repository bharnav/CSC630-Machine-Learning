[Verse 1]
Oh my God
I'm feeling crazy man
What could it be?
As I walk into this place, everyone's staring at me
Somehow I feel I've got
A fucked up disease
'Cause I part the seas
Fingers come out pointing at me
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think I'm funny?
Haha, or funny queer?
Bitch, get outta here
Let me make myself clear
I don't give a fuck
All you people can suck
My motherfucking dick!

[Chorus]
What's with the hostility?
Why is it so provoked?
You're living in a fantasy
That's how you cope
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior
I feel you're just plain absurd
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy

[Verse 2]
Oh my god!
This shit is crazy man look at this scene
As I watch these stupid people
Act like they are machines
They should really all
Drop to their knees
All the jealousy
That's the one thing I guarantee
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think I'm funny?
Haha, or funny queer?
Bitch, get outta here
Let me make myself clear
I don't give a fuck
All you people can suck
My motherfucking dick!

[Chorus]
What's with the hostility?
Why is it so provoked?
You're living in a fantasy
That's how you cope
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior
I feel you're just plain absurd
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
What's with the hostility?
Why is it so provoked?
You're living in a fantasy
That's how you cope
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior
I feel you're just plain absurd
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
