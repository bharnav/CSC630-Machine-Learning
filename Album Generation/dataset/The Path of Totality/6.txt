[Verse 1]
A slap in the face
It is endowed
The light of my life
Is put out somehow
I'm lying in pieces of
Emotions you control
You're feeding my sympathy
The lie unfolds

[Chorus]
Beating this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

[Verse 2]
The lines that I traced
Around the scars they swell
In flame with a sedative
To numb this spell
I'm lying in pieces of
Emotions you control
You're feeding this cancer
It's taken hold

[Chorus]
Beating this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

[Brige]
Feeling animosity
When no one else is around
Blindly, I scream into the air
Eating my heart off the ground

[Chorus]
Beating this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears
