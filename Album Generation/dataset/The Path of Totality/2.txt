[Verse 1]
And along came something sacred
I never knew what I found
The demons dance around, elated
They're hurting me

[Chorus]
I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown

[Verse 2]
Falling awake in a nightmare
Images of horror abound
Thought I stumbled upon salvation
Hell I found

[Chorus]
I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown

[Bridge]
I'll never be the same
It's the greatest lie ever told
No, I'll never be the same
I sold my soul

[Chorus]
I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown
