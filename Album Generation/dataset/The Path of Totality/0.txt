[Verse 1]
Coming onto you
The hell you got me through
What would I have to do to kiss that frown?
I know what's wrong with you
That fucked up part of you
Is gonna bury me under ground
Now I'm awake
Been stuck in a place I really hate
And it's not fate
Everything's just fine

[Chorus]
So why must it be?
Chaos lives in everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me

[Verse 2]
Get away from you
Is what I gotta do
I want my soul back
I'll stand my ground
So walk away from me
You know this has to be
Another way for me to kiss that frown
And it's not fate
Everything's just fine!

[Chorus]
So why must it be?
Chaos lives in everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me
Now I'm guilty, not ashamed
Got this thing attached to me
Throw it all away
It just comes back to me

[Brige]
Gonna take you
Gonna break you
Gonna rape you
Fuck you bitch, frown
Sometimes I worry
Sometimes I'm sorry
Sometimes I just want to beat you down
Gonna take you
Gonna break you
Gonna rape you
Fuck you bitch, frown
Sometimes I worry
Sometimes I'm sorry
Sometimes I just want to kiss that frown
I'm insane but now you gotta give it all to me!
Life is wearing thin!
My only pleasure is watching you give in!
I tried to pretend!
And all it got me was nothing in the end!
I tried to win!
And all it got me was nothing in the end!

[Chorus]
So why must it be?
Chaos lives in everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me
Now I'm guilty, not ashamed
Got this thing attached to me
Throw it all away
It just comes back to me
It just comes back to me!
It just comes back to me!
