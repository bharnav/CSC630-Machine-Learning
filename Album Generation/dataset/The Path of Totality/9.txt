[Verse 1]
Here it comes once again
'Irrational' I give in
Paranoia expands within
Little voices start to begin...
Everyone's out to take your joy away
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking
You must make it stop, make them pay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just take things
Way too far
Irrational feelings
I just try too hard 'cause...
What goes up must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause...
Sometimes I just take things way too far

[Verse 2]
Reality is surreal
Wretchedness is all I feel
Now it's really just a way
God, I hear the voices say...
Everyone's out to take your joy away
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking
You must make it stop, make them pay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just take things
Way too far
Irrational feelings
I just try too hard 'cause...
What goes up must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause...
Sometimes I just take things way too far
Sometimes I just take things
Way too far
Irrational feelings
I just try too hard 'cause...
What goes up must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause...
Sometimes I just take things way too far
