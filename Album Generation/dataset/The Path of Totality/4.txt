[Verse 1]
I can't believe what's happening
Where is your self control?
Why can't you just be honest?
The corruption takes its toll

[Chorus]
You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You've built this house of shame
You smile and you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now

[Verse 2]
I can't believe this happened
The fear starts to grab hold
Then anger starts to take over
I will not be controlled

[Chorus]
You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You've built this house of shame
You smile and you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now

[Brige]
They're taking over now
Eating up our souls somehow
Taking over now
Parasites, they run around
The culprits won't be found
They lie behind this mask of wealth
They're taking over now
Illuminati they hide

[Chorus]
You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You've built this house of shame
You smile and you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now
You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You've built this house of shame
You smile and you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now
