[Verse 1]
I am clearly broken
And no one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit
So I pound them into you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

[Chorus]
Times are looking grim these days!
Holding on to everything!
It's hard to draw the line!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to rip my eyes out
And look at you
Peace through pain is precious
Especially when it's done by you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

[Chorus]
Times are looking grim these days!
Holding on to everything!
It's hard to draw the line!
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories
Of what I've left behind
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Times are looking grim these days!
Holding on to everything!
It's hard to draw the line!
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories
Of what I've left behind
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
Shut the fuck up, get up!
