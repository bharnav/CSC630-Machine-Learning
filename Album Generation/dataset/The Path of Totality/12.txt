[Verse 1]
I'm plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred
That's falling down, at least they start to fry
Why can't I be removed, take their places?
Sometimes it's better to eat their scars
These are the times of the waking liar
Hold him close, or you will expire
Holding on to the place you're thinking
Total deceit

[Chorus]
I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?

[Verse 2]
I'm terrified by emotionless faces
They're all around me I want to die
I'm fucking tripping out seeing traces
Of murderers covered in lye
These are the times of the waking liar
Hold him close, or you will expire
Holding on to the place you're thinking
Total deceit

[Chorus]
I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?

[Bridge]
I love the things that make you upset
The more you hurt, the stronger I get
I love the things that make you upset
The more you hurt, the stronger I get!

[Chorus]
I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?
