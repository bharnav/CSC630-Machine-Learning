[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

[Chorus]
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

[Bridge]
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna be rude but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through
I just need to look around
See that life that has come unbound
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

[Chorus]
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

[Outro]
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days
