I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1]
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye
