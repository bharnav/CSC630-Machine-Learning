Gentlemen we have called you together to inform you that we
Are going to overthrow the United States government
Do you still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?

Does anybody else see a problem here?
If the government has nothing to hide why are
They so afraid toanswer a few questions?
This story does not add up

I'm on a mission to never forget
3,000 people that I've never met
We want some answers and all that we get
Some kind of shit about a terrorist threat
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surpise Surprise Surprise
Lies Lies

I'm on a mission to dig up the truth
You think we're stupid and there's no proof
Well let me tell you that the time has come
To pull the trigger on the smoking gun
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surpise Surprise Surprise
Lies Lies Lies Lies

Don't listen to me, listen to your head
Don't listen
Don't listen to anything, they've said
Don't listen
Lies Lies Lies Lies

America has been hijacked
Not by Al Qaeda, not by Bin Laden
But by a group of tyrants
That should be of great concern to all Americans

I'm on a mission to bring out the facts
You got your stories but they all have cracks
Misinformation, lies and deceit
What made you think that we were all asleep
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surpise Surprise Surprise
Lies Lies Lies Lies

Don't listen to me, listen to your head
Don't listen
Don't listen to anything, they've said
Don't listen
Lies Lies Lies Lies

Don't listen to me, listen to your head
Lies Lies Lies Lies
