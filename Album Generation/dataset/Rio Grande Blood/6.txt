...and war goes on...
...and war goes on...

There's no crisis of conscience
The truth is dressed in disguise
Feeding the hungry with Yellow Cake
Feeding the public with lies

Yellow Cake

No crimes were ever committed
No charges were ever read
Cooking the books on the Yellow Cake
Cooking a meal for the dead

Yellow Cake

...and war goes on...
...and war goes on...

This is no time for the righteous
Only the wicked survive
Bake up a batch of the Yellow Cake
Bake up a batch of the lies

Yellow Cake
Yellow Cake
Yellow Cake
Yellow Cake
