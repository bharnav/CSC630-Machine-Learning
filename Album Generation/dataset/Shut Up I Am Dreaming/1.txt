One, two, three
Bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, Ba-da-da

He's just a kid, he wants a ride
They took his ears, they took his eyes
They said a ride is never free
He couldn't hear, he couldn't see
Well, there are things that have to die
So other things can stay alive
The fire burns, it burns to give
It has to burn a life to live

The elder men spoke low
They took a vote and said no
They turned around real slow
Where did they go, where did they go?
And the question, oh the question
Can the kid keep his eyes
If the fire doesn't die, say nooooooooooooo
I said nooooooooooooo
I said, "You don't know what king we serve, boy, Oh you don't know what things we employ!"
The elder men spoke low
They took a vote and said no
They turned around real slow
Where did they go, where did they go?

Bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, bum-ba-da-dum, Ba-da-da

And the question, oh the question
Can the kid keep his eyes?
If the fire doesn't die
Can the kid keep his eyes?
Oh the question, oh the question
Can the kid keep his eyes?
If the fire doesn't die
I said, be careful what you wish for
Oh be careful what you wish for
And be careful 'round the fire light
And be careful 'round the bright, bright lights
Cause the fire never dies so the kid lost his eyes
Oh, that's how it goes, baby, that's how it goes, baby
That's how it goes, baby, that's how it goes
