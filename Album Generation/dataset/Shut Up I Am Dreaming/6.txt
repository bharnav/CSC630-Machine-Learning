I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry, that someone undressed me, as professed to me in Spain with their eyes
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-dum
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-da-da-dum

I'm sorry cause someone told me to watch and I watched for it all over Spain with my eyes
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-dum
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-da-da-dum

If I'm sorry, then so are you cause I, I go where you tell me to
On horseshoes

The Casanova ran
Toward the Eastern lands
His cock was in his hand
You gotta ride away from him, you gotta ride away from him

But if you ride over there they'll put bows in your hair, they will stand back and stare at you in Spain with their eyes
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-dum
Ba-dum-bum-ba-da-da-da-dum

It never occurred to me, and it
It never occurred to me, and it
It never occurred to me that the men are called horsemen there
Oh-oh, the men are called horsemen there
Oh, the men are called horsemen and I'm no horseman
Oh, the men are called horsemen and I'm no horseman
Oh, the men are called horsemen and I'm no horseman
And I'm no horse and you are no angel
Oh, I'm no horse and you are no angel
If I was a horse I would crouch like a leopard
If I was a horse I would trample the shepherd, love
If I was a horse I'd have pricks in my mane
If I was a horse I would throw up the reins...if I was you
If I was a horse I would throw up the reins, if I was you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
If I was a horse I would throw up the reins, if I was you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But I am no horse and you are no angel, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I said if I was a horse I would throw up the reins If I was you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Your hand's on my neck
Your hand's on my muscles
Your weight on my back
It keeps me from trouble
But oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

But such weights never did stay in Madrid, did they?
Where someone says, fuck me someone else says, ok
You gotta ride me to a pasture on a ride to give such withered wings
Where someone says fuck me someone else says, ok
