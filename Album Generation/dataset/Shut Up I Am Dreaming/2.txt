You are a waterfall
Waiting inside a well
And you are a wrecking ball
Before the building fell
And every lightning rod
Has got to watch the storm cloud come

And I’ve heard of pious men
And I’ve heard of dirty fiends
But you don’t often hear
Of us ones in between
And I’ve heard of creatures
Who eat their babies
And I wonder if they stop
To think about the taste

I saw the sun go down
Outside of Arkansas
And I saw the sun come up
Somewhere in Illinois
And in the darkness
I taught myself to hate
But where were you, oh where were you?
And where’d the fucking sun go?

And I am a creature
And I am surviving
And I want to be alone
But I want your body
So when you eat me
Mother and baby
Oh baby, mother me
Before you eat me

And you should always pass
When you get the inside lane
Don’t pull your hair out
I won’t pull my hair out
For I have never seen a sun
That did not bury his head in the side of the world
When the day is done

You are a waterfall
Waiting inside a well
You are a wrecking ball
Before the building fell
And I will mutter like a lover
Who speaks in tongues, oh he speaks in tongues
Oh I speak in tongues

He don't know if she's got the wedding rings on
She don't know if he's got the wedding ring on
