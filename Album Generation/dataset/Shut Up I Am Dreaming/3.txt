Snake's got a leg
It's one only she can see and she'll get so many legs
That she'll run in ways we'll never ever see
I got a jacket
A coat full of contraband and I got
I got so many high heels to sell and I got
I got so many hands to hand 'em over with
And they'll eat like kings, oh

So oh-oh-oh
His God aimed with bows and arrows o-oh o-oh o-oh
I said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
His God aimed with bows and arrows oh

I don't wanna go
Into the hills today, into the mountains to feed the crows
Up in the hills, up in the hills, it's cold and brutal

They peck at my bones with their beaks, I'm lying down
And they peck at my eyes with their beaks, I'm lying down
And they peck at my ears with their never ever ending cawing
And their cawing, and their cawing, and their cawing, and their ca-ca-cawing
And they'll eat like kings, oh

So snake's in the grass put that snake in the oven cause I'm the oven and sing
How can you live up so high in the mountains?
It's cold in the shade of the woodshed, baby, say can I stay awhile?
She said no, how dare you live up so high in the mountains
I got chased by a hundred snakes this morning
Got away from a hundred snakes in the night sing
How can you live up so oh-oh-oh-oh

I got chased by a hundred snakes in the morning
Got away from a hundred snakes in the night sing
How can you live up so
