You're on the distant shore
You're on the distant shore
Oceans never listened to us anyway
Oceans never listened to us anyway
And if I fall into the drink, I will say your name before I sink

He says your name out loud
In miniature rooms where no one's found
It's a desperate sound
You're on the distant shore
He stamps his feet down
You can hear his knuckles on your door
He wants to send you drawings
Drawings of men with faithful hands
They'll make such good boyfriends
He wants to tell you stories
Stories of boys who stomp their feet saying, "Shut— shut up!
I'm dreaming of places where lovers have wings"

And I'll meet you where the river forks
When everyone else is dead, you'll be safe on the water
We'll be much younger than we remember
You're on the distant shore
I'll stamp my feet down, down — do you hear knuckles on your door?
Do you understand what I'm fighting for?
But oceans never listened to us anyway
Oceans never listened to us anyway
If I fall into the drink, I will say your name before I sink
Oceans never listened to us anyway

I’m afraid of the water
I’m afraid of the sky
I’m tired of waiting
Oceans never listen to us anyway
Oceans never listen to us anyway
And if I fall into the drink, I will say your name before I sink
Oceans never listen to us anyway
So don’t make a sound
Don’t make a sound
Don’t make a sound
