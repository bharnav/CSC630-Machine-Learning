Maybe an ocean is found in the lake
Maybe exceptions to this could be made
But I'm swimming Lord, just to be saved
She always loved him, but not in the way
The way she's supposed to, but she never claimed to
Oh she's swimming Lord, just to be saved

Young lovers gathering 'round they hold their hands on Sundays
And some days they'll get down on the ground, they'll get down on the ground for you
I'd say you got some explaining to do and some claiming to do
And I, I'd say you got some silly dreams that can't come true, oh
Someday he'll get down on the ground, he'll get down on the ground for you
He's getting old, he's getting old, he's getting old
He's getting old, he's getting old, and the water is cold

Bum-bum-ba-da-dum-dum
Bum-da-dum-da-dum-dum
Bum-da-dum-da-dum-dum
Bum-da-dum-da-dum-dum
Bum-da-dum-da-dum-dum
Bum-bum-ba-da-dum-dum-dum-dum

Oh I'd say you got some explaining to do and some claiming to do
And I, I'd say you got some silly dreams that can't come true, oh
Someday he'll get down on the ground, get down on the ground for you
He's getting old, he's getting old, he's getting old
He's getting old, he's getting old

Because variables lurk in the wine
Because the bed's warm and it's cold out that's a good sign
It's never ever gonna feel right to pull the latch back again
This dust you kick up is too fine
Because variables lurk in the wine
Because the bed's warm and it's cold out that's a good sign
It's never ever gonna feel right to pull the latch back again
This dust you kick up is too fine
