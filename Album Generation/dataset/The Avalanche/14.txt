[Verse 1]
All things past in the Pick-up
Found my brother's badge
Abraham is live and well in the Pick-up
And his wife cast no more spells
In the Pick-up

[Chorus - Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Found myself in the Pick-up
Seat belt on my lap
And my sister with her braids
In the Pick-up
Kissed my mother on the face
In the Pick-up
Clapping with the human race
In the Pick-up

[Chorus - Instrumental]
