Why don't you have a baby?
Why don't you have a child?
Babies are good
And part of humanity's charm
Why don't you have a baby?
Babies are you
And the fatherhood rights all your wrongs
Goodbye baby, Daddy's going away
Goodbye Daddy... Baby's here to stay
A little baby!
Why don't you have a baby?
Why don't you have a child?
Babies are good
...and the fatherhood rights all your wrongs
Baby...
Baby...
