Come on, my love
There are times, many times...
...When myself I've done stranger...
...stranger, stranger...
Let it roll lassy, roll
Come what may, anyway...
I was born not to follow
There are times, many times...
When my pride I must swallow
...follow...
...swallow...
Oh, let it roll lassy, roll
Because in time, it goes away...
Time proves nothing stays
The time for change has ended...
It loves you still but I never will again
