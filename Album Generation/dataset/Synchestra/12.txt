All the miles and all the trials and cities made of gold
When there's a free way a free way a free way to carry you home

Tell the world, the young and old and every boy and girl
That there's a free way a free way a free way to carry you home


OH WHAT A FEELING
OH WHAT A FEELING
KNOW FROM WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED
IT CAME FROM AFRICA!

[reversed] Oh sell us your meal, oh sell us your meal, oh

OH WHAT A FEEDING
OH WHAT A FEEDING
KNOW THE CHOSEN ONES...
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE!!!
