You are the rainbow!
You are the sun to my chameleon!
We are the river!
We are the stone!
And you're never alone, while you're feeding the crux of the you
YOU BRAVE ACCADIAN
Oh, thank you... thank you!!!
PARALYZED, TERRORIZED
IN MY EYES I'VE ALWAYS FALLEN
END THIS LINE, ENDLESS LIE
ENDLESSLY BUT STILL I'M FALLING
BREAK ME AWAY FROM MY T
Hold on tight!
Hold on to you!
PARALYZED, TERRORIZED
IN MY EYES I'VE ALWAYS FALLEN
END THIS LINE, ENDLESS LIE
ENDLESSLY SO PIXILLATE ME
PARALYZED, TERRORIZED
IN MY EYES I'VE ALWAYS FALLEN
END THIS LINE, ENDLESS LIE
ENDLESS LINES BUT STILL I'VE FALLEN
Break me away from my I
...hold on tight...
It's this HOPE... that gives us
