She's a woman
Feel good Mordecai
Known exactly where she's been
Sooner or later well the fear's gonna hunt you down
Tell me everything you feel
The fear is overwhelming
The air is getting thin
Seems to save myself my friend
I'd know where I'd begin
And I'm running on empty
See the lady, dueling motor care
Knows exactly what she's seen
It seems like every moment when the wind it blows
And the will goes and I'm waiting...
...I'm still waiting
Sphere the sense of self my call
Is the lightning in the rain
Seen the lights of hell my soul is sure to find again
And you're running the nails...
Seen the world through everybody's eyes
To know you have to go alone...
