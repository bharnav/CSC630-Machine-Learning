[Intro: Jim Jones]
Rell fresh home
How it feel to back where the bricks my nigga
Ya heard, I got the D.A. on my ass right now
All my soldiers behind the G Wall
Inhale, exhale... fuck the police

[Verse 1: Hell Rell]
I'm up early on the strip while the birds chirpin
I had to turn my fone off too many birds chirpin
Damn my homies gotta sit in the bing
So for them, I flood my chain and piss in my ring
Yea, shit on these niggas 'til I sit wit the Lord
I woulda been home last year but I got hit at the board, nigga
Yea you spotted man, now you red dotted man
You fuckin wit Hell Rell, New York City's rider man

[Bridge: Jim Jones]
Now is these niggas some killers like us
No
They say the real, well they realer than us
No, no, no
Is my set good
Yes
Is my bet good
Yes
Is my threat good
Yes, yes, yes

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Since you've been home they done indicted ya boy
Due to the circumstances of this life we enjoy
Niggas start snitchin they Sammy the Bullin
Til my niggas start grippin these hammers and pull 'em
That's when these niggas start switchin turnin Islamic and Muslim
Cause they seein my position is straight savage and hoodlums
Shit, who suffered and lost, my new truck is a Porsche
This is One-Eye Willie and I'm from fuckin New York

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Who them niggas paintin the town red
Dip-Set
Banks stop and we lay down bets
Byrd-Gang
Who them niggas gettin that money man
Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set
Who them niggas leave wit ya bitch nigga
Byrd-Gang
Who them niggas squeezin at bitch niggas
Dip-Set
Who them niggas that gotta get rich nigga
Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang

[Bridge 2: Jim Jones]
Now do these niggas be bangin like me
No
They say they G is they gangstas like me
No, no, no
Is my guns good
Yes
Is my ones good
Yes
Do we run hoods
Yes, yes, yes

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
My pistol game been tight
Since chicken lo mein and rice
Tryna get that paper, flippin that caine for a price
Fiends goin crazy, hittin that caine thru the pipe
Niggas that bang to the right
I'm jus sayin this is life
So we adore and survive
Cause thru this war we gon ride wit two 4'z on our side
Shit, man I'm riskin it all
Cause for this love and this money man, I jus wanna ball

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Who them niggas paintin the town red
Dip-Set
Banks stop and we lay down bets
Byrd-Gang
Who them niggas gettin that money man
Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set, Dip-Set
Who them niggas leave wit ya bitch nigga
Byrd-Gang
Who them niggas squeezin at bitch niggas
Dip-Set
Who them niggas that gotta get rich nigga
Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang, Byrd-Gang

[Verse 4: Hell Rell]
These niggas want me to slow down and switch my speed
And these bitches pokin holes in the condom tryna get my seed
Leave me alone lemme twist my weed
Two things I never seen a U.F.O. and a bitch I need
The beamer shinin on B.B.'z, niggas tryin to be me
You gangsta on the streets dawg, north signin to P.C
These niggas washed up callin it quits
It don't matter, Porsche to 6, they be all my dick
I, slaughter the strip wit a quarter a brick
I got Florida chicks comin to N.Y. for the dick
I only been home for a month but I'm still fresh y'all
Up in this booth and still smellin like the mess hall

[Bridge: Hell Rell then Jim Jones]
Now is these niggas more liver than me
No
He kinda hot but is he spittin more fire than me
No, no, no, no
Is my dope good
Yes
Is my coke good
Yes
Am I so hood
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Now is these niggas some killas like us
No
They say the real, well they realer than us
No, no, no
Is my set good
Yes
Is my bet good
Yes
Is my threat good
Yes, yes, yes
