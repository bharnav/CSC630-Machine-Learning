You ain't but a fire on my sad estate
Burning my house to the ground
High and mellow, oh, how she rides me
Out in the meadow where the taxis don't ride
A million times quicker than the pain of games
A million times better than the pain
You ain't but a telegram nobody's sendin'
Nobody sends me but you
High and mellow, slow and steady
Out in the meadow with you
A million times quicker than the pain of games
A million times better than the pain of games, games, games
