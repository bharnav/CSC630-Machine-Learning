Trains moan in my sleep
When I'm trying to go to bed
Moving way too slow
For whatever that they be carrying
And I've been working hard
Ever since I was a kid
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like something's always moving

Trains moan in my sleep
When I'm trying to go to bed
Moving way too slow
For whatever that they be carrying
I've been working hard
Ever since I was a boy
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like something is always moving

You know I don't always show
What it is I'm feeling baby doll
You know that the things that you want
Are that the things that you need
But the things that you love they're a lie
I'm gaining on them trains and fast
Trains moan in my sleep
Into the future and out of the past
Into the future and out of the past

Trains moan in my head
When I'm trying to go to sleep
Throwin' rocks at the window
When the sun's crawling up the sheets
And I've been working hard
Ever since I was a boy
Trains moan in my sleep
Gnawing on me like I was a chew toy

You know I don't always show
Whatever I'm feeling baby doll
You know that the things that you love
And the things that you want
And the things that you need are a lie
I'm gaining on them trains and fast
Trains moan in my sleep
Into the future and out of the past
Into the future and out of the past
Into the future and out of the past
Into the future and out of the past

Trains moan in my head
When I'm trying to go to sleep
Moving way too slow
For whatever that they're carrying
I've been working hard
Ever since I was a kid
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like I'm always moving
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like I'm always moving
