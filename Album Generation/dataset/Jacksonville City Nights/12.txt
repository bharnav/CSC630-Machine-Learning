I can be taught but I'm not learning
Over and over I lose
I make mistakes, get so sorry
I can't unwind like yarn from a spool

I'm a little shaky gotta learn how to fight
The moon shines on the boulevard baby let's ride
If you gotta look back, don't look down
Our love went cold and turned to ice

It's hard to see the ground
From the withering heights
From the withering heights

I can go on, but I won't bore you
Lucky in life, not in love
I make mistakes like anybody
Anyone foolish to love me that much

I'm a little shaky gotta learn how to fight
The moon shines on the boulevard, baby let's ride
If you gotta look back, don't look down
Our love went cold and turned to ice
It's hard to see the ground

From the withering heights
From the withering heights
From the withering heights

From the withering heights
From the withering heights
From the withering heights
