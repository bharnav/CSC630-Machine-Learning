Go and get the gun
Cause it's only getting worse
Go and fill it up with silver bullets

Cause I can't see the sun
But I know it's going away
And I can't make you love me
And you can't make me stay

I'm the wolves at the door
You're not supposed to let in
But you can't make me feel if I'm not feeling

And I can't see the sun
But I know it's going away
And I can't make you love me
And you can't make me stay
