Lord take me home
To the peaceful valley
Down the winding river
To the city of souls
I've grown so tired
And my hearts too heavy
To walk any longer
To your cities of Gold
All my life I longed for forgiveness
But I can never seem to get enough
All my life I've been rocked into the darkness
With a gun to my head
Trying to find a peaceful song
Trying to find a peaceful song
To sing when everything goes wrong
Till the peaceful valley calls me home

Up there in the clouds
In that glorious kingdom
Tell me there ain't nothing but an easy decline
Can I still smoke cigarettes and have my coffee
Up there in heaven and a bottle of wine
All my life, I've been lost out in the darkness
But I can never seem to get enough
All my life I've been locked into the darkness
With a gun to my head
Trying to find a peaceful song
Trying to find a peaceful song
To sing when everything goes wrong
Till the peaceful valley calls me home
Oh take me home to the peaceful valley
Down the winding river
To the city of Gold
