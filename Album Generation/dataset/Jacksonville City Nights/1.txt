I don't know the sound of my father's voice
I don't even know how he says my name
But it plays out like a song on a jukebox in a bar
In the back of my head till it's worrying machine
And in the cotton fields out by the house where I was born
The leaves burn like effigies of my kin
The trains run like snakes through the Pentecostal pines
Filled up with cotton and dime store gin
Oh Jacksonville, how you burden my soul
How you hold all my dreams captive
Jacksonville, how you play with my mind
Oh my heart goes back, suffocating on the pines
In Jacksonville
The end, the end, the end

All the cars are lined up on a Saturday night
With a sky full of nothing but moon
And I lose my reflection in a bottle of wine
Till the morning comes down and I ain't nothing but you
At the diner in the morning for a plate of eggs
The waitress tries to give me change I say, "Nah, it's cool. Just keep it"
I read up my news, I start thinking about her
And I wonder if anybody here besides me has got any decent secrets
Oh Jacksonville, how you burden my soul
How you hold all my dreams captive
Jacksonville, how you play with my mind
Oh my heart goes back, suffocating on the pines
In Jacksonville
The end, the end, the end
