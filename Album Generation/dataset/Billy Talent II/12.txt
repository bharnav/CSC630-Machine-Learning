[Verse 1]
In a garage beside a house
There is a luxury Sedan
And for his next monthly installment
He’s gonna go out with a bang
Boy who always did what he was told
Was promised to be king when he was old

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit the brakes, hit the glass
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past
Flashed before his face

[Verse 2]
There is a man, intensive care
When he awakes, he will declare
“I’ve been dead for 20 years!
I won’t let 20 more go by…”
Boy who always did what he was told
Bought the only dream that he was sold

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit the brakes, hit the glass
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past
Flashed before his face

[Chorus]
Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

[Bridge]
Ever feel like you’ve been cheated
Following what they believe?
Don’t shake the hands of fate
Oh, don’t shake the hands of fate

Ever feel like you’ve been cheated
Following what they believe?
Don’t shake the hands of fate
Oh, there’s no more time to waste!

[Chorus]
Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

[Outro]
Burn the evidence!
Burn the evidence!
Burn the evidence!
Don’t shake the hands of fate!
Burn the evidence!
Burn the evidence!
Burn the evidence!
There’s no more time to waste
