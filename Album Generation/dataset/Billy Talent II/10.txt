[Verse 1]
All we shared was a mattress
And a lie and an address
Baby, I don't need you
Well, baby, I don't need you

Once occupied by a goddess
Now it's a room full of boxes
She said, "it's time to leave you"
But, baby, I don't need you

[Chorus]
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

[Verse 2]
I never got the whole story
Not 'til after she left me
Baby, I don't need you
Well, baby, I don't need you

Word on the street is she fucked him
While we were playing in Cleveland
Well, baby, I don't need you
You're fading in my rearview

[Chorus]
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick!

[Bridge]
Control, Alt, Deleted
Control, Alt, Deleted
Control, Alt, Deleted
Reset my memory!

Control, Alt, Deleted
Control, Alt, Deleted
Control, Alt, Deleted
Reset my memory!

[Chorus]
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes..
