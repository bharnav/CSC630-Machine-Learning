[Verse 1]
Urban Hipster, the new gangster fronting by the club
A new wave mannequin packing haircuts instead of packing guns
Magazines from overseas won't teach you how to feel
They trade in their hearts for indie rock charts to tell them what is real

[Pre-Chorus]
When did they assume putting on a costume
Gave them a right to ostracize
Out of the woodwork, art aficionados?
Answer one question

[Chorus]
Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!

[Verse 2]
She sells street cred with no smile at the local record store
She's acting the role and dressing the part pretending to be bored
The truth about conformity is it bites without a sting
Trends come and go, but when you're alone, it doesn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
When did they assume putting on a costume
Gave them a right to ostracize
Out of the woodwork art aficionados?
Answer one question

[Chorus]
Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!

[Chorus]
Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!

[Outro]
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
