[Verse 1]
A slap in the face
And I can't erase
These things that you say
Don't make it all okay, it's not okay

When push comes to shove
I'll put on the gloves
Intentions are cruel
I ain't nobody's fool you know it hurts..

[Pre-Chorus]
My pride
Step aside
'Cause I don't need your..

[Chorus]
Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
That's what you're giving me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

[Verse 2]
A fistful of lies
Dressed up in disguise
And make no mistake
I know they're all so fake, they're all so fake

My self-righteous friend
I just can't pretend
Your words are the truth
Sincere only when they suit you, it hurts..

[Pre-Chorus]
My pride
Step aside
'Cause I don't need your..

[Chorus]
Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
That's what your giving me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
This shit is killing me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down
Breaking me down

[Chorus]
Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
That's what your giving me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
This shit is killing me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery

Breaking me down
Breaking me down
Breaking me down
