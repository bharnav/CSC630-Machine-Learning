[Verse 1]
Twisted tongues will place you in their category
Face to face, you’ll hear them tell a different story
Loose lips may sink ships, but honesty’s forever
Eyes of envy try to cut and try to sever

[Pre-Chorus]
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don’t care whose feelings will get hurt
Beware the voice without a face
That’s hidden underneath the…

[Chorus]
Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Beware the voice without a face
That’s hidden underneath the…

Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don’t care whose feelings will get hurt
Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face

[Verse 2]
When you’re insecure, they’ll find the fuel to start a fire
They’re bitter pricks with only hatred to inspire
Level heads prevail, revenge won’t make it better
Trust your instinct like you trust what’s in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don’t care whose feelings will get hurt
Beware the voice without a face
That’s hidden underneath the…

[Chorus]
Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Beware the voice without a face
That’s hidden underneath the…

Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don’t care whose feelings will get hurt
Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face!

[Chorus]
Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Beware the voice without a face
That’s hidden underneath the…

Cover of cowardice!
Can’t you see them?!
Covered in cowardice!
Can’t you hear them?!
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don’t care whose feelings will get hurt
Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face

Voice without a face
Voice without a face
Voice without a..!
