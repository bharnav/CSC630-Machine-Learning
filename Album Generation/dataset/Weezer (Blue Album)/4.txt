[Verse 1]
I'm me, me be
Goddamn
I am
I can sing and
Hear me, know me
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

[Interlude, spoken]
Girl: Hey, what's up?
- Not much
Girl: Did you hear about the party?
- Yeah
Girl: Um, I think I'm gonna go but, um, my friends don't really wanna go. Could I get a ride?

[Verse 2]
Oh no, it go, it gone
Bye-bye
Who I?
I think, I sink, and I die
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (as I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
It's good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone
