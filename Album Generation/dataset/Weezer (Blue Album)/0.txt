[Verse 1]
My name is Jonas
I'm carrying the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
But this is how we feel
Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you about it

[Chorus 1]
The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay

[Verse 2]
My name is Wepeel
I got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else
Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

[Chorus 2]
The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

[Bridge]
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Harmonica and Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
My name is Jonas
