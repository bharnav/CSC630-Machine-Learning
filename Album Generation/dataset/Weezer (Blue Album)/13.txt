Jamie, what you doin' now?
What you doin' now girl?
Please, please tell me
'Cuz I need to know, I need to know now
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently
Jamie, I want you to know
Jamie, Jamie
I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time
Jamie, what you doin' now?
Who's dialin' your car phone?
Please, please be true
You know that I trust you, do that which you must do
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently
Jamie, I want you to know
Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time
You've got the Beach Boys, your firm's got the Stones
But I know you won't leave me alone
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh
And I'm so glad
I am yours, you are mine
Show me where and I will sign
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting, waiting
Jamie, oh, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time
Jamie, believe me, I won't let you down
'Cuz you are the best lawyer in town
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
I love you so much, I love you so much
