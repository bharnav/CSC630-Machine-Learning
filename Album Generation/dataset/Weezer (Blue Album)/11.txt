Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted

When I met you I was all alone
Cold and hungry cryin' on the phone
You baked me brownies and said "don't you cry"
And gave me the coat off your back

Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted

Even Izzy, Slash and Axl Rose
When I call you put them all on hold
And say to me that you'd do anything
And all I can do is say that
I haven't much I can give you in return
Only my heart and a promise not to turn
But I'll sing to you every day and every night
Susanne, I'm your man

Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted
Of a girl
YEAH!
