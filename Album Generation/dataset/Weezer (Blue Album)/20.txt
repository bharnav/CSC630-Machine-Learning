[Verse 1]
You can't resist her
She's in your bones
She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules of
Oxygen and carbon dioxide

[Chorus]
Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold onto hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

[Verse 2]
You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, "Hey, baby
I just might take the chance"
You say, "It's a good thing
That you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way I will crush
Your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces"

[Chorus]
Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold onto hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

[Outro]
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams

[Guitar Solo]
