Class of 1988
Never thought you'd graduate
Playin' with your guns all day

If only they could see you now
That you've learned to shoot so well
They wouldn't laugh that way

(chorus)
Wayne, you know it's true
There's nothing you can do
So put the guns away
Who cares what's wrong or right?
So please give up the fight
And put them guns away

All of your friends are through
They've given up what they tried to do
See now how happy they are

Each with a new lease on life
A brand new car and a milage wife
Put down them guns and fall into line

(Chorus)
All your friends are through
There's nothing you can do
So put them guns away

Do do do do do do do do....

All your friends are through
There's nothing you can do
So them guns away

(Chorus)
