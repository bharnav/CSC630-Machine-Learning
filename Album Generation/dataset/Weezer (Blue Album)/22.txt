[Verse 1]
It's been two and a half years now that we've been apart
I've been kinda spaced out lately
Can't seem to get you out of my mind

[Chorus]
I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

[Verse 2]
You think I'd have given up
Found somebody new
But no girl's got what you got
I belong to you

[Chorus]
I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

[Outro]
I swear it's true
I really do
I swear it's true
I swear it's true
