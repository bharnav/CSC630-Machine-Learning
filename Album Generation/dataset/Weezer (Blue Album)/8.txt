[Verse 1]
Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

[Chorus]
Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!

[Post-Chorus]
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Verse 2]
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're going
We're going where the wind is blowing
Not knowing where we're gonna stay

[Chorus]
Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!

[Post-Chorus]
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Bridge]
We'll write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
(On the road with Kerouac)
In free verse
(Sheltered in his bivouac)
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
(On this road, we'll never die)
In free verse

[Post-Chorus]
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Reprise]
Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

[Chorus]
Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holi-

[Outro]
Let's go away
Let's go away
Let's go away
Let's go away
In a heartbeat!
