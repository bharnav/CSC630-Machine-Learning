[Verse 1]
I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide
I've got a 12-sided die
I've got Kitty Pryde
And Nightcrawler too
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do
I've got posters on the wall
My favorite rock group KISS
I've got Ace Frehley
I've got Peter Criss
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do

[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage

[Verse 2]
I've got electric guitar
I play my stupid songs
I write these stupid words
And I love every one
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do

[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage
In the garage

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song

[Outro]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one laughs about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me sing this song
