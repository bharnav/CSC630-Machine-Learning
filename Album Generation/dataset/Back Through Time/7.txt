[Verse 1]
Gather round and listen
As I tell you now this tale
The grim legacy of the pirates three
And how their lives ceased to be
I'll tell ye now of Redrum
The ginger commodore
He got a case of scurvy rot
And then that bastard was no more

[Verse 2]
This is the tale of Captain Crashride
By his crew, condemned and damned
And as if this wasn't bad enough
They replaced him with a baldy man
Now his soul haunts the sea
Eternally he's doomed to wander
Mayhaps you'll hear his deathly cry
"C'mon son, buy a honda!"

[Chorus]
To the end of time we will sail the seas
With cutlasses in hand
We'll terrorize the land
Though the hands of fate may strike us down
We'll fight till we fall
Swashbucklers 'til we die

[Verse 3]
This is the tale of Admiral Nobeard
The fattest pirate in the west
He's never seen his balls before
And he needs a bra to hold his breast
Feared by friend and foe alike
No sword or gun could wound his flesh
But one day he met his fate:
'Twas on a pretzel he choked to death

[Solo]

[Outro]
To the end of time we will sail the seas
With cutlasses in hand
We'll terrorize the land
Though the hands of fate may strike us down
We'll fight till we fall
Swashbucklers 'til we die
We'll fight till we fall
Swashbucklers 'til we die
