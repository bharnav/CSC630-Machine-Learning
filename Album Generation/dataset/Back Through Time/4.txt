[Verse 1]
From Scotland's bonnie shores we set sail
In search of alcohol, the drunkard's holy grail
'Cause a pirates life is empty without booze
The situation's dire, we've got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
To England we ride
With vengeance on our minds
We'll kill the monks, and get dead drunk
Come on lads, it's cloister burning time!

[Chorus]
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash

[Bridge]
I'm not sure what's in it except from caffeine
Despite having drunk it since I was thirteen
It sells by the barrel in China and Spain
I'll get drunk once more on that Lurgan Champagne
(Yah-ha-ha-har)

[Chorus]
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash
Buckfast Powersmash
