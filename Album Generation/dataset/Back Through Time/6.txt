[Verse 1]
The time has come, the time for a drink
But I don't want whiskey or gin
There's only one drink that gets me so drunk
Until my head starts to spin
Far to the west under tropical sun
This mystical drink is brewed
On our mission to get totally drunk
We have got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Rum is the power
Rum is the key
Rum is the thing that will set us free

[Chorus]
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum, give me more rum

Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ya-ha-ha-ha)

[Verse 2]
The time has come, the time for a drink
But I dont want vodka or mead
None of these drinks will quench my thirst
Rum is the drink I need
Questing the oceans and questing the seas
Searching for ultimate booze
On our mission to get totally drunk
We have got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Rum is the power
Rum is the key
Rum is the thing that will set us free

[Chorus]
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum, give me more rum

Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum, give me more rum

Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum (ahoy)
Rum, rum, rum (yaarr)
Rum, rum
Hey
