[Verse 1: Christopher Bowes]
From the deep there's a terror rising
A great beast with eyes like crimson fire
Leviathan returns, to devour the world
Set a course, the time for slaughter
To the heart of the raging oceans blue
This time the beast will meet it's doom
(Eternal doom)

[Verse 2: Christopher Bowes]
Legends speak of the ancient monster
From a time beyond the dawn of time
In a pit of primordial ooze
Many years we have been kept waiting
But tonight that squid will surely die
Revenge is a dish best served fried
(Deep fried)

[Chorus]
Deathsworn, oathbound
On a quest for vengeful slaughter
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky
Deathsworn, oathbound
No gods shall be our master
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky

[Verse 3: Christopher Bowes]
With a crash of thunder
Our ship sails 'cross the waves
On a course to the frozen arctic seas
We've defeated vikings
And ninjas we hath slain
The terrorsquid won't escape again
(Never again)

[Chorus]
Deathsworn, oathbound
On a quest for vengeful slaughter
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky
Deathsworn, oathbound
No gods shall be our master
We sail to the halls of doom
With the black flag raised in the sky

[Bridge: Christopher Bowes]
Poseidon's realm falls silent
The beast awakens!

[Verse 4: Ken Sorceron]
Between the bounds of light and death
Rides the serpent, Ouroboros
Supine before the altar of doom
Enter into the Cthonic lair (ouh!)

[Verse 5: Ken Sorceron]
A raging torrent of smoke and fire
Lightning from across the bow
Hear the death throes of the terrorsquid
The doom of Leviathan draws near

[Outro: Christopher Bowes]
Thunderous volleys from the thirtytwo-pounder gun strike the beast
As our vessel moves in for the killing blow
From the bow of the ship the great harpoon is fired
Impaling through the monster's cursed eyes
With a final scream of terror
Leviathan rears up in defeat, and is vanquished for all eternity
