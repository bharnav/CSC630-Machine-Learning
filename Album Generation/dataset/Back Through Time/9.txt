[Verse 1]
Oh, the year was 1778
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 2]
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 3]
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in scuppers with the staggers and the jags

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
On the King's birthday we put to sea
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
We were 91 days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 5]
On the 96th day we sailed again
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 6]
The Yankee lay low down with gold
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Ladies and gentlemen, mister Heri Joensen
[Solo]

[Verse 7]
Then at length we stood two cables away
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 8]
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Maintruck carried off both me legs

[Chorus]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 9]
So here I lay in my 23rd year
How I Wish I Was In Sherbrooke Now!
It's been 6 years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday

[Outro]
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers
