[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt, therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift, pulsing with the Earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

[Verse 3: James Hetfield]
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Bridge: James Hetfield]
I feel a change, back to a better day
(Shapeshift) Hair stands on the back of my neck
(Shapeshift) In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

[Outro: James Hetfield]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning
Of wolf and man
