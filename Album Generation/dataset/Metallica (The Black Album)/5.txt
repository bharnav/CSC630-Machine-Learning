[Intro: James Hetfield]
Don't tread on me
I said, "Don't tread on me"

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Liberty or Death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
Never begins it
Never, but once engaged
Never surrenders
Showing her fangs of rage

I said, "Don't tread on me"

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

Don't tread on me

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Love it or leave it
She with the deadly bite
Quick as the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness
Always in surveillance
Eyes, they never close
Emblem of vigilance

Ooh, no no no
Said, "Don't tread on me"

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

[Verse 3: James Hetfield]
Liberty or death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

Don't tread on me
