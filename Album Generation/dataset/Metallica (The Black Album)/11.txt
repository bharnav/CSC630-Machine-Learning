[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? what have you got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
(What the hell?) What the hell?
What is that you think you're gonna find?
(Hypocrite) Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell
Reaching out (Reaching out)
Grabbing for something you have got to feel
Closing in (Closing in)
The pressure upon you is so unreal

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
Struggle

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
What the hell?
What is that you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
