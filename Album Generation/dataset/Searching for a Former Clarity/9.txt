[Intro]

You can have it all, I ain't got the heart to fight, no
Total exhaustion, complete breakdown. For the asshole I am
Apologies in full, please leave me alone
Pull over the van, let me out

[Verse]

And we'll give the money back, to the record label
Fire the agent, fire the manager
We ain't got what it takes, to make it
We got indifference, got no respect for them
Feels like you already said so much
Feels like you can never say enough
Let someone else take our place
Let them be your entertainment

[Chorus 1]

You know they're waiting
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting
(they're just waiting)
To tear us apart

[Chorus 2]

You know they're waiting
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting
(you know they're waiting)
You know they're waiting
(they're just waiting.)
To tear us apart
