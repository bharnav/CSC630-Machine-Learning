[Verse 1]
You've gotta love this place
Here conformity is key
They’ll wipe that smile right off your face
Give you a list of songs you're allowed to sing
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Yeah, you can say what's on your mind
As long as it’s on their minds too
'Cause it isn't in their hearts to find
A little room for some other point of view
La la la, la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Chorus]
And any time I think that I might drown
In all this standard issue gray
When I'm feeling small and pushed around
I close the door and draw the shades
I put on my red dress
I put on my red dress
Can't take my red dress away

[Verse 2]
I learned to grit my teeth and smile
Let 'em think they've boxed me in
Inside I'm still the problem child
That I always was, so I guess I win
Na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Chorus]
And any time I think that I might drown
In all this standard issue gray
When I’m feeling small and pushed around
I close the door and draw the shades
I put on my red dress
I put on my red dress
Can’t take my red dress away

[Bridge]
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

[Chorus]
And any time I think that I might drown
In all this standard issue gray
When I'm feeling small and pushed around
I close the door and draw the shades
I put on my red dress
I put on my red dress
Can’t take my red dress away
