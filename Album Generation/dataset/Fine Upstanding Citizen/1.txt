[Verse 1]
I saw something wild
It’s innocence and freedom
Knew no rules or boundaries
Did whatever it wanted to do

I loved to watch it run
It mostly kept its distance
But whenever it came near me
I felt wild, too

And it when it wasn’t around
All I felt was chained and bound

[Chorus]
You were so beautiful from where I stood
So I chased you down and held you as close as I could
That’s when the fire turned cold
Maybe you’re not supposed to hold
Something wild

[Verse 2]
Oh but how could I resist
I am only human
How could I not want you
When you looked at me that way

The fire in your eyes
I’d hoped was burning for me
I couldn’t take all that temptation
For another day

[Chorus]
You were so beautiful from where I stood
So I chased you down and held you as close as I could
That’s when the fire turned cold
Maybe you’re not supposed to hold
Something wild

[Bridge]
I saw something wild and free
Why couldn’t I just let it be?

[Chorus]
You were so beautiful from where I stood
You were so beautiful from where I stood
So I chased you down and held you as close as I could
That’s when the fire turned cold
I almost made ice out of gold
Maybe you’re not supposed to hold
Something wild
