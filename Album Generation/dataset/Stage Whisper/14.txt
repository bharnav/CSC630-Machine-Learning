[Verse 1]
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

[Chorus]
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
And she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

[Verse 2]
Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

[Chorus]
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
And she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

[Bridge]
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that

[Verse 4]
I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

[Outro]
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
And you make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
