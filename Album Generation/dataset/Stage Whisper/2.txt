If God don't make mistakes
Pulling the weeds from the ground
As they're growing up
And over the streets of the city

And I can't play it straight
Cause I don't know if it matters
You try to stay calm
As they break your head all is silent

All the rain coming down

Little iron will
Pushing against the world
What you hope to gain
Is the same as what you're losing

Like a parasite
Living off somebody's life
All you take from someone else
Give yourself away
