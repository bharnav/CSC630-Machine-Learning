Please, please, please
I’m calling for you my dear
I hope you can understand
I think it’s time we changed our plan

All this while we’re trying to raise up money
It’s all that we really have
It seems to me we’ve lost our touch

Oh I had to start
We’ve been out of touch
Oh I had to start
Can’t keep myself away

All this time
I’m trying to change my mind
But now that you live my life
I’m starting to feel I’ve let you down

So please please please
I’m calling for you my dear
I hope you can understand
I think it’s time I changed the lock

Oh I had to start
We’ve been out of touch
Oh I had to start
Can’t keep myself away
Oh I had to start
We’ve been out of touch
Oh I had to start
Can’t keep myself away

I hope to be with you
And ain’t no other way
We speak each others minds
That’s the only kind of touch
But I’ll always be here for you all the time
So in a different kind of way
I still love you just the same
It seems to me we’ve lost our touch

Oh I had to start
We’ve been out of touch
Oh I had to start
Can’t keep myself away
Oh I had to start
We’ve been out of touch
Oh I had to start
Can’t keep myself away
