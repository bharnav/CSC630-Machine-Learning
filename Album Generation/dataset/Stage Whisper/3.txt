White telephone
Pick up the receiver
Wait for the tone
Wait for the tone
It’s droning
There’s no one on the line
It’s droning
There’s no one on the line

The rotary
Finger into the hole
Pull back, let go
Pull back, let go
It’s ringing
No one answering
It’s ringing
There’s no one answering

All our words go into the wire
Just like a ghost
Just like a ghost
It’s fleeting like light from a room
Into darkness from an empty room
I’m fleeting like light in a room
Into darkness crawling after you
