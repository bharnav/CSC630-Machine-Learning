In paradiscos
We get bored with breaking windows
Turning beggars into heroes
Bodies moving innuendos
In paradiscos
We're confined to only pleasure
Metal pin take a measure
When you're a flame you'll burn forever
And forever

I'll burn an effigy out of the past
Then our clothes catch fire as we dance
And I wonder how long they could last
Walking through a room full of broken glass

In paradiscos
We'll make a million out of zeroes
Split an apple with an arrow
Play the violin like Nero
In paradiscos
Into the eye of an angel
You can fly like a mosquito
And turn into the magnate of the people
In paradiscos

I'll burn an effigy out of the past
Then our clothes catch fire as we dance
And I wonder how long they could last
Walking through a room full of broken glass

I'll burn an effigy out of the past
Then our clothes catch fire as we dance
And I wonder how long they could last
Walking through a room full of broken glass
