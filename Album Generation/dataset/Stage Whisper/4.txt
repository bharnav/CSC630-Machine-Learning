Anna
Take me back to the home
Anna
Once I knew it’s getting born

I’ve been in the world
With no air to sing
Still I could hear
Your voice calling in

Takes too long
To forget you
If I know you'll never stay
Too long
To forget you
I’m still waiting for a chance

Anna
All I see is your face
Anna
Same great heart still away

I want you to know
I was so young then
Don’t wanna feel
On my own again

Takes too long
To forget you
If I know you'll never stay
Too long
To forget you
I’m still waiting for a chance
