There's only one thing I think you should know
You've got to be strong when the cold as the day
Got to realize when there's nothing left to say
Good things come and go
One day you will know

You've got to let go, yeah you've got to let go
Yeah you've got to let go

When your night feels longer than the day
Love's a wrecking ball and you're in its way
Feels like everyone you know has close the door
Just don't feel like keeping on, anymore
Got to make up your mind
Our wounds heal in time

You've got to let go, yeah you've got to let go
Yeah you've got to let go

You've got to let go, yeah you've got to let go
Yeah you've got to let go

It's a deadly revolver, it's a deadly revolver
It's a deadly revolver to your head

It's a deadly revolver, it's a deadly revolver
It's a deadly revolver to your head

It's a deadly revolver, it's a deadly revolver
It's a deadly revolver to your head

It's a deadly revolver, it's a deadly revolver
It's a deadly revolver to your head
