My head is pounding, my mouth is dry
My eyes are burning, oh I can see you lowering
Pan de sal, Blanc Ménage
Holy holy, tension turn me inside out
Inside out, inside out

Seraphim, please don’t pull me down
It’s just a drowning man reaching for me now
Seraphim, please don’t pull me down
It’s just a drowning man reaching for me now
Please don’t pull me down

I want release from absolution
I want release from-
I want rele-
I want release

Terrible angels, infant sorrows
Twilight horses, they will walk with me again
I can hear them, oh I can hear them
My ancestor, my protector, my tormentor
And a lot unknown, and a lot unknown, oh oh

Seraphim, please don’t pull me down
It’s just a drowning man reaching for me now
Seraphim, please don’t pull me down
It’s just a drowning man reaching for me now
I want release from absolution
Benediction
Good intentions
Blue black flowers
Poison wine
Blood ecstatic
Annihilate the sense of things
I am born into these breaking hours
Out of change change change
