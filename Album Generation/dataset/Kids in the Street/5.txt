Shot by bedroom eyes
And that screaming silence frozen fire hypnotize
And I can't disguise the words that I steal from your lips
A ransom for your body, bind your fingertips
Then just so be it

And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
And I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you

We're both right
We feast on poisoned apples and I'm just in time
But I'm petrified
Oh I take my time and you're the clock
And that second hand you place on me
My heart could stop
And it's tick tock tick tock

And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
'Cause I needed to
And I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you

And every single day
I remember
You never take away
Even if it's wrong
And I walk out the door

And I walk out the door
I walk right out the door
And next to you
'Cause I needed to
And I never asked for more
I get my fix if I get close to you
With just a dose of you

And every single day
I remember
You never take away
Even if it's wrong, yeah
And I walk out the door
I walk out the door
And I walk out the door
