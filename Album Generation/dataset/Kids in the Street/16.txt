[Verse 1]
I got to breathe
You can't take that from me
Because it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave
And that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind
I know there are times
You're so impossible that I should sign a waiver
And you will find
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go

[Chorus]
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows

[Verse 2]
There was a day
You threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay
But since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through
And I know there are times
You're so impossible and you ask me to go

[Chorus]
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know

[Verse 3]
As I lay in solitude
Oh what's a boy supposed to do
I shake the very thought of you
Me together, I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late
All I do is wait and wait
You're never coming home to me
That's the hardest thing to see
I got to breathe
You can't take that from me
I can finally say we're through

[Chorus]
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
Pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you ever go
You'll feel when the wind blows
