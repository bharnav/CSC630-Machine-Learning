[Verse 1]
I still remember that empty look left on your face
You took the pictures but you left the frames
All we had written, well, it's been erased
Something that i had to do
I cut you deep, you're bleeding through
You're every single shade of blue
I'm staring right in front of you

[Chorus]
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need, make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down

[Verse 2]
Here you left scattered
Like wishes i led to your room
I bury my face in your pillow
Just to smell your perfume
Outside i'm hungry
But inside i'm just consumed
Tell me how am i supposed to breathe
When losing you is choking me?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I fucking hate this town
I wanna burn it down
I never felt so cold
And when i burn this town
I hope i burn it down
And leave me on my own
I fucking hate this town (just see me)
I wanna burn it down (just see me)
I never felt so cold (just see me)

[Outro]
I hear your heartbeat slowing down
Slow
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down (heartbeat slowing down)
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around (heartbeat slowing down)
You can take my life (take my life)
All you need (all you need), make me right
How can you sleep with your heartbeat slowing down?
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
