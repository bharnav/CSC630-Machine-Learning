[Verse 1]
Doctor, doctor
Could you please just give me something for the state i'm in
I'm having trouble and society believe i got it wrong again
I'm one month sober i don't think i'm getting over my predicament
But if i jumped out of the window what would she say

[Chorus]
It's not on me, it's all on you
We can't deny the things we do
I can't believe her pretty feet walked over me
All over me

[Verse 2]
Help me, help me doc
It seems to be an awful lot for me to understand
I know i'm not a specimen
The troubles and the mess i'm in
I should be dead
He said, listen son
I think you've had all your fun
It's time to be a man
So you better quit your bitching
Think about what the people would say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Wait until tomorrow, and it's gone
So long
Wait until tomorrow, so long
It's gone
Wait until tomorrow
You beg and steal and borrow till it's gone

[Verse 3]
(He don't got a lot but he's got all he needs)
I need someone to love
(And all he's got well it's all that he needs)
Somebody help me cause i could hear the voices in the tube
To get me through anything i do and anything will do good by me
A little pill, a little thrill, should i take it i think i will
And anything will do good so as long as it's always too good
Either way i don't give a damn what you people all say
All now boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus][x2]
