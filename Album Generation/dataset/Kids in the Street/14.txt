I paint the moon, you draw the stars
We can do anything that you want
The night is dumb and young and I guess we're just babies
You let me lead but I still follow
You tell me not to think of tomorrow
Steal, beg, and I borrow just to keep you with me

And your hand, my hand, just push, the world away

Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right
I know all along
When I can't see it you share the light
Spend all our days just to save the night
Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong

So I'm just lost but you're a mess too
What does all the worrying get you?
Ever since the day I met you you've been stronger than me
The way you fall out of your cloudy darkened skies
Then I'll pick you off the floor and we'll go dance out in the lightning you and I

You and I, me and you
Either way you don't know what to do

Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right
I know all along
When I can't see it you share the light
Spend all our days just to save the night
Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right

Be honest to me
No I'm never gonna string you on
Just be good to me
Please, please, don't do me wrong

Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right
I know all along
When I can't see it you share the light
This world's got teeth just let it bite
Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right
Don't do me wrong
Do me right, do me right
Be honest to me
No I'm never gonna treat you wrong
Just be good to me
Don't do me wrong
