[Verse 1]
Down, down, down
Into the cloudy sea
You love me like a car wreck
Wrapped around a tree

Down, down, down
It's the only way to go
Sometimes it's hard to hold on
Without letting go

[Chorus]
We'll walk in the water 'cause I can hardly breathe
We'll leave the ones who love us, you are all I ever need
Just sand in the water, drown next to me

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
'Cause the curtain has to close
We take a bow and face the crowd
And realize we're all in the show

Now, just now
You can rest your weary eyes
It's only hard when what you're living for
Makes you feel dead alive

[Chorus]
Walk in the water, 'cause I can hardly breathe
We can leave the ones who love us, you are all I ever need
We'll tell each other lies that we know we'll both believe
Just sand in the water, drown next to me

[Bridge]
I'm never letting go, caught in the undertow
Take your love, heart and soul
Dive down, 'cause this world is drying us both out

[Chorus]
We'll walk in the water, 'cause I can hardly breathe
We'll leave the ones who love us, you are all I ever need, yeah
We'll tell each other lies that we know we'll both believe, yeah
We're just sand in the water, just sand in the water
Just stand in the water, drown next to me
