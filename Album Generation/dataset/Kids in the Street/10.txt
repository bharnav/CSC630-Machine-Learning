[Verse 1]
Say the words I cannot say
Say them on another day
Fragile words like these will cut your tongue
Was I good enough, was I bad enough
When I wanted more, yeah, you had enough
But nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
And every slow-lit cigarette
That nervous hands can barely get the courage
I could always feel your eyes
And those dresses you made look like gowns
You're a sinner but the devil even turned you down

[Chorus]
Cause, nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you
And nobody's going to try for you
And nobody's going to lie for you
And nobody's going to do like I for you

[Verse 2]
Hold me like you never could
I'll hold you like I said I would
Air or light won't breathe nor shine between
With your feather lips, yeah you fly away
Well i hope they come back down someday

[Chorus]
Cause, nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's going to do like I for you
Somebody's getting by for you
I don't bend, I just break in two
Somebody like me
I'd die for you
