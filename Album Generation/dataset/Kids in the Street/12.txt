[Verse 1]
What makes you so damn sure that you're perfect huh?
I can't explain you, just like a nightmare I can't remember
What makes you so damn sure that you're worth it huh?
You're just a bad trip, I can't come back from since
Last December
Walk, into, the room, and you steal everyone
I see you, walk, into, the room, and you kill everyone
Cause I know

[Chorus]
My somedayâ€™s gone now
Bye bye [x2]
Just let it go

[Verse 2]
How did you figure that I'd let you cut me down?
Right at the knees I fall like a dead man
Out of an airplane
How do you figure that I'd let you drag me around?
You got my number - Draw me a story, tell me a picture
Walk, into, the room, and you've had everyone
And then you walk, into, the room, it's so sad
Everybody already knows

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause even when I live, a piece of me will die
Win some lose some she won't bat an eye
Even when I sleep, I see you in my dreams
Forget about it one day damn I see you
Walk, into, the room, and you fucked everyone
And then you walk, into, the room, well so what
Everybody already knows

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let it go [x5]
