I'll never forget when we started out
The beat of the drum, a face in the crowd
It's better this way, it's better this way
How far we've come, now not a soul can change

Remember the road running under our feet
We'd shoot for the stars but we'd aim at the trees
It's better this way, it's better this way
Gambling with life, it was our turn to play

It's time
Only when you look forward can you see behind
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride

Every trial and every test
We'd drive to the east and we'd fly to the west
Just running away, just running away
We can't be different cause they're all the same

Every night that we'd ever start
And every beat of every heart
Is running away, just running away
Catching our breath at the end we could say

It's time
Only when you look forward could you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go of life
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride

Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time

Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time

For some it's a god, for me it's a fact
We'd make a mistake and try to take 'em all back
It's better this way, it's better this way
Out of the grind and then into the grave

It's time
Only when you look forward can you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go alive
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
