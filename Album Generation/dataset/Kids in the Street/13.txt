How long has it been since i ripped you
These paper cut hands need to stop
And lonely's a plague but it skipped you
I suffer till you cut me up

Then i bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last time

Well you put yourself together
But pieces of you slipped away
And somehow forever whenever
Put me on my knees at your feet today

And then I bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last time

You'll never forgive me, I can not forgive you
Yeah I fill you full of little lies
You're still hungry for the truth
And I know we've got problems
Let's just try to solve them

But they know

In your mind I stay with you
I know in time you'll feel it to

Bleed into your mind
I need to make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last
And I bleed into your mind
With a love that'll make you blind
I bleed into your mind
I need you one last
