[Verse 1]
And I was a boy from school
Helplessly helping all the rules
And there was a boy at school
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools
And there was a girl at school
Blaming all the words she learned from home
Nothing could keep her a child
Long hours don't you know we try

[Hook]
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong

[Verse 2]
Now I met you on the street
Heartlessly breaking rules, we meet
Lives are found and loves are lost
Say goodbye to nothing everything caused
Now I find you on my street
Breaking rules, hopelessly we meet
Lives are found but loves are lost
Say goodbye to everything, nothing caused

[Hook]

[Bridge] [x3]
I got, I got lost
You said this was the way back

[Hook]
