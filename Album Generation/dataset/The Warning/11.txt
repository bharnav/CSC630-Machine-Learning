Deck shoes, part green
Part burgundy, your size
Done gone gone
A healthy body, emergency
Flesh show, flesh gone gone

And my no go
Joyful, careful, bespoke
Gone gone gone

All of, every single, urgency, nothing
Gone gone gone

I'm washed up, washed out
The surf's up, I'm made of doubt
For what I need to say

Explain all, has happened, to me and you
It just won't, wash with you
It won't wash with you
