[Chorus 1 x2]
Come around and around just like we breakdown
With a fist and a fall we meet with the floor
On the ropes in the oak of making once more
All in the name of what we're not sure

[Verse 1]
Lay down in our beds, it's caught in our heads
There's a room full of notes that build to a dread
Is there room to ignore what we are here for
Turn on the lights and open the door

[Chorus 2 x2]
Ring on your finger, a block on your heart
Hold on my friend, the end is a start

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 x2]
