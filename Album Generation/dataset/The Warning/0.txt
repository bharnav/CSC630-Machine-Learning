[Verse 1 x2]
Every year, exactly this time of year
They go up, balloon up into the air
And hold onto one who is near
Remember everything is here

[Verse 2 x2]
Every year about this time of year
I am with you as if you are here
I remember the way it fell through
You and all we all could do

[Verse 3]
I hope that you will be careful
The stories you told are hopeful
I hope that they aren't just artful
I hope that you will be careful
