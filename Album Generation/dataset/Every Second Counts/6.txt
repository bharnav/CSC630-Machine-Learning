Thought that I was in control
And in my mind you were mine, what did I know?
I didn't listen when they said
That you were fake, manipulating boys to bed

I thought they had you wrong
The morning you were gone

Everytime I see you face
I can see the games you play
Nobody can break hearts better
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
Turns you on
Always getting what you want
Made me believe that we'd be together
Why do you have to be so damn clever?

We were over from the start
Intertwined just in time to fall apart (fall apart)
I can't believe I missed the signs
You were cold and they all told me not to try

But I thought they had you wrong
The morning you were gone
Just vanished from my life
Didn't even say goodbye

Everytime I see you face
I can see the games you play
Nobody can break hearts better
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
Turns you on
Always getting what you want
Made me believe that we'd be together
Why do you have to be so damn clever?

You pulled all the right strings
Saying all the right things
Now that you've gotten what you wanted you don't want it anymore

Everytime I see you face
I can see the games you play
Nobody can break hearts better
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
Turns you on
Always getting what you want
Made me believe that we'd be together
Why do you have to be so damn clever?

Oh
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
Oh
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
Oh

Made me believe that we would be together
Why do you have to be so damn clever?
