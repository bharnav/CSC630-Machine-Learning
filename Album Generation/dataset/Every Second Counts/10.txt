She says, I don't take her seriously
And I don't, so I guess I'd have to agree
I didn't mean that
I really mean that
I know, she gets mad at me all the time
But that's fine, I don't let it ruin my night
I didn't mean that
I really mean that

I watch what I say
Say what I should
Something you said I misunderstood
I'll figure it out as soon as I figure it out
I could get there if I would just move
I like what I have and love what I lose
Figure it out as soon as I figure it out
Yeah

She says, one more time and she's out the door
Yeah yeah, haven't I heard that one before?
I didn't mean that
I really mean that
Come on, I wish she would cut me some slack
It's her fault, she's the one who keeps coming back
I didn't mean that
I really mean that

I watch what I say
Say what I should
Something you said I misunderstood
I'll figure it out as soon as I figure it out
I could get there if I would just move
I like what I have and love what I lose
Figure it out as soon as I figure it out

All my days are all the same
I should mind but all my time's spent wasting time away

Watch what I say
Say what I should
Something you said I misunderstood
I'll figure it out as soon as I figure it out
I could get there if I would just move
I like what I have and love what I lose
I'll figure it out as soon as I figure it out

I'll figure it out
Figure it out
I'll figure it out
Figure it out
