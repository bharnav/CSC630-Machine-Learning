Love, love, love, love, love, love
Woo!

You were everything I wanted
You were everything a girl could be
Then you left me brokenhearted
Now you do not mean a thing to me
All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you
Now that it's over
I don't even know what I liked about you
Brought you around
And you just brought me down
Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you

I really don't like you...

Thought that everything was perfect
Isn't that how it's supposed to be
Thought you thought that I was worth it
Now I think a little differently
All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you
Now that it's over
I don't even know what I liked about you
Brought you around
And you just brought me down
Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you

Now that it's over
You can't hurt me
Now that it's over
You can't bring me down

(Oh, oh...)

All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you
(I really don't like you)
Now that it's over
I don't even know what I liked about you
(I liked about you)
Brought you around
And you just brought me down
(Hate) Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you

I really don't like you
I really don't like you
I really don't like you
