Lately when I go to sleep and kiss
I feel you pulling away
I know something is a miss
But what it is, you won't say
If I've done something to upset you
Believe me, that was never my plan
But how can I fix it, standing out here in the cold?
I'm a sensitive man

You don't always have to speak
You can say it with a look
Even across a crowded room
I can read it like a book
But other times when there's something on your mind
Make it as plain as you can
Don't freeze me baby, I know, dinkey doo
I'm a sensitive man

I'm a sensitive man
You can hear that in my song
I'm a sensitive man
My first impressions could steal you wrong

Sent silly, my one desire
Was to make you happy again
But I can't come back till you let me back in
I'm a sensitive man

I'm a sensitive man
You can hear that in my song
I'm a sensitive man
My first impressions might well steal you wrong

Sensitive man
(Out in the cold)
Trying to do good
(But so misunderstood)
Sensitive man
(Man)
