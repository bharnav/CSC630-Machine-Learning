House for sale
I'm moving out
I'm moving on
This bird has flown
House for sale
I'll tell you where to redirect my mail

House for sale
Take a look inside
This is where love
Once did reside
But now it's gone
And that's the reason I'll be traveling on

Well the roof has given in to the weather
And the windows rattle and moan
Paint is peeling, cracks in the ceiling
Whatever's happened to my happy home
House for sale I've had enough
I'll send a van to get my stuff house for sale
I'm leaving like I'm getting out of jail

Do do, do do, who who who who
Do do do do do, do do do do do

The stairs are alarmingly shaky
And the carpet threadbare and worn
Fence needs mending
Garden needs tending
How soon it's become overgrown

Oh house for sale
I've had enough
I'll send a van to pick up my stuff
House for sale
I'm leaving like I'm getting out of jail
I'm leaving like I'm getting out of jail

House for sale
I'm talking to you
Because with time, care, cash
Peace, love and understanding
It can be as good as new
House for sale, house for sale
