I'm on a lonely street
But nobody told my feet
They're walking on air
'Cause somebody cares for me

I'm in a blue hotel
Room like a prison cell
But I'd sleep on the stairs
If somebody cares for me

In a dim saloon
Anytime before noon
There's an empty chair
'Cause somebody cares for me

I find my self in church
I don't come in here much
But I'm sayin' a prayer
'Cause somebody cares for me

It's like I filled a hole that was shaped all wrong
With a piece of a puzzle that's been missing all along

If you think I'm glad
I'll say you more than that
I'm glad as can be
That somebody cares for me

Do Do Doo do Doo do do

It's like I filled a hole up
That was shaped all wrong
With a piece of a jigsaw puzzle
That's been missing for too too long

If you think I'm glad
I'll say you got that dad
I got more than my share
'Cause somebody cares for me

I'm glad so glad
I'm glad as can be somebody cares for me
