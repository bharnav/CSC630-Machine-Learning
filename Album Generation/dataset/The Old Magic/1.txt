I'm sixty-one years old now, Lord I never thought I'd see thirty
Though I know this road is someway to go I can't help think in on
Will I be beloved and celebrated for my mystery climb?
Or just another bum when it comes to checkout time?

I'm fearful my chances of crossing over Jordan into glory
May be compromised by the pies I've had my fingers in
Must I be condemned, forever demned for some long forgotten crime?
Or singing Rock of Ages with the angels soon after checkout time?

And when it's time to pay the bill
I'm gonna get my lap and then I will
Throw it in the first cabbing line
I'm gonna make this the day to remember 'till checkout time

Must I be condemned, forever demned for some long forgotten crime?
Or singing Rock of Ages with the angels soon after checkout time?

(Checkout time) checkout time
(Checkout time) checkout time
(Checkout time) checkout time...
