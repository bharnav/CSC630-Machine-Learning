Shame on the rain
For making me twice as blue
It's raining in my heart
On my window too

Days like this
Have put out the flame
I've got that smoke in my eyes
Shame on the rain

You'd think it's enough
To know she's gone
But with my kind of luck
It could rain from now on

Now that I'd lost
This heartbreaking game
You'd think the sun would shine
Shame on the rain

Shame on the rain
For adding to my distress
She took away the sun
Left me with the rest

I've had my share
Of sorrow and pain
Look what a day it is
Shame on the rain
Just look what a day it is
Shame on the rain
