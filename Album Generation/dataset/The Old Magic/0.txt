You've practiced and rehearsed
But in your heart you know
It's too late
Experience should tell you
Never get your story too straight
You'd better steel yourself
And prepare for
Some blues to descend
'Cause you've broken something this time
Stoplight roses can't mend

You've dusted off your shame face
In the mirror behind the bathroom door
That little-boy-lost look
That used to work so well
Doesn't anymore
If you believe your same-old used-to-be
Will see you through
You'll last about as long as stoplight roses do

Stoplight roses
In their sad array
Love's promise in cellophane lace
Or dead giveaway?
You'll need time to devise
A stylish plan
And you'll do it driving over to
The stoplight roses man

And if you believe your same-old used-to-be
Will see you through
You'll last about as long as stoplight roses do
