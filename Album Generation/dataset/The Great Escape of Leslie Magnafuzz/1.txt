Now I don't know where I'm going
And I'm trying to forget where I've been

Time creeps forward
But the feeling still remains
The emptiness she left me
When my baby went away

Now I don't know where I'm going
And I'm trying to forget where I've been

Keep on moving
Now the lonesome path I roam
Thinking of what could have been
If I didn't do her wrong

Now I don't know where I'm going
And I'm trying to forget where I've been

Trouble keeps coming back to me
I always let her in

Sweet little thing
You my baby
Sweet little thing
You my baby

I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you

Now I don't know where I'm going
And I'm trying to forget where I've been
Trouble keeps coming back to me
I always let her in
