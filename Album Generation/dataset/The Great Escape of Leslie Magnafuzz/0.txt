Take me in your sky
Take me in your plane
The Rancho Tehama Airport
Is only a few blocks away

I'm confined in solitude
In these walls
I'm drowning in my shame
In my shame

Confined in my solitude
In these walls I'm disguising shame

Now I don't care
How they take me
Away from here, anywhere
How they take me

Can't go from day to day
I can't awake me
Can't hide from all my pain
The shame, it breaks me

Let me in your mind
Stitch me, I'm unfrayed
It's only a matter of time
Before I lose my ways

I'm confined in solitude
In these walls
I'm drowning in my shame
In my shame

Confined in my solitude
In these walls I'm disguising shame
No, I don't care how they take me
