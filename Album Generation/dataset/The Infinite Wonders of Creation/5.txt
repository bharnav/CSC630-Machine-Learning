Source of cosmic link gently lead
My romantic dream
Seasons of white snowy true words
Inspiration's soul
Who speaks for all
Awakes new hope

My heart eyes are trapped by that game
Magic crystal rain
Melancholic wonder she lies
In her starless night
Queen of silent realms of shade

I WRITE FOR YOU
MY MYSTICAL MOON
IN THIS LONG SNOWY COLD WINTER'S NIGHT
AND WHILE YOU SHINE
MAGIC RIDES
WHILE PAGES FILL LINES ON THEIR OWN
I WRITE FOR YOU
MY MYSTICAL MOON
IN THIS LONG SNOWY COLD WINTER'S NIGHT
AND WHILE YOU SHINE
MAGIC RIDES
WHILE PAGES FILL LINES ON THEIR OWN
ANGELS ARE NOT SO FAR FROM ME NOW
OH, SILVER MOON

Feelings flow between icy wind
To eternity
Melancholic wonder she lies
In her starless night
Queen of silent realms of shade

I WRITE FOR YOU
MY MYSTICAL MOON
IN THIS LONG SNOWY COLD WINTER'S NIGHT
AND WHILE YOU SHINE
MAGIC RIDES
WHILE PAGES FILL LINES ON THEIR OWN
I WRITE FOR YOU
MY MYSTICAL MOON
IN THIS LONG SNOWY COLD WINTER'S NIGHT
AND WHILE YOU SHINE
MAGIC RIDES
WHILE PAGES FILL LINES ON THEIR OWN
GREAT SILVER MOONLIGHT
COSMIC DIVINE RHYME
VEIL WITH YOUR MYST MY ABSTRACTION
UNTIL PRINCESS DAWN'S NEW AWAKE
ANGELS ARE NOT SO FAR FROM ME NOW
OH, SILVER MOON
