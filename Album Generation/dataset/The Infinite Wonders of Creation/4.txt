Infinite visions of water and lands
Learn to discover the queen's holy reign
Source of majestic and colourful days
Mountains, rivers and lakes

With the shadows of winter revealing
All the mist of the white sleeping woods
While the wolf is in love with the moonlight
I can't find the words for you

THERE'S NO WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE
THE GREAT MIRACLE OF LIFE
MY BELOVED WILD JUMPING DOLPHINS
AND THE WHALES' IMMORTAL CHANT
AT THE LIMITS OF THE SKY
SHINES THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF OUR MOTHER
THANKS TO HER I AM ALIVE
IT'S THE MIRACLE OF LIFE

Canyons of wild rock and white icy plains
Art and emotion that run in my veins
I feel true passion inspired by your might
And your breathtaking wonders

With the magic of summer revealing
All the treasures kept by the blue sea
And the lonely sound of the ocean
Tide's and moon's poetic link

THERE'S NO WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE
THE GREAT MIRACLE OF LIFE
MY BELOVED WILD JUMPING DOLPHINS
AND THE WHALES' IMMORTAL CHANT
AT THE LIMITS OF THE SKY
SHINES THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF OUR MOTHER
THANKS TO HER I AM ALIVE
IT'S THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
