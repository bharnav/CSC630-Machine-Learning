One new grey day
How to find her
In this cloudy
Empty sorrow?

Stolen future
Wasted years?
In the silence
Notes like tears

THE SEVEN NOTES - A TRAGIC CHORD
2 BARS OF SUDDEN MELANCHOLIC FALL
A POEM WRITTEN IN MINOR BETWEEN DARK AND LIGHT
SO MYSTIC AND DIVINE
SHE RAN AWAY, SHE WON'T BE BACK
BUT STILL HER LOVE CAN SURVIVE THROUGH MY HAND
IN THESE NOTES OF REAL PASSION STILL SAD BUT ALIVE
SO MYSTIC AND DIVINE

Tragic vision
Killed emotion
Sad remembrance
Of a lost world

Holy music
Please allow me
Just to feel her
In your heartbeat

THE SEVEN NOTES - A TRAGIC CHORD
2 BARS OF SUDDEN MELANCHOLIC FALL
A POEM WRITTEN IN MINOR BETWEEN DARK AND LIGHT
SO MYSTIC AND DIVINE
SHE RAN AWAY, SHE WON'T BE BACK
BUT STILL HER LOVE CAN SURVIVE THROUGH MY HAND
IN THESE NOTES OF REAL PASSION STILL SAD BUT ALIVE
SO MYSTIC AND DIVINE
