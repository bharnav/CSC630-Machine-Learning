Illusion, Division
Transcendence of angels eon
Poetic, Romantic
Cosmic at the means

Etherial, Material
Eternal but still so mortal
Arcana, Sovrana
Mother of all dreams

Emotion, Devotion
Grand mirror of souls horizons
Lost frequence reflected
On the velvet sea

Wide open dream

Intensive, impressive
Lost freckle of chaos and order
Refraction of wonders
Of a time it soars

Ambition, Devotion
Grand mirror of souls emotion
Lost frequence reflected
On the velvet sea

Wide open dream

Mother of Golden sunshine
Mountains and oceans
Free are the splendours of your conscience
And reveal your mystic spirit to your son

My queen of northern sunlight
Paint skies with rays of light
Lie in the infinity of cosmos
And embrace my lost eternal soul

Mother of Golden sunshine
Mountains and oceans
Free are the splendours of your conscience
And reveal your mystic spirit to your son

Mother of Golden sunshine
Mountains and oceans
Free are the splendours of your conscience
And reveal your mystic spirit to your son

My queen of northern sunlight
Paint skies with rays of light
Lie in the infinity of cosmos
And embrace my lost eternal soul

Mother of all
