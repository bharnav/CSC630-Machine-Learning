[Verse 1: Tom Meighan]
I feel like the time has come
A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster?
I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile
Perfecting my style
I knew you wanted a reaction

[Chorus: Tom Meighan, Sergio Pizzorno]
Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Try light em' up

[Verse 2: Tom Meighan]
Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter, through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you?
The flame I need to heat the silver
You bring Gods to their knees
Pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the Generals from their duty

[Chorus: Tom Meighan, Sergio Pizzorno]
Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Try light em' up

[?]

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Meighan]
Who made you the master?
The lady caster?
I found you looking for a good time
Now this blood and glitter
It tastes so bitter
There's no retreat, for I surrender

[Chorus: Tom Meighan, Sergio Pizzorno]
Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Flip the switch
