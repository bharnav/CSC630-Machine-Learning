[Verse 1]
Out of my garden, passed the battle cruiser
We jumped over cemetery gates
There on the wasteland, we saw the horizon
I noticed your pupils dilate

[Chorus 1]
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

[Verse 2]
Came from the booze and the fags generation
And prayed for the mayhem to start
You said you were foolish but I saw the genius
In pulling the stitches apart

[Chorus 2]
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

[Bridge]
So raise your glass to the ones who have passed
And the ones that got away, ohh

[Chorus 3]
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
I saw her face, way out in space
