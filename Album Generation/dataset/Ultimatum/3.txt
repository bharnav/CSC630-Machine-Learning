You play hard to want
You're hard to crumble up
I belong to someone already gone
Hard to want
You're hard to crumble up
I belong to someone gone before I was born

She's was gone
She was gone before I was born

The last time we crossed
I held you under
Wanting to feel you
Wanting to breathe
And I thought
You wanted to feel like breathing

You have delicate hands
And I know why
You have delicate hands
And I know why

There's nothing left to do
Not when you
Have the ocean for a view

The last time we crossed
I held you under
Wanting to feel you
Wanting to breathe
And I thought
You wanted to feel like breathing
And I thought
You wanted to feel like breathing

The weight of this hairstyle is making me lazy
I think I'm going to leave it up all night
I want to feed you butter-rum candy
But someone beat you to me
Beat you to me
Someone beat you to me

The last time we crossed
I held you under
Wanting to feel you
Wanting to breathe
And I thought
You wanted to feel like breathing

The last time we crossed
I held you under
Wanting to feel you
Wanting to breathe
And I thought
You wanted to feel like breathing
