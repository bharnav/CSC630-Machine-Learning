Student, why do you dream of me
When you dream of your acre of trees?
It was agreed, I came to burn leaves
It’s all I ever claimed to do
A plowman I’ll never grow into.

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I’ve got their song in my head
Ah

Blue, in the broad light of day
Your claws snag on my face
Say it: I wish we were naked
And I wish that I could take it
When you turn on me

I don’t want my words twisted
I don’t want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope I can keep seeing you
As long as you don’t say you’re
Falling in love

Crave translates into slave;
No one can harness the rain
And I can make myself into rain
You’ll feel me on your cheek
And on your sleeve

I can feel you about to forget
