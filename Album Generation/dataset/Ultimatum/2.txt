Our new set can talk and think
I'm upset it was so hard to train
Our old set was quite a bore
We yelled at it but it didn't hear
My new friends have messages
They reach me wherever I am

Everything is talking, everything

Nameless friends
All know my name
They know me, they help me
Our new set is a good set
It's a big set, a really big set

Everything is talking, everything

I'll miss:
The waitresses
The cops
The appointments
The shops
The envelopes
The change
I'll miss the change

My bank is hip-hop jazz
They're too street, I don't get it
I won't eat a machine
But what if they ask me?
What if it says my name?

Everything is talking, everything
