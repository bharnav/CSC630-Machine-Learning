The interview where you spoke
To the bleach in the stone
You should have brought some tea
Outside where the light
Coats us in marzipan
In pools of breast milk
I had to bury my daughter today
And I can't think about it too much
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe

I am down to the beach
Smoke condensed from telling stories
Strolling through the neighborhood
Clanking steel and discolored
Because you made a truce of rubber
Because you made a truce of rubber
Because you made a truce of rubber
Because you made a truce of rubber
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe

Abiding in the unborn is symmetry
And that one is always the refugee
Abiding in the unborn is symmetry
And that one is always the refugee
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe
You see a buck from the sky
Trample a wandering doe
