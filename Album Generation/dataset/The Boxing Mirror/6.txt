As your last breath hung forever
Were you dancin' behind the beat?
Hold her close now
Don't let her go now
Take her with you where you sleep
Whisper tell her
What it feels like
To be empty, to be free
Where you sleep now
Where you sleep now
Where you sleep

There's no reason
To deny her
All the promises we have made
So take her with you
For she loves you
And her life is hidden in the wait
Where she sleeps now
Where she sleeps now
Where she sleeps
