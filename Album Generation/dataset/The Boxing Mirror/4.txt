I'd climb a ladder just to see you
I have no eyes but I can feel
Two snakes entwine so I can be you
This ladder climbs from me to you

La Bufadora will explode soon
In liquid splendor sculptured trees
Amongst the oaks the shapes are shifting
A shift to meld you into me

Let's sleep away the pain we suffer
The medicine is in our dreams
Fly away like Caracaras
This ladder climbs from me to you
