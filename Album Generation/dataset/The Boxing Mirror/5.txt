If you could see you
The way that I see you
The way I perceive you
No, I never came to deceive you
Or sit high above you
Or lock doors behind you
But only to love you
Inside the refrain

But I just might break this time

Mothers and fathers
They don't have all the answers
Can't see past the chain link
They laid on the line
So break another picture
Yeah, or better yet sit there
Inside the stillness
Yeah, this time

But I just might break this time
Yeah this time

Whoever told you
There'd be no danger
Nothing to fear here
Yeah in this house of pain
So speak to me softly
Yeah and tell me you love me
And we'll join together
Inside the refrain

But I just might break this time
Yeah I just might break this time
I just might break this time
Oh this time
Yeah this time
This time
