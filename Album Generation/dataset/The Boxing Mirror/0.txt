Have another drink on me
I've been empty since Arizona
I turned my back on me
And I faced the face of who I thought I was

One kiss just led to another
One kiss just fades into love

Blow another smoke ring for me
I've been straight so straight since Arizona
You say I've lost my way
But it's all a dream
Since Arizona

One kiss just led to another
One kiss just fades into lover
Arizona

Have another drink on me
I've been empty since Arizona
I turned my back on me
And I faced the face of who I thought I was

One kiss just led to another
One kiss just fades into love

In Arizona
In Arizona
In Arizona
