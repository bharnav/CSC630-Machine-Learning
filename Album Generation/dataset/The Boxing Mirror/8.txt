I died a little today
I put up a fight
And carved a simple hello
You can hold to the light
So no one will know
We died a little today

Gonna learn how to give
Not to simply get by
Or to barely hang on
For the sake of goodbye
Baby maybe you'll know
We died a little today
We died a little today
We died a little

It's a strange way we live
To have been her before
And leave nothing behind
As we move towards the door
No, there's no one to blame
We died a little today
We died a little today
We died a little
