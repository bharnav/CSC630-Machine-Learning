I saw the Good Son
Walking with Leo Canton
Down the boulevard
With Leo Canton
His beginning froze
As he took a jab
I saw the Good Son
At the underground Hall of Fame

I saw the Good Son
On the arm of a Princess
His beginning froze
Under the weight of the sea
I saw the Good Son
On the arm of a Princess
She was wise and strong
Spit out the raging sea

No more the Good Son
He lost his sense of space
His beginning froze
Under the weight of the sun
No more the Good Son
Just walking around
He's looking for Leo Canton
