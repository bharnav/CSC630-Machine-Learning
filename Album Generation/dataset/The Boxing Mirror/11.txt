Here she comes
All she sees she keeps
No one gonna take it away
Her eyes are young and old
The kind that ancients sold
To celebrate a victory
The trail she leaves
Is dark, doubt and dread
And all the mouths she's ever fed
Round, round, round like the world she turns
It's a playback stuck inside your head

Yeah, I see you for the first time
And baby I just wanna leave
Yeah, I know you it's the last time
I'm all messed up
I got nothing to take your place

There's a past she keeps
In a depression jar
She opens like a secret cave
Who she was before
And what her life's become
Is built upon the love she craves
I'm going down down down
There's nothing here
And baby you can't
Hold me up
I'm going down down down
Even deeper still
'Cause this world has gotten so fucked up

Yeah, I see you for the first time
And baby I just wanna leave
Yeah, I know you it's the last time
I'm all messed up
I got nothing to take your place
Yeah take your place

Yeah, I see you for the first time
And baby I just wanna leave
Yeah, I know you it's the last time
I'm all messed up
I got nothing to take your place
Yeah take your place
Yeah take your place
Yeah take your place
