I believe all that you've written
I believe all that you know
Has somehow been mistaken
For the truth inside this show
We weren't looking for love
We weren't looking for love

Two strangers make a fire
Wrap themselves in heat
And feed off their desire
As they watch the desert sleep
They weren't looking for love
They weren't looking for love
One true love
One true love
One true love

They say the party's over
The sacrifice complete
I'm feeling so much older
Since we drank up all the heat
We weren't looking for love
We weren't looking for love
One true love
One true love
One true love
One true love
