[Verse 1]
The moon is brighter than the sun
My shadow is long as night and it follows me
As I drive your way
The moon hangs from the sky
The tree hangs from the branches
Water lies flat in the gutter
While a rose climbs up the staircase
And falls upon the landing
Falls upon the landing
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome, yeah, I could cry

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I come home at night I'm glad that you are sleeping
So I don't have to pretend that you are thinking of me
Or something like that, in the middle of the night
She really is breathtaking as she lies there softly sleeping
Undisturbed, and I wish my breath, my voice, my touch
Could awaken her
Yeah, awaken her again
I'm under a spell, her name
Oh, I spell her name
I'm under a spell, her name
Oh, yeah, I spell her name

[Verse 3]
There really is no reason for the way that I am feeling
It could've been the weather
Or something less than that
I need to shed this old skin for something that's much lighter
Maybe different colors
Maybe not so tight
Maybe not so tight
I'm under a spell, her name
Oh, yeah, I know her name
Uh huh, I know her name
Oh, yeah, I spell her name

[Verse 4]
It singes and it burns like a delicate veil
The pressure of her kiss
Feels like it's all over now
I never could jump from high enough
I never could jump from high enough
A third story jump ain't high enough
It's just a mess on Market Street
I'm under a spell, her name
Oh, yeah, I spell her name
Oh, yeah, I spell her name
Uh huh, I spell her name

[Verse 5]
Palo Alto Hotel at Sacramento & Polk
The neighbors spend their day
Washing their socks and staring out the windows
In a Thorazine haze
They don't know what to do with their hands
They vaguely remember some plans
But that was so long
That was so long ago
I'm under a spell, her name
Oh, yeah, I spell her name
Oh, yeah, I know her name
Uh huh, I spell her name

[Instrumental]
