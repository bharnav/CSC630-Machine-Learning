Take, take, take, all my time, all my company
Take everything from me
Fake, fake, fake all these things that you say to me
Nothing that I want to believe
I think the time has come to set it straight
I need to change this frequency
'Cause everyone just says the same old thing to me

Get up!
Get up!

Your shattered crown, it drags me down
'Cause there's no sun when you're around
Your righteous lies, you slip and slide
Now I want you to just
(Fade out)
Static in my stereo man
(Fade out)
A new transmission's calling, here we go!

Say, say, say anything that you want to me
I'm still not gonna agree
I'm not gonna be a part, be a part of this
I'm not what you want me to be
Because I need some time to set this straight
I'm gonna forward everything I say
Tell everyone to say the same old thing to me

Get up!

Your shattered crown, it drags me down
'Cause there's no sun when you're around
Your righteous lies, you slip and slide
Now I want you to just
(Fade out)
Static in my stereo man
(Fade out)
A new transmission's calling...
A new transmission's calling, here we go!

Woah... A new transmission
Woah... A new transmission

Your shattered crown, it drags me down
'cause theres no sun when you're around
Your righteous lies, you slip and slide
Now I want you to just
(Fade out)
Static in my stereo man
(Fade out)
A new transmission's calling...
Change the channel, flick the switches

A new transmission's calling
A new transmission's calling, here we go!
