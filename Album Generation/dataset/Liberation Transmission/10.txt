I haven't lost the way I feel
I didn't look away this time
The blood that's filling up these veins
Doesn't ever feel like mine

The shadows never seem to comfort me (I don't wanna feel this way)
How many little lies will make us see (I don't wanna feel this way)
Hide the truth from my eyes
I will never know, I will never know
Tear the sun from my skies
I will never know, I will never know

I didn't want to cross the line
I didn't want this on my mind
But through all the things I've seen
I'm still a part of this machine

The shadows never seem to comfort me (I don't wanna feel this way)
How many little lies will make us see (I don't wanna feel this way)
Hide the truth from my eyes
I will never know, I will never know
Tear the sun from my skies
I will never know, I will never know

Hide the truth from my eyes
I will never know, I will never know
Tear the sun from my skies
I will never know, I will never ever ever ever know
