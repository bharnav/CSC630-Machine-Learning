One, two
One, two, three, four...

I'm sure I've seen this look before
Done a thousand times and a million more
How many lies did he tell this time?
How many times did he cross the line?
It won't help me but I have to ask
Is there something real that's behind the mask?
Something true we don't know about?
A little faith in amongst the doubt

And maybe someday you will grow
Maybe someday you will know
Maybe someday you will end these tears and go

A little piece of me grows old
I keep on walking down this road
I've seen a million people change
But I will stay the same
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Always steal and borrow
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Never catch, you're never gonna catch tomorrow

I'm sure I've played this scene before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I'm sure I used to hold your hand
Did I hurt you?
All this attitude with no history
All this anger when you're attacking me
Got a lot to learn and you need to know
That your time is up kid, let it go

Maybe someday you will grow
Maybe someday you will know
Maybe someday you will end these tears and go

A little piece of me grows old
I keep on walking down this road
I've seen a million people change
But I will stay the same
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Always steal and borrow
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Never catch, you're never gonna catch tomorrow

Never gonna catch tomorrow

A little piece of me grows old
I keep on walking down this road
I've seen a million people change
But I will stay the same
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Always steal and borrow
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Never gonna catch tomorrow

Yeah the haircut's hot
But this has gotta stop
Good shoes won't save you this time
I think you're gonna find
With everything combined
That the time's running out of this line

And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Always steal and borrow
And I know you, (Know you, know you)
Never catch, you're never gonna catch tomorrow
