Her eyes are open like a book
Her fingers stroke her hair to look
A moment feels so out of place
This will left standing in disgrace

Paint your fingernails at night
Style your hair in the bathroom light
Hatred never looked this good
Whoever thought it could

I don't wanna wait or leave it up to fate
'Cause I just wanna watch you all night
Screaming

Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to
Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to end

One kiss those lips could never lie
But I know something isn't right
Don't be fooled my friends aside
'Cause I see nothing in those eyes

All said and done
This won't be fun
Make no mistake
Those smiles are fake

Don't wanna wait or leave it up to fate
'Cause I just wanna watch you all night
Screaming

Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to
Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to end

But believe me
I know it will always be moving
I know we could find a key

Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to
Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to

All the times that we suffered this before
Never once, did you ever close that door
All the make up cannot hide that fact
That you're gone and you're never coming back
