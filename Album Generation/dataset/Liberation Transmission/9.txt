(Yeah)
(Ooh)

So can you feel your heartbeat racing
Can you feel the tension rise
Can you see the road you're walking
Are these signs too hard to recognise
Part of where you're going
Is knowing where you're coming from
The hardest part of moving forward
Are these times where we all stand alone

No, no, but you'll never believe
No, no

For all these times (for all these times)
That we walked away
For all these times (for all these times)
That I've heard you say
Give me something to believe in
Give me someone to believe in
For all these times (for all these times)
And it starts today

A generation always waiting
A revolution passed its time
Another reason to take stock
Of all these things that you have left behind
Feelings that will never leave you
Never make you change your mind
You gotta make it out past this one
Always the wrong place at the wrong time

No, no, but you'll never believe
No, no

For all these times (for all these times)
That we walked away
For all these times (for all these times)
That I've heard you say
Give me something to believe in
Give me someone to believe in
For all these times (for all these times)
And it starts today

Lipgloss Lies, doin' the time
Never gonna miss what I left behind
If I got the chance I'd do it again
I wouldn't change it, change it
Change it, change it

Lipgloss Lies, doin' the time
Never gonna miss what I left behind
If I got the chance I'd do it again
I wouldn't change it, change it
Change it, change it

No, no, but you'll never believe
No, no

For all these times (for all these times)
That we walked away
For all these times (for all these times)
That I've heard you say
Give me something to believe in
Give me someone to believe in
For all these times (for all these times)
And it starts today

Lipgloss Lies, doin' the time
Never gonna miss what I left behind
If I got the chance I'd do it again
I wouldn't change it, change it
Change it, change it

Lipgloss Lies, doin' the time
Never gonna miss what I left behind
If I got the chance I'd do it again
I wouldn't change it, change it
Change it, change it
