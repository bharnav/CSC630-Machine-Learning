Bar Fight, week night
You don't look right, poor mite, no bite
Wake up, first light
This is what we live and what we see...
Dance club, strip light
Get drunk, no sight, watch it ignite
Live it up tonight
Nobody really cares, but it's not for me...

So raise your glass my son
We're telling everyone

Living in everyday combat
Day to day commuter riot
Shot down, Dancing in the DMZ
(And we)
Walk on, streets on fire
Caged in with razor wire
Shot down, living in the DMZ
Living in the DMZ

T-T-Times up, let's go, all that we know
Release tension, you're my hero
After dark, terror in the town high street
And I know you can't stop full throttle
Get involved mate, broken bottle
(Invasion) Panic on the cold concrete

So raise your glass my son
We're telling everyone...

Living in everyday combat
Day to day, commuter riot
Shot down, shot down, dancing in the DMZ
(And we)
Walk on, streets on fire
Caged in with razor wire
Shot down, living in the DMZ
Living in the DMZ
Living in the DMZ
Living in the DMZ

Right... Yeah...

Let's go

Living in everyday combat
Day to day, commuter riot
Shot down, dancing in the DMZ
(And we)
Walk on, streets on fire
Caged in with razor wire
Shot down, living in the DMZ
Living in the DMZ

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Living in the DMZ

Oh right, oh yeah

Living in the DMZ

Don't think you're safe 'cause it's not over... [x16]
