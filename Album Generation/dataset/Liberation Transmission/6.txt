Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding

I'm sick of watching my mouth with everybody looking at me
And I'm sick of wasting my time, this city offers nothing for me

No good for me
No good for you
You walk away I see it thorough
Don't turn your back it's not alright
Without tonight would you want to

'cause we see the world through bloodshot eyes
And we can't decide who's on our side

Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding

'cause you see the world through bloodshot eyes
And you can't decide who's on your side

I'm sick of working all week for people I cannot stand
I'm sick of holding it in, the actions in the palm of my hand

No good for you
No good for me
A wasting life you can't break free
Don't turn your back it's not alright
We're out tonight don't you want to

Can you see the world through bloodshot eyes
But you can't decide who's on your side

Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding

Can we see the world through different eyes?
Still can't decide who's on my side

Everybody's screaming baby...
Everybody's screaming baby...
Everybody's screaming baby...
Everybody's screaming...
'cause we see the world through bloodshot eyes
And we can't decide who's on our side

Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
(It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet)

Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
(It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet)
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
(It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet)
Everybody's screaming, we're only bleeding
(It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet)
