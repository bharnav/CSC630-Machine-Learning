Booom, boom, boom, boom, booom
Booom, boom
Badababoomdaboom
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom,  booom

[Verse 1]
I called you on a Thursday
I waited for your call
You didn't respond to me, yeah
And I called you on a Friday
You didn't respond
I've been waiting patiently, baby
Boom, boom
I can't wait no more
Somebody else is sniffing at my dress, heey
Somebody is checking for a sister
And I'm sorry you're about to get left, ooh

[Chorus]
Booom, boom, boom, boom, booom, booom, boom, booom
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, booom

[Verse 2]
I mean I been waiting patiently for you honey
I can't believe that I would
Lower my steelo
For the call from you
But you just won't do
Cause you don't love me at all
I mean, I've been holding it down
Yeah I've been holding it down
And I really don't have to, Ay-yeah
I've been wanting you so badly, but sadly
Madly, you don't want me too
So I say

[Chorus]
Booom, boom, boom, boom, booom-booom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Booom, boom, booom

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry I have to drop the bomb this way
I mean there's a lot of things I could say
I could tell you that I really wanted to be with you
But you don't feel me
You can't hear me
I - I got to make this next move
I gotta do what a sistah's, gotta do
And if that hurts you
Well then it hurts you
I gotta make a move
I'm gonna do it too like

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, booom, boom,  boom
Boom,  boom, boom, booom boom, boom
It's all boom

[Breakdown]
I'm like boom
I'm like boom
It's like boom
I gotta do what I gotta do son
(shhh) Grown woman, making decisions and choices
Utilizing everything inside of me
My soul, my heart, my mind, my voices
So maybe, in the middle of the night
When the dreams just ain't going right
I could use, a tug
A hug
A kiss
Something, strong
Something, fit for a Queen
Something passionate
Someone with esteem (whoo)
A king
That'll knock a sistah down (down)
Like (like) boom (boom)
Booom
Boom booom
Booom
Boom boom
Booom
Boom

[Verse 4]
You can hold me close, (Hey!) kiss me nice
Talk to me in the moonlight
You can take my hand, be that strong man you can
Hold me close make me feel so good and, strong as steel
Cause I a-am, I just need you man
Oooh I need to get closer
To where I was meant to be
I need to be closer
To where, I need to be... hey

T-Talk to me in my ear
Tell me things that I need to hear
Don't always have to be nice, don't always have to be
But I need the truth from you
Come and give it to me soon
Cause I need you
I can't take all of this without loving
I'm tired of being strong all day, (hey) oooh
I need to get to know you in a familiar way
I can handle it all but in the middle of the night
I need something right, I need you
To get closer
Come a lil bit, come a lil bit closer boy, hey
I need you to get closer to (ooooh)

Mmmm, can you feel the fire in me
Ow, I need to make it burn baby
It's all about the way you do what you do
I'm looking for the king in you
Let me see it sooon


[Outro]
Closer
Closer
Come closer to me
Aye
I need you to get closer
Ooh ahh oohh
