Come on...

Babe
The only thing I think about at night is that you ain't here
(You ain't here, babe)
So many ideas
But truly I ain't sure
I don't know
That's how you got me, boo
Late nights missing you
Missing your touch, missing your love, missing your smell
I'm missing you
Missing your kiss, missing your arms, missing your soul
Well...
It seems like all I do
I'm stuck on...
The way you would hold my hand
When we would cross the street
Your eyes when they paid attention
(Paid attention to me)
Oh, the smell of your breath on my skin
I'm in, I'm In
And I'm missing you
I am missing you
Seems like all I know
I am missing you
It's all I ever seem to do
I'm missing you
Please tell me you recorded something
Please...
