I'm making you wait for the fifth date
I need to know if you're worthy
Making you wait, never too late
I need to know if you're crazy
I'm making you wait
A-ha, I need to know that you're worthy
Making you wait, wait, wait

I'm making you wait
I can't give the sweet of me so quickly
I gotta know if you're strictly
Dictation, saying what you said before to that other girl
You know I gotta find out if it's true
Ha-ah, ah, uh-ah, ah, ah

I'm making you wait

I'm making you wait, never too late
I need to know if you're worthy
Making you wait, not to frustrate
I need to know if you're crazy
I'm making you wait
Wait, wait...wait, wait
I'm making you...
(You, you, you, you, you, you, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)

Hey, I'm making you

I need to know if it's all perpetration
If it's really real
What are you telling me?
I need to see
Without any outside clarification, baby
That's why, I...
I really wanna do what you want me to do

I'm making you wait, never too late
(I just can't be all easy)
I need to know if you're worthy
(Just satisfying and pleasing)
I'm making you wait
(I wanna rest out)
Never too late, never too late
(Oh baby, I wanna return)
Wait, ah-ha, ha, ha
(Everything I tried satisfying on his mind)
I'm making you wait
(Never know what we might find)
Wait, wait, wait
Wait a little while, you might see me smile
I'm making you wait, ha, ha, ha
(I'm worth it, I'm worth it)
I'm making you wait
(I'm worth it, I'm worth it)
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh
(I'm worth it, you're worth it)
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh
(You deserve it)
