Well well well well well well well
Maybe you don't recognize what you got between ya thighs, come on (well)
So I'm gonna set you right
And I'm starting here tonight well (well)
Shine like the moon
And strong like the sea (well)
More expensive than money, more valuable than anything (well)
Juicy mango summer peach (well)
Make a lame man walk and a full man hungry
Well well well well

And if you don't know what I'm saying then baby I'm telling you

There's power in them rolling hills, come on
You're a prize possession, not everybody's worthy
Only reason I know is cause I headed down that road
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow, Come on (well)
W-w-w-w-well well
W-w-w-w-well well
Welllll

Maybe you don't recognize what you got between your eyes (well)
So I'm gonna set you correct so you can get what you should get (well)
Intuition's something sweet (well)
Let you know what you know, let you find before you seek (well)
Spirit of discernment, pray for it everyday (well)
Let you know who should go and who you should let stay (well)

And if you don't know what I'm saying then baby I'm telling you
(Well, well)

There's power in them rolling hills, come on (well, well)
You're a prize possession, not everybody's worthy (well, well)
To feel, only reason I know is cause I headed down that road (well, well)
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow (well, well)

There's power in them rolling hills, come on (well, well)
You're a prize possession not everybody's worthy (well, well)
Only reason I know is cause I headed down that same road (well, well)
I wanna see you grow, I wanna see you glow (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
Glow, I wanna see you shine (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
I mean all the time (Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh)
Gotta let that light (Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh)
Gotta let it shine so bright (Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh)
Maybe you don't recognize (Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh)

There's power in them rolling hills, yeah (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
You're a prize possession, not everybody's worthy (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
Only reason I know is cause I headed down that road (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
And I wanna see you glow, I wanna see you glow (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
Glow, glow, I wanna see you glow (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)

There's power in them rolling hills
Power in them rolling hills...
