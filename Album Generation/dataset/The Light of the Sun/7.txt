About another time, some other time
How 'bout you call next week
We'll get something to eat
We'll just hang and chill
Just to keep the thrill

About another time, some other time

Oh my God, I really had a good time tonight
It was fun
I had stars in my eyes
Oh my God, (he was fly) he was witty and sweet
Relaxed and comfortable (Nice, fine)
Conversation was nice and easy
Steady moving, (good sense of humor), smart
There was a kind of dignitary vibe
Like that original hip-hop element
Breakdance, fat laces, Beat Street, Soul Train
He's kinda Don Cornelius to me
(Cooler than a fan, cooler than a fan)
But it's only been two weeks...

About another time, some other time

He can be a snake in the grass
Deceptively hiding, waiting to spill his venom on my ass
(You know how it go)
He could be cold blooded
With another woman behind another door
And another couple of kids, three or four
He could be lying about his money (shit, no dough)
Ain't got nothing to show (frontin' with his dude pea coat)
He could be be a lotta things, a lotta things
He could be a lotta things

I just wanna see (spirit of discernment)
I just wanna see about a...about a...about a...about a...
(spirit of discernment)
How 'bout you call next week
About a...about a...about a...about a...
(spirit of discernment)
