[Verse 1]
Here I am again asking questions
Waiting to be moved
I am so unsure of my perception
What I thought I knew I don't seem to
Where is the turn so I can get back to what I believe in?
Back to the old me and

[Chorus]
God, please hear my call
I am afraid for me
Love has burned me raw
I need your healing
Please, please, please

[Verse 2]
I am such a fool
How did I get here?
Played by all the rules
Then they changed
I am but a child to your vision
Standing in the cold and the rain
Lost here in the dark
I can't see my foot to take a step
What is happening?
Oh, this hurts so bad. I can hardly breathe
I just want to leave so...

[Chorus]
God, please hear my call
I am afraid for me
Love has burned me raw
I need your healing
Please
God, please hear my call
I am afraid for me
Love has burned me raw
I need your healing
Please, please, oh, please, please

God please hear my call
I am afraid
Love has turned me cold
I need your healing
Please, please, please, please, please, please
