[Verse 1]
Thought I was different, it seems I'm just the same
As again I put my hand over the flame
I thought, I was smarter as I flew into the sun
But it turned out the way it does with everyone

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burned and fallen down so many times before
I don't fly around your fire anymore

[Verse 2]
I loved the heat, I loved the things that I forgot
I loved the strings that tie me down and cut me off
I was a king, I was a moth with painted wings made of cloth
When did the flame burn so high and get so hot?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burned and fallen down so many times before
I don't fly around your fire anymore

[Bridge]
I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burned and fallen down so many times before
I won't fly around, fly around
I don't fly around your fire anymore
I don't fly around your fire anymore
Burned and fallen down so many times before
I won't fly around, fly around

[Outro]
Oh, fly around
