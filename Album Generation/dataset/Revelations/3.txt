I felt it happening so fast
Although at first it took a while
I was no one to dwell on the past
But it chased away my smile

I felt no grave questions to ask
Until they burst into the open
I did not see the fragile mask
Atop all that was unspoken

Did I walk down the right path?
Did I make the right decisions?

It is then that I feel doubt
Afraid that it is all I am
It pervades my life throughout
And there is no one else to blame

Sometimes it makes me want to cry
And let it out as best I might
Sometimes I feel I want to die
And fade away into the night

I thought my life can be a blast
With odds that are there to defy
I did not mind it to be fast
Never look back and rather die

I did not think the dice were cast
With fate looming in the distance
But I felt it take hold at last
When it crushed all my resistance

It is then that I feel doubt
Afraid that it is all I am
It pervades my life throughout
And there is no one else to blame

Sometimes it makes me want to cry
And let it out as best I might
Sometimes I feel I want to die
And fade away into the night

I will live with it all the same
I will live with it all the same

It is then that I know doubt
But it is not all I am
I will bring my life about
And live with it all the same
