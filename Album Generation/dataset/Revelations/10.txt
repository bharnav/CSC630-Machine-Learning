[Verse 1]
Just like a rescue of a stray dog in the rain
I was hungry when you found me
And you could tell by my tail and my rib cage
What was once around me

[Chorus]
I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away

[Verse 2]
Bless your heart you gave me a home
And a new start, and I will leave you never
Sleep at your feet and stand guard
At you're front door, I will keep things together

[Chorus]
I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away

[Verse 3]
I killed myself, threw away my mental health
But nobody was blinking an eye
Backyard, basement, falling on the pavement
Nothing left to say but goodbye [x2]
It's true I ran away before but be sure
I am no tail-chaser
I know a good thing when it throws me a bone
I'm your best friend forever

[Chorus]
I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away
