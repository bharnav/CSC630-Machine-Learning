And there I was, now all alone
Left by the wayside on my own
Standing still, bent down to my knees
Strangely feeling at ease

And so it was that I came home
From the tiny seed that all this had grown
Standing tall, thoughts free to roam
Knowing where they belong

I had thought the chance long gone
But now I felt this spark of hope
My stride of life an easy lope
So I would find a place all my own

I had always heard this song
And now I knew that it was hope
To live my dream to the fullest scope
And in the end come into my own

Absorbed by the music
That leads the way

Into this sanctuary
Into my sanctuary
