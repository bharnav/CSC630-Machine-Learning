After weeks of searching
I had arrived
Where my journey had begun

I knew that behind those doors
Had been all the answers
But now they were shut tight
And the place deserted

Where was the music?
Where were all the people?

My search for the Dreamweb
Had brought me here
But I still had to find the Sleepwalkers

And then I could hear it
The music. that singular music
In the dead silence, in this dark alley
It was still in my head

And then I knew what I had to do
