So much music
Listening to fragments on disk
Was it the drink in the club?
What is the name of the band?

Mind.in.a.box

Where is White?
The last train
What is the key?

The club is closed
The screamer destroyed everything
The Dreamweb
My memory is coming back
What is the Agency?
The music is the key
Night
The Friend
Sleepwalkers

Meet me in the Dreamweb
The train station is closed
Candlelight avoids electricity
Only in the Dreamweb
Where is the DJ?
Who is Night?

I was there, but no one came
Get the information from the Agency
We will fight the Agency
Night's nightmare
What is the real world?
Dying world
Hidden memories
