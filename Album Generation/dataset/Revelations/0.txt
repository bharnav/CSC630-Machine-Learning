How could you let it come to this?
You gave me all that I will always miss
How could you let it end like this?
Now all I do is sit around and reminisce

My life was full of things that were not really there
Crammed full of stuff to hide its emptiness
Then it all came down like this house of cards
And all that stuff, it seemed to float away

My world seemed fine but it was all just a big lie
I believed it all and I did even cry
Then I felt what I had never felt before
And all I wanted was offer it all up to you
