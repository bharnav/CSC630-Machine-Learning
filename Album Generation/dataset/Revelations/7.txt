It's in their faces every day
Trapped in their world of eternal gray
Their heads in sync
Swaying back and forth
Looking for something they cannot see

They walk in circles every day
With faces all empty
All empty and pale
No regard for their silent pain
I walk past through the endless rain

They are afraid
I'm not afraid

They're so afraid
I'm not afraid

Trapped in a place that has no name
Their empty shells all one and the same
What's different they just cannot see
They are stuck in their darkest dream

They march in step side by side
Any room for dissent denied
I'm not like them, without a name
I am safe in my darkest dream

It's in their faces every day
Trapped in their world of eternal gray
Their heads in sync
Swaying back and forth
Looking for something they cannot see

They walk in circles every day
With faces all empty and pale
No regard for their silent pain
I walk past through the endless rain

Can you see their faces?
Can you feel their fear?
Can you feel their shame?
Living their darkest dream

Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid

Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid
