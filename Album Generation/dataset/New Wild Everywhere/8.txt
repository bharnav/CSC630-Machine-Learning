What is the Hell is going on here
Took my living and you took my friends
This is a time-bomb, and it could happen anywhere
It could happen right here
It could happen to you too

What if it was in your backyard
What if it was way of life
I bet you'd go crazy too
I bet you'd loose your mind too

Lot of people are on the edge
Found the edge a long time ago
You want to see real anger
You want a sea of sorrow
But the big thing is
You've got to bring the love
And we can't let go
And we can't give up

What if it was in your backyard
What if it was way of life
I bet you'd go crazy too
I bet you'd loose your mind too

Papers say this knocked us on our knees
We were already on our knees
They said the gulf was dead
And it was never going to come back

You better hurry up and know it
I want to love you till the end of the line
