A neighbor says it's been around years since the 70's
Knows all of the people, studied all their features arbitrarily
Says it's entertaining, the city block container once was proud
They're all passing through his sharpened point of view with their heads in the clouds
But I hear them late at night, getting into fights
Calling into the dark, Are you there? You got something for me

Parkdale blues, Heard it on the news
Transmissions from the eye of the storm
Parkdale blues, All its made abuse
When they're down you fly up to escape
They escape

I'm looking for a light, All grinning at the light, Maybe some change
The lift within the eyes, with gravity defied, I can tell it's no good
See what you can find to satisfy your mind in the neighbourhood
How can they be so gone? And they've been here so long, living all of this
They sing in a language I don't fully understand
Talk so loud and sweats a rock when the heat comes around

Parkdale blues, Heard it on the news
Transmissions from the eye of the storm
Parkdale blues, All its made abuse
When we're down we fly up to escape
We escape
