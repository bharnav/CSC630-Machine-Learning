Points so sharp that it cannot feel
Has two sides. Which one’s real?
Net thrown over and pulled from the school
Wake up in the hands of fools
Should’ve known better in daylight’s burn
Restless depths, of darking yearns
Hushing words from a silver tongue
The restless winds to willing ears

Should have known, living in a storm
You’d act like thunder and shift your form

The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me free, let me go
The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me deep, send me home

Fighter flash over fever escape
Underwater dreamer took the bait
Could have been the one that slipped from the hook
But you pull me slowly, ever so slow
Left on the island with nowhere to go
Half my mind, burning snow
Burnouts rarely make good flames
But don’t bother playing if you don’t know the game

Should have known, living in a storm
You’d act like thunder and shift your form

The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me free, let me go
The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me deep, send me home

Silver words compete with the heat
I hardly believe you can stand on your feet
Spent all the time twisting our nuts
When the smoke clears, you clearly forgot
I’m not made of metal and I’m not made of wood
Destined, it seems, to be misunderstood
Cut through me neatly with your fine blade
Flit so fast, a mess was made

Should have known, living in a storm
You’d act like thunder and shift your form

The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me free, let me go
The knife you, the knife oh
Cut me deep, send me home
