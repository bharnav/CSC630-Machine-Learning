There’s a fire in the study, Whisper in the dark
Colors burning brighter, hunger for the spark
Shadow thrown from light unknown, calling on the hearts
To challenge the alive and summon the asleep
And the sun sinks over the big smoke
The sky explodes on the shuttering lake

There’s a new wild feeling dancing in the air
There’s a new wild everywhere

Rocks jump and jitter, bush surface roots
Dream up clay in water, simmer up the soots
Weather breaks, spirit shakes
Somethings switches on
Running independent, rushing out men gone
And the sun sinks over the big smoke
The sky explodes on the shuttering lake

There’s a new wild feeling dancing in the air
There’s a new wild everywhere

Fly up to the heavens, anchored in the clouds
Fly beyond the night, love the blooming sounds
Maize and cries, neon lights pushing and light
Taking flight to raven heights to turn on and shine
And the sun sinks over the big smoke
The sky explodes on the shuttering lake

There’s a new wild feeling dancing in the air
There’s a new wild everywhere
