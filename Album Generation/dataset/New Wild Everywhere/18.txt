Easy come and easy go
That's what they say when they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go

When to see the beast, he was singing the blues
Blasting out psalms and spinning the noops
Tending the garden and gathering leaves
Polishing coffins, burning out thieves

Easy come and easy go
That's what they say when they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go

Call it chance, call it choice
Words escape on the breath of your voice
Spinning a magic as they arrive
It's not fail when it's a shallow dive

Easy come and easy go
That's what they say when they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go

Easy come and easy go
That's what they say when they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go
