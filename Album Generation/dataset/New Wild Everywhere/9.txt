When you try to close your eyes
And put yourself in a dream
Sleeping and then dreaming
Means that you are truly free
It's the best thing that you can do
As far as I can see

Oh, quiet your mind
Oh, quiet your mind

In the country, in the foothills
Found you down in the fall
Finally found a vision
Vision to all
You in it, so completely
When you don't even try
Set loose, all your worries
Like doves into the sky

Oh, quiet your mind
Oh, quiet your mind

So now I'll send a lullaby
Warp it in a dream
To take the weight, from your shoulders
And the pressure from your teeth
It must seem like, a ghost sometimes
Appearing from thin air
So take hold, of this quiet song
(????) find you there

Oh, quiet your mind
