I was on the water
When it began to heave
And at the fight
My words were strong
But I would not have imagined
That they'd stop making patterns
It's caps of white
Raised and broke I fasten to the boat

The panic overtook
Me and the fear I held within
I drew a breath and
I tried to find the courage
To stand the troubled trip
What have I gotten myself into?
I silently wondered
I silently asked

I thought of my family
And thought of my love
I thought of my maker
And what might be above
And the cabin in the woods
That I have not yet built
Many other things that
I hold dear in this world

I rode through the turmoil
And rode through the strife
I held to my words and
I clumped to my life
And then when my
Vision began to blur
This is what I saw in
The thought that had occurred

I saw every fish
Swimming fast beside me
And all kinds of leafs
From all different trees
And all of the insects
That circle on the earth
Birds and land animals
Are reaching towards birth

And I saw my body on a body of water
And I could see that we were the same
Roaring and reckless, invulnerable
Emotion and swinging
And predisposed to changing

When I open my eyes vision respell
I picked up my oars
And I kissed the coldness
With stronger arms
I silently swear
I silently drifted
I silently wept
