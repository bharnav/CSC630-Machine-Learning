Look at the names carved into the rocks
Look at the dates when they were lit up
Brushing my hand and I feel their age
Years of radiance, years of rain...

And the world stops spinning
When you stop spinning
Sighs when you sigh when you sigh

I’m coming home, so leave the light on
For me
I’m drawing over the luminous veil

When I get in, I will see you all there
I’m drawing on the great exhale

Uncertain ground, so I walk lightly
Translating names of lost families
Somebody’s sleeping that you should
Not wake
Drifting whispers over damp clay

And the world stops spinning
When you stop spinning
Sighs when you sigh when you sigh

I’m coming home, so leave the light on
For me
I’m drawing over the luminous veil

When I get in, I will see you all there
I’m drawing on the great exhale

Wide open spaces
Been asleep a long time
Punctuating places
Coming out like old teeth...

I’m coming home, so leave the light on
For me
I’m drawing over the luminous veil

When I get in, I will see you all there
I’m drawing on the great exhale

I’m soaring in on the great exhale
