Running through cornfields, the fire’s lit
Coyotes are crying, nothing fits
I can tell which is a beautiful night to fall in love
Let’s gather the wood and then burn it all down
Burn through the night

All of the minerals elements made
Dancing in light a particular shade
Of cornflower blue
Oh, how it suits you
Clear window through
But you look into the sky

The eyes and the ears of the fields are alive
Its voices it rose like whispers arrive
Whisper all night
Bury the seeds, watch as they grow
Blooming an ecstatic firework show
Bloom through the night

All of the minerals elements made
Dancing in light a particular shade
Of cornflower blue
Oh, how it suits you
Clear window through
But you look into the sky

All of the minerals elements made
Dancing in light a particular shade
Of cornflower blue
Oh, how it suits you
Clear window through
But you look into the sky

Cornflower blue
Oh, how it suits you
Clear window through
But you look into the sky
