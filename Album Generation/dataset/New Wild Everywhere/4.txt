Out on the line, weightless and beyond design
Light headin’ heavy and running through the night
Half awake, found the wild in the wilderness
Under the starry sky of straights

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Best as an instrument, all the notes played with discipline
Hanging in tune and rising as they fall
Half of a life, it came until tomorrow’s drive
Holding a stormy spinning wheel

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Through the night turn and set
Stay fast, a music script
Set a line and drive into a dream
Make it through the night, again
Count back from a thousand to ten
Ride it out and drive into a dream

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Made it a fire and desire
Turns like a wheel
Changes with the wind

Out on the line
