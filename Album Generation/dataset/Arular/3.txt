[Verse 1]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat it like a wing yo
To Congo To Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing yo
I salt and pepper my mango
Shoot spit out the window
Bingo, I got him in the thing yo
Now what? I'm doing my thing yo
Quit bending all my fingo
Quit beating me like you're Ringo
You wanna go? You wanna win a war?
Like P.L.O. I don't surrendo'

[Chorus]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby

[Verse 2]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat like a wing yo
To Congo, to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing yo
I checked that mouth on him
Fucking checked that gas on him
I had him, cornered him
Fucking shut that gate on him
Why should you listen to him?
He had his way I'm bored of him
I'm tired of him
I don't wanna be as bad as him
It's a bomb, yo
So run, yo
Put away your stupid gun, yo
'Cause see through like protocol
Thats why we blow it up 'fore we go

[Chorus]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby

[Verse 3]
Semi-9 and snipered him
On that wall they posted him
They cornered him
And Then Just Murdered Him
He told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there they didn't know him
They showed him a picture then
Ain't that you with the muslims?
He had Colgate on his teeth
And Reebok Classic on his feet
At a factory he does Nike
And then helps the family
Beat heart beat
He's made it to the Newsweek
Sweetheart seen it
He's doing it for the peeps
Peace

[Chorus]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
