Pull up the people

[Bridge]
Sleng teng, that's that M.I.A. thang
I got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang
(x2)

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
Yeah, we got God now we got you
Every day thinking 'bout how we get through
Everything I own is on IOU
But I'm here bringing you something new
You no like the people, they no like you
Then they gonna set it off with a big boom
Son in a battle, is a son and battle too
Why you wanna talk about who done who?
Why you wanna talk about...

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
I'm a fighter, fighter god
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road
Bring me the reaper
Bring me the lawyer
I'm a fighter, I'll take them on
You treat me like a killer
I ain't never hate ya
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, fighter god
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, nice nice fighter
I'm a fighter on that road
