Red turns blue the anger burns in you
When spoken true it spills right out of you
Ain't too hard to see, you're planning to leave
You wear that smile while you're lying

If you're leaving again
(You're just a wrecking ball)
And if you're talking to him
(You're just a wrecking ball)
I will destroy it all
(You're just a wrecking ball)
No one could make me crawl

Up turns down you drink in wasted ground
Turning round this drunken jester's crown
It's easy to see, how cool things could be
If you'd stay here and stand your ground

If you're leaving again
(You're just a wrecking ball)
And if you're talking to him
(You're just a wrecking ball)
I will destroy it all
(You're just a wrecking ball)
No one could make me crawl

And if I quit right now, you can ride it out
And if I should fall, you could have it all
As it stands right now, it is my call
You cannot stall, I'll fucking wreck it all

If you're leaving again
(You're just a wrecking ball)
And if you're talking to him
(You're just a wrecking ball)
I will destroy it all
(You're just a wrecking ball)
No one could make me crawl

And if you're leaving again
(You're just a wrecking ball)
And if you're talking to him
(You're just a wrecking ball)
I will destroy it all
(You're just a wrecking ball)

Yeah yeah, I will destroy it all
Yeah yeah, I will destroy it all
Yeah yeah, I will destroy it all
Yeah yeah, I will destroy it all
