I've risen through the ashes of tragedy
I've fallen babe you've seen the worst of me
And you've seen me fly, hid when I got high
Now that's all gone by

Look into my eyes
I'm the king of the world now honey
Come along for the ride
Cause I don't wanna bring anyone else no

Been witness to the whore this world can be
I sit in dumb wonder as it falls around me
Now that's all gone by

Look into my eyes
I'm the king of the world now honey
Come along for the ride
Cause I don't wanna bring anyone else no

Don't you try to hide
I got you in my gaze now honey
It's like getting high
Going down in a fire fight, yeah

When everything is upside down
And the world's burnt to the ground
I am the nuclear cloud

Look into my eyes
I'm the king of the world honey
Come along for the ride
Cause I don't wanna bring anyone else no

Don't you try to hide
I got you in my gaze now honey
It's like getting high
Making love in a fire fight, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's like getting high
It's like getting high, yeah, yeah, yeah

Look into my eyes
I'm the king of the world
You're my forgotten girl
