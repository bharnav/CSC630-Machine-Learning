We are criminal, our crimes have payed
Makes no difference, what your leaders say
We earned our right, to kill and and take
Rape and murder, and we take no blame

We are the lords of Abaddon
We are the kings of agony
We are the lords of Abaddon
We hold the keys to tragedy

World full of indifference, distrust and pride
Borderline aggression, God is on our side

We are the lords of Abaddon
We are the kings of agony
We are the lords of Abaddon
We hold the keys to tragedy

Yeah
We are the lords of Abaddon
We are the kings of agony
We are the lords of Abaddon
We hold the keys to tragedy
Come on!
We are the lords of Abaddon
We are the kings of agony
We are the lords of Abaddon
We hold the keys to tragedy
Come on!
