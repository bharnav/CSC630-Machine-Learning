Kill with a Judas kiss
Revenge ain't sweet when the blood is on your lips

Democracy is such a whore
Fools and kids march off to war

Cold comes the reaper's grin
How will we pay for our greatest sin?

Democracy is such a whore
(Know your history)
Fools and and pawns march off to war
(Without victory, there's no history)

Down underground
Where will you go when the witch hunt turns around?

Democracy is such a whore
(Know your history)
Brothers and sons march off to war
(Without victory, there's no history)
No one wins, no one wins, no one wins
