Nothing is easy when nothing is true
It never gets easier lying to you
As for now my heart goes out
You brought me everything but the caged bird still sings
So many hands they pull me away
It seems impossible to navigate
Nothing ever stays the same that will never change
You wanted a star, to shine on a stage
But don't you know that hearts will wander when they're unchained
I needed a place, cover from the storm
Now all that bound just seems forever torn
Nothing ever stays the same that will never change
Nothing is easy when nothing is true
It never gets easier lying to you
Burning the days down and hiding from you
It never gets easier lying to you
When you wake up, in the mirror tell me what's the greatest fear that you got
Face down undercover have you wandered to another lover
Nothing is easy when nothing is true
It never gets easier lying to you
Burning the days down and hiding from you
It never gets easier lying to you
It never gets easier lying to you
It never gets easier lying to you
It never gets easier lying to you
