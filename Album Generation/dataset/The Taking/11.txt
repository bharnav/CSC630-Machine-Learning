I don't know what I'd do if I ran into you
I think I'd take a rope and I'd make you a noose
Watch you kick and flail as you take your last breath
If the fall first didn't break your neck

To break your curse
I'd go one worse
I'd rid your type
Exterminate

For all the hurt, and all the pain
You feel no wrath, you take no blame
For what it's worth, I wish you no well
And I'm going first, follow me to hell
Follow me to hell, follow me to hell, follow me to hell

You're an animal that just should have been left caged
A no good mother fucker with a black and twisted brain
If I knew first about your deviant plan
I would have warned that girl about the evils of man

To break your curse
I'd go one worse
I'd rid your type
Exterminate

For all the hurt, and all the pain
You feel no wrath, you take no blame
For what it's worth, I wish you no well
And I'm going first, follow me to hell
Follow me to hell, follow me to hell, follow me to hell
