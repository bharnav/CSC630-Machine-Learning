Someday you might find, that victory
Is well worth the bitter fight
But you've got to give it a try
You've got to want to deny, the enemy

We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win

There were days they pushed us around, for all to see
But we brushed it off and got up from the ground
When you've got a chance at the crown
Will you be the one to back down? No

We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win

The moment when you hit your stride
Blood and tears been cast aside
Iron will can't be denied
We're done waiting for this moment

We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
We win, we win, we win, we win, yeah we win
