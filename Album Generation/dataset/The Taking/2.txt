You
You're so goddamn hard to please
You confuse and frustrate me
Why must we both go through it?

I said you
Well is it so hard to see
Those things that you do to me
Why must we keep them secrets

Break through those clouds
See the stars shine down
Find solid ground
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
You can leave it all behind

Because i
I can't seem to get through to you
You pass this up and can't undo
Its so clear that you've been wounded

So why
Must i pay now for his deeds
I'm not the one who steals and cheats
What must i do to prove it

Break through those clouds

See the stars shine down
Find solid ground
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
You can leave it all behind

I will not burn
I am not him
The past has broke him
You're not dead and broken

(solo)

Break through those clouds
See the stars shine down
Find solid ground
Forget all what has been
Past ghosts and sins
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
You can leave it all behind
