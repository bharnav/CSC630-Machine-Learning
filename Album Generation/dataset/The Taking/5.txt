Saw the tears run down your face
Guess we saw the signs too late
Now the wind is gone, you're drifting all alone

Lift my anchor from your sea
That vast tranquility
I was overcome and blinded by the years

Placing blame and, hiding all the things that shame them
Fading, hating, you'll never stop this heart from bleeding

Set my sights on foreign shores
Woke up there wanting more
Never saw myself as one to float away

Placing blame and, hiding all the things that shame them
Fading, hating, you'll never stop this heart from bleeding

You only need me when you're drunk and dirty
You only use me when you feel alone
You did my drugs and then you take my money
I'm leaving, you're on your own

Yeah yeah, you're on your own now, yeah yeah, you're all alone yeah
Yeah yeah, you're on your own now, yeah yeah, you're all alone yeah

Placing blame and, hiding all the things that shame them
Fading, hating, you'll never stop this heart from bleeding

Placing blame and, hiding all the things that shame them
Fading, hating, you'll never stop this heart from bleeding
