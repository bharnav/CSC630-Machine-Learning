Empty bottle of Vicodin
The dirty clothes that I slept in
Today I'm finally through, it's time for something new

Morning coffee and Ritalin
Haven't slept since I don't know when
I need a friend or two, someone I haven't used

Tremors, shakes, can't break this chill that's in my veins
Tremors, shakes, can't stop today, at least I quit cocaine

You dirty fuck you lied again
This isn't black tar heroin
To get me through the day, I'll do it anyway

I hid a gun in a darkened place
A simple short arm's length away
Somebody's gotta pay, I hate the world today

Tremors, shakes, can't break this chill that's in my veins
Tremors, shakes, can't stop today, at least I quit cocaine

You can't stop me, I can't stop me
Yeah, can't cure this chill that's in my veins

Turn, go away, stop knocking
Turn, go away, stop knocking
Turn, go away, stop knocking
Can't you tell there's no one home

Tremors, shakes, can't break this chill that's in my veins
Tremors, shakes, can't stop today, I guess I quit cocaine

Tremors, shakes, can't break this chill that's in my veins
Tremors, shakes, can't stop today, at least I quit cocaine
