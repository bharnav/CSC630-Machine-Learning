Read a letter from you today
In short it said that you've been so far away
It said where you've been, what's been on your mind
It makes you feel so much better when there's something to hide
You're shifting blame again

Lie to yourself about it
Pretend your life is sane
Basking in faded glory
The world forgets your name

Move on from there, get up and go on
Wait any longer you'll be stuck where you are
Leave all your things, clean up your face
The scars of the past are the dust that remain in the way
Stop shifting blame again

Lie to yourself about it
Pretend your life is sane
Basking in faded glory
The world forgets your name

How could it be that you sunk down so low?
Word around town is you got no place to go
Your story's got a crack and you got no one to follow
I couldn't care less

Lie to yourself about it
Pretend your life is sane
Basking in faded glory
The world forgets your name

Cry to yourself about it
Drive all your friends insane
You failed to prove your story
I will forget your name
