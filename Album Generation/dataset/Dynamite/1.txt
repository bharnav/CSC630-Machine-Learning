[Verse 1]
Riding the night, riding the night - ain't it cool?
Rolling it high, rolling it high - ain't it cool?
She's looking hot, she's looking hot, in the breeze
Flashing those eyes, strutting her stuff, Givenchy
Baby wants to ride tonight

[Chorus]
Well, you sure got the look, that the good times come for free
Baby I'm not expensive, but tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look, when you're riding next to me
Dynamite, dynamite
You sure got the look, got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you, girl, you got the look
Riding the night, you know that she's dynamite, come on
Dynamite, dynamite

Don't stop caressing me
'Cos it's ecstasy
And I wanna be

[Verse 2]
Riding the night, riding the night - ain't it cool?
Riding the night, riding the night - she's no fool
(Turn the lights off)
Rolling it high, rolling it high - that's her thing
Riding the night, she's cold as ice - watch the sting

[Chorus]
Well, you sure got the look, that the good times come for free
Baby I'm not expensive, but tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look, when you're riding next to me
Dynamite, dynamite
You sure got the look, got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you, girl, you got the look
Riding the night, you know that she's dynamite, come on
Dynamite, dynamite

(In the Givenchy, five seventy five, in the Givenchy)
You know, baby, you've got that dynamite
Baby, I want your dynamite
Baby, you've got that dynamite
Baby, I want your dynamite

[Chorus]
Well, you sure got the look, that the good times come for free
Baby I'm not expensive, but tonight you're taking me
You sure got the look, when you're riding next to me
Dynamite, dynamite
You sure got the look, got to keep you on my hook
Pussycat eyes, I'm digging you, girl, you got the look
Riding the night, you know that she's dynamite, come on
Dynamite, dynamite

All this dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite
Under the moon as we slip through the city streets
Dynamite, dynamite
You and me can believe in this happiness
Dynamite, dynamite
Under the moon as we slip through the city streets
Dynamite, dynamite
Under
The moon as we slip through the city streets
Dynamite, dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite
