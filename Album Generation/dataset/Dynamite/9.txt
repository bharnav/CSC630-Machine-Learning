I've got a lot of juice
I need to put to use
Let's bring this highway down
I'm going from Z to G
When it should be A to B
Nose so low it just scrapes the ground
Can't you see me over taking?
All the while I'm salivating
Won't you let me
Push a little thrust up you?
She loves riding around
In my black devil car
I can't hear a sound
Because her foot's pushing down too hard
And white angels cry
For her black devil heart
She wants me to stop
She should never let me start
She should never let me start
Talking to all those pretty girls
That I meet around the world
Her name was Gina
You should have seen her
She had the greenest eyes
And with those endless thighs
I've put my hands through
Some misdemeanors
Can't you see me, I'm not choosy?
You drive a black machine
And I think you're groovy
Won't you let me
Take a little ride with you?
She loves riding around
In my black devil car
I can't hear a sound
Because her foot's pushing down too hard
And white angels cry
For her black devil heart
She wants me to stop
She should never let me start
She should never let me start
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
Ooh, riding around
In my black devil car
You know I can't hear a sound
In my black devil car, yeah
Babe, you know
You got such a tight machine
Now let me drive your dream
Until your tank is dry
I'm shooting from the hip
Not running out of clips
Flames of love and licking high
You know she'll always be running free
A hot freewheeling honey bee
Won't you let me
Push a little thrust up you?
That's what I wanna do
Riding around in my black devil car
I can't hear a sound
Because her foot's pushing down too hard
And white angels cry
For her black devil heart
She wants me to stop
She should never let me start
She should never let me start
Strapped down, wrapped around
Breaking up the speed limits
Red lights, crazy nights
Hope she's coming back with it
Super charged devil queen
Stepping in my love machine
Twisted my metal
On the highway of desire
She's easy rindin' super flyin'
'95, it's still green
High heels, shiny wheels
Looking for a tight squeeze
Rocket fuel and jet juice
Now she's getting real loose
Can't stop, black heart
She should never let me start
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a
