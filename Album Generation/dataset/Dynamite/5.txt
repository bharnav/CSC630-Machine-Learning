Love blind and you're on my mind
Even when I'm walking the dog
I'm carefree like this melody
Hope this doesn't take us too long
Baby, turn me on
You put fire in me every night
I need the drug you got to give
Keep it like that 'cause it's positive
Can't leave you to feel alone
Step in the car, let me take you home
Slide right up and make you bend
Now we did it once, can we do it again?
Baby, you've got me hanging off the streetlights
You've got me singing with the Bluebirds
In the sky above
I think I'm in love
Step to me, angel eyes
You got the shake and I got the fries
All black leather like a disco bitch
Five feet nine with your ruby lips
You made me love blind
And I can't get you off my mind
Mama said, stay away from girls like you
Turn out the lights, I know what to do
Baby, rock the floor
(You gonna rock the floor tonight)
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
(You gonna rock the floor tonight)
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
Rock the floor tonight
You've got me hanging off the streetlights
You've got me singing with the Bluebirds
In the sky above
I think I'm in love
And you've got me dancing on the ceiling
You've got me thinking abaout the whole world
It revolves around you
So what can I do? What to do?
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
Baby, rock the floor
Kiss me twice and I need some more
Yeah, you're gonna rock the floor tonight
You've got me hanging off the streetlights
You've got me climbing up the wall
Everything you do reminds me of the good times
Woah, baby, you know you made me so love blind
Yeah, you're gonna rock the floor tonight
Yeah, you're gonna rock the floor tonight
Yeah, you're gonna rock the floor tonight
Yeah, you're gonna rock the floor tonight, tonight
