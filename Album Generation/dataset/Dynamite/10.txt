[Verse 1]
How many times
Can a man watch the sun rise
Over his head
Without feeling free?
How many words
Will fail me in my negligence
To arrest, oh yes
This crazy part of me?
How many fools
Will I let unlock the door to my heart
When I know that
Know that they shouldn't've had the key?
It's been so long
And the groove in my heart's nearly gone
Oh, my head's in the clouds
But I'm landing on my feet

[Chorus]
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down)
I'm hot tequila brown
Don't shoot me down
I'm stone cold but I'm lying here, in the
(Sunshine, shine down)

[Verse 2]
How many lives
Will I lose on the battle lines
Inside the mind?
I think I've had enough
Don't shoot me down
All I want is to see my black eyes turn back to brown
Cross that Rubicon
I think I really must

[Chorus]
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down)
I'm hot tequila brown
Don't shoot me down
I'm stone cold but I'm lying here, in the
(Sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down)
I'm hot tequila brown
Don't shoot me down
I'm stone cold but I'm lying here in the

Sunshine, shine down
Sunshine, shine down
Sunshine, shine down, down

[Chorus/Outro]
Don't shoot me down
I'm hot tequila brown
Don't shoot me down
I'm stone cold but I'm lying here, in the
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
I'm hot tequila brown
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
I'm hot tequila brown
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
Don't shoot me down
(Sunshine, shine down, sunshine, shine down)
