I've got nowhere to hide
When her ghost lives inside my body
I feel the weight from within
As the lids of my eyes get heavy

Yeah, are you feeling it too?
Yeah, I hope you're feeling it too

Here I go, let them know I'm heading back to Idaho
All the way to USA, I've thought about you
Every single second since I got home
I may find a better view, find a better view, Idaho

There's someone I left behind
She found a place in my mind that's steady
A constant wave of regret
I need a change in my life, I'm ready

Yeah, are you feeling it too?
Yeah, I hope you're feeling it too

Here I go, let them know I'm heading back to Idaho
All the way to USA, I've thought about you
Every single second since I got home
I may find a better view, find a better

Yeah, are you feeling it too?
Yeah, I hope you're feeling it too

Here I go, let them know I'm heading back to Idaho
All the way to USA, I've thought about you
Every single second since I got home
I may find a better view, find a better

Here I go, let them know I'm heading back to Idaho
All the way to USA, I've thought about you
Every single second since I got home
I may find a better view, find a better view, Idaho
