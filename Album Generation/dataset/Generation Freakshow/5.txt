[Verse 1]
I don't want to be the one who sleeps alone
I don't want to feel this emptiness surrounding me, no place to go
I don't want to walk along these streets alone
I don't want to turn my head around, and feel that there's no colour anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Moving to the left, where should I go
Moving to the right, Soho side shows
People come and people go
Moving to the left, all they ever wished for
Moving to the right, in this life is still insight

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, places that I know
Summer is alive (Look into the light)
Rising from below, sunrise
The city is awake, ready for the day
Summer is alive (Look into the light)

[Post-Chorus]
Always, sunrise

[Verse 2]
I don't want to be the one who fights alone
I don't want to wake and feel that there's this silence, now the love has gone
I don't want to be the one who cries alone
And I don't want to be the one who falls
And wonders where it all went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Moving to the left, where should I go
Moving to the right, Soho side shows
People come and people go

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, places that I know
Summer is alive (Look into the light)
Rising from below, sunrise
The city is awake, ready for the day
Summer is alive (Look into the light)

[Post-Chorus]
Always, sunrise

[Bridge]
As a crowd gathered across the road
Looking up to a man on a tightrope
There's a woman selling autographs, says that they're original
How would we ever know?

[Chorus]
Sunrise
Everywhere I go, places that I know
Summer is alive (Look into the light)
Rising from below, sunrise
The city is awake, ready for the day
Summer is alive (Look into the light)

[Post-Chorus]
Always, sunrise

[Outro]
Sunrise
