Violent society
(Why did you lie to me?)
What do you want from me?
(In the meantime)

Violent society
(Why did you lie to me?)
Out on the city streets
How could I ever leave?

Fighting anxiety
(It's got a hold of me)
Buried the enemy
(For the last time)

Fighting anxiety
(It's got a hold of me)
Oh, it will never be
The way it used to be

People of a nation, lost in conversation
Following the sidestep, find out what the kids know
Generation freakshow, let's go

Love without empathy
(Responsibility)
It's an escape release
(In this town)

Love without empathy
(Responsibility)
Everybody needs a little space
To breathe

Positive energy
(Something that you believe)
Try and you might succeed
(In your own time)

Positive energy
(Something that you believe)
'Cause you're the next in line
You've got a chance to shine

People of a nation, lost in conversation
Following the sidestep, find out what the kids know
Generation freakshow, let's go

Hello, hello, hello, hello
(Generation)
Hello, hello, hello, hello
(Generation freakshow)

Hello, hello, hello, hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello

People of a nation, lost in conversation
Following the sidestep, find out what the kids know
Generation freakshow, let's go

Find new inspiration, without hesitation
Following the sidestep, time for celebration
No more isolation, let's go
