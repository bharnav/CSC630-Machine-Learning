WooOOoo, WooOOoo
WooOOoo, WooOOoo

She's always trying' to work it out
Sitting' in a parked car
Music on the stereo is blaring out
Shutting out the world
People always say 'what you gonna do now'?
Are you gonna go far
Gonna follow your heart, Til it stops
She could never say why
'Cos she's leaving tonight
She would never say why
'Cos she's leavin'

Jessie always wanted, to get away
Tried to cross a Border, Head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, Blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave now?
Are you gonna leave town?

WooOOoo, WooOOoo

It's funny how she hesitates
She wonders why she still cares
Tomorrow seems so far away
This moment could be her's
People always say 'what you gonna do now'?
Are you gonna go far
Gonna follow your heart, Til it stops
She could never say why
'Cos she's leaving tonight
She would never say why
'Cos she's leavin'

Jessie always wanted, to get away
Tried to cross a Border, Head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, Blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave now?
Are you gonna leave town?

Looking for the answer
She won't be the last one out
Trying to get a head start
Find her way through the crowds
Right now...

WooOOoo, WooOOoo

Jessie always wanted, to get away
Tried to cross a Border, Head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, Blinded by the sun
Jessie don't leave it too long, too long now

Jessie always wanted, to get away
Tried to cross a Border, Head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, Blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave town
