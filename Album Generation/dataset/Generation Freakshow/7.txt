[Verse 1]
Feel like I lost my self today
The thought of rejection burns away

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been two weeks since she called
I'm going out of my tiny mind everyday

[Chorus]
You will never know
If you can't feel my heart the way it beats, it slows
Today I almost choked, I thought we got along
I guess we got it wrong

[Verse 2]
Driving around, it's ten below
It's freezing outside, November calls

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been two weeks since she left
I'm going out of my tiny mind everyday

[Chorus]
You will never know
If you can't feel my heart the way it beats, it slows
Today I almost choked, I thought we got along
I guess we got it wrong

[Bridge]
Say hello, say hello, say hello to Eve
(Run out of time)
This love inside feels like the enemy
Say hello, say hello, say hello from me
(Run out of time)
She waved goodbye as I watched her leave

[Chorus]
You will never know
If you can't feel my heart the way it beats, it slows, slows
Today I almost choked, I thought we got along
I guess we got it wrong
