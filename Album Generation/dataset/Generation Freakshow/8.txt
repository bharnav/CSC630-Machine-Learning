[Intro]
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Woo-oo (woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo) (x2)
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-woo-oo

[Verse 1]
Draw a line around your mind, you feel lost in thought tonight
Lying back on the bed, your legs are restless, eyes are red
You drift back until you fall a hundred feet below, you call out
There's no other way

[Chorus]
In all honesty I always thought that we would just be friends
Looking back on fading photographs, now everything has changed

[Verse 2]
Stepping up to the line, every day seems so defined
Every smile that you fake, the same old promises you break
But you're feeling so alive, your heart is full of hope tonight
There's no other way

[Chorus 2]
In all honesty I always thought that we would just be friends
Looking back on fading photographs, forever changing trends
I'll wait for you right here on foreign land
In all honesty I always thought that we would just be friends

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Woo-oo (woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo) (x2)

[Chorus 2]
In all honesty I always thought that we would just be friends
Looking back on fading photographs, forever changing trends
I'll wait for you right here on foreign land
In all honesty I always thought that we would just be friends
