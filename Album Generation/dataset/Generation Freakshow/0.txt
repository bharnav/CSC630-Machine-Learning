She spent the weekend getting clean
Flushing out the enemy
Her body shivered from the strain
Somehow she can turn her life around
She kept on falling to the ground
Her head was heavy, defenses down
Another day, another week
Somehow she can turn her life around
Live beside a country loving town

She will be waiting alone at night
By a clock that chimes
Dreams of another life
No one to save her, pull her back
From the devil inside

The TV's on but there's no sound
Her confidence was shot down
She felt the water at her feet
Dreaming there's an ocean all around
Childhood memories at Camber Sands

She will be waiting alone at night
By a clock that chimes
Dreams of another life
No one to save her, pull her back
From the devil inside

She lay down to hearing these voices
Calling in the distance to get out
The rain had stopped, above there was a rainbow
Colours reaching up between the clouds
Lighting up that country loving town

She will be waiting alone at night
By a clock that chimes
No one to save her, pull her back
From the devil inside
She will wait now

She will be waiting alone at night
By a clock that chimes
Dreams of another life
No one to save her, pull her back
From the devil inside

She will wait now
She will be waiting
She will wait now
Alone at night
Dreams of another life
No one to save her
She will wait now
Cause the devil's inside
She will wait now
