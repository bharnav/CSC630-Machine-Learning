Trying to find a place to start
Fortune always plays a part
He wonders what tomorrow’s gonna bring
He held his head up to the light
Underneath a moonlit sky
Turned and walked away towards the trees
Cause no one really thought that he would leave
Don’t leave

Oh oh, why was he the first to go?
Johnny didn’t seem right!
Oh oh, someone should have let us know

Some things he could never change
Journeys on the path of fate
Brought him to a crossroads in his life
Sometimes he could make mistakes
Feel that there’s no hope, escape
Fall into the ocean of despair
Leave behind the people that still cared
We cared!

Oh oh, why was he the first to go?
Johnny didn’t seem right!
Oh oh, someone should have let us know

When I think back
Fragments of life seem so short
It's brought it all back
It's quiet as I'm lost in thought

Hey Johnny!
Hey Johnny!

Oh oh, why was he the first to go?
Johnny didn’t seem right!
Oh oh, someone should have let us know
Johnny didn’t seem right!
Oh oh, someone should have let us know
