[Verse 1]
We got to fall back, take cover
Things are going down, we're heading for the gutter
I'm feeling headstrong, the kids are kicking
Riding on the pavements, feeding the addiction

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna keep it all alive, fires burning till sunrise
I wanna keep it all alive

[Chorus]
If you get your head straight, you can find an escape
You can get a head start, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

You can go the right way, follow what the signs say
This could be the best day, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

[Verse 2]
Out on the streets now, inner city
You've got to burn bright, there's no pity
You got to reach up, follow your heart
You got to stand tall, keep your head upfront

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna keep it all alive, fires burning till sunrise
I wanna keep it all alive

[Chorus]
If you get your head straight, you can find an escape
You can get a head start, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

You can go the right way, follow what the signs say
This could be the best day, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

[Bridge]
We step out and we step in
We'll burn bright and suck life in

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna keep it all alive, fires burning till sunrise
I wanna keep it all alive

[Chorus]
If you get your head straight, you can find an escape
You can get a head start, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

You can go the right way, follow what the signs say
This could be the best day, you can get a life
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit

[Outro]
Good times, good times ahead, there's no limit
