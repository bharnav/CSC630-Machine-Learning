When I lie back and close my eyes, it feels like
You're sending love back down to me
I try to keep you there inside with me
But you leave and it's so quiet tonight
Conscience finds a place to hide inside
Lonely as my thoughts divide tonight
I hear you, never thought that I'd ever be alone

She laid right here, right here
Beside me in this bed
I can still hear her voice
It echoes in my head
It's left a hole, a space inside, buried the love
Shut out the light
I don't know where to turn

And all the places that I've seen with you
What I would give to have you by my side
I stare at shadows as they twist, calling
Imagination running wild tonight
Conscience finds a place to hide inside
Lonely as my thoughts divide tonight
I hear you, never thought that I'd ever be alone

She laid right here, right here
Beside me in this bed
I can still hear her voice
It echoes in my head
It's left a hole, a space inside, buried the love
Shut out the light
I don't know where to turn
I don't know where to turn

If I let go, how will it end?
If I let go, how will it end?

She laid right here, right here
Beside me in this bed
I can still hear her voice
It echoes in my head

I'll wait for you to come
Cause I'm lost, my will has gone
I don't know which step to take
You're living in my head

I walk with emptiness
Breathing the loneliness
Tell me where I belong
You're living in my head

I'll wait for you to come
Cause I'm lost, my will has gone
I don't know which step to take
You're living in my head
Living in my head...
