Paroles de la chanson Coast To Coast :
I wanna sit, wait until the daylight comes
I wanna drink coffee from an open cup
I wanna stare up into a pale blue sky
I wanna see each day that comes with open eyes

I wanna know what it’s like to be you
I wanna see the world the way you do
I wanna know cause I’ve been feeling so uptight
Don’t wanna let each moment that I have pass by

I can’t live alone in silence
I won’t sit back in silence

Follow the ocean, head for the sun
Look to the bright side, it’s where we belong
This is the right time, together we run
We’ll take our chances, this could be home

She’s calling me, I looked and it was quarter to five
I had this image flashing in the back of my mind
I’m on a train heading for another town
I’ve got a feeling that I won’t be staying around

I wanna know what it’s like to be you
I wanna see the world the way you do
I wanna know cause I’ve been feeling so uptight
Don’t wanna let each moment that I have pass by

Follow the ocean, head for the sun
Look to the bright side, it's where we belong
This is the right time, together we run
We'll take our chances, this could be home

Follow the ocean, head for the sun
Look to the bright side, it's where we belong
This is the right time, together we run
We'll take our chances, this could be home

Follow the ocean, head for the sun
Look to the bright side, it's where we belong
This is the right time, together we run
We'll take our chances, this could be home

Follow the ocean, head for the sun
Look to the bright side, it's where we belong
This is the right time, together we run
We'll take our chances, this could be home
