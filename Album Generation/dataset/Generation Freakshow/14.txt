Standing in an open space
Surrounded by views as you escape you find a place
Forgotten what it's like to lose freedom and the right
For you to choose which step to take as we go through this life

Things can get a little bit twisted from time to time
But we know when it's right, it's then when we go
We take fire from the sun, this planet's cold
We'll find some place we belong, we've been shining in the dark
Holding on together just like children of the sun

Feeling like we're here again
Staring in the face of circumstance, we understand fortunes
Alying in the wind, turning every corner in this town
No place to land as we go through this life

Things can get a little bit twisted from time to time
But we know when it's right it's then when we go
We take fire from the sun this planet's cold
We'll find some place we belong we've been shining in the dark
Holding on together just like children of the sun

We will never feel alone again as we walk across greener land
As we climb up from a place below feel low
We are guided by a safer hand something tells us
Not to look back down, all of this can be yours

It's then when we go
We take fire from the sun, this planet's cold
We'll find some place we belong we've been shining in the dark
Holding on together just like children of the sun
We're like children of the sun
