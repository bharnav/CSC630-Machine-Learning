Sent you the flowers, I've broken the trust
It's hard to surrender, it's hard to give up
Those summers together, now everything is gone
I'll always remember, you'll always be young, young

Somewhere she's sitting back
Looking at pictures that hang on the walls, oh
Maybe those moments together come back to her
And she recalls

I still feel that somewhere you're alone
And I can't sleep 'cause somewhere you're alone
She was the finest, she had it all
She was an angel, I worshiped her soul

Somewhere she's sitting back
Looking at pictures that hang on the walls, oh
Maybe those moments together come back to her
And she recalls

I still feel that somewhere you're alone
And I can't sleep 'cause somewhere you're alone

Somewhere she's sitting back
Looking at pictures that hang on the walls
Maybe those moments together come back to her
And she recalls

I still feel that somewhere you're alone
And I can't sleep 'cause somewhere you're alone
You're alone, oh
