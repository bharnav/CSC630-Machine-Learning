Black cards in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleedin'
I know there's somethin' wrong
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
Don't know the life that I'm livin'
Ohh, black tambourine
Ohh, black tambourine
My baby run to me
She lives in broken down buildings
Can't pay the rent again
These spider webs are my home now
And when the sun is down
We'll shake and rattle our bodies
To keep it warm at night
My tambourine is still shakin'
Ohh, black tambourine
Ohh, black tambourine
Black cards in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleedin'
I know there's somethin' wrong
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
Don't know the life that I'm livin'
Black tambourine
Ohh, black tambourine
