[Verse 1]
I prayed Heaven today
Bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it

[Verse 2]
I dragged all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
My shoes worn out and used
They can't take me much farther

[Chorus]
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

[Verse 3]
She rides in a car, like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind, aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that was broke, tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert, a beach with no treasure
A night that's so blue, feed the aching in you
And the background birds, take a flight from the earth
Where the bonfire burns and the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating, down a river of sleep

[Verse 4]
I can't see her hollow eyes
I'm walkin' along with my boots full of rocks
I can't believe these tears were mine
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box

[Chorus]
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing

[Outro]
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
