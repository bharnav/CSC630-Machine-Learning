[Verse 1]
Looking for my place on assembly lines
Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
Skeleton boys hyped up on purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Bank notes burn like broken equipment
Looking for shelter, readjust your position
Thought control, ghostwritten confessions
Two dimensions, dumb your head down
Duck, don't look now, company missiles
Power is raunchy, rent-a-cops are watching
Make your dreams out of paper mache
Cliched wasted hate taste-tested

[Chorus]
Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing (please, enjoy)
Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs
Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates (please, enjoy)
Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct

[Post-Chorus]
Yes (hai), yeah, that's it
Umisei, yeah, that's it
Umisei, yeah, that's it
Hai

[Verse 2]
Stretched to the limit, attention spans snap back
Retract, collapsing the laugh tracks
Noise response, applause and handclaps
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
Breaking points on the verge of pointless
Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
Look for the common, not superficial
Code red Cola War conformity crisis
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
With magic markers running out of their ink
Lives in White Out, turn the lights out
Fax machine anthems, get your damned hands up

[Chorus]
Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing (please, enjoy)
Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs
Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates (please, enjoy)
Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct

[Bridge]
Yes (hai) umisei, yeah, that's it
Yes (hai) umisei, yeah, that's it
Yes (hai) umisei, yeah, that's it
Yes (hai) umisei, yeah, yes
I like your bass, yes, your beat is nice, yes

[Outro]
Hell yes, hai, hell yes, hell yes, hell yes, yes, hai
