[Verse 1]
I see you there
Your long black hair
Your eyes just stare
Your mind is turning

[Verse 2]
You know I'll laugh
And I won't take it back
I've seen your eyes
I know what you're thinking

[Verse 3]
And one by one
We'll shoot our guns
We'll have fun
Don't ever doubt it

[Verse 4]
And when I say
Fare thee well
My only friend
Oh, how the days go
Oh, how the days go

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Your setting sun
Your broken drum
Your little drugs
I'll never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
