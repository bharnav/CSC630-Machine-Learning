[Verse 1]
I want to throw up, but for now I hold back
I can't express just how I'm feeling, it's true
You want to grow up, but there's a problem with that
There's no where to go for someone who's as stunted as you
And it's true that I'm disgusted with myself as well
My tongue can not be tamed it's on a fire straight from hell
I eat the dirt you kick up and play the chord that resonates
A gentle word I can not find a way to enunciate

[Chorus]
You make me, you make me
Oh so sick, oh so sick
You make me, yeah, I know you make me
Sick, sick, sick, I get sicker every day, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Still your voice, pump your stomach, set the garbage free
Oh I know you don't get drunk, you just drink socially
Your reasons are all invalids, they can't stand up
And when you talk I hear the brain cells die so keep your mouth shut
I didn't wake up to find myself as a bug
I've been one for much longer than I care to recall
I'm not a junkie lost in Interzone or under the rug
I just eat the bug powder then I climb up the wall

[Chorus]
You make me, you make me
Oh so sick, oh so sick
You make me, yeah, I know you make me
Sick, sick, sick, I get sicker every day, yeah!

[Chorus]
You make me, you make me
Oh so sick, oh so sick
You make me, yeah, I know you make me
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick
You make me, you make me
Oh so sick, oh so sick
You make me, yeah, I know you make me
Sick, sick, sick, I get sicker every day
Sick, sick, sick, I get sicker every day
