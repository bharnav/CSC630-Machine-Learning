I'm gonna shed my skin, deactivate my head
The skin that I regenerate looks like the skin that I just she'd
I'm better suited being typical
I keep choking down the cockroaches until I get full

A centipede! Yeah, a centipede!
The trunk moves independently of the head
Can't keep it quiet, no can't keep it quiet
The lips keep moving when the brain is dead

Don't wanna keep it down, I wanna throw it up
I just can't keep it to myself, I can't shut myself up
Don't need no honesty, it isn't half as fun
I just want to run my mouth
It makes me feel like I am someone

A centipede! Yeah, a centipede!
The trunk moves independently of the head
Can't keep it quiet, no can't keep it quiet
The lips keep moving when the brain is dead

I don't need to meet the arch bishop
Don't need to shake hands in a roman cathedral
Just drag the garbage up out of my guts
For I am all things to all people

A centipede! Yeah, a centipede!
The trunk moves independently of the head
Can't keep it quiet, no can't keep it quiet
The lips keep moving when the brain is dead
