[Verse 1]
Dance with me baby, let me hear your voice
If I didn’t wanna fall for you I never had a choice
Smear the makeup on my face and run your fingers through my hair
Cannot keep my heart from you and I don’t even care
Yeah, you turn me inside out, you make me shake and I can’t stop
You give new meaning to drop dead gorgeous and I’m about to drop

[Chorus]
You are a song to me
And every note of every chord will set me free, yeah
There’s no time before you came along (I know, I know)
Three cheers for the end of twenty one years and nothing else is going wrong

[Verse 2]
Reverberate and complicate my evenings and my days
And I will only love you more, well, I will count the ways
Dance with me and when you see my pulse beneath my skin
It’s racing now, I don’t know how to hold the burning in
You’ve taken from me my defenses, my will is under attack
And baby when I wrap my arms around you, feel the bones in your back

[Chorus]
You are a song to me
And every note of every chord will set me free, yeah
There’s no time before you came along (I know, I know)
Three cheers for the end of twenty one years and nothing else is going wrong
Going wrong

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, your voice is like music, it’s music to my ears
Oh yeah, your voice is like music, it’s music to my ears
I’m not dying anymore, I’m alive baby
I’m not dying anymore, I’m alive baby
I’m not dying anymore, I’m alive baby
I’m not dying anymore, I’m alive
Smear the makeup on my face and run your fingers through my hair
Cannot keep my heart from you and I don’t even care
Yeah, you turn me inside out, you make me shake and I can’t stop
You give new meaning to drop dead gorgeous and I’m about to drop

[Chorus]
You are a song to me
And every note of every chord will set me free, yeah
There’s no time before you came along (I know, I know)
Three cheers for the end of twenty one years and nothing else is going wrong
Going wrong
Going wrong
Going wrong
