I was looking for you when I first heard the sirens
The ambulances filled the streets
The masses screamed and called for help
You were no where next to me
Soldiers came to round up the living
And take them away to somewhere that's safe
But if I can't find you, there's no place to save me
If you are gone then it's too late
Night turns to dawn and dawn into day
And the land overflows with the dead
Where did I last hold you in my arms?
What was the last thing that you said?
Some hide underground
Others hide in a mall
I still drag myself through the streets
A life without my love isn't a life to me
I don't believe that love will rot away
So first aim for the heart, then aim for the head
I wept bitterly and then I threw up
Something silver washed up in my lap
This metal thing, your wedding ring
Brought all of the memories back
I remember the bite and breaking my teeth
I remember choking it down
Eating your fingers one at a time
I left most of you there on the ground
It's there that I find you, just as you were left
And writhing you rise to your feet
Come back to my side with very few insides
They're still strewn about on the street
I have heard it said that love endures all things
Now I know that it's true
Stronger than the grave, death can't put it out
Here I am, the walking dead, still next to you
I don't believe that love will rot away
So first aim for the heart then aim for the head
If true love last forever, then love doesn't die
It just becomes the living dead
