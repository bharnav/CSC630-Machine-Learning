[Verse 1]
Five A.M. rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest, no time to play
Fifteen: the mother is a runaway
No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold so her child can eat

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What is happening to the world we live in
In our home and other lands

[Chorus]
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
Ooh, baby

[Verse 2]
Lil' Johnny all alone
His only friend the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and every day
To be teased because he has no place to stay
This young homeless boy feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it's happening to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way

[Chorus]
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
Ooooh
State of the world
Ooooh
Nation!

[Breakdown]
Can't give up hope now
Let's weather the storm together

[Chorus]
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today

[Outro]
That's the state of the world today
That's the state
That's the state of the world today
