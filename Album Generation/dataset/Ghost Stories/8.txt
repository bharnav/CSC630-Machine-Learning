I'm alone in this life
And these old jeans are too tight
And now I can't pick my feet off the floor
I try to laugh but I cry
My dignity is undignified
Guess I'm really on my own
Love is like a little boy, no I'm not paranoid
But I'm on to you, yeah, yeah
Well I'm not 17 and I don't want to be
So why am I hiding

Is it too late to call you on the phone
Too late to tell you I'm alone
I want to wake you from another lonely night
Too late to wonder where you are
Too late to hold you in my arms
Because if your looking for wonderful
I'm wonderful

I'm a very simple girl
And I don't fit into this world
The city lights leave me in a daze
And even though we've never met
You know that I'm trying to forget
Somethings you can't change

Is it too late to call you on the phone

Too late to tell you I'm alone
I want to wake you from another lonely night
Too late to wonder where you are
Too late to hold you in my arms
Because if you're looking for wonderful
I'm wonderful

I'm underneath
Underneath
I'm underneath
I'm underneath

Is it too late to call you on the phone
Too late to tell you I'm alone
I want to wake you from another lonely night
Too late to wonder where you are
Too late to hold you in my arms
Because if you're looking for wonderful

Is it too late to call you on the phone
Too late to tell you I'm alone
I want to wake you from another lonely night
Too late to wonder where you are
Too late to hold you in my arms
Because if you're looking for wonderful
I'm wonderful
