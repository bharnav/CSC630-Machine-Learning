A child is born
A life begins
To take and hurt
A precious gift

When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much
When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much

And the night gets further from the day
Take me to your wendy house to play

A child is born
A life begins
To take and hurt
A precious gift

When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much
When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much

And the night gets further from the day
Take me to your wendy house to play

When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much
When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much

When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much
When i'm along
It all hits home
Don't it all just seem a little much

And the night gets further from the day
