I don't mean to get into your dreams
But you seem to think it's alright to destroy
You became such an opportunist somewhat dim
It's a bad combination

You can't ever erase that you were not
Popular in school
Can't erase you were poor and a no one
You can't ever erase who you were no matter what you become
I know where you're from
And that you spoke in tongues

I know you're really just hurt and afraid
But you pretend that nothing gets to you

I'm not the kind to dance on a grave
But you're the one who bought me these dancing shoes

You can't ever erase that you were not
Popular in school
Can't erase you were poor and a no one
You can't ever erase who you were no matter what you become
I know where you're from

I can still remember the day
When we first met and I saw myself in you
I don't mean to rain on your parade but the sky's getting dark
And there's nothing that you can do
