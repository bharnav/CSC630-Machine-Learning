Don't you want to get to know me well
Don't lie to me cause I can always tell
When you're feeling strange
I know you

There's no point in banging any blame
The mind is powerful it loves to play
Games that don't come with any rules

I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Feeling like I never thought I could
I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Every line does me good

I know it's not the way we planned
I love it when yo take my hand
And kiss me and then just hold still
You fill me with all your energy
Your poisons, antidotes and sympathies

In a place that no one could ever fill

I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Feeling like I never thought I could
I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Every line does me good

An you won't be alone when you sleep tonight
Cause I worry, oh I'm worrying too
But the ocean sends waves to the beach so we'll play
And to clean all the water up too

I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Feeling like I never thought I would
I'm mad about you
Overwhelmed
Every line does me good
Every line on you face does me good
