It's mothers birthday,she's forty years
And I don't know what to say

Buy her roses and cry her tears
And she'll just give them away
Maybe I'll fight it
Maybe I'll fight it

Why'd I have to grow up so fast?
I just want to stay here and laugh
Oh we only, oh we only blew away

You were wearing my favorite dress
When you left that day
But yellow covers your photograph
You come to me in waves
Baby,I'll find her
Baby, I'll find her

Why'd I have to grow up so fast?
I just want to stay here and laugh
Oh we only, oh we only blew away

I don't want to be the one who has to be afraid
I don't want to be the one who feels so afraid
I just want to be the one to make you smile
And kiss your face

It's mothers birthday, she's forty years
I don't know what to say

Why'd I have to grow up so fast?
I just want to stay here and laugh
Oh we only, oh we only blow away
Why'd I have to grow up so fast?
I just want to stay here and laugh
Oh we only...
