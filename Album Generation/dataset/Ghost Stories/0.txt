We were occupied
I never had to go outside
I was your alibi
We were planning our escape

We stayed up all night
With Lucy in the diamond sky
Drank cheap red wine
And tucked ourselves to sleep

CHORUS
Please don't go
These ghosts of you
The only thing that help get me through the day
Baby please don't go
'Cause I love you
You're the only one that will stay the same

We could laugh out loud
And sing until the sun came out
We took a secret vow
That we would never change

You always loved to dance
I wish we had another chance
To go back in time
And do it all again

CHORUS

I don't want to live forever
But if we could be together
Then I wouldn't mind infinity
I don't want to live forever
Oh, but I can still remember
No, I wouldn't mind infinity

CHORUS x 2
