I don't need to be forgiven
And I don't want your sympathy
It's a mad, mad world
But it's still turning

Don't want to get too complicated
But it gets so dark that I can't see
Yeah it's a mad mad world
But I'm hoping

I'm waiting for the sun to shine

I'll wait until the day I die

I'm tired of living in the shadows
But I'm not giving up on me
Yeah it's a sad sad world
But I'm waiting

I can't worry about tomorrow
Or what each new day's gonna bring
'Cause every dark cloud has a silver lining
