I get so blind, from all of these colours
Dressed up like kings and queens, but it don't mean a thing
A killer I'm not, murderers get caught. If I'm such a criminal, then take me away!

Well I get so tired, of the word on the wire
It's all so black and white, but how quickly it fades
We eat food for thought, and forget what we've got
She was a prisoner, now an alien

Chorus: Over the ocean, a world away
Ghosts from her home, asylum, can't chase away

Oooooooooo...

Chorus (x2)

Ahhhhhh...
