I don't know why the winter's so long
It wears me out
It goes on and on
Yah I don't know why the winter's so long
It seems never ending
It goes on and on

I know you blame yourself but don't

I don't know why this town is so small
It makes me mad
I've seen it all
Yah I don't know why this town is so small
There's nobody left here
Everyone's gone

I know you blame yourself but don't
