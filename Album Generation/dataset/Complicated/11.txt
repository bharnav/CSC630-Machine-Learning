Just packed up in this party
Tipsy off this Bacardi
'Bout to take this fine
So high, say bye, bye
Beep, beep in here all night long
My girl like, Hey that's my song
'Cos I'm feeling bad
So bad, so fine
All the girls that feel me say
(Oh yeah)
In the club you hear me say
(Oh yeah)
Feeling good, feeling great
I look good, don't hate
If a fella's feeling you, say
(Oh yeah)
And they're liking what you do say
(Oh yeah)
Feeling good, feeling great
You look good but don't hate
All my girls get your hair fixed
And your nails done
Put your hands up and say
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You got a drink? Get another one
Make 'em pay for it
Put your hands up and say
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Your hands all over my booty
Two steppin' in my Gucci

Go girl, go girl, go girl
You like the way I shake it
You wanna see me naked
It could be your night
Your night, your night
All the girls that feel me say
(Oh yeah)
In the club you hear me say
(Oh yeah)
Feeling good, feeling great
I look good, don't hate
If a fella's feeling you, say

And they're liking what you do say
(Oh yeah)
Feeling good, feeling great
You look good, don't hate
All my girls get your hair fixed
And your nails done
Put your hands up and say
