[Chorus:]
Whether we're on the phone
Listening to each other breathe
Or cuddling at home
It's like you don't feel me

We built a world of dreams
But now it's fallen all apart
And though you're here
It seems

You're so far
You're so far
You're so far
You're so far

[Verse 1:]
Although we stay in the same town
Feels like you're miles away
Though I seen you last night
It's like I haven't seen you for days

And every time that we speak
It's like we don't have nothing to say
(Damn, how do we love this way?)

I'm running out of words
I'm running out of things to do
I'm tryna understand
Just why you acting brand new

Why your heart's hard
Why you won't let me through
And when I try to come closs (why won't you let me reach you)
(Please leave a message after the tone. Call me back)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Can you connect me again
Cause somehow I feel out of frame
And tell me what to wear
Cause everyday the seasons change

I don't know what it is
But I know that something is strange
(Yeah, can I get the old you in exchange)

For the opening honest guy you used to be
Cause I don't know the one
That's standing in front of me
Could you bring him back
'Cause I never wanted to leave me
No, no, no, no, oh

Something's distant
It's distant
Love
[Look, it's like this]

[Repeat Chorus:]
