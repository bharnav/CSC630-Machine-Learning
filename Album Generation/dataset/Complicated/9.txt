Verse 1:
Im sick of all these folk telling lies to me
Trying to steal my dreams and I can't believe
The one I trusted with my life took everything
That he could steal from me I didn't know a thing
My momma crying to me cause she's tired of working
And she ain't healthy, and its killing me
Cause I know I worked enough to help my family
But they still struggling, Im going CRAZY! OHHHH

Chorus:
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
(I can't take this no more, No More)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( No more, Just can't take this no more)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( I can't take this no more, Oh Yeah)

Verse 2:
I got a grandma pushing sixty riding MARTA
For some food stamp dollas
(made me wanna holla)
I know somebody here just what talking bout
I almost had a spouse till he put me out
Said my sister got three babies and they need me
My daddy scares me, cause I know he's hurting
Im tired of tryna save the world
When I can't save my save self
Whats the use to even try
When it ain't nothing LEFT!!!!

Bridge:
Sometimes I just wanna cry (Cry when i think)
When I think about the things that
Happened to ME!!!!

Chorus:
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
(I can't take this no more)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( I am walking out the door, Yeah)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( Ain't no coming back, I'm sure yall)
I can't take it
(NO MORE!!!)

Bridge 2:
See I just want yall to feel me
I know that you been through some
Things that made ya, Walk Away
Just Keep your Head up (Keep Your Head Up)
Hold Ooooon On!!)JUST CANT TAKE THIS NO MORE!!)

Chorus: No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
(I can't take this no more,HEY)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( I am walking out the door, Yeah)
No More, No More,No More,No More,No More
( Ain't no coming back, I'm sure yall dont hear me)

No More, No More, No
