Rain, rain is the channel that no one wants to turn to
A series of bad signals that no one wants to belong to
Yet it purifies and brings purpose for the next sunny day
As my tears reach the edge of my nose
They fall to meet the rains' reflection on the ground
In that same breath cupid shot me down

So fast i wondered how, you could not
See through the storm life has in store for you
But in order to see sunshine in the end
There would have to be rain in the beginning
