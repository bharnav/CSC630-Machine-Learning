[R Kelly]
I pulled up in this all chrome
Whole body is all stone
Hopped out on tha cell phone
This sh-- bouta be on
Im in tha club like (ohh ohh)
4 shots of da Henndo
Babygirl ain't no joke
Got that thong in a choke hold
Im talkin about Nivea

[Nivea]
So many fellas up in tha club
Which one of them here for me
Das dat brotha who can flip my covers
And fulfill my fantasy
Lookin for a hook up
Doubtcha know me
Who can take me to go shopping
Wit a little bit of BIG
And a little bit of Pac
Wrapped up in one for me

[Chorus]
Im lookin for a gangsta guy
'cause imma gangsta girl
Im lookin for a gangsta boy
To share my gangsta world

[repeat]

Fellas u got doe u gangsta
U gotta whip u gangsta
Ya own crib u gangsta
A big -- u gangsta

[verse 2]
Im lookin for a hook up ride or die
Rich and can hold his own
Gangsta gangsta when its goin down
Be the shelter and my stone
When he's goin to the club
Its all good 'cause im hangin wit my girls
So eenie meenie miney moe
Real gangstaz tho em up lets go

[Chorus]
Here papi here papi iy-yi-yi

Come 2 mami yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

[Chorus]
