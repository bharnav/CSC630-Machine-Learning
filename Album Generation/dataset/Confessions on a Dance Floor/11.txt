[Verse 1]
You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the garden
You be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

[Chorus]
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no

[Verse 2]
Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari did too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

[Chorus]
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no you know it
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

[Break]
No, no
You know it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the garden
You be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

[Chorus]
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

[Outro]
No, no
You know it
