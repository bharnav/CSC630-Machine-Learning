[Verse 1]
I don't like cities
But I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London
Baby, you can keep

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Verse 2]
If you don't like my attitude
Then you can F off
Just go to Texas
Isn't that where they golf
New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat
Then get off my street

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Outro - Repeated]
I love New York
Get off my street
Get off my street
