[Intro]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?

[Verse 1]
It's funny
I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about
I did it
Just about everything
To see my name in lights

[Chorus 1]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve it

[Chorus 2]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?

[Verse 2]
It's funny
How everybody mentions my name
But they're never really nice
I took it
Just about everything
Except my own advice

[Chorus 1]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve it

[Chorus 2]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make? (nothing lasts forever)
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone? (doesn't make a difference)
Will any of this matter?

[Bridge]
Nothing lasts forever
Doesn't make a difference

[Verse 3]
How high
Doesn't make a difference
Nothing lasts forever
Should I
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?

[Chorus 2]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make? (nothing lasts forever)
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone? (doesn't make a difference)
Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
