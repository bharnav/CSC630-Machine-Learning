[Hook]
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)

[Verse 1]
I don't, don't care if it's not right
(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
To have your arms around me
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's going to break your heart)
I want to feel what it's like
(Let go, let go)
Take all of you inside of me

[Chorus]
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

[Verse  2]
I know that you're no good for me
That's why I feel I must confess
What's wrong is why it feels so right
I want to feel your sweet caress

[Chorus]
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

[Verse 3]
If I only had one wish
Love would always feel like this
Wishing on the stars above
Forbidden love
If I only had one dream
This would be more than it seems
Forbidden love (forbidden love)

[Hook]
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)
Is the greatest aphrodisiac

[Chorus]
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

[Outro]
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
Love should always feel like this
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me
[repeat and fade]
