[Verse 1]
Now I can tell you about success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile?

[Chorus 1]
Let it will be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?

[Chorus 2]
Now I can tell you about the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down

[Chorus 1]
Let it will be
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?

[Verse 2]
Now I can see things for what they really are
I guess I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return
Just watch me burn

[Chorus 1]
Let it will be
Just let it be
Oh, let it be
Let it will be (just let it be)
Just let it be (let it will be)
Oh, let it be (got to let it be)
Oh, let it be (Won't you let it be?)

[Chorus 2]
Now I can tell you the place that I belong
It won't last long
The lights they will turn down

[Chorus 1]
(Oh, let it be)
Oh, let it be
Oh, let it be (won't you let it be?)
Oh, let it be (you got to let it be)
Just let it be  (anyone can see)
Oh, let it be (let it will be)

[Bridge]
Just watch me burn
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
Won't you let it be? (just let it be)
Oh, let it be (let it will be)
Just let it be (don't you let it be?)
Won't you let it be? (won't you let it be?)

[Elision]
Now I can tell you (oh, let it be)
Tell you, tell you.. (just let it be)
About success, about fame
Won't you let it be? (about fame, about fame..)
Won't you let it be?
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
