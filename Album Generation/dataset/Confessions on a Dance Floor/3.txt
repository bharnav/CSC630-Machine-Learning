[Intro]
I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans
Come with me

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Intro Continued]
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

[Verse 1]
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try? (try, try)

[Verse 2]
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide
Love inside their eyes (eyes, eyes)

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Verse 3]
Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine
For eternity
In a world that's free

[Verse 4]
Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on
To a dream that's gone

[Bridge]
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Post-Chorus]
There's no love like the future love
Come with me

[Verse 1]
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Verse 1]
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
Connect to the sky
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

[Verse 1]
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
Connect to the sky
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try

[Outro]
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
(In the evidence of its brilliance)
In the evidence of its brilliance
