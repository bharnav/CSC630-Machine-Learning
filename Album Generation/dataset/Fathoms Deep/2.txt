If we do nothing wrong
We feel victorious
But is it good enough
Just too avoid the bad
CHORUS
I can swim in the water
But I won’t drift with the tide
I can go where the 4 winds blow
But I won’t run and I won’t hide
Time hates our love to stay
Drives us to be alone
Slow rain to wash away
Our names from marble stone
CHORUS
One day if you see me
Dressed in my cotton gown
Cry out as they lower me
Into the cold cold ground
CHORUS
