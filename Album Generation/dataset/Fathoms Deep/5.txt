I have wings to soar to fly a bird I long to be
Now the earth is cracked and dry the air will carry me
And if I wear my feathered crown no human I will try
No falling I will spread my wings and fly
And what will swim inside my blood like Mississippi brine
And where my footprints drag thru mud my only earthly sign
And now I hear from rocky cliff the pure white seabirds cry
And like them I will spread my wings and fly
Above a black and roaring sea so effortless I glide
And if the winter come to me in feathered nest I hide
Into a day of turquoise-gold I blaze into the sky
In rolling air I spread my wings and fly
And all the humans far below how stale and tired they seem
Earthbound they can never know the glory I have seen
And find no mercy in my face no gentle loving sigh
For bird-like I will spread my wings and fly, and fly and fly
