This is the slow train baby
With the worn out seats and rusted engine
This is the slow train baby
With the smoke stack gone and a broken fender
But it's all that I got
Yeah it's all that I got
So let me live my life and go
Chorus
Where did the road divide
Why did I follow the signs that pointed backwards
When did the feeling take me
That I'm tired of coping such a fool for hoping
Chorus
Ooh this is a slow train baby you gotta let me live my life and go
