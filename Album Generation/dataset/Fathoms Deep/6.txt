I learnt my lesson
I learnt it well
I can't go far without you
I can't go far
They say love is everything
I know this is true
I can do anything
When I'm here with you
People never change until their back's against the wall
I can't seem to change but as the axe begins to fall
I fall for you my love
I fall for you
And in our wilderness
A concrete rose
I watered with my tears
I helped it grow
People never change until their back's against the wall
I can't seem to change but as the axe begins to fall
I fall for you my love
I fall for you
