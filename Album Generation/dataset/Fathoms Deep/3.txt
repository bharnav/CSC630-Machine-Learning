Hold me close my little lamb
Fortune favours the brave and I love you so much
But the drinkers in the bar room of your mind
Are the very ones I didn’t want to find
Secretly the past comes in
Poisoning the good things exaggerates the bad
And the lifer in the prison of your heart
Is the very one to tear our love apart
O why did I pick the weakest rose
Why did I plant a blood red vine
Why do I hate the thing I chose?
And call-a bad man mine
And call-a bad man mine
I wonder now maybe it’s over
But I can’t stand the sight of you looking unhappy
But the idler in the factory of your eyes
Is the only one I truly now despise
CHORUS
O Why did I pick the weakest rose
Why did I plant a blood red vine
Why do I hate the thing I chose?
And call a bad man mine
And call a bad man mine
And call a bad man mine
And call a bad man mine
