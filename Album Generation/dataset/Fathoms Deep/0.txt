From the east a dust cloud rose - dark against the sky
I knew then they were after us
By noon next day we came upon a well that had run dry
I preyed then for a miracle
I thought back to the time - an island fresh and green
The sun in your hair - your face all the joy I had seen
We walked to Port Erin fair - your hand slips into mine
O why did I leave - to sail over oceans in time
So bitter now the wine
We hid inside a roofless church – waiting for to die
While birds of prey were circling
I held the ring you gave to me - so tightly in my hand
And knew one day we’d meet a again
CHORUS
In a dream you came to me - dried blood upon your head
You took my hand and spoke to me
There is a place I’m going to - no vale of tears you said
And one day you will join me there
CHORUS
