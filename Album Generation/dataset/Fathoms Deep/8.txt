We travelled light and moved by night
A bitter foe we harried
We camped at dawn and ate the corn
We carried
CHORUS
On the day the soldiers came
The bullets fell like driving rain
They drove us up to Capstan Hill
Where from our coats the grain did spill
And though to heaven we all flew
In the Spring the bright corn grew
In the Spring the bright corn grew
On that day cut flowers we lay
Our blood through earth was seeping
And cross the sky pale riders rode by
All weeping
CHORUS
A flame goes out no gun will doubt
How cheap the life it’s claiming
And here for you just love that’s true
Remaining
CHORUS
