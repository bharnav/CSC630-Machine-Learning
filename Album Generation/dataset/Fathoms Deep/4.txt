This was to be
Something I thought
Would set us free
Now we’re tied more and more
Hollow with the child I never bore
Following a path we never saw
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand love
I don’t know if I’ll ever understand
Just let me go
I want too much
Faith proved too strong
It kept me bound to your touch
I never meant to hurt you anytime
I never knew that I could be so blind
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand
Who’ll take my hand I dunno if I’ll ever understand love
No I don’t know if I’ll ever understand love
I don’t know if I’ll ever understand love
