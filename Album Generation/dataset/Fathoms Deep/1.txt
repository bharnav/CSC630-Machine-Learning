Dying lights blood red caberat
No reason so before the red eyed evening prey
Crows drop through hot copper dusk
Our shadows move but never us
I dream of horses
Lean down on me
Lean down on me
They bore you not sleeping through the trees
Suits of black cold stonework frieze lone tolling bell
Ten years ago beside the fence you laughed and gestured without sense
I drifted north
Lean down on me
Lean down on me
