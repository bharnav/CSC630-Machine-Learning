Verse 1]
I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

[Hook]
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

I missed you

[Verse 2]
I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

[Hook]
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

[Verse 3]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
Why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and so new

[Hook]
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
