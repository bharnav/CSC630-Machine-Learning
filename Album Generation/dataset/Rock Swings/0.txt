[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Frank said it, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

[Verse 2]
This is for the ones who stood their ground
Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Frank said it, "He did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

[Bridge]
You better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't break down

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
Ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's an open highway
Frank said, "He did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
Just want to live while I'm alive
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
