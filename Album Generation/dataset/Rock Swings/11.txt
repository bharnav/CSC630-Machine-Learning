[Verse 1]
We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk and kiss
Slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

[Chorus]
Into the sea
You and me
These years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you, we missed you
The lovecats
We're the lovecats

Wonderful
Wonderfully pretty
Yes I would do anything for you
We should have each other to tea
Lets have each other with cream
Curl up by the fire
Sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
The perfect dream

[Chorus]
Into the sea
You and me
These years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you, we missed you
The lovecats
We're the lovecats
We're the lovecats
The lovecats

[Outro]
Wonderfully pretty
We're the lovecats
