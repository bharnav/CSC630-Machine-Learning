[Verse 1]
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, yes
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

[Pre-Hook]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

[Hook]
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

[Verse 2]
I like the feeling you're giving me
Hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
And I'll be working from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side

[Pre-Hook]
And I've never felt so in love before
Promise me baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Hook]
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
Gone, gone

[Bridge]
And I said oh
You make me feel good
Yes, you kiss me
I feel your fever
Woah baby
You make me feel so good
Pretty baby

You're really turning me on
