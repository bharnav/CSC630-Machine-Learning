I get up, and nothin' ever gets me down
You got it tough, huh, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby just how you feel
You gotta roll with the punches to get what's real

Oh can't you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean

Might as well jump (Jump)
Might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump (Jump)

(Hey you) Huh, hey babe how you been
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin

Can't you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean

Might as well jump (Jump)
You might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead jump (Jump)
Go ahead and just jump (Jump)
Knock yourself out

Can't you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean

Might as well jump (Jump)
Might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump baby (Jump)
Come on jump (Jump)
Might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead knock yourself out (Jump)
Go ahead and jump (Jump)
Come on and jump (Jump)
Jump
