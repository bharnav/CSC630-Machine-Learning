As he did so, her body slammed backwards
At first it was my impresion when I saw her eyes that she was sleeping
But she was already dead
He called her name

Cold
Dead
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,–sweetheart!

Oh yes, he called her name …

Look at the mess
In your party dress
Baby’s gone blue

That fixed expression
She was already dead

Who are you going to send flowers to?
Who are you going to send flowers to?

Oh yes, he called her name
I’ll never forget about that, that fixed
Expression
It didn’t feel right

Cold
Dead
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,–sweetheart!

He called her name
Crash out
Alcohol

Look at the mess
In your party dress
Baby’s gone blue

Did you hear about that?
At first it seemed...
But she was dead
Her body slammed backwards
The first thing
The first thing, alcohol
It didn’t feel right
But she was already dead
