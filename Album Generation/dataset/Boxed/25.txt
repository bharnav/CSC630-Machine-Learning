Home is where the heart is
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

Home is where the heart is
Now I’ve understood
Home is still a stranger
It’s never any good

Home is just a story
A room without a view
Pretty picture on the wall
Memories of you

(Memories)

Home is where the heart is
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

Can’t be far away (x14)
