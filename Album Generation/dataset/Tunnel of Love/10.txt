[Verse 1]
Times were, though love was not enough
So you said, "Sorry, Johnny, I'm gone, gone, gone"
You said my act was funny
But we both knew what was missing, honey
So you lit out on your own
Now that pretty form that you've got, baby
Will make sure you get along
But you're gonna find out some day, honey

[Chorus]
When you're alone, you're alone [x3]
When you're alone, you ain't nothing but alone

[Verse 2]
Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city
And I fought to make 'em my home
With just the shirt on my back, I left and swore I'd never look back
And, man, I was gone, gone, gone
But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming
And send you crawling like a baby back home
You're gonna find out that day, sugar

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I knew some day your runnin' would be through
And you'd think back on me and you
And your love would be strong
You'd forget all about the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had
And you'd want to come home
Now it ain't hard feelings or nothing, sugar
That ain't what's got me singing this song
It's just nobody knows, honey, where love goes
But when it goes it's gone gone

[Chorus]
