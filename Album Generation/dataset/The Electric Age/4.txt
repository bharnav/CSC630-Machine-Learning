Twisting and turning
The incessant burning the night
Never quite learning the truth
Wrong versus right
Wings that are broken
Words never spoken in flight
The future now open
Then flashes to hide out of sight

Don't you look so fucking sad
I'll beat you like you never had
Can't hide behind the purity
There'll be no more security
God not here to serve you now
I'm here to give and show you how
Darkness and light, darkness and light

Naked disaster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Make it go faster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

Deadly sensation
The cold liquidation unfold
Disintegration
In pure isolation they fold
Wheels that are broken
Once were outspoken and rolled
The future now open
Explode to lose all control

Black ring painted round your heart
This is where we're gonna start
Can't hide behind that riddled soul
I can see right through the holes
God don't want to beat about
Let's clean it up and sort it out
Darkness and light, darkness and light

Naked disaster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Make it go faster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

Twisting and turning
The incessant burning
Twisting and turning
Burn, burn, burn, burn

Don't you look so fucking sad
I'll beat you like you never had
Can't hide behind the purity
There'll be no more security
God not here to serve you now
I'm here to give and show you how
Darkness and light, darkness and light

Naked disaster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Make it go faster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself

Save yourself, save yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
Save yourself
Make it go faster
Only you can save yourself
Save yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
