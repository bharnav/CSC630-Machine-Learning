Name the father, son and the fixer
And to the warmth we all feel inside
Strap it on and pour the elixir
To the days we count as alive

Concrete Jesus in a Hell of a fix
He makes his living
On a heavy-handed mix
More, more, more, more

Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me down adrenaline highway
Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me up and count me alive

Seem to pray whenever I need it
Seem to sin whenever I want
Strap it on, intending to bleed it
An easy mark, so nonchalant

Concrete Jesus got the law on his side
He gets his kicks pissing on my pride

Call in the fixer, call in the fixer
More, more, more, more

Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me down adrenaline highway
Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me up and count me alive

Amputated spirit, executed soul
None but the shell of before
Exterminated, feel it as it fills the hole
Hear them screaming, they want more
More, more, more, more
More, more, more, more

Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me down adrenaline highway
Black daze, black daze, white haze
Shoot me up and count me alive
