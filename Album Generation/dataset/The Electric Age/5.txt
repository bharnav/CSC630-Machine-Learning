Hold your feet to the fire
Hold your face
To the ground, ground, ground
Hold on tight, you're a target, baby
Drop the hammer down

I'm a long life, loving hate
I'm a bomb that makes no sound
Could you please?
Would you loosen these?
I'm about to fucking drown

Lowdown and overloaded
Keeping you alive
I see that you've exploded
On the other side
Lowdown and lowdown and
Kicking it around
I see that you've exploded
Drop the hammer down

In a mock execution
In a house and gag and bound
Not the best of solution
Drop the hammer down

I'm a long life, hating love
Under my dirt mound
If you could stand where we stood
We're not fucking around

Lowdown and overloaded
Keeping you alive
I see that you've exploded
On the other side
Lowdown and lowdown and
Kicking it around
I see that you've exploded
Drop the hammer down

Let's hear for the black and blue
For the tortured soul
The battered crew
Three cheers for the black and blue

Raise a glass to the beaten down
To their dignity and bloodless frown
Three cheers for the beaten down

Drop dead dreams in a deep, dirt ditch
Buried by a shovel hand
Dead screams from the son of a bitch
Coming out to beat the hand
Oh baby, how I love your bite
Turn my smile upside down
Oh baby, how I hate your light
As you drop the hammer down

Hold your feet to the fire
Hold your face
To the ground, ground, ground
Hold on tight, you're a target, baby
Drop the hammer down

I'm a long life, hating love
Under my dirt mound
If you could stand where we stood
We're not fucking around

Lowdown and overloaded
Keeping you alive
I see that you've exploded
On the other side
Lowdown and lowdown and
Kicking it around
I see that you've exploded
Drop the hammer down
