Think that I know you
But I just can't place the face
Got something to show you
It can never be replaced
Wherever we walk, wherever we fly
Wherever we live, wherever we die
Think that I know you
But I just can't say goodbye

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we gonna fly
Come and get it

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we going high
Come and get it

Remember the rising
When the lightning filled the air
No compromising
In a strapped electric chair

We never could walk
We always could fly
We never could live
We always could die
Think that I know you
But I just can't talk too high
Over your horse and ride

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we gonna fly
Come and get it

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we going high
Come and get it, come and get it

Do you know a better way
To make it all good inside?
All the friends have died away
By a new law they abide
And all God's children, there they go
Judgement on their side
Do you know a better way
To make it all good inside?

And I cry
Does it make you feel better?
Sing it

Do you know a better way
To make it all good inside?
All the friends have died away
By a new law they abide
And all God's children, there they go
Taking the free ride
Do you know a better way
To make it all good inside?

All God's children, there they go
Taking the free ride
Do you know a better way
To make it all good inside?

And I cry

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we gonna fly
Come and get it

This is it
Hey now, don't it make you feel better?
Come and get it
This is it
Here we go, we going high
Come and get it, come and get it
Come and get it, come and get it
