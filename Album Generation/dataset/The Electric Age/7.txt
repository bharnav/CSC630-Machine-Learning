We ran it out, took another chance
Between the real and the disappear
We turned about, did the devil's dance
Screamed we got to get on out of here
There's no rest for the hunted
They only live to stay alive
So we took our chance with the devil's dance
And kicked it into overdrive

First in and last out, a thorn in the side
First in to fight, let it ride

Got a lot of mouth for a Jersey white boy
Beat the drum, now you've gone too far
Drag it out, eat it up, enjoy
Old wounds, brand new scars

The screams would come, keep us up at night
I couldn't even sleep a wink
Now I beat the drum, find a strange delight
Knowing the my eyes don't blink
There's no meat for the hungry
They only eat to stay alive
So we screamed so loud, that we cleared the clouds
And cheered the swan to dive

The screams would come, keep us up at night
I couldn't even sleep a wink
Now I beat the drum, find a strange delight
Knowing the my eyes don't blink
.....Head don't think

So you see my friend, there is no end, this was only yesterday
So we burned the hope, we took all the dope
It what you carry what it weigh
There's no hope for the hunted, he only play to live by chance
And the overdrive kept us all alive, as the fires burned
At the devil's dance
