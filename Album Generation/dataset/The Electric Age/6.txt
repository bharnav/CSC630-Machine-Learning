Suck it up, it's a new sensation
He's a twenty-first century man
Hooked on into a new vibration
You can tell by shaking hands

Waiting on the next war
Suitcase in his hand
Feeling his head throb
He lights up a flash mob

Hey damnation, watch you go now
A better battle plan
Hey mutation, techno freak how
Twenty-first century man
Hey damnation, in your face
Does the best you can
Hey mutation, outer space for
Twenty-first century man

Suck it up as the worlds collide
He's a twenty-first century man
Living large and he's cast aside
There's got to be a better
Plan, plan, plan

Praying on the next war
IPhone in his hand
Feeling his heart jump
Turn up the heat pump

Hey damnation, watch you go now
A better battle plan
Hey mutation, techno freak how
Twenty-first century man
Hey damnation, in your face
Does the best you can
Hey mutation, outer space for
Twenty-first century man

Twenty-first century man
Twenty-first century man
Twenty-first century man
Twenty-first century man
All the colours turn to gray
The innocence has gone away
Too much info here to stay
Twenty-first century man

Suck it up and the masturbation
Said the twenty-first century man
I'm hooked on into a goodbye nation
You can tell by his futile hands
Heading down the fast road
Limited attention span
Feeling his soul burn
Never did quite learn

Hey damnation, watch you go now
A better battle plan
Hey mutation, techno freak how
Twenty-first century man
Hey damnation, in your face
Does the best you can
Hey mutation, outer space for
Twenty-first century man

Twenty-first century man
