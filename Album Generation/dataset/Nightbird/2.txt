Let's take one more rocket to the moon
Before we wake I'll kiss your eyes and lie between
While you sleep is all around
Just look up in the air
And find it
Just wish upon a star
And find it

It's dawning
I'm gently falling
The rhythm of water
And windows are white
Darling soft as your pillow
I'm slowly drowning
Go spiralling down
As you catch your breath

A keychain in your pocket just for luck
I hold it in and close my eyes to hide a tear
And what we need is all around us
Just say a little prayer
And find it
Just look up in the air
And find it

Walking into your life
Love without knowing I'm out of my mind
Calling straight to your heart
I'm slowly drowning and morning is here
As I catch my breath

And what we need is all around us
Just look up in the air
And find it
Just say a little prayer
And find it

Walking into your life
Love without knowing I'm out of my mind
Calling straight to my heart
I'm slowly drowning and morning is here
