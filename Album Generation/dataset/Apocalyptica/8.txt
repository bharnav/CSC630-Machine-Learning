All that I ever wanted
- to understand my nightmares
Possessed by my fears
Betrayed by my Pride
Alone I wandered in the deepest Dark
Seeking comfort from the vanity
Each time I escape the Real
My soul died, died a bit more
Confronting the evil within
Praying for my angel to appear
Agonized whisper into the emptiness
Begging for salvation - salvation for this cursed mind
Words without meaning
Touch without feeling
- I did not recognize my own face...
Eyes that were once shining
- now extinguished
Left only a silent cold
Sound of a tear falling down
In the desperate hour of loneliness
This shattered heart reaching
For it's relief - the relief it can not find
Glance without affection
Kiss without sensitivity
Promise without comprehension
Love without hope
-I do not remember my own tale...
Betrayed by my Anger
Betrayed by my Beliefs
Betrayed by my Delusions
Betrayed by my Lust
(I wish)
Strength - to be released from my demons
(I desire)
Wisdom - to forgive the past
- to forgive Me
