There's aluminium cans an' cigarette butts
Lyin' in the sides of street
Baseball field in the county park
Buried in a blanket of weeds

There's a swastika sprayed from an aerosol can
Displayed on the overpass
Drivin' around, it's easy to see
This town's goin' down real fast

Somebody should do somethin' about it
How hard could it be?
Somebody should do somethin' about it
Maybe that someone is me

Followed a couple into Ferguson's Grille
The doors swung back in my face
Closed my eyes but I felt the stares
When I bowed my head to say grace

Watched the table of suits stiff the waitress a tip
Like they didn't have a nickel to spare
Walked out in the heat risin' on Main Street
But I felt the chill in the air

Somebody should do somethin' about it
(Somebody, somebody)
How hard could it be?
Somebody should do somethin' about it
(Somebody, somebody.)
Maybe that someone is me

I don't expect this world to be Heaven
But it sure could be better
I could sit around bitchin'; stand around waitin'
But I might be waitin' forever
(Forever, forever.)

Somebody should do somethin' about it
(Somebody, somebody)
How hard could it be?
Somebody should do somethin' about it
(Somebody, somebody.)
Maybe that someone is me...
