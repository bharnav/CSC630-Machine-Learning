There's a back road leadin' off the hard-top
Half-a-mile past the slingshot tree
Wanders round through a million mem'ries
It's callin' me, callin' me

There's a white house with fading shutters
The old front door that never needed a key
An' I hear my Momma in the hush of the evenin'
Callin' me, yeah, she's callin' me

An' no matter where I'm goin'
It reminds me of where I'm from
Just as long as I can hear it
I know I'm not too far gone

There's a first kiss under the willow
Love so honest, it was hard to believe
An' even when my heart is breakin'
It's callin' me, callin' me

Yes, it's callin' me
(Ooh, yeah, yeah.)
Callin' me, callin' me

An' no matter where I'm goin'
It reminds me of where I'm from
Just as long as I can hear it
I know I'm not too far gone

There's a tiny country chapel
Filled with voices singin' harmony
An' when my soul is lost in the silence
Oh, it's callin'; yes, it's callin' me

Yes it's callin' me
(Callin' me.)
Callin'
Oh, it's callin'
Yes, it's callin' me...
