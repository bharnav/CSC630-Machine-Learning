You took me out so far that I can't swim to shore
I've been holdin' on but you're not any more
Our love would always lead us home, constant as the Northern Star
Here's a storm we won't get through 'cause it's not in your heart

I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If I could be what's missing, that's all I'd want to be
I can feel you drifting

In the silence that's become the company we keep
I realise how far we are from what we used to be
A part of you has gone somewhere that I can't seem to touch
I could stay and take what's left, but, baby, that's not us

I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If I could be what's missing, that's all I'd want to be
I can feel you drifting

If I could be what's missing, that's all I'd want to be
I can feel you drifting
I can feel you drifting
You're out of reach...
