I was young, so was she
Life didn't stay a mystery for very long...
We could do no wrong
Then she called, said she was late
So we took a little drive upstate an' took care of that...
Yeah, just took care of that

But now I'm longin' back at some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change...
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges

Now my old man, he had it rough
'Cause like his Daddy, when he drank too much
He'd get mean, an' take it out on me
So with angry words, I was gone
I never even tried to go back home, the night he died
Momma said he apologized

Now I'm longin' back on some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change...
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges

[Instrumental break]

We could all go crazy from
Things that only time can dull
I guess that's why everyone is given
Water and bridges
Water and bridges
Water and bridges

[Instrumental fade]
