The night will start to fall
You'll lie awake recalling every tender thing she said
You'll think about her laugh
Her touch, her smile becomes a photograph
You can't forget
Not just yet

You're gonna know that night
When you reach out an' she's not there
An' there's more pain than your heart can bear
Love's just a river till you've crossed it
Suddenly everything in your life feels wrong
You're alive but the reason's gone
You'll know love when you've lost it

You'll know the taste of tears
You know you will for years, 'cause there's a treuth you can't get past
Some bridges will not burn

(Some bridges will not burn.)
But some corners must be turned so you can love again at last
And not look back

Still until that that night
When you reach out an' she's not there
An' there's more pain than your heart can bear
Love's just a river till you've crossed it
Suddenly everything in your life feels wrong
You're alive but the reason's gone
You'll know love when you've lost it

It's so easy to recognise
You'll know love when you've lost it...
