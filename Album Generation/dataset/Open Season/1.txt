Be gone
Be gone
Be gone your olden ways, be gone
Don't be afraid of anyone
Like seasons, just move on

Aorta liver ventricles
And other winter vehicles
From indigo to crystalline
You've one more chance, so get it right

Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me

Oh don't believe all of your golden memories
They're little more than make believe
So listen carefully

Agonic lines, ascendances and amatory tendencies
From here to heart arrhythmias
Oh don't you know we're not like this

Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and it reflects me

Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me
