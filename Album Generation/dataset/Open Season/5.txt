Drape yourself in greenery
Become part of the scenery
Ever since time immemorial
It's all stored up in chemicals
Witness the demolition of boy in prime condition, oh
Into the dusk, we will descend
I hope and pray that this won't end
So say goodbye to everybody
Tell them all I am so sorry
Oh, I wish I could have said goodbye

What else could I do?
What else could I do?

Drape yourself in greenery
Become part of the scenery
Into the past, we'll all descend
We'll hope and pray that it won't end

Drape yourself in greenery
Become part of the scenery
Oh drape yourself in greenery
Become part of the scenery
