Then you'll discover
Under your cover
The strangest thing that
I ever heard of

It makes you wonder
Why you're here
And why you feel so
Strangely weird

Cause we're not going home
And me I'm not alone
No we're not going home
From the sea to the land beyond

And when we get there
We will go wandering
In the wilderness
Getting in a mess

And when we find it
I'll keep on wondering
And here's another thing
You didn't know 'til now

Cause we're not going home
And me I'm not alone
No we're not going home
From the sea to the land beyond

Cause we're not going home
And me I'm not alone
No we're not going home
Going to the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond

From the sea to the land beyond
From the sea to the land beyond
From the sea to the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond
