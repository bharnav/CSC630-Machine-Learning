Oh take me somewhere quiet please
These motorway exit gates
Are calling to me dearly
And I need a place to go

And even numbers on a timetable
Arrivals and departures and
Those places' names
Never seemed so strange before

If there's anyone asking, did you get a rush?
There's no point in asking if it wasn't enough
There's nobody else here, so please stand up
If there's anyone asking, did you get a rush?
There's no point in asking, it wasn't enough
There's nobody else here, so please stand up

The occultation of a summer sun
Was burning holes in everyone
Defenceless, what was left inside could finally escape

It seemed as if the streets had melted
It seemed as if the air was scented
I wish all of time could be like this

If there's anyone asking, did you get a rush?
There's no point in asking, it wasn't enough
There's nobody else here, so please stand up

Oh oh, oh my love

If there's anyone asking, did you get a rush?
There's no point in asking, it wasn't enough
There's nobody else here, so please stand up

And then all of the sudden it's all better better
A little excitement makes us wetter wetter

Oh my love
Again, again, again, again my love
