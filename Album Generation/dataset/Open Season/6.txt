Took a pill last night, just to get to sleep
Put me on my back, not on my feet
Propylene across your eyes
To take me to the land of sighs

Had a drink last night, just to get to sleep
Put me on my back, knocked me off my feet
Filled my skin with ethylnol
To find some peace, to let it fall

Eight hours a day - call it twenty years
There's a place you can go
Free of lust, cupidity and fear

Oh it left my heart broken
It took my breath away
A lesson open
A little more each day

A little eyesore
A little Nytol
A little heartache
A little soothe-all

Melatonin, a little dose, takes things to a peaceful close
Commerce runs through your veins
And takes you from this waking plane
Industry on your side
To do what you do, when you get tired

Eight hours a day - call it twenty years
There's a place you can go
Free of lust, cupidity and fear

Oh it left my heart broken
It took my breath away
A little lesson open
A little more each day

A little eyesore
A little Nytol
A little heartache
A little soothe-all

A little eyesore
A little Nytol
A little heartache
A little soothe-all
