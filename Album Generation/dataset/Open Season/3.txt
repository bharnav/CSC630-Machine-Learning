Mother
Maiden aunt or brother
On the masonary, and there are others
Like you, beheaded lover
In the cemetery
Seems rather sad to me
Oh seems rather sad to me
Oh amour centenary
Available for all to see

But in between the morning and the evening light
Is how the days go by
And in between the evening and the morning light
Oh don't the stars look nice
But in between the evening and the morning light
Is how the days go by
And in between the evening and the morning light
Oh don't the stars look nice

At first the settings broke
Now the machinery stops
And the country's all sectioned off
Like a honeycomb
Oh cells and foam
Like separated bones
Have you been waiting for long?

Oh in between the evening and the morning light
Is how the days go by
And in between the evening and the morning light
Oh don't the stars look nice
In between the evening and the morning light
Is how the days go by
And in between the evening and the morning light
Oh don't the stars look nice

And oh, oh oh
Oh ain't it going well?
And oh, oh oh oh
But it's so hard to tell

It's like everything you never said
But always meant to say
It's like everything you never did
And did it anyway

But in between the morning and the evening light
It's how the days go by
In between the the morning and the evening light
Oh don't the stars look nice
