My heads all filled with memories
And yesterday is on her knees
I'm stuck inside the sleepy web
When I'm led into a deeper blue

There's cash stashed up in the hills
A flood of mud and dollar bills
I'm just looking for a piece of bread
When I'm led into a deeper blue

Melting under the brassy sun
Dusted and spangled all tangled and done
Melting under the brassy sun
Dusted and spangled all tangled and done

My heads all filled with memories
And tomorrow's dog is growling at me
I'm parked beside the murky ebb
When I'm led into a deeper blue
