Baby, baby since you've been gone I ain't doing so good
I don't get up, paint my face and go out like I should
Baby you turned a clear night sky into a dark, dark hole
And when I see a sunset now I'm just looking at a painting in a cheap motel

Baby I'm going on without you
Maybe I'm even gonna get through
But baby I'll tell you something that'll never be true
Baby, I'll get over you

Sometimes I feel that my only friend is a whisky glass
You know it don't stop the time but it helps it pass
That old sun coming in my room, well it hurts my eyes
I see people walking out on the day but I stay inside
I need to hide

Baby I'm going on without you
Maybe I'm even gonna get through
But baby I'll tell you something that'll never be true
Baby, I'll get over you

I'll get over you when the moon gets tired of chasing the sun
I'll get over you when all God's work on Earth is done
And on that day when I go to meet my maker's son
I'll need no one and I'll be over you

Baby I'm going on without you
Maybe I'm even gonna get through
But baby I'll tell you something that'll never be true
Baby, I'll get over you

Baby, I'll get over you
