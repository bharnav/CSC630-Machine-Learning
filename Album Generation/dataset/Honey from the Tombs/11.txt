Blablabla and everyone be quiet
The machine has come between me and my love
It's hopeful but doubtful for tomorrow
So pour me up another before bed

Lady love has only seen me crying
And the nights have forgotten who I am
But singing is always easy when you're drinking
So pour me up another before bed

If you would take and embrace me in your arms
I would stay and dedicate my heart
Watch you go when the day breaks
So pour me up another before bed
Pour me up another before bed
