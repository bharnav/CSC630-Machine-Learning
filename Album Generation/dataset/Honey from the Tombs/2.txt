Come along, Ruby
Where have you gone?
You've got eyes like the North Dakota sun
Got lips like an ocean and skin like the rain
Whole lot of whisky and wine and propane

Took me to Nashville to sing with the band
And then you left me in Tulsa sleepin' in the van
A dollar and a daisy is all that you left
Lock up my heart and forget about the rest
Lock up my heart, forget about the rest

A year and a day is all that its been
My Ruby's still singin' and I'm drinkin' gin
Lost all my money on the Saratoga track
Lost all my time hopin' you would come back
Lost all my time hopin' you would come back

Come along, Ruby
Where have you gone?
You've got eyes like the North Dakota sun
Got lips like an ocean and skin like the rain
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
