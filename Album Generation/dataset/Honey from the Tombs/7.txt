I feel as blue as the blue in your eyes
I feel as old as the old man telling lies
I feel as lucky as a horseshoe on the door
But I don't think I can take this world no more
No I don't think I can take it anymore

Ain't it hard to keep your eyes closed sometimes
Ain't it hard to turn away
Ain't it hard to feel the sunshine sometimes
It feels just like another rainy day

I feel more burdened as the bourbon starts to seep
Hoping it will help me get to sleep
I feel as lonesome as the woman in the moon
Hoping that you'll be beside me soon
I'm hoping that you'll lie next to me soon
