Your eyes are like burned-out headlights, a little thunder in the night
I'm losin' you
You're walking around like you live a graveyard, get you the one with the cards
I'm losin' you

I guess I'll go
And I'll lock the door behind me
What's it for
When you've only got time you gotta leave behind?

You nod and smile like a lying stranger when I ask if you're doing all right
I'm losin' you
And underneath the hungry silence, fear is eatin' through
I'm losin' you

I guess I'll go
And I'll lock the door behind me
What's it for
When you've only got time you gotta leave behind?

I'm not the kind to beat you from behind
I'm not the kind to tell you you've been blind
I'm not the kind to put up a fight

I guess I'll go
And I'll lock the door behind me
What's it for
When you've only got time you gotta leave behind?

Your eyes are like burned-out headlights
A little thunder in the night
I'm losin' you
I always thought you were the one
I guess I still do
But I'm losin' you
I'm losin' you
Your eyes are like burned-out headlights
A little thunder in the night
I'm losin' you
I always thought you were the one
I guess I still do
But I'm losin' you
I'm losin' you
