Skinny boy, all bones no lies
You're so miserable in the mornings
Will you will wait up for me?
It's sordid and I can't find my feet
And you've got lips I could spend a day with

Skinny boy, somewhere some prostitution
Some devour some doubt some dance
They're coming with swords through the backdoor
And there you are on the fence
With those lips I could spend a day with

When it's done, i'll drink champagne to the lonely
Lonely in me
Monday, tuesday so lonely
Wednesday, thursday only me
Friday, saturday only me
Here comes sundayâ€¦
