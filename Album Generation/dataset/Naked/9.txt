(feat. RaRa & Dame)

[Chorus]
[Ra Ra]
I like it
With your tight jeans on
I can see your thong
And you know it turns me on
[Dame]
I like it
When your pants hang low
When your tempo slow
You know it turns me on
[Ra Ra]
You love it
When I lick you low
Move fast and slow
And give it to you some more

[Dame] you love it

[Verse 1]
Mami youre hot like whoa
Body like whoa
Tongue ring up and down my shit like whoa
Your ass shake the room kaboom like whoa
I'm lovin' it how you like it from the back like whoa

Thong in your crack tatoo on your booty
We're gonna hit a club to get you in the moosee

[Verse 2]
Say ma what you doin why them jeans so low
And I figure they were comin down when you smelled my cologne
You lookin at me like youre ready to bone
I can lick you up and down while you rubbin this bone
Baby so wet i think she need a diaper
Been wanting to fuck since MH and Pied Piper
Anticipation gettin higher and higher
Lickin your nipples like two pacifiers

[Chorus]

With your tight jeans on
I can see your thong
And you know it turns me on

Come rock my (Come rock my world)
Fulfill my fantasy

You Got It (You got it girl)
Come rock my (Come rock my world)

[Verse 3 Dame]
I was scared shitless when I peeped this
You put that brand on the map jeans fittin ridiculus
Damn !!! so hood (so hood)
My niggas trickin I ain't budgin a fall back Its all good

You go home when you want to
Come when you want to
MH give em something they can crunk to
Intimidation never reached to my breadskin
Especially when them ben franks rapped in rubberbands
In the club im in the corner boy
Why you haters still broke on the corner boy
I can run rap when I'm on the track with Corey boy
Back on snap behind the base more the noise
When I 2-step you can't even join the boy
The moon goin up your girl makin all the noise
When the moon go down she still on the boy
Mona Lisa Mona Lisa on the boy

[Chorus]
[Dame]
I like it
With your tight jeans on
I can see your thong
And you know it turns me on
[Ra Ra]
I like it
When your pants hang low
When your tempo slow
You know it turns me on
[Dame]
You love it
When I lick you low
Move fast and slow
And give it to you some more
[Dame and Ra Ra]
You love it
Yea I love it
You love it
Yea I love it
