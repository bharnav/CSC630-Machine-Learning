I,I,I ... I wasn't ready [x4]

[Verse 1: Marques Houston]
Wen u talked about our future
U would nod ya head and smile
But I didn't understand it
I was living in denile
I couldn't see tha picture
But now I see it clearer
Cause I was so young
And now that I could get cha
I wanted ta be wit cha
What have I become

[Chorus]
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready (I,I .. I wasn't ready)

[Verse 2: Marques Houston]
Momma told me bout excuses
She'd say that there no use to say
Watchu would have done but did it
I had to learn the hard way
Now that its over
I wanted to jus hold u
But I kno I can't
I'm tryna be a soldier
I wanna do it over
Give me one more chance (I,I .. I wasn't ready)

[Chorus]
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready (I,I .. I wasn't ready)

[Hook: Marques Houston]
Can I get a re-do baby
Cause u no I need u baby
And now I'm ready for ur love, ur love
I jus wanna see u baby
Jus wanna smell and breathe u baby (your so beautiful mami)
Cause I hate what we've become (yeah)
I wasn't ready for ur love

[Rap: Rufus Blaq]
Yo I waited I contemplated and then I did it
There was room for relationship but pretty had to hit it
We like hand in glove, a head to a yankee fitted
Game is responsibily, its all how u spit it (betta yet live it)
Cause karma is a tru adventure
Sorta like a ninga or king and all his splender
Remember love can be as cold as decemeber
Unless its in its truest form I could neva end ya
Can break or make u, see my vision cuz I noe eventually
Ull see my vision by the way I'm livin (this is a given)
I'm given u my heart I'm givin u my soul I'm givin u my gold
I'm sorry for the dirt that I did
Sneakin broads in and out tha crib
Tha double life I lived
They say a fool sells dreams
But a man makes dreams come tru
Mami I changed all for the love of u

[Chorus x2: Marques Houston]
(I,I wasn't ready)
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasn't ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)
[CORNER BOYS]
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)
(I,I .. I wasn't ready)

[Outro: Marques Houston]
Wish it coulda worked back then, damn ...
