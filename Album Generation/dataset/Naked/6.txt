How do I say this?
Baby I'm sorry, but I cheated
And I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me
Check it out . . 

V 1

Babygirl, I know I used to do some mill shit to you
(Coming home late, jumping in the shower
To wash off the last chick's perfume)
Changing my drawers, stuff 'em down to
The bottom hamper
Taking numerous trips to Atlanta, Miami, Tampa
(Girl, I was doin' my thing)

Then I seen the pain in your brown eyes
Made me realize I . . .that I was breaking you down
What goes around, comes around
And girl when I lost it all
You never walked away
Baby, you stood your ground

Chorus

Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
Stay by my side, girl, I know I can change
Sometimes I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me
Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
What would I do without you

V 2

I know I had good girl
Beautiful inside and out
Its like I can't get enough
What I have for you is love
With them its only lust
(Telling you I'm in the studio
When I'm up in the telly freakin' em)
When I promised I'd take the weekend off

But yet and still you stayed
And I see your friends lookin' at me crazy
They don't want to see me with you
But I need you in my life
I don't want to pay the price
(Of losing you, its time for me to stop now)
Girl, I throw in the towel
Yea, yea, yea

Cause now I keep myself out of juice
So Ima do what I can to tell you the truth
Believe me baby, cause my best is all I can do
Oooh

Chorus

Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
Stay by my side, girl I know I can change
Sometimes I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me
Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
What would I do without you

Bridge

But the clubbin' and the drinkin' took over
And now its time to make it right
(So I know I will for you)
No more coming home late staggering
Yawning, going to sleep snoring girl
(I know there's nothing out there for me but you)
I keep slipping and slipping
I stop for a minute
Then I'm right back cheating on you
You you you . . 
Yea yea oohh

I'm sorry baby
Hey, hey, hey
What do you want me to do?
How can I make it up to you?
I don't want to cheat again
My heart is yours
No more cheating
But I can't say I won't do it again
But I'm man enough to admit that
I love you . . 

Chorus

Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
Stay by my side, girl I know I can change
Sometimes I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me
Girl, I know I cheated on you before
I can't say I won't do it again
What would I do without you
