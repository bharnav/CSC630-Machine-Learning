Spoken:
Marriage don't change
Nothing but your name
Unless it's real love
Throught the sunshine and the rain
For better or for worse
Girl this is not a game
See marriage dont change
Nothing but your name

1st Verse:
Girl I been try to make you understand
That I'm proud to be with you and I'm happy I'm your man
I know your moms and your pops wanna see you walk down that isle
Askin whats up, cause its been a while, bout seven years now

Bridge 1:
We've been together baby, but girl I'm still not ready
Take it easy dont push me away, dont wanna make a mistake
Wanna do things right, get my baby right
Wanna be 100%, its with you I wanna spend my life

Chorus:
Marriage don't change
Nothing but your name
Unless it's real love
Through the sunshine and the rain
For better or for worse
Girl this is not a game
See marriage don't change
Nothing but your name

Marriage don't change
Nothing but your name
Unless it's real love
Through the joy and through the pain
It's more than a ceremony
More than a wedding ring
A marriage won't change
Nothing but your name

2nd Verse:
Ever since you caught that bouquet, at your friends wedding day
I've been under pressure babe
Now you window shop for wedding gowns and wedding bands
Picking out your bride's mades and theme song for the reception

Bridge 2:
I know you you love me baby, but girl I'm still not ready
There's so many things, that you dont know about me
Even though we've been together for so long
We've got a long way to go, so girl lets take it slow

Chorus

Its not that I can't see myself in love with you
Girl I ain't going nowhere, let's take our time
This ain't something that you just jump into
And marriage dont change, no....

Chorus 2x
