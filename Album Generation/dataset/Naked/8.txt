V 1

You love her
She seemed . . 
Looks ain't everything to me
She took my heart from me
And every single part of me
Hee

Chorus

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do
Cause I was crying for the truth
I'm saying that girl was something else
I got caught up
My feelings I couldn't control
I trusted everything I had with her
That girl was something else

V 2

I made the wrong
(Decisions that I shouldn't have made)
She played me, betrayed me
Can't believe I fell for this girl ooh woo
Was supposed to be my girlfriend baby
But you lied to me babe, whoo
And now I realize that you ain't worth my time
You ain't worth it baby
So now I gotta let you go

Chorus

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do
Cause I was crying for the truth
I'm saying that girl was something else
I got caught up
My feelings I couldn't control
I trusted everything I had with her
That girl was something else

(Repeat v 2)

Was supposed to be my girlfriend baby
But you lied to me babe, whoo
And now I realize that you ain't worth my time
You ain't worth it baby
So now I gotta let you go

Chorus

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do
Cause I was crying for the truth
I'm saying that girl was something else
I got caught up
My feelings I couldn't control
I trusted everything I had with her
That girl was something else
