[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
White devils like it
I'm drinking coffee brought to me
By white devils' sidekicks
They askin' if we like to get higher
Like they hired him
The fire and brimstone is known
To be composed of desire never twice lived
The metal might miss, but the beveled edge
Of the mind can provide tricks
To bring the light to the likes of whites and black kids
As well, it's like magic, I'm not your average
Negro please, I know I'm an idiot
But I got a schtick and I'mma use it a little bit
I'm not too sure if I should clue in the little kids
Or if I'm too clueless to move with the bigger fish
Why it gotta be those two and not some other shit?
Take me to the mothership
Hate me I'm Abramovich
I'm Lady Gaga, I'm a fag, I'm a lesbian
See me playin' bass in jam bands up at Wesleyan
See me at a poetry slam in like '97
Singing classic numbers by Otis Redding
Totally shredding
Hoping you get it, yeah

[Chorus x2]
Relax relax relax relax
Relax relax relax relax
Relax relax relax relax
Relax relax relax relax
Yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no

[Verse 2: Heems]
What good is this Cashmere
If they're still dying in Kashmir?
Kashmir
There was homes, now there's just dust there
Next year, same as this year
A rough year
Live in much fear, stay inside after dusk here
Brush tears from eyelids
Peep violence
And these people is dyin'
I'm wildin'
Old Earth said they wanna move back
But they ain't got enough funds to do that
Back in 1980, from Delhi to Queens
She had a pocket full of lint, he had a suitcase full of dreams
From holdin' me to bagging groceries at the Pathmark
To scoldin' me for drinking and driving in fast cars
Juvenile shit
I ain't really tryin' to rap about
I don't remember from b-b-ba b-blackin' out
These days, I'm mostly focused on my bank account
I ain't backin' out until I own a bank to brag about
A local institution, life of the party
With him and at him, brown Chris Farley
Kalapani Kālidāsa, Vijay from Pyaasa
Wilds out at night, can't breathe through his nostrils
Papa need his medicine
Reticent to let them in
Hesitant bedouin
In elegant lettermens
And other fresh shit, to distract you

[Chorus]
