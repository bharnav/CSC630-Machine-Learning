Yeah! It's a celebration!
Ohmigod, ohmigod, please!

We can sell this, too, we can sell this to you!
Whatchu wanna do?
How do you do what you wanna do?
What can I tell you that you want to believe?
What have you got with your knowledge, see?
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but you don't hear me, no?
I know, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but you don't hear me at all

I know it's a celebration
C'mon everybody, yeah

We can give it away, don't mean what we say
We can joke, we can play, we can joke all day
What can I give you that you would actually need?
What do you wanna be that you could actually be?
And I know, and I know
And I know, and I know
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but you don't hear me at all
I know, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but you don't hear me at all
It's a celebration
But you don't hear me, y'all
C'mon y'all, it's a celebration

If you wanna be me, you can be me, really be me
Cat Stevens, you can look all day, but you still wouldn't see me
If you wanna be you, you can do that, too
And if you don't, then I don't really know what I can tell you

[Outro w/scatting]

You can ask what it do
Or can act like you knew
You can ask what it is
But I still wouldn't tell you
We can sell this to... oh, is it over? It's over!
