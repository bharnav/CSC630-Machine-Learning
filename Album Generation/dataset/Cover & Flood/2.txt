I saw entry lines round your face
They're new and show
Where someone took your place

Easy, watch your feet as they go
Cause your thoughts and your words
Won't help you down below

Don't scoff, I can't pretend
Easily Cause I'm blue, but I'm bold
And you never were my friend

Bring in the cavalry load up the guns
Cause my car can take it
And the mission carries slowly

Bring back the harbor
Build me a place for home
For friends, for fading

Pause a little while
Take me in to your house
All ink and water
