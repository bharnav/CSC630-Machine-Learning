Out of the boat on that day we went walking
We looked at the stars and we saw what the others could see
A hung light on the reeds

We crept up the old walls on our knees where they buried them
Captured the comets, flagged down the next ride we could see
Come on get in with me

Oh, see how the world can throw you
Oh, I'm not the ghost to haunt you
Little girls help to pave in the way
Your missing the feast we made under the clay

Crack it open a little more hold the light to the window
Eucrid is singing and I'm still a fool for the words that your bringing
A piper is playing and I am dancing over his body in blue

Oh, see how your bones can break you
My little angel creeping around to teach you
Not everything that your mother would say
Will bring you to the lord lest you lay down and pray

Crack and open
Crack and open
Crack and open

See how your bones can break you

See how your bones can break you
