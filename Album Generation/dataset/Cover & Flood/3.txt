Heavy lighting
Body of stone
What would I be?

Head in the bowl
Psych like Jung
Psychoanalyze me
I get inside

It's a case of my noise
It's these damn sharp knives
If I had two of our lives
I'd be plenty
Plenty of buckets of nothing

I get out of bed just to see what I look like
The hands at the ends of my arms don't relieve me
Someone somewhere getting me right out of here

Only a servant with blood on his fingers
Could make something odd just to see if it lingers
The hair on your head bleeds a smell like Johanna
I come clean

It's a case of my noise
It's these damn sharp knives
If I had two of our lives
I'd be plenty
Plenty of pockets of nothing
