First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out
Next they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out
AND THEN THEY CAME FOR ME

This is autonomy- My American Dream
Stepped over on the street - Stars and stripes blinding me
Their contagious air we breath - My American Dream
Classism the black plague - Will mark your grave

This is the second time, we will not fall in line
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus

A hooded prisoner on the bay - These truths let freedom ring
A child Darfur refugee - Home of the free and brave
The ghosts of war who will not sleep - These truths let freedom ring
The poor who drown in bigotry - Will mark your grave

This is the second time, yeah, it's the second time, we will not fall in line
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus

Fight forever more - The movement of the people
Fight forever more - The voice of the emigre
Fight forever more - The movement of the people
Fight forever more - No concession, no compromise

First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out
AND THEN THEY CAME FOR ME

No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus
This is the second time; we will not fall in line!
