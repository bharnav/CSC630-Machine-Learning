Woah oh Woah oh
Woah oh Woah oh

I woke up sweat soaked in the morning
I was mourning freedom buried deep
Mourning freedom buried deep
In tickers and broadcasts through power lines
Freedom buried in sound bites, buried in headlines

And we sing
Woah oh Woah oh
Woah oh Woah oh

A nation in fervor has given up
No, no, no, this fight has just begun
With movements and revolutions as few and far between
As movements and revolutions will ever come to be

This scare is blood soaked red - soaked red
Marked down the last words that you said, as we watched this city

Woah oh Woah oh
Watch it burn!
Woah oh Woah oh
Alright!

It's beaten in and beaten in
We're coming back around again
It's beaten in and beaten in
We're coming back around again

This scare is blood soaked red - soaked red
Marked down the last words that you said, as we watched this city

Fall and hit the ground
No one can ever replace what we've lost now
Fall and hit the ground
No one can ever replace what we've lost now, yeah!

We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh
We're coming back around
Woah oh Woah oh

We're coming back around
