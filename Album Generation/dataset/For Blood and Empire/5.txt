[Verse 1]
Seems every station on the TV
Is selling something no one can be
If every page was torn from the magazine
Would cash still drive the media machine?
The products, damage, and pursuit are endless
Identity can leave you selfless

[Chorus]
We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you, my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
For more

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are open but you can't see
Your mouth is moving but you don't speak
A blitzkrieg of images to break your will
I hope you choke on every pill

[Chorus]
We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you, my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
For more

[Bridge]
We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you, my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget...

[Chorus]
We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you, my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
For more
