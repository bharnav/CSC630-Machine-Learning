"Depleted Uranium is used on the ends of bullets
And on the ends of shells because it is so hard {that}
Almost any armament is vulnerable to something that is tipped with Depleted Uranium."

Woahhh!

In the cities and towns of Afghanistan
In the heart of the Balkans - the heart of Iraq
Not your Grandfather's style of deadly munitions
It's silent and deadly long after the mission

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

Gonna cut through their armor, then cut through your lungs
If you make it home alive you'll still die young
A greedy gang of liars, yeah we've seen it all before
A moneymaking scheme led by war-profiteering whores

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"They were throwing it away until they figured out they could use it for armament."

Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - You'll waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - You'll waste a...

We've heard their lies before and we know they're lying again
Feels like a déjà vu of Agent Orange and Vietnam
Weaponry so sadistic it is hard to comprehend
War profits surge with every breath by Uncle Sam

Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime

"We went to a hospital in Southern Iraq
And a woman was there with a very deformed child and
Her husband had been in the Iraqi Army and had been
In the battles in Southern Iraq and
Came home and they produced a baby with very severe
Malformations... Both the Leukemia rates in children and
Malformations at birth had increased by 600%
And it was clearly an epidemic where all this
DU had been dumped... It becomes a dust that can be
Inhaled and infect the blood stream and the rest
Of the body and it was the opinion of the
Doctors there that this was caused by depleted uranium...
They simply saw this as being a direct result of the
War by United States."

Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - We waste away

[U.S. Representative, Jim McDermott:]
"The doctor said
'Women {in Iraq} at the time of birth don't ask if
It's a boy or a girl, they ask: Is it normal?'
...The military denies first, and then after the evidence
Builds to the point where they can no longer deny
Then they do the research. That's what happened in the
Vietnam era around Agent Orange and I suspect and
I'm worried that that's what will happen this time."
