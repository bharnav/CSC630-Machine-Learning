[Verse 1]
Recruited by the NSA, my orders to talk smooth and straight
If heads of state try to say "No", I lovingly told them "Fuck you!"
The jackals lose when I cannot (get through)
There is a windfall of profit to (get to)
You better deal or we're gonna take you down

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
So dance with me

[Verse 2]
Arbenz, Mossadeq, Allende, Roldos, Torrijos, Aristide
Elected democratically, all snuffed out by the CIA
The truth will cause your heart to seize
Shed light on the true enemy

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire will make you move

[Bridge]
What have we done? (You don't know)
Until you care (You never will)
What have we done? (You don't know)
Until you care (You never will)
The crimes, the murder, unjust, unheard of
The crimes, the murder, what have we done?

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
And it goes on and on and on and it goes on and on it goes
The iron fist for blood and empire, will make you move
So dance with me
