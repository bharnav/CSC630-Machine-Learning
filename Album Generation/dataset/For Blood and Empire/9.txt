The Anarchists are buzzin' like bees around a hive
As protesters hit the streets with signs, signs, signs
The dissent of the world has filled us to the brim
But some will still cast their ballots
Based on those who live in sin

[Chorus]
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable to watch the system crumble
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
This political shakedown, coming correct from the underground
We've been cut up
We've been shut up
For far too long, yeah!

Pull the feeding tube out of the mouth of democracy
Televise it starving to death
Once buried in the ground
We can all breathe free
We can all breathe free

[Chorus]

(It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
(It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)

Policeman takes his club to a head (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
Just like he's beating the drum
The news reporters dance like hell (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
..To the sounds
[x2]
