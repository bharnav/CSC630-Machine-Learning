It's a gut check of what you believe

A Global Pax Americana
Neo-con, neo-fascist blue print - USA hegemony
Charlatan war hawks, untried, untrue
Celebrate and exploit tragedy
To steal away control

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?
Or never ending hate?

It's a think tank, psycho and crazed
War profiteering membership - a world catastrophe
They've got a war plan that counts on you
To kill for their corporate empire
While they sit at home

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?

Are you going to...Fight Back!
Time to prove what you really believe
We gotta FIGHT BACK!
Until we win or fall
We gotta FIGHT BACK!
Will you heed the call?
The Neo-Fascist race to war
The PNAC plan to rule the world

It's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?

Are you going to...

And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a New American Century?
Endless...
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?

Will you? Or never ending hate?
