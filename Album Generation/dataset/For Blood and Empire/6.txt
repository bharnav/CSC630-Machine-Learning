[Verse 1]
One trillion dollars could buy a lot of bling
One trillion dollars could buy most anything
One trillion dollars buying bullets, buying guns
One trillion dollars in the hands of killers, thugs

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh
Fuck the world
Kill 'em all

[Verse 2]
One trillion dollars to Africa, Iraq
One trillion dollars and itâ€™s never coming back
One trillion dollars could buy some bad-ass drugs
One trillion dollars makes me wanna kill myself

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh
Fuck the world
Kill 'em all

[Bridge]
Until the sun burns from the sky
Until the sun burns so bright this world is no more
Sunburns from the sky...
And all the people are just dust on the ground

[Verse 3]
One trillion dollars could buy a heart, a soul
One trillion dollars buying nations - all the world
One trillion dollars could make the fat lady sing
One trillion dollars, what a bullshit useless thing

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world, a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Shit loads of money spent will show us wrong from right
Fuck the world
Fuck 'em all
