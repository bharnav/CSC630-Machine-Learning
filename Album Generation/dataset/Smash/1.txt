I turn it on, I set the tone
And I know, I'm ready to go
I saw you looking up against the wall
And I knew, you were ready to go

Tonight I'm a different guy
Forget about the things you know
If you want to do it, we can do it right
I can see you coming home

'Cause I'm ready to go
Is that a yes or no?
'Cause I'm ready to go
Is that a yes or no?

'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so

Show me something
We're out of time
Show me, this is it
Don't change your mind

I turn it on, I set the tone
And I know, I'm ready to go
I saw you looking up against the wall
And I knew, you were ready to go

Tonight I'm a different guy
Forget about the things you know
If you want to do it, we can do it right
I can see you coming home

'Cause you're ready to go
Is that a yes or no?
'Cause you're ready to go
Is that a yes or no?

'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
'Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
