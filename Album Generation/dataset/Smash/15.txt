Last night, I partied a bit too hard
It's not quite coming back to me so far
I might not have slept, but I woke up a superstar
On another side of the world

Keep my head down
Stay away from the flash
The whole dancefloor is saying I've  gotta smash
And I don't mind
Cause it's all for the fans
And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

Chorus x2
S-T-A-R
That's what you are, cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan x2

Now you know I gotta run
Got a shark on my back
I got a 10 ton agent wanna hear my track
This is gonna work, yeah this is amazing
We could take it to the world with a perfect timing
If you don't know how, you could do it like David
He's so hot right now he's a pretty big deal
Call a manager in to come up with a plan
And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan
Big in Japan, big in Japan

Last night I partied a bit too hard
It's not quite coming back to me so far
I might not have slept but I woke up a superstar
On another side of the world

I'll keep my head down, stay away from the flash
The whole dancefloor is saying I've gotta smash
And I don't mind
Cause it's all for the fans
Because the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

Chorus x4

Big in Japan, big in Japan x2
Big in Japan, big in Japan x2
