I'm just trying to get away
This is what my sister said
I can just leave it to fate
Don't get any closer babe
There is nothing about us
I'm not adventurous
Should I go or should I stay
I'd rather get away

Got a plan to avoid the fight
I take you to the Baron if that's alright
Take a few steps and check the moves

And I'd rather get away from you, from you
I'd rather get away from you, from you
I just want to get away from you

I'm just trying to get away
Well this is what my shrink said
Let's have a chat and swim in boose
So that everyone acts and no one lose

I feel something about us
And you're not generous
But I look like yesterday
I'd rather get away

How do you call that, champagne with ice
We call this a piscine and that sounds right
I'm not that stubborn babe

I'd rather get away from you, from you
I'd rather get away from you, from you
I'd rather get away from you, from you, from you
I'd rather get away from you, from you, from you
I'd rather get away from you
