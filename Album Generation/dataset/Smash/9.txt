Did you say those words ?
Do you really mean it ?
We used to share the world
We used to share the sand pit
What should we do now ?
It's hard to let it go
Cause we're on the same side
No matter where the wind blows
And if we cross that line
Let me tell you something
Chorus
We were not meant to step over
That could be the story over
Somehow
Watch out
And remember what they say
That could be the end of laughter
That could be the story over
Let's not play games
Now that you said those words
Don't be sorry for it
I could have said those first
And you'd have blamed me for it
We would be just fine
If we let it go
Leave it frozen in time
We'll sort it out tomorrow
But if we cross that line
Let me tell you something
Chorus
