[Chorus: Dragonette]
I could stick around and get along with you
Hello, oh, oh, oh
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you
Hello, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Dragonette]
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you'll get from me, hey
Yeah, I think you're cute, but really you should know

[Chorus 2: Dragonette]
I just came to say hello
Hello, hello, hello, oh, oh, oh
I'm not the kinda girl to get messed up with you
Hello, oh, oh, oh
I'mma let you try to convince me to
Hello, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Dragonette]
Oh, it's alright, I'm getting dizzy, just enjoy the party
It's okay with me if you don't have that much to say, hey
Kinda like this game, but there's something you should know

[Chorus 3: Dragonette]
I just came to say hello
Hey, hey!

[Chorus: Dragonette]
I could stick around and get along with you
Hello, oh, oh, oh
Doesn't really mean that I'm into you
Hello, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Dragonette]
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to the party, hey
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to the party, hey
...

[Chorus 2: Dragonette]
I just came to say hello
Hello, hello, hello, oh, oh, oh
I'm not the kinda girl to get messed up with you
Hello, oh, oh, oh
I'mma let you try to convince me to
Hello, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Dragonette]
Oh, it's alright, I'm getting dizzy, just enjoy the party
It's okay with me if you don't have that much to say, hey
Kinda like this game, but there's something you should know

[Chorus 3: Dragonette]
I just came to say hello
Hey, hey!
