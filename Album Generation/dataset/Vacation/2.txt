[Intro]
Come into my life and jump into my bed
There'll be holding hands, there'll be faces red
You know it ain't fair, I've been working all week
Gotta rest these eyes, gotta get some sleep

[Verse 1]
You're into music and you're OK too
I just don't know what I'm meant to do about it
It's not fair why I'm left with you
And your holding hands, and your thank-yous

[Verse 2]
Tell me about your life and tell me about your band
Tell me about your band friends that you see around
I hear it ain't all chance, no it ain't potluck
I'm listening, yeah, but I just don't give a fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't say much 'cause the truth will hurt
But you can keep your mix tape and the t-shirt
Really gotta rest, gotta get some sleep
But you keep leaning in, you keep whispering

[Chorus]
But I, I ain't even here
I'm just bored, I don't know what to do with my love
Meeting on the street and meeting in the bar
Drinks all day, more drinks at the bar

[Verse 3]
Excuse me please while I duck out back
Need a break from you, you cool with that?
When I get back you're still sitting there
Playing with your phone and playing with your hair

[Bridge]
It's really tough, I've been working all week
Gotta get home soon, gotta get some sleep

[Chorus]
But I, I ain't even here
I'm just bored I don't know what to do with my love
Oh but I, I ain't even calling
I'm just bored, I don't know what to do with my time

[Verse 4]
Come into my life and climb into my bed
There'll be holding hands, there'll be faces red
I really only offered 'cause my place was close

[Outro]
I see you're drunk and me, almost
Won't say much 'cause the truth will hurt
But you can keep your mix tape and the t-shirt
Really gotta rest, gotta get some sleep
But you keep leaning in, you keep whispering
