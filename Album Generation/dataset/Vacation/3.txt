You did not get home until 3
Your clothes stained with paint I can see purple, purple
Leave them on your bedroom floor
Wait for a knock at the door. Excuse me, mister

Consumer, you really don't fit
Defacer, you clearly admit, don't you
Purple terror of the night sky
Friend of unsuspecting eyes. Aren't you

Six months in the big house, you're clear
Told them what they wanted to hear
Mr, can you spare me some food
A plate, a slice, a forkful will do

Whose stain the clothes they don't fit, the clothes they don't the clothes they don't fit
Whose stain the clothes they don't fit, the streets you will hit just don't write your name on it
