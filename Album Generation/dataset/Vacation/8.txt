Crossing town I'll take the train
I'll draw my eyes along the pavement
I would think you're like the river
Running fast and overflowing
You've been sleeping there for hours
It's the early afternoon
Pull your sheets between your thighs
Drop my eyes, daylight and falter
And you listen when she's speaking
Cos' you know how these lovers
Have a way with words
We are lovers in your kitchen
We are lovers in your hallway
Place a feather in your cauldron
I'll leave the book on your doorstep
And it's hardest when you're leaving
Cos' you always turn around
And she never dies
I'll drop by some other day now
I will seek you out in silence
Another book, another mystery
Some accounts of love and violence
And you listen when she's speaking
Cos' you know how, you know these lovers
Have a way with words
