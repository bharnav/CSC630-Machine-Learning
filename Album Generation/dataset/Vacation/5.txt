I sit and stare at my shoes
I sit and start at the wall
I watch the planes fly north overhead
I will say nothing at all
I'll sing a song of silence
I'll sing no song at all
And in this time of waking
And if the the lust lay breaking
Bad friends are looking for something new
Bad friends aren't looking for you
Oh will you open up your door
Let the strangers sleep upon your floor
Until we all fall down like water
Chaos at the alter
I am the ring in your ear
I am the dust in the window sill and..
My friends are all getting drunk somewhere without me

And in this kingdom of nothing
I am the king of everything
Bad friends keep looking for something new
Bad friends aren't looking for you
Oh will you open up your door
Let the strangers sleep upon your floor
Until we all fall down like water
Chaos at the alter
