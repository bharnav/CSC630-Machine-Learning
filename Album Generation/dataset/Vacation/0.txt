Take my hand, take the wheel
It's been twenty-four, it's too long I feel
I'm watching movies, reading books
Still can't figure out which wrong turn I took
But I know, I ain't no gladiator
But you know, do you know what's in my head?
What i do, it's makes no difference anyway
What i do, it's makes no difference anyway
I'm trading Franny's funny faces
I am hanging with the smash hits
Still growing up, growing up
Even though I stopped believing day six
I'm lacking girls, lacking money and these jerks
They make me feel funny
I can quote my favourite line
I can calculate the distance in time
But I know, I ain't no gladiator
But you know, do you know what's in my head?
What i do, it's makes no difference anyway
What i do
I can feel it slipping
I can, I can feel it slipping
I can. (times 10)
I ain't no gladiator!
Do you know whats in my head?
It makes no difference anyway
It makes no difference anyway!
