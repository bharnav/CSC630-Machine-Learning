Stay awake, this life's like a blink of the eye
Breathe in, i feel the weight as the words, they tumble down
Brace yourself, your life's about to change
How, you don't even know
Change is hard to deal with, when all i feel is how i miss you now
As you sit there, crying on the phone
It's funny how a goodbye is the only way to really say, 'i love you'
A love that's shared is a love that's spared from every inch of soil between us now
Places, a time when i don't know how
Oh, the simplicity, to piece together all i've been shown
But i don't know how it feels, to have every piece of me crying to go home
Oh the feeling when i wake, and the pleasure falling asleep next to you
And the weight of the crime, when we know that we do not know what to do
As you sit there, crying on the phone
As you sit there, wishing yourself home
