Rolling by I can't see why it's all about to change now
The winter rain has come again and I spent all day inside my warm sheets thinking of you
But someday I must face the cold, I'm just not ready now
'Cause I feel like I'm growing old too soon I don't know what I've done
And my greatest fear that someday from now I'll have to walk alone
