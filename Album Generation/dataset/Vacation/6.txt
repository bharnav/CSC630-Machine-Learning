Think you caught it
Think you got it
Think you lost what you had
Will never get back to you
Why this hurt inside my head?
Nothing can keep you
Throw it back instead
Why this pain inside my heart?
Nowhere to run
Let’s take it back to the start
It’s in my heart
It’s in my head
It’s in the shape of a false feeling
It’s in my heart
It’s in my head
Why this stain upon my thoughts?
I feel it hunting me in my dreams
