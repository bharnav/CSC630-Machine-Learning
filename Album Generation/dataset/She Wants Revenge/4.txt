[Verse 1]
Kissing a strange hand, my city like street lamps fade
On the edge of an answer you weigh lust beginnings are made
Lover, forgive me, my guilt is my only crime
And I'll carry it round 'til it breaks me down every time

[Chorus]
This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest, most depraved
Of joys

If you're afraid to say, but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love

[Verse 2]
From hunger you call, and it falls upon the ears of faith
A half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would take
Pretend all you want, you can cry to your heart's own beat
We will take love and swear upon the things that we just can't keep

[Chorus]
This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest, most depraved
Of joys

If you're afraid to say, but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest, most depraved
Of joys

If you're afraid to say, but you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth
My love
