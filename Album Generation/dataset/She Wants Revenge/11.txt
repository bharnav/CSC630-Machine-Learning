[Verse 1]
Felt too much, did she feel a thing?
Long, dark hair, never saw her cry
In two halves I was torn
My maybe love who wouldn't even try

[Chorus]
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

[Verse 2]
I saw you only yesterday
We shared a smile, then went our separate ways
Perhaps one day? Never mind
All the nights we shared, were we just killing time?

[Chorus]
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

[Bridge]
For all the things I said to her and all the ways I tried
And all the things I did for her, they're lost with one goodbye

She loves me, she love me not

[Chorus]
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

[Bridge]
For all the things I said to her and all the ways I tried
And all the things I did for her were lost with one goodbye

[Chorus]
She loves me, she love me not
She loves me, she loves me not
