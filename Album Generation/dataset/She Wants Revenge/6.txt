[Verse 1]
She smelled like 2am
Took him back to her place
Where all the saints adorn the walls
Delivering her from grace

He knew he should leave
That this could only turn cold
She was a bad, bad girl
So he told her so

[Verse 2]
Under the shadows of doubt
He had the whisper of lust
He said no touching tonight
She closed her eyes in his trust

She said, "Tuck me in"
He knew his judgment was sound
Still he pulled back the sheets

[Chorus 1]
And said, "You better lie down, 'cause the angels are watching"
She closed her eyes and said, "Quit the talking
You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

[Verse 3]
Her every word was in italics
As it would fall from her lips
The walls made of broken promises
He hoped this wouldn't be his

She said, "Tell me what to do"
He knew right then he was done
Feeling lonely and confused

[Chorus 2]
He said, "You better lie down, 'cause the angels are watching"
She closed her eyes and said, "Quit the talking
You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

So he said, "Shut your mouth, girl, the angels are listening"
She crossed herself, now, the moments are missing
"You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

[Verse 4]
Glancing through the curtains
Questions on her tongue
She spoke in third person
And he had seen every one

Awkward and embittered
Said shut the door when you go
Perhaps he should have reconsidered (oh, no)

[Chorus 2]
When he said, "You better lie down, 'cause the angels are watching"
She closed her eyes and said, "Quit the talking
You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

So he said, "Shut your mouth, girl, the angels are listening"
She crossed herself, now, the moments are missing
"You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
"You better lie down, 'cause the angels are watching"
She closed her eyes and said, "Quit the talking
You can hurt me, do whatever you like"

So he said, "Shut your mouth, girl, the angels are listening"
She crossed herself, now, the moments are missing
"You can hurt me, do whatever you like"
