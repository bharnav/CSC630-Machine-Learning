[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sick of trying to find a way inside
Sick and tired of all the after
Sick of trying to find a way to slide
Even though it always ends in laughter
It's never hard to tell when things are done
She looked into my eyes, and a voice said "RUN"
She says that I'm a mess, but it's alright
Whether it's two weeks, two years, or just tonight

[Chorus]
You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high

[Verse 2]
I can find a reason that we should quit
I can find a reason to do it
I can find excuses for all my shit
She tells me just to work right through it
She's pretty, and I like her, but she's too well
Cause I need red flags and long nights, and she can tell
It's not that it's my fault, it's just my style
Beginning with a look and then a smile

[Chorus]
You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high
You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high

[Bridge]
She don't need a thing, she don't need saving or a lay
She's got all her friends around, and you can hear them say
He's not into you, he's into the idea of
But little do they know that she's not through

[Chorus]
You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high
You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high
