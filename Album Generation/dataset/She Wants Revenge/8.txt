[Verse 1]
Late last night I was looking through pictures
Flooded with memories, I lied on the floor
And spread them around me like friends at a party
Their faces remind me of all that I've known

[Chorus]
Still, I can't forget all the hushed who and whys
All the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I, hand in hand
As we look at this thing called us

[Verse 2]
Late last night I was pacing the hallway
Reading the letters you'd signed x and o
I turned out the lights and imagined you with me
I tried my hardest to cry, but it just wouldn't come

[Chorus x2]
Still, I can't forget all the hushed who and whys
All the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I, hand in hand
As we look at this thing called us
All the hushed who and whys
All the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I, hand in hand
As we look at this thing called trust

Still, I can't forget all the hushed who and whys
All the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I, hand in hand
As we look at this thing called us
All the hushed who and whys
All the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughs
Take a walk through the past, you and I, hand in hand
As we look at this thing called trust
