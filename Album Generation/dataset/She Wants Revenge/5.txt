[Verse 1]
Pay attention, my love, 'cause it's over
At the tip of my tongue is the price you weren't willing to pay
Still, this is something akin to a breakdown
And your impression of a woman supposed to be easy to see

[Chorus]
That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

[Verse 2]
When you look back now was it special?
Or was it nothing but an anecdote that you can tell now and then?
And I delude myself, it was worth it
Mm, even though from the beginning I could see exactly how it would end

[Chorus x2]
That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

Torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

[Bridge]
I wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, I wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away, I wanna kiss you away

[Chorus]
Torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying, and drawn out fights
Make up sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts
