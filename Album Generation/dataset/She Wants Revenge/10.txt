[Verse 1: Justin Warfield]
Got a big plan, this mindset
Maybe it's right
At the right place and right time
Maybe tonight
In the whisper or handshake
Sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard
Wait never mind

Late night and passing
Mentioned it flipped
To her best friend, it's nothing
Maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror
And a crush to like
Then she walked in, he froze up
Believe it's the fright

It's cute in a way
Till you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette
And knees get weak
Escape was just a nod and a casual wave
Obsess about it
Heavy for the next two days

It's only just a crush
It'll go away
It's just like all the others
It'll go away
Or maybe this is danger
And he just don't know
You pray it all away
But it continues to grow

[Chorus: Justin Warfield]
I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

[Verse 2: Justin Warfield]
Then he walked up and told her
Thinking maybe it'd passed
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his
She left it there
Told him how she felt
And then they locked in a stare
They took a step back
Thought about it
What should they do
Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met
And reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last
Either way he wanted her
And this was bad
Wanted to do things to her
It was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart
