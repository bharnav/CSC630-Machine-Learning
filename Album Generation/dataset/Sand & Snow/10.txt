I think you made the right choice
I didn't think you'd run away
The thousand miles between us became a race
I meet you on the further shore
I know I've said this before
Don't you know that I want more for you
And all the things that we could do?

I'm taking back today, I didn't mean to give it away
The thousand miles between us became a race
I'm taking back today, I didn't think you'd run away
The thousand miles between us became a race

Did we make the right move?
I only want the world for you
So many things we may have to let go
Are you fearful to compromise?
We're running for the race of our lives
Don't you know that I want more for you
And all the things that we could do?
There's no more time for wasting cos I...

I'm taking back today, I didn't mean to give it away
The thousand miles between us became a race
I'm taking back today, I didn't think you'd run away
The thousand miles between us became a race

And every step's another mistake
To take me further from your point of view
And every step's another distant space
To lose my wicked soul so far from you

Til you're home again
Til we're whole again...

I'm taking back today, I didn't mean to give it away
The thousand miles between us became a race
I'm taking back today, I didn't think you'd run away
The thousand miles between us became a race...
