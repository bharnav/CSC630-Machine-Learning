I won't be your cuckoo my love
Nor a thief on the way
A shameful regret
Or a promise on a string
And I will follow your heart
Until you let me in
I'll never be your cuckoo my love
I'll be a lesson learned instead

Ooohhhhhh oh oh ooohhhhhhh oh oh ooohhhhhh

Don't be a cuckoo my love
If you ever want to know
The beat of your heart
Or the depth of your soul
And now I cut out my life
With the courage that you showed me
To never be a cuckoo my love
But I will take this wish and bury it in the snow

Ooohhhhhhhh oh oh oooohhhhhhhhhh oh oh oooooohhhhhhh

The river you didn't cross
Grows deeper everyday
And for the rest of my life
Are you the one that got away
For we grow old
Would you show me the depth of your soul
And no we clip your wings
And we will build a home with the courage you have shown

Oooohhhhhhh oh oh ooooohhhhhhhh oh oh ooooooohhhhhhh

So put down your bow and arrow
Because time is on our side
I will be here in the morning
If there are violins tonight
This is the calm before the storm
Through the silence in your eyes
I'll never be a cuckoo my love
Oh I will take this wish and bury it in the snow (Cuckoo my love)
I will build a home with the courage you have shown (Cuckoo my love)
And I will take this wish and bury it in the snow (Cuckoo my love)
And if you cross this river
I'm yours and yours alone
