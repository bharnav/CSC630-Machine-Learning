Tell me when to let go
I'll swing this wrecking ball
There's trouble in the basement
I can hear it through the floor

Stay up in the attic
And dare not make a sound
Is any more sadness
Might bring this whole house down

Love takes a wrecking ball
Will it take a wrecking ball tonight?
Will it take a wrecking ball
To open your eyes?
Love takes a wrecking ball
Will it take a wrecking ball tonight?

How can you stay hear?
You'll disappear in smoke
I've given you a warning
I'm letting go the rope

Come out of the basement
And let me share your load
I am your reflection
I do not see the joke

Love takes a wrecking ball
Will it take a wrecking ball tonight?
Will it take a wrecking ball
To open your eyes?
Love takes a wrecking ball
Will it take a wrecking ball tonight?

If we tear love down
We'll be swinging on forever
If we tear love down
We'll be swinging on forever

Love takes a wrecking ball
Takes a wrecking ball tonight
Will it take a wrecking ball
To open your eyes?

Love takes a wrecking ball
Takes a wrecking ball tonight...
