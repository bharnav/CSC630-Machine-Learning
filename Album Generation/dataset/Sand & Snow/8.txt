Queen of, queen of her sad land
Shiver, shiver through winter
Kneeling, kneeling before her
Finger, fingering onward

Ocean, ocean currents
Frozen, frozen border
Softly, softly she's spoken
Send me, send me homeward

Queen of a sad land...

Filter, filter in orange
Shrouding, shrouding the autumn
Heaven, heavenly violence
Breathe in, breathe in the forest

Ocean, ocean currents
Frozen, frozen border
Softly, softly she's spoken
Send me, send me homeward

Queen of a sad land...

Ocean, ocean currents
Frozen, frozen border
Softly, softly she's spoken
Send me, send me homeward
