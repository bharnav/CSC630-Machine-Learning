A scholar's wind in a boxing ring
Went floating by on a hummingbird wing
Wide enough to guide you in
With a sun in rise, we started shivering

And anyway we know how
We're gonna get our bellies full
Living on a fault line
Are we reaching our potential?

Animals in cages
Actors on a payroll
And maybe in our lifetime
Are we reaching our potential?

When you reach your potential
We reach our potential
We'll be laughing with out bellies full
Ooohhhh

Anyway we know how
We're gonna get our bellies full
While living on a fault line
Are reaching our potential?

Animals in cages
Actors on a payroll
Maybe in our lifetime
Are we reaching our potential?

With tires on a soapbox
With orders for the front line
We're fighting for our children
Are we reaching our potential?

Runners in a rainstorm
To try to cross enemy lines
I love you, do you love me?
But are we reaching our potential?

When you reach your potential
We reach our potential
We'll be laughing with our bellies full

When you reach your potential
We reach our potential
We'll be laughing with our bellies, full
Oooohhhhh
