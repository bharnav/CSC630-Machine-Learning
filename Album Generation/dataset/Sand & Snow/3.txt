Do you remember what you wanted to be?
Do you remember how you use to feel?
Now you're pushed and shoved and made to fit the mould
Like a rounded peg, you're forced in a square hole

Run away now, Anastasia
And don't regret a thing
Run away now, Anastasia
You won't regret a thing

We use to talk about the consequences of love
And you use to move without surrender between the creaky bows
Where innocence is swept into the cold
You're a rounded peg but you're forced in square hole

Run away now, Anastasia
And don't regret a thing
Run away now, Anastasia
You won't regret a thing

Ask yourself, is this what you wanted?
Ask yourself, is this what you want?
Leave it all and go...
