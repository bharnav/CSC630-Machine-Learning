Cigarette smoke crawls up in the sycamore
Stone dust, beach shells breaking in the water
Needles and pins in the cold, cold glow
Drifting on cliffs with the rising snow
And I hope it settles soon
Rusty blue eyes be my husky at dawn
Sunset, sunrise show in the ice storm
Dancing in the streets 'til the butterfly byes
Laying on our backs under northern lights
And I hope it settles soon
A snow found romance will always repeat

A snow bound heartache will never recieve
Ooo-ooo-oooh oooh-oooh-oooh
Angel choirs with the rustle of stars
Constellations straight across the universe
Stepping in time with the beat of a drum
Singing out loud to another man's song
And I hope it settles soon
A snow found romance will always repeat
A snow bound heartache will never recieve
Ooo-oo-ooh oooh-oooh-oooh
Ahh-ahhh-ooooh oooh-oooh-ooooh
