[Verse 1]
You and I know I had to leave
Under the harbour lights, I could not see
But you were my rock never my stepping stone
I held my tongue, I turned on my heels
I couldn't look back, I want you to know
That you were my rock never my stepping stone

[Chorus]
You were never a stepping stone

[Verse 2]
We both know I cannot come home
The water rose faster than I could run
All my load has bruised my grieving bones
Forgive my sins for I haven't found God
And I don't know when I can trust my heart
But you were my rock never my stepping stone

[Chorus]
You were never a stepping stone
You were never a stepping stone

[Bridge]
She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"
She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"
She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"

[Chorus]
You were never my stepping stone
You were never my stepping stone
