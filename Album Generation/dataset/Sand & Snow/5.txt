The devil puts words in my mouth when we're close
You're like the snow in spring, ever receding
And if you know what I'm talking about
Let me feel your heartbeat, let me feel your heartbeat beat

When it's closing time and the night is young, do you need a friend to help you on?
You can lean on me and I'll carry our bones home
As the stars explode in the sky above and the pieces fall back down to earth
If you lean on me then I'll let you feel my heartbeat beat, let you feel my heartbeat beat

The heart is deceitful above all things
So desperately wicked, who can really know it? Are you listening?
And if you know what I'm talking about
Let me feel your heartbeat, let me feel your heartbeat beat

When it's closing time and the night is young, do you need a friend to help you on?
You can lean on me and I'll carry our bones home
As the stars explode in the sky above and the pieces fall back down to earth
If you lean on me then I'll let you feel my heartbeat beat, let you feel my heartbeat beat

When the time is right, the moon is full and we're drawing out the curtain call
Lean on me and I'll let you feel my heartbeat beat
Let you feel my heartbeat beat
Let them feel your heartbeat beat...
