[Chorus]
I am a steady rolling man
And I roll both night and day
I am a steady rolling man
And I roll both night and day
But I've got no sweet woman
Woo-hoo Lord, to be rolling this way

[Verse]
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
Why can't you hear me begging mama?
Woo-hoo Lord, down on my bent knee?

[Chorus]
