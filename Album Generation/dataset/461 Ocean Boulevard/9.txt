[Verse]
My heart was leaping in the sun
My friends all say that you're the one
Let me get this one thing very clear
There ain't enough going on down here

[Pre-Chorus]
Mainline Florida, oh say
Mainline Florida, OK

[Chorus]
Her arms were open, open wide
Her invitation's a changing tide
I could remember not long ago
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
