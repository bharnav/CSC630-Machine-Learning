I look around and I can't speak
I am in silence, and my world is hollow
Pretending to be living there
And maybe there was something between us
I cannot see beyond your face
What I am searching for is someones shadow
And in the forrest of the night
Am i unwise to let the story end

I would not hurt you
I would could never
Your dark became my night
I would not walk one step without you ever
I would not be alive today
Without your love
Along the way

You try one dive
You pull out
You should understand
Your shooting from the heart when your dreaming

For one moment there is someone loving me
And no-one else can change that place and time
You go through the motion
But all your emotion is gone

You made me yours, I made you mine
And if i make this promise i deliver
Beneath it all I know
That looking back I lived on your laughter
And there were diamonds in the dust
And there were moments we could never follow
And in the morning rain
I always told you at the closing of the day

I will not leave you
I would never
Your dark becomes my light
I will not take one step without you ever
I would not be alive today
Without your love...Without your love
Along the way
