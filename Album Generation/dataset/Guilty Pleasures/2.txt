I saw you looking in the mirror
I saw you fighting with your conscious
I think you need a little time away and i may give you mine
And you can fine me in the moon glow
You find me underneath your pillow
And we can find a little hideaway where we can go

I'm in the corner with a friend of mine
I stood with my defences down
So many things that bring you close to me
That we be led astray
The wonder of desire
To love the things we cannot touch

Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away
And then the story can go on without a single tear
You take a chance on it and change the history
And for a time we fall in love with someone
So who am i to say the words that say we've found each other
Can we imagine any hideaway is right
And our adventure down in paradise
Born upon the wind
And we are one with the night

Maybe we shuffle of to Rio
A little Riodegenero
And then i get a little chance to say
I'm falling into you

And you and i can change the world if we just try
This lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light
To make the sense of it
And solve the mystery
Its just a love you forever leave with someone
So who am i to say the words that say we've found each other
Can we imagine any hideaway is right
And our adventure down in paradise
Born upon the wind
And we are one with the night

And our adventure down in paradise
Born upon the wind
And we are one with the night
Mmmmmmmmm
