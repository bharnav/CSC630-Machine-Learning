[Barbra:]
Are you ready for the day
That we've prayed for
Already holding what is real
You know the soul finds its own evolution
And this is the only love I feel
Can I tell ya
I'm keeping up the strength
I've gotta try
'Cause you ain't getting past this heart of mine
I'm out here waiting for you
With all I've got to give
And I accept this life we live

[Both:]
I'll be your lover
And I'll be your friend
I'm gonna follow you
Right to the end

[Barbra:]
I wasn't made to tell you lies
I only came to make you realize

[Both:]
I'll be your hero
And I'll be your plan
You pick me up
And let me down

[Barbra:]
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait
'Cause come tomorrow will be to late

[Both:]
Come tomorrow
Come tomorrow

[Barry:]
I got to turn away my face
'Cause you blind me with your light
Can you catch up to me
You know I love you in the black of night
This sacred bridge you walk
This journey has begun
We try, we try to carry on
Are you listening
You get to find the things in life
That get you through

[Barbra:]
One more day...

[Barry:]
And deep inside the things you want love never knew

[Barbra:]
One less chance...

[Barry:]
Let me make it happen
This world we have foreseen

[Barbra:]
Hmmm...

[Barry:]
And I will tell you how I feel

[Both:]
Love will be better for wearing your ring
I'm gonna give you everything

[Barry:]
I wasn't made to tell you lies
I only came to make you realize

[Both:]
I'll be your hero
And I'll be your plan
You pick me up
You let me down

[Barry:]
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait

[Both:]
'Cause come tomorrow will be to late

Come tomorrow...
Come tomorrow...
Come tomorrow...
Oh! Come tomorrow...
Come tomorrow...
Come tomorrow...
Come tomorrow...
