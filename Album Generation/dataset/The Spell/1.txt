"Captured by you and slowly pulled into your web
The venom was smooth,so I didn't mind a thing
As I moved the strings were held there by you
Something then told me that I had no escape

So,please forgive me for this spell I am under

As the years passed by,I tried to work out the clues
To break this curse that was cast down and held by you
And in this maze at every turn you stood in my way
So I left a disguise in my place

So,please forgive me for this spell I am under

I lose myself in this spell I am under
I feel your spell on me...

We're held by your gaze,lost in a state
A potion of delusion,something is brewing
The poison is blinding
The streets are all winding
The clocks lose their timing
Your spell on me has no cure

So,please forgive me for this spell I am under

I lose myself in this spell I am under
I feel your spell on me...."
