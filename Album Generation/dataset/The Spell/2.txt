Days peel off and pass away

Like souvenirs from a distant place

Postcards from your memories

Just like an old love line

Or dividing wall that fell

This'll never be forgotten

These are not just words

Do you remember

The things we said?

Do you remember

The things we said?

The smoke and script changed through the years

The stories blend and lies were fed

I know some things can't be explained

Just like an old scar

Or this thorn in my side

This'll never be forgotten

These are not just words

Do you remember

The things we said?

Do you remember

The things we said?

I'll try to remember

The things we said

I'll try to remember

The things we said

Of all these things we have forgotten

There are no "just words"
