Every day goes by and every night the same
I sit and think of how I'm so much
Further away from you
Every time I wake, I'll slowly mark the day

'Cause this life has taken me so much
Further away from you
Every sunset and every time it rains
Every walk I take I'll count the steps

Further away from you
If I should fall in love again, I will know that
I'm only that much further from you
You'll fall in love again someday, I know

You'll see the light and I'll be away
