I carried this letter
All through the winter
In fear of what it might say
I know the reasons
They change so fast
And we can never make it back

In the letter that you wrote
I heard the words that you never spoke
It is time for you to come home

So, I travelled the seas
To return for you
But I did not make it through

And I know it's not easy
Things can be so wrong
As we are lost in the waves

And in the letter that I wrote
Were the words I never spoke
This is why I can't come home
And in the letter that I wrote
Were the words I never spoke
This is why I can't come home

And in the letter that you wrote
Was it a letter as a friend?
This is what i must know
And in the letter that you wrote
Was it a letter as a friend?
This is what I must know
