There is a place where I stay near the sea
Always alive she said in me you'll be

Drawn into your web
I'm tangled in your web

Hiding in the smoke and trees we live
All these lives give me strength she said

Drawn into your web
I'm tangled in your web

Trapped in your web I'll always be
Wrapped around your heart like thorns you sting
Tangled in my heart you will stay
