In a cabin out where it's cold
There's a waiter serving time
He remembers she said
"I'll be there yes I'll be there
Someday when the snow thaws"
So he stands watching the snow fall
In his hand a clock on a platter
He remembers she said
"I'll be there yes I'll be there
Every night your eyes dream"
"dream dream my lonely one"
