Every moment in every second
Every day that Iâ€™m awake
Every chance that I get
I am frozen in regret
Every day shows signs of rust
And I watch the sky turn gray

I am frozen

Every moment in every second
Every step that I take
I am frozen by these things
I find another way to burn my soul again
And I watch the days go by

I am frozen every time I return to burn
Every time I return to burn
