Am I alive or am I dead
Am I awake or in a dream
Am I with you or am I all alone
Do I have skin do I have bones
Do I reveal or show no more
Should I place a bet or end this game
If I dream or if I stay awake
This fear this fright it haunts me either way
It follows me down to the end of the world'
Am I too weak do I have the strength
Do I have needs am I ok
Am I sick am I well
Am I on the ground or in the clouds
Am I here or a world away
Am I cold or should I burn in flames
