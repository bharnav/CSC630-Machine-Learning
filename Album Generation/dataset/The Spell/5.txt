All our fears are fed
All our thoughts are read
All things divide and they bend into you
All things collide again

All our crimes revealed
All our dreams are killed
All the controls are dead
All things divide and bend into you
All things collide again
All things divide and bend
All things collide in the end

All the things you fight
Are all the reasons to rise
Would you believe when I say
All these things hang by a thread
Would you believe when I say
All these things hang by a thread
