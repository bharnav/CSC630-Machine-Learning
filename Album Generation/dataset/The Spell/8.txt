Every night it's the same
I wait for you
Daylight takes you away
Night time brings you back
It's been so long
The days last so long
When I wake
The light seeps in and i know i have no defense
Something took you away but the night time will bring you back
It's been so long
The days last so long
In the night i wait for you to bring me back
In the night i wait for you and bring you back
When i can bring you back
