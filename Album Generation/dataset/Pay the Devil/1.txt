I've been up and and down the highway
And i've seen what a man can do
To some little girl along the byway
That's why i sing this song to you

If you find your baby's gone
And you don't know where or when
You wonder, yes you wonder
If you'll ever see him again
Just remember, remember
These simple words i brought

Soon it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much as you thought

'cause i been up and down the highway
And i watch them as they pass by
Broken hearts and i wish that they'd go my way
I'd save them every little teardrop they cry

Won't you listen?
If you think you can't go on
And life ain't got it for you no more
You're waitin' every night
For him to come walkin' through that door

Just remember, remember
These simple words that i brought
Soon it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much as you thought

Well, it won't hurt half as much
No, it won't hurt half as much
Lord, it won't hurt half as much as you though
Fades
And everytime you're sad, you cry
You feel like you...
