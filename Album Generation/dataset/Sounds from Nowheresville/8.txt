[Verse 1]
I can't get today
Tell your five friends I'm ready for you
Keep our love distant
Gettin' all back, I paid attention
Learn your ABCs
You tell me some lies much better than
You keep our love, it's too hard
Hold yourself back the way I'm going

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me your hands and I will shake you to the floor
You give me a piece and I will hit them out' the park
You give me your keys and I will take them for a walk
You give me your ears and I will blow 'em until they're blown

[Chorus]
God help ya
Wait until you get home
God help ya
Wait until you can get home

[Verse 2]
I can't get today
Tell your five friends I'm ready for you
Keep our love distant
Gettin' all back, I paid attention
Learn your ABCs
You tell me some lies much better than
You keep our love, it's too hard
Hold yourself back the way I'm going

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me your hands and I will shake you to the floor
You give me a piece and I will hit them out' the park
You give me your keys and I will take them for a walk
You give me your ears and I will blow 'em until they're blown

[Chorus]
God help ya
Wait until you get home
God help ya
Wait until you can get home
Wait until you can get home

[Outro]
Forgot I was a daughter, forgot I was a daughter
Forgot I was a daughter, forgot I was a daughter
