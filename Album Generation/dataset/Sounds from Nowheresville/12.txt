Say were gonna leave this
100 miles an hour
We could if we could just stay
But I don't know how

Say were gonna jump ship
100 time a day
I only got to know you
And we're on our way

Say were gonna leave this
There's a fool on the road
But say what we've been missing
Before we have to go

This could have been perfection
If we had a been since
But we have to do this
And so we started art again

So give it back
Give it back
Gimme back my high five
High five gimme back my boots
Gimme back
Gimme back my life
Life gimme back my boots
Give it back
Gimme back
Gimme back my name
Name give it like you should
Give it back
Gimme back
Gimme back it all
All I'll kill you if I could
Hey!

Say we gonna get here
You made my life mysery
But when I went to count the paper
You weren't I threw up in the sea

But specialty a copy
Because you dirty and as I'm I
I should've taken off my glasses
And see the way that you life

So give it back
Give it back
Gimme back my high five
High five gimme back my boots
Gimme back
Gimme back my life
Life gimme back my boots
Give it back
Gimme back
Gimme back my name
Name give it like you should
Give it back
Gimme back
Gimme back it all
All I'll kill you if I could
Hey! Hey you
Hey| Hey you
