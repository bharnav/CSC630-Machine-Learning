An old man gave me a tip, he said
"Don't waste your time with politics", he said
"Just chase skirts instead
And "Life is too short, and you're almost dead", he said
"I met a woman once, gave her my best shot
But never did I talk, and talk and talk
If I had her back, I'd be real as my age
I so don't blame them, I wouldn't do the same
But I can blame them
I'd sing her this”

[Chorus]
And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling, dear, get a grip

And I think what I just wrote is going over my head
I'm stealing lines from myself
And what I said was never said
It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind

[Chorus]

You're moving but not aware
You're drowsy without a care
Except keeping your whites behind your lids
And your lids are your best canvas
I can only imagine what you're painting
What you're painting
And your body on my mattress is proof
And your makeup on my pillow is proof
But do you think I’m telling you the truth?
It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind

[Chorus] x2
