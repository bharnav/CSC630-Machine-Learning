You have a jump in your step
But a rip in your, a rip in your rep
And everybody knows it
So be sure to be proud
And don't forget you aren't allowed to brag

[Pre-Chorus]
I just gave myself the shivers
And that's what you get when you think about her
And I just gave myself the shivers
And that's what you get, that's what you get

[Chorus]
With that fa√ßade you can do no wrong
Many will enter but few will win
So please, be sure to read the fine print

I spend more time in front of mirrors
Than any gent should because, let's face it
One on one is more fun anyway
And everybody knows it
But I'm not so proud
And I'll never be the one to brag
To brag about how

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] x2

The arch in your eyebrows can tell the truth
Just imagine what your back can do
And the dance floor where I do my best
Is your, your mattress

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] x2
