Swoon this is the same old blood rush with a new touch
I am safe, quaint and eloquent
But my bottom lip along with the top one, too
Is chapped and it's all thanks to you

We all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss
But it never came
And we all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss
It was but a game

[Chorus] x2
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone

You trained these lips when they were champs
And now they're itchin' for a comeback
So come back
It's a shame that your claim to fame
Hangs on someone else's name
So come back
Such a task and this is such a blast
And such a task
And such a task and this is such a blast
And all that jazz

[Chorus]

You have a dangerous face and illegal taste
And that strap is fallen off that shoulder blade
Be patient, behave

You trained these lips when they were champs
And now they're itchin' for a comeback

[Chorus]
