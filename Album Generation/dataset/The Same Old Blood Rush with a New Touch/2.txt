Eyeliner and a famous designer brand
Your mind is a moment to be stamped
Expressed tried and true
Just look, look at you
Pretty and perfect due to your steady hand
Apply that lip gloss like it’s your job
You know you’re his heartthrob

[Chorus]
You wanna know what you got?
I’ve got a plan we can’t get caught
There’s no chance in hell we’ll stop
No, no, no, no, no, I think not

Pinching with a moment so tight
Undone and looking just right
No, not tonight
No, not tonight
A smeared kiss
A moment missed
Are you upset with it?

[Chorus]
You wanna know what you got?
I’ve got a plan we can’t get caught
There’s no chance in hell we’ll stop
No, no, no, no, no, I think not

Body language is something that you learn
And you just can't get taught, we'll never get caught
Body language is something that you feel
It's just too real to be concealed
[Chorus]
You wanna know what you got?
I’ve got a plan we can’t get caught
There’s no chance in hell we’ll stop
No, no, no, no, no, I think not

You wanna know
You wanna know
When you find out what you really got with that information that I gave you
You wanna know
You wanna know
You, you, you, you, you, you
But I’m not telling
