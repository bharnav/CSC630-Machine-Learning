[Verse]
This is a seasonal affair
So be there or be square
And the invitation said so
So just let that ego go

And watch it strike back like a boomerang
Scared stiff and not sure how to deal with it
You're a legend in this room
Only on this room
Oh, goodness me
Oh, goodness, my mind has slipped
And wiped you away from it
Same shit, different day
Same shit
Same shit, different day
Now let’s, let’s backtrack and back it up
We have a whole lot to prove
You hike your skirt
And pull your shirt down
To give those gents what they crave
Because as you say
You love to save, to save
Now let’s, let’s backtrack and back it up
We have a whole lot to prove

[Chorus]
Let the sweat drop
Come collected and cunning
Watch those jaws drop
The sweat is still running

Some have labeled me so savvy
And I'll admit I agree to disagree
Do your knees go weak when I simply speak?
And did you, did you hear that I’m so charming?
Oh, yeah, and I bow and I bow
But I'm not sure I can bare it
Same shit, different day
Same shit
Same shit, different day
Now let’s, let’s backtrack and back it up
We have a whole lot to prove

[Chorus] x2

[Verse]

[Chorus] x2
