[Verse 1]
I've got the gift of one liners
And you've got the curse of curves
And with this gift I compose words
And the question that comes forward
Are you perspiring from the irony
Or are you sweating to these lyrics
And this just in
You're a dead fit
But my wit won't allow it

[Pre-Chorus]
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes

[Chorus]
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard "with skin you'll win"

[Verse 2]
Her bone structure screams
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse of curves
So with the combination of my gift with one liners
And my way
My way with words
It seems I'm too hip to keep tight lipped
And you're on the gossip team
You're making something out of nothing
And jealousy's the cousin, the cousin of greed

[Pre-Chorus]
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes

[Chorus]
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard "with skin you'll win"

[Bridge 1]
Her bone structure screams
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse, the curse of
From what I've heard "with skin you'll win"

[Bridge 2]
We all have teeth that can bite underneath
To where the reality grows
Yeah, that's where mine go
That's where mine go
We all have teeth that can bite underneath
To where the reality grows
Yeah, that's where mine go
That's where mine go

From what I've heard "with skin you'll win"
And from what I've heard "with skin you'll win"

[Chorus]
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard "with skin you'll win"

[Bridge 1]
Her bone structure screams
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse, the curse of
From what I've heard "with skin you'll win"
