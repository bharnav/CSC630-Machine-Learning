[Pre-Chorus]
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now, what you got now

[Verse 1]
We keep ourselves a mystery
But we provide, provide the clues
So the rest is up to you
And don't forget to check the obvious
We are so serious
So I guess it comes down to how curious you can be

[Pre-Chorus]
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now, what you got now

[Chorus]
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare

And you check labels more than the FCC
But these calories are, are killing me
But this is a sticky situation
So keep your chest in the game
And drop your jaw and coax me
(Just coax me, just coax me)

[Pre-Chorus]
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now gotta, gotta give it up
What you got now, what you got now

[Chorus]
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare

[Bridge: William Beckett]
This is a party without the people
This is a show without the sounds
This is a dance without the steps
Now I gave you the clues, so find what I found
This is a party without the people
This is a show without the sounds
This is a dance without the steps
Now I gave you the clues, so find what I found

[Chorus]
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly but they sure love to stare
