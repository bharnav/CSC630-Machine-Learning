[Verse 1]
She doesn't deserve to be in a place like this all alone
She's under-age and so very very brave
A fake ID lent her credibility
She sits at the bar
The gents are gonna try so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
He said it was a one night stand
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
A one night stand

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Verse 2]
So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned
Says, "Girlie, girlie, you're at your best when you're sober"
And she slurs, "No, no, just one more"
And one turns into four
The fourth drink instinct is taking over
And the gentleman is leading her towards the door

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Bridge]
She thought that she could buy happiness by
By the bottle

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Chorus]
So what made you think
That he couldn't find that door in the morning
When he found that bed so easily in the dark?

[Pre-Chorus]
He said it was a one night stand
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
A one night stand
