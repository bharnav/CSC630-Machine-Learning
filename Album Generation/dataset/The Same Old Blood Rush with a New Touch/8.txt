[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make sure that I put this place on the map
If there’s one promise I make, it's that
If there's one promise I make, it's that
And some have told me that this could be the best for me
And some have said
Yeah, I've heard it
But I'm not buyin’ in
Yeah, I've heard it

[Pre-Chorus]
Style doesn't matter when you're on your back
Just remember that fact, just remember that
Style doesn't matter when you're on your back
Your clothes don't fit the season
You’re cold and that's the reason

[Chorus]
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me

[Verse 2]
My door was locked as we talked and talked
Keeping tempos with or without our clothes
And I'm telling you as fast as I can I'm a trend, a trend
‘Cause I don't break hearts, I just dent them
No, I don't break hearts, I just dent them

[Pre-Chorus]
Style doesn't matter when you're on your back
Just remember that fact, just remember that
Style doesn't matter when you're on your back
Your clothes don't fit the season
You’re cold and that's the reason

[Chorus]
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me

[Bridge]
Keeping tempos with or without clothes
Fast, halftime and slow
So raise that glass, you're high class
Keep that tempo slow
Style doesn't matter when you're on your back

[Chorus]
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me
Uptown girls are as good as gold down town
Or suburban gents like me have been told
Good as gold
Suburban urgency has got the best of me
