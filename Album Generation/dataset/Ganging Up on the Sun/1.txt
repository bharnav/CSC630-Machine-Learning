[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Shining like a work of art
Hanging on a wall of stars
Are you what I think you are?

[Chorus: Miller & Adam Gardner/Miller]
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite

[Verse 2: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Elevator to the moon
Whistling our favorite tune
Trying to get a closer view

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner/Miller]
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite

[Bridge: Miller]
Maybe you will always be
Just a little out of reach

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner/Miller]
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite
You're my satellite
