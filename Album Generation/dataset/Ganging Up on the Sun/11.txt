[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Here we are inside a novel
Waiting for an end
We don't know the authors of the book
Maybe someone's writing chapters
For us while we sleep
From a million miles away

[Pre-Chorus: Miller]
Stuck without a captain or a chart
No one seems to know just who to follow anymore

[Chorus: Miller]
Hang on
Hang on
There's a twilight
A nighttime and a dawn
Who knows
How long
So hang on
Hang on

[Verse 2: Miller]
If we fell inside a forest
Would it make a sound
It doesn't seem there's anyone around
Days are long we carry on
But still don't understand
We're a million miles away

[Pre-Chorus: Miller]
Stuck without a captain or a chart
No one seems to know just who to follow anymore

[Chorus: Miller]
Hang on
Hang on
There's a twilight
A nighttime and a dawn
Who knows
How long
So hang on
Hang on

[Chorus: Miller]
Hang on
Hang on
When all is shattered
When all your hope is gone
Who knows
How long
There is a twilight
A nighttime and a dawn

[Outro: Miller]
We break
We bend
With hand in hand
When hope is gone
Just hang on
Hang on
