[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Standing on a building, I am a lightning rod
And all these clouds are so familiar
Descending from the mountaintops, the gods are threatening
But I will return an honest soldier

[Chorus: Miller]
Home

[Verse 2: Miller]
Steady on this high rise, like every lightning rod
And all these clouds are boiling over
Swimming in adrenaline, the sky is caving in
But I will remain the honest soldier

[Chorus: Miller]
Home
