[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
I've come down with something
I'm frozen, tied up, cast in lead
It's simple, so says the captain
Face forward, move slow, forge ahead

[Verse 2: Miller & Adam Gardner]
I'm earning a reputation
My conscience, mistrust, and regret
Courageous, just like the captain
Marching forward with no doubt in his head

[Outro: Miller]
Onward! Onward!
Onward! Onward!
