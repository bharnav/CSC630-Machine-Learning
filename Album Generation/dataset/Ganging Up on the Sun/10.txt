[Verse: Ryan Miller]
We're not sentimental
We're just oil-filled machines
Trying not to say the things we mean
You gotta show us a little love

[Verse 2: Miller]
Our big brother tells us
That it's something in our genes
Pretty soon we'll all be coming clean
So start showing a little skin

[Chorus: Miller & Adam Gardner/Miller]
I'm the judge and jury
I'm the lion and the lamb
And this is the beginning of the end
It's breaking you down
We're breaking you down

[Verse 3: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
We're unrecognizable
We're sunken submarines
Trying to escape before we're seen
You're gonna miss us when we're gone

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner/Miller]
I'm the judge and jury
I'm the lion and the lamb
And this is the beginning of the end
It's breaking you down
We're breaking you down
