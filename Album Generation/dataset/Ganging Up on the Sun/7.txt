[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
I look out of my bedroom window pane
Every day, but the view just stays the same
I was young I would run straight from this place
Come back home and then start it all again

[Chorus: Miller/Miller & Adam Gardner]
I know just what I want, I know just what I need
It's a big old house and it's coming back to haunt me
We'll be alright, we'll be easy
Dont look back, dont look back
Just c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[Verse 2: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Look around at the people in this place
I'm afraid that we'll end up the same way
So let's rise, dye our hair, and change our names
Make a wish and just blow it all away

[Chorus: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
I know just what I want, I know just what I need
It's a big old house and it's coming back to haunt me
We'll be alright, we'll be easy
Don't look back, don't look back
Just c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[Outro: Miller & Gardner]
We'll be alright, we'll be easy
Dont look back, dont look back
Just c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Cause you know what you want
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
