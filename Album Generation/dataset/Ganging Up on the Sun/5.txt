[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Welcome, you're under control
And buried like a mole
1000 feet below

[Verse: Miller]
Waiting, we're all that we've got
Our reputation's shot
A 90 story fall

[Chorus: Miller & Adam Gardner]
No one here can make a sound
We're all ghosts in this town
We are standing in the trenches
Of the new underground

[Verse 2: Miller]
Pipe down, stay under control
It's getting pretty absurd
Soon everything will turn

[Bridge: Miller]
It's our time to see the sun
There'll be a crack and our day will come
Maybe then we'll be the ones
You never can be sure, the shot heard 'round the world

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
No one here can make a sound
We're just ghosts in this town
We are standing in the trenches
Of the new underground

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
No one here can make a sound
We're just ghosts in this town
We are standing in the trenches
Of the new underground

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
All the walls are coming down
We're still hanging around
We are digging in the trenches
Of the new underground
