[Verse 1: Ryan Miller/Miller & Adam Gardner]
Tonight
Where do we go from here?
The road to Ruby Falls has reached the end
And now
We're digging in the sand
They're promising that help is on the way

[Chorus 1: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Love
Confession number one
Impossible and sorry
And judge, can you look the other way?
Some things are best unsaid

[Verse 2: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
And now
Where can we go from here?
When all the morning birds have gone away
Two wrongs
Won't navigate tonight
The afterlife is all in the end
The afterlife is ours in the end

[Chorus 2: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Love
Don't look me in the eye
Just wash it all down
And judge
Can you let me know the way?
We're out of here
Straight out of here

[Chorus 3: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Somewhere
Down buried in the sand
Two birds give out a song
And all of Ruby Falls is singing along

[Outro: Miller]
Sing along

[Excuse the mistakes have gone and turned away?]
I hear them stumbling, now they make you pay
