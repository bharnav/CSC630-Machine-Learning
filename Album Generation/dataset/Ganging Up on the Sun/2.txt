[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
Bones are broken and the will is sunk
How did everything get so fucked up?
Do you want to change your mind?
You can always change your mind

[Chorus: Miller]
You and I could quit this scene
Build a town and then secede
Like an Adam and an Eve
'Cause to the dreamers go the dreams
But the leaders have the lead
It's a frightening, frightening thing

[Verse 2: Miller/Miller & Adam Gardner]
Born to the land of opportunity
Of manifest destiny
Do you want to change your mind?
You can always change your mind

[Chorus: Miller]
You and I could quit this scene
Build a town and then secede
Like an Adam and an Eve
To the dreamers go the dreams
But the leaders have the lead
It's a frightening, frightening thing

[Post-Chorus: Miller/Miller, Gardner & Joe Pisapia]
The moon and stars are ganging up on the sun
Rebellion!

[Outro: Miller, Gardner & Pisapia]
Everybody, the sky is falling down
Friends and lovers, the world is coming down
Down, down
Down, down
