[Verse 1: Adam Gardner]
As I fall asleep, to black and white TV
Fly far away, in my recurring dream
Each winter drains electricity
There are words to say
And there are songs to sing
But I can hardly speak at all

[Chorus: Gardner & Ryan Miller]
Home, I'm on my way
To a holiday in real time
Float, hold my own weight
Say we'll be ok, dear valentine

[Verse 2: Gardner]
Now quietly peek across the street
Perfectly kept, perfectly neat
But it's not complete, no not at all

[Chorus: Gardner & Ryan Miller]
Home, I'm on my way
To a holiday in real time
Float, hold my own weight
Say we'll be ok, dear valentine
