I'm searching for a change of pace
Trying to pull away all these names
Tell you how it all works out
I'm terrible on the phone
It's better when it's us all alone
Tell you how it all works out

You're not the only one
And I'm not your only fun

I like the sound you make when we're shaking
You like to lose control and I take it
I turn the music up so it drowns us out, oh

I'm scattered when the morning comes
Shattered over what I've just done
Tell me if it all works out

You're not the only one
And I'm not your only fun

Oh, I like the sound you make when we're shaking
You like to lose control and I take it
I turn the music up so it drowns us out
Oh, I like the way you breathe when we're moving
Forward and back and forth with no feeling
I turn the music up so it drowns us out
Oh, oh, oh

I'm searching for a change of pace
Searching for a change

I like the sound you make when we're shaking
You like to lose control and I take it
I turn the music up so it drowns us out
Oh, I like the way you breathe when we're moving
Forward and back and forth with no feeling
I turn the music up so it drowns us out
Oh, oh, oh

I like the sound you make
You like to give and take
I like the sound you make
You got to give, you got to give
Push it away
