The distance between the sheets
When chemicals compete
The friction of skin is deathly unbearable, yeah
The basics of war are near
The coward's in you and me
There's no turning back
We walked into this
Don't confuse it

Love
Wasted on the young
Detonate it run
Never wanted all the hard, the breaks at all

Bodies with no remorse
Clothing lines the floors
The red on the skin is fading slowly
Dancing lonely

Love
Wasted on the young
Detonate it run
Never wanted all the hard, the breaks at all
Taken by it fast
Sacred in the moment
I can feel your breath
You couldn't save me
Taken by it fast
Sacred in the moment
I predict the worst
You're going to hate me

(Wasted on the young)

I could leave all of this behind
I should leave all of this behind

Love
Wasted on the young
Detonate it run
Never wanted all the hard, the breaks at all
Taken by it fast
Sacred in the moment
I can feel your breath
You couldn't save me
Taken by it fast
Sacred in the moment
I predict the worst
You're going to hate me

(Wasted on the young)
You couldn't save me
(Wasted on the young)

I can't live this way forever
I cannot live this way forever
