I'm out of range and you're all radio
I want my entertainment
I'm out of phase and you're all stereo
I want my entertainment loud right now
You should've known the difference
I'm out of range and you're all radio
I want communication

Break

There's so much useless noise that I can't take
There's so much useless noise I can't break through

I'm out of range but not invisible
Don't want my entertainment
Vacant like an empty statement
I wanna burn this station down right now
You should've kept your distance
I'm out of phase and you're all stereo
I want communication

Break

There's so much useless noise that I can't take
The sounds are getting louder every day
There's so much useless noise
That I can't take
I'm out of phase

We walk alone like motorists
Behind the bars and discotechs
Love is a product and sex is the currency
We're all cheaters if we can't win
Blood, liquor and the holy bible paint a picture of a
Kinder gentler world
An art that seems to have no ending
One that leaves us standing at the gates with broken wings
While our heart scan reports:
Access denied, access denied

(We have arrived)

Break

There's so much useless noise that I can't take
The sounds are getting louder everyday
There's so much useless noise that I can't take
I'm tortured by the airwaves, I feel
Vacant like an empty statement
You and I cannot escape this
Vacant like an empty statement
You and I cannot escape this
