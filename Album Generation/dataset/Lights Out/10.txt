Watching it burn to your fingertips
Everything stings a bit
Dangerous silence surrounds you
All of the ashtrays and magazines
Recurrent love themes
Captured by time zones that hurt you

This could be perfect
It could be worth it
This could be perfect
If I wasn't worthless

Breathing in slowly
Hearts beating lonely
Damaged by habits that haunt you
All of the goodbyes
All of the goodnights
All of the nice try's
Left you in the cold

This could be perfect
It could be worth it
This could be perfect
If I wasn't worthless

This could be perfect
This could be worth it

If I could be a part of your world
Leave this all behind
I would investigate a perfect life with you
If I could say it in another way
If words could make this right
I would investigate a perfect love with you

This could be perfect
This could be perfect
This could be perfect (this could be perfect)
This could be perfect (this could be perfect)

Watching it burn to your fingertips
