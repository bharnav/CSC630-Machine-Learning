I can't take it
It's just a paycheck
Making arrangements to burn it to the ground
I can't fake it
When nothing's sacred
Making arrangements to burn it to the ground

And beauty lies in the ignorant
With the sound of selling out to the innocent

I can't save us from the outside
I can't take it, what I'm told
You can't stop it
It just started
Dead living on the radio
I can't save us from the outside

I can't take it
I won't cooperate
Making arrangements to bury it in the ground
I can't fake it
This station
Is going under, so I'll bury this in the ground

And beauty lies in the ignorant
With the sound of selling out to the innocent

I can't save us from the outside
I can't take it, what I'm told
You can't stop it
It just started
Dead living on the radio
I can't save us from the outside

I can't take it
It's just a paycheck
Making arrangements
I can't take it
It's just a paycheck
Making arrangements

I can't take one more day all for I am done
I can't bend, this must end, counting back from 3 to 1

I can't save us from the outside
I can't take it, what I'm told
You can't stop it
It just started
Dead living on the radio
I can't save us from the outside

I can't save us
You can't take us
No one gets out alive
I can't save us
You can't take us
No one gets out
