Watching your lips move together
Nothing's making sense
Talk to me
Talk to me
I don't want to break the silence with the taste of something violent
Come to me
Come to me

I don't believe the lies
Reading between the lines
I don't belong here any longer
I'll be gone this time

Watching every move you make
I hope you slip
I hope this fades away
Fades away
I get closer with the silent treatment
When it hurts to need it
When it's hard to leave it
Come to me
Come to me

I don't believe the lies
Reading between the lines
I don't belong here any longer
I'll be gone this time
I don't believe the lies
This is the last goodbye
I don't belong here any longer
I'll be gone this time

I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
God only knows it's getting harder everyday

I don't believe the lies
Reading between the lines
I don't belong here any longer
I'll be gone this time
I don't believe the lies
This is the last goodbye
I don't belong here any longer
I'll be gone this time

Watching your lips move together
Nothing's making sense
Talk to me
