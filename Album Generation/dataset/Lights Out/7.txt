What you wanted couldn't hold us down
What we needed turned its back so
Out loud, we're telling your secrets
Out loud to the lovers and thieves
Out loud, 'cause you never experienced
This is the side of us nobody sees

We're making something beautiful
Starting a riot
We've got this under our control
Starting to fight

What you wanted couldn't hold us now
What we needed all came crashing down
Down, with the lies and cover ups
Down down, to the lovers and thieves
Down now, 'cause you never experienced
This is the side that I'll never believe in

We're making something beautiful
Starting a riot
We've got this under our control
Starting to fight
We're making something
We're taking nothing
We're starting something beautiful
Start a riot

What you wanted

We're making something beautiful
Starting a riot
We've got this under our control
Starting to fight
We're making something
We're taking nothing
We're starting something beautiful
Start a riot (hey hey)
Riot (hey hey)
Riot (hey hey)
