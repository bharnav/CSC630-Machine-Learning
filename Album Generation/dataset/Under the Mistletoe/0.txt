[Chorus]
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list, you're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

[Verse 1]
I know someone out there knows what I'm saying, oh no
Baby you're a girl who's wishing just like me, yeah yeah
There is one, and you know who you are, my gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

[Chorus]
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list, you're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

[Verse 2]
In the morning I know everybody's rushing
To see what's underneath the Christmas tree
Know what I mean cause I don't find it there, underneath the mistletoe is where
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say, yeah

[Chorus]
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list, you're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

[Bridge]
Only you can make this a merry merry Christmas, yeah
There is one, and you know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

[Chorus]
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list, you're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

[Outro]
All I ever wanted was you, this Christmas
Yeah yeah yeah, I need you baby
You're the single item on my list, you're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, kiss me there, I'll be waiting, kiss me there
