[Intro]
Santa's coming girl, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's going to find out
Who's naughty and nice, Santa Claus is coming to town

[Pre-Chorus]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's going to find out
Who's naughty and nice, Santa Claus is coming to town

[Pre-Chorus]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge]
So it's that time of the year when you let all your problems go
And you know, you just shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh
Shake it, shake it, baby, shake it, shake it, baby, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
He's going to find out
Who's naughty and nice, Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming, Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
