[Verse 1: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
Looking out the window waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway, it's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & The Band Perry]
Pacing down the hallway tryna fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop, except for the clock on the wall, yeah yeah
And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

[Bridge: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'm praying that you make it home tonight, so we can lay down by the fireside
You and I 'til Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here, I'll be waiting

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

[Outro: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
Looking out the window waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway, it's really coming down tonight
