[Verse 1]
Baby I will not pout, baby I will not cry
Cause I got your love this Christmas time
When the snow's on the ground and it's freezing outside
I got your love this Christmas

[Pre-Chorus]
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

[Chorus]
Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of a star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

[Pre-Chorus]
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

[Chorus]
Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

[Bridge]
All the lovers around the world
Got me singing Merry Merry Christmas, Merry Merry Christmas
And every boy and every girl, stay close to the ones you love and thank God above
That you got someone this year, that can fill your heart with cheer, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

[Outro]
For my very own Christmas love
For my very own Christmas love
Give me a kiss baby, give me a kiss baby
For my very own Christmas love
