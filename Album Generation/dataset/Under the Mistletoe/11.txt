[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
This is the time a year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it, get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight when you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl I'll be right there

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Want to put my ear to your chest girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like, now I know that it's Christmas time

[Verse 2: Boyz II Men]
You got on my favourite dress, you're looking, looking, looking good
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Want to put my ear to your chest girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like, now I know that it's Christmas time

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
I'll deck your heart with boughs of holly, boughs of holly)
Fa la la la la la la, fa la la la la la la
Baby cause you're the reason to be, jolly
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la la la, fa la la la la](3033159)
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like, now I know that it's Christmas time

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la, like Christmas
I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's Christmas time, yeah yeah
