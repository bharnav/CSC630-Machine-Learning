[Chorus]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright

[Verse 1]
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Chorus]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light

[Verse 2]
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
