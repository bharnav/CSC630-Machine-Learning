[Muic Video]

[Verse 1]
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me
How I can make a change?

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

[Verse 2]
I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner cause some of my dinner
Is still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference and it's starting today

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me
How I can make a change?

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

[Bridge]
Pray for the broken hearted, I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing, I pray for all the souls in need
I pray, can you give 'em one today?
I just can't sleep tonight, can someone tell me how to make a change?

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray, I pray, I pray
I close my eyes and pray, pray
