[Intro]
How can I begin to
Tell you what you do to
Me every time I hear ya
More willing to want to see ya

[Verse 1]
I know that there's no use in
Trying to explain the confusion
But still I'm not complaining
About my situation
Let's not talk about a
Possible ending
The very first time that I
Was looking to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hiding in your expression
So I put myself forward
For your consideration

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a
Possible ending
Let's not think about it
Every day
And I know
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
Every time I hear
My beautiful woman

[Verse 2]
And so we put the top down
To take you driving downtown
I guess we'll know just what to do
When you're looking to fool around
It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
B is for beautiful as the sunshine
E tells me everything is feeling alright
A goes to
U and me swinging it down
T is two
I want you, You've got me acting like a
Fool

[Chorus]
