[Intro]
Weird world, weird world
Hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket
Because it's hard to stop when you're spinning around

[Chorus]
It's a weird world don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it

[Verse 2]
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love
It's a weird world, yeah
Sent a message to a GI in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

[Chorus]
It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

[Verse 3]
I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

[Outro]
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey
