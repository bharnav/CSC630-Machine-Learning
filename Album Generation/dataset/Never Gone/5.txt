[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Jodie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

[Bridge]
She said, what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wannabelieve

[Chorus]
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

[Bridge]
Right now right now
Oooh
Oh Oh

[Verse 2]
Jodie liked to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor untill the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk I followed (followed)
When she left I cried

[Bridge]
What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la (la la la la la)
La la la la
La la la la (la la la la)
La la la la la

[Verse 3]
Oh
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Right now right now
Right now oh oh
Poster girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Poster girl yeah
Come on come on yeah
