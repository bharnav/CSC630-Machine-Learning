[Verse 1]
When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault
I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just got to know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

[Chorus]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Verse 2]
I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

[Chorus]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Bridge]
I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
Because someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

[Chorus]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Chorus]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Outro]
Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too
