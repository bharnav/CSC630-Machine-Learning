[Verse 1: Brian]
Who are you now?
Are you still the same or did you change somehow?
What do you do at this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick]
No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

[Chorus: All]
I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

[Verse 2: AJ and Howie]
Now look at me
Instead of moving on I refuse to see that I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment that wasn't meant to last (to last)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick]
I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

[Chorus x1]

[Bridge: Kevin and AJ]
No, no
I wish I could find you just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (about you)

[Outro: All]
Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you
