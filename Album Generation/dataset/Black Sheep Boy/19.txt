I'm in love with Susan Smith
I've been from the start
I'm in love with Susan Smith
And I'll take care of her

Is she crazy? I think so
How else to explain
Strapped them babies in that car seat
Ain't gonna see them again

Piece of film, all innocence
Crawling, smiling, permanence
She makes up some bs story
On cbs and all the rest
She sounds so phoney
I can hear tears inside hurting, haunting
Who she was then I don't know
But I find myself wanting her

I'm in love with Susan Smith
Ain't no truth
The way men tell it
A mother's love is pure and perfect
What's the verdict
I can smell it

Kill the bitch
Ain't no mitigating factors
Dig a ditch and bury her ass
Final judgement is [?]
And you ask how come you're even bothering

I'm in love with Susan Smith
Cause I hate all of you
Sit there judging
Your shit stinks
Pressure takes its aim on you
Pressure beats your fucking head in
What are you supposed to do
None of this applies to you

Cause moments define everything
Early enough birds were singing
What is it about today
Is it anything especially
