How did we end
So far out

Past praying
And past recall

To believe in nothing
Is a faith in itself

A lighthouse
In the eye of the storm

The nightmare
Of the nightmare

To follow the signal
Of a ghost ship

Our names are
Written in water

The knowledge
Is all around us

We came here
To be washed away
