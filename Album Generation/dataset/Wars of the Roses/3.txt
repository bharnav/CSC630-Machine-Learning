The family is gathering
In silent prayer

Before the bed
Where he is laid out

Beautiful in black
And closed eyes

Only a boy
And a brother

And a lover
And a son

His sudden
And violent death

Leaving us without words
And looking away

From the mother
And the father

Left alone to go through
A great grief forever
