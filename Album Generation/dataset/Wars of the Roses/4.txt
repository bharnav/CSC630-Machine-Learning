Mount the high horse
And dogs will follow

The scent of innocence
The wars of the roses

Sounding the charge
Down in history

The hand that offers
The heart is unfaithful

Full of broken promise
And hidden in the hollow

A blood-red coat
White to the bone

Fit for a queen
And the cloven foot

A trophy animal
A lost game
