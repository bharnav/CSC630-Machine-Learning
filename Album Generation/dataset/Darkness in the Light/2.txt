Turn it off, turn it off
(I)
Won't make that mistake
(I've)
Been down this road before
Think again, think again
I will not compromise
(I)
Won't compromise anything
Beat down
(I'm)
At the end of my rope
Beat down
(I)
Can't stand these changes
Beat down
Headfirst I take on survival, survival
Try to tear my down
I won't hesitate to stand face to face
With my worst enemy
Standing tall in the face of defeat
Go it alone at my discretion
The hammer falls whenever my will says it does
I promise you
I've fallen all too far
Obsession with the shadow in the light
This constant war will lead me home
This constant war will force me onward
Try to tear me down
Headfirst I take on survival
I fell all too far
Obsession with the shadow in the light
I'm at a constant war
Yet this strife has carried me to my home
I've fallen all too far
Tear me down
Lost in the shadows in the light
Tear me down
Only word
It's been a lifetime of fueled obsessions
A promise kept is my only word
Only word
Lost in the shadows in the light
Tear me down
A promise kept is my only word
Only word, it will be kept
I promise you
