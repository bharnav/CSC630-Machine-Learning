[Hook]
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
I hear a sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Bridge]
Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forward or backwards
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

[Hook]
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
I hear a sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Remember to see when you are lost
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
