[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singing come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing—

[Chorus]
You… are…
You… are…

[Verse 2]
Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singing come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing—

[Chorus]
You… are…
You… are…
You… are…
You… are…
You… are…
You… are…

[Bridge]
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

[Chorus]
You… are…
You… are…

[Outro]
(Home) Home
Where I wanted to go
(Home) Home
Where I wanted to go
(Home) Home (You…)
Where I wanted to go (Are…)
(Home) Home (You…)
Where I wanted to go (Are…)
