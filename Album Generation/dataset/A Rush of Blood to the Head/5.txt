[Verse 1]
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

[Hook]
Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
It

[Verse 2]
On a hill top, on a sky-rise
Like a first born child
On a full day, and a full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

[Hook]
Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without

[Outro]
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
