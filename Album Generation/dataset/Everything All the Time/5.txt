[Verse 1]
Back of the boat was painted "Wrecking Ball"
There was country music playing
But he don't like it at all
And red fire popping on the rained-down wood
There was whiskey bottle spilling
And a lake that's made of salt

Well look out back there was a note on the door it saying
"Everybody listen we will be the next Omaha"

[Chorus]
Now if you find yourself falling apart
Then I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake

[Chorus]
Falling apart
And I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake

[Verse 2]
Your old man was but a wishing machine
It's time that you could spend
Now he is getting old
When Billy Lorett had found a watering hole
It's a place to lay south or the heads of coyote

[Chorus]
Now if you find yourself falling apart
Well I'm sure
I could stand
On
The Great Salt Lake

[Bridge]
Follow me home
We want more
Follow me home
We all want more
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know we all want more, oh-oh
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know we all want more
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
