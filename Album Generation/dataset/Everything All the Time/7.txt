[Verse 1]
Well I'd like to think I'm the mess
You'd wear with pride
Like some empty dress on the bed
You've laid out for tonight

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll tell you sometime
Time
Sometime
And you were right
Right
You were right

[Hook]
Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine

Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine

Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine

Oh
