[Intro]
Weed party
Yeehaw

[Verse 1]
I got you arrested because
Weed party come and gone
Gone
I am about to set this off
'Til weed party's done
Is done

[Chorus]
The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong

[Verse 2]
So I brought you perplexing thoughts
Words were at a loss
A loss
It's a good day to skip because
Weed party is gonna call
It's called

[Chorus x2]
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
Parents aren't enforcing the laws

Oh
