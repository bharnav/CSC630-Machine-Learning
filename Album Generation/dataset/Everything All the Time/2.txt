[Verse 1]
Out on the wall sounds of banging
Is constant coming from your head
And desperate the calls came and
Ringing from those wanna wring your neck
Your neck

[Verse 2]
Open your mouth sounds of breathing
Found it spilling from your face
Best to be dim to the humble of
Traffic stopping on your name

[Chorus]
Count on us all falling our own swords tonight

[Verse 3]
Chilling walk home down the portions
Roads there leading straight to your place
Look like the tin can would swallow the kitchen
Plugging up your space

[Chorus]
Count on us all stepping on our toes tonight

[Outro]
Count on us all stepping on our toes
Count on us all to fall on our own swords tonight
