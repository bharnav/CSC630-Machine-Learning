[Verse 1]
A tree for all these problems
They can't find you for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath
Your heart and somewhere in your stomach

[Verse 2]
And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you
Well ain't they just like monsters
They come to feed on me
Giant little animals to feed

[Chorus]
Though to say we got much hope
If I am lost, it's only for a little while
Oh

[Verse 1]
A tree for all these problems
They can't find us for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath
Our hearts and somewhere in our stomachs

[Verse 2]
And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you
Well ain't they just like monsters
They come to feed on us
Giant little animals for us

[Chorus x2]
Though to say we got much hope
If I am lost it's only for a little while

[Outro]
If I am lost, it's only for a little while
If I am lost, it's only for a little while
