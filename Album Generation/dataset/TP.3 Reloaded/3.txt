[Verse 1]
Girl, I want to be alone with you
Just to see what you can do
Ooh, you're dancing all over me
Baby, this is like some kind of fantasy
The way you move, you're teasing, girl
So tonight, I want you in my world

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go again, girl, on my mind
See you in my dreams all the time
Ooh, baby girl, you're so fine
Standing in front of me

[Chorus]
Now will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)

[Verse 2]
Girl, the time has come to show and prove
I've seen enough, I wanna feel the truth
Put your voodoo on me, babe
Kiss my lips, and curse me, babe
Show me how you do your magic, babe
Lead me to your secret jungle, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go again, girl, on my mind
See you in my dreams all the time
Ooh, baby girl, you're so fine
Standing in front of me

[Chorus]
Now will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (would you wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (oh)

[Bridge]
You're a Jamaican Queen, oh yeah
I'm an American King
You're a Jamaican Queen, oh yeah
I'm an American King
You're a Jamaican Queen, oh yeah
I'm an American King
You're a Jamaican Queen, oh yeah
I'm an American King
You're a Jamaican Queen, oh yeah
I'm an American King

[Verse 3]
Let's get together
And make sweet love
Let's get together
And mix cultures
Let's get together
And change the world, yeah
Wind for me, Jamaican girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go again, girl, on my mind
See you in my dreams all the time
Ow, baby girl, you're so fine
Standing in front of me

[Chorus]
Now will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (oh yeah)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (wind for me)
Slow wind for me (would you wind for me)

Wind for me (Jamaican girl)
Slow wind for me (oh yeah)
Will you wind for me (Jamaican girl)
Slow wind for me (oh yeah)
Will you wind for me (Jamaican girl)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)
Will you wind for me (Jamaican girl)
Slow wind for me (wind for me)

Wind for me (Jamaican girl)
Slow wind for me
