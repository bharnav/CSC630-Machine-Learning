[Spoken Intro]
Wake up...baby...baby...get up...
Listen

[Verse 1]
I touch you, you awake
All the love that weve been making
I cannot believe that it's going on the third day
No need for a clock 'cause, baby girl, we won't stop
Got me wantin' to keep on goin' ever since the pants dropped

[Pre-Chorus]
(We) We've been making out (yeah) for a quite while (oh)
Unbelievable (how we drive each other wild)
It don't make no sense (no sense), this is heaven sent
You have put a spell on me, now I want...

[Chorus]
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day even when we're sleeping
I want sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we're making

[Verse 2]
We'll take our time 'cause girl, we've got our whole life
Your sex is incredible, it's goin on the 12th night
Girl, anytime, any place, say the world
And I will satisfy your body ways unheard

[Pre-Chorus]
(We) We've been making out (making out, yeah) for quite a while
Unbelievable (how we drive each other wild)
It don't make no sense (oh yeah), this is heaven sent
Girl, you have put a spell on me, now I want

[Chorus]
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day, even when we're sleeping
I want sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we're making

[Bridge]
All the way through the night, babe
Straight through to the morning time
Girl, tonight I vow (I vow) to keep your body satisfied
And we'll keep on goin babe until night comes again
Let's keep it consistent
There's no such thing as us stopping
Your body on top of my body every single night, oh
I wanna hear you scream (oh oh), I wanna hear you sing to me

[Chorus]
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day, even when we're sleeping
I want sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we're making
I want your sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day even when we're sleeping
Sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay, love is what we're making
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day even when we're sleeping
Sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we making
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day, even when we're sleeping
Sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we're making
Sex in the morning, sex in the evening
Sex in the noon day, even when we're sleeping
Sex on all the holidays and every single weekend
Baby, it's so okay because love is what we're making
