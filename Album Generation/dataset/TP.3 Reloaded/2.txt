[Verse 1]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, cooking me a meal
Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your T-shirt, with nothing else on
Strutting past, switching that ass, while I'm on the phone, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
Girl, we'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed

[Interlude]
How would you like it, babe? (Would you like that?)
Tell me right now, babe (Yeah, I'm going to call you back)

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, chilling in your robe
I'm saying to myself, she better go put on some clothes
Tickling and teasing, doing that little dance
Girl, you gon' make me lay you down and give it to you more 'gin

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
Girl, we'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed

[Interlude]
This is what I'm ready to do
Girl, I'm ready to toss your salad
While making love, I'll be feasting you

[Verse 3]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, sweating up a storm
The oven's on 500, so you know the kitchen's warm
Girl, you know just how to get into a brother's mind
'Cause here we are still in this kitchen doing it for the third time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy doing the damn thing that...

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed, whoa
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
