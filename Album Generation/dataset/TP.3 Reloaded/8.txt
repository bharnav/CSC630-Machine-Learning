Baby, I wanna do something different tonight a'ight?
Okay, what you wanna do?
I want you to sing to me, while I sing to you
Why don't we do this?
Okay

[Verse 1: R. Kelly & Nivea]
Touching you, touching me, satisfying your every need
You won't have to work for nothing
After I give you this loving
Touching you, touching me, sexual chemistry
Girl, seems like your body's ready
And I know you won't regret it
Turn the lights down low, ready to let my juices flow
Baby, double lock the door, let's start right here on this floor
Sounds like the perfect plan, we're seconds away from loveland
All you gotta do is take my hand
Now tell me, baby, who's your man?
You babe
Who?

Now come and take it, baby

[Chorus: both + R. Kelly & Nivea]
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby, I don't mind if you take off my clothes
Let it go, let it flow

Baby girl, you can be loud, no one will know
Let it go, let it flow

Raindrops falling, love angels calling
Something tells me this could be, the greatest sex in history
All these nights, girl, I vow
To make you cry when I go down
I am here to please you, baby
Taste your love and drive you crazy
Like a summer breeze, bursting trees
Loving the way you pleasing me
Bite my lips to keep from screaming
Baby boy, it's like I'm dreaming
For me the same when positions change
Making me wanna scream your name
It's like heaven matched us up
Such a blessing we hooked up

[Chorus: both + R. Kelly & Nivea]
Let it go, let it flow

Everyone's gone...
And it feels so right, it can't be wrong
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Ooh, I'm so glad that we're alone
Ooh, this sex kinda turnin' this house into a happy home
Let it go, let it flow

Just like tasting raindrops, pretty lady, don't you stop
Got me going round and round, just bring my loving right on down
Let it go, let it flow
