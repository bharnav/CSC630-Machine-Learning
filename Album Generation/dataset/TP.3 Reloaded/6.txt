[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend

Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
Go on and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been more man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunting I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wasting your time
Believe, I really tried to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempting and teasing me
And plus she knew what she was doing, did it anyway
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay
Truth is, is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu

[Verse 2]
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feeling her
And how we would get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to mislead you (lead you)
At first I just wanted to please you (please you)
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Cause I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta nowhere ever since the day we kissed
And the, truth is, is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)

[Bridge]
(I'm sorry again) Never meant to hurt you
(I'm sorry again) But girl I love her
(I'm sorry again) I never meant to make you cry, no
Now right up out the closet

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend (yeah, hey)

I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time...
