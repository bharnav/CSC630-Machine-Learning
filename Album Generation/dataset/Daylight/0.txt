[Verse 1]
Is this all that you could do?
Wait for them to come to you
Tell yourself that it's right
Where were you the night before?
Someone saw you at his door
Searching eyes are on fire
For the answers you hide
Would you let them find the light

[Chorus]
Don't wait for daylight
Don't run from tonight
Just open your eyes
The stars fade with the light

[Verse 2]
What if they don't believe
You just went there to leave
Could not know that he would try
To get back at you that night just for saying goodbye
You left wearing his coat
Then found his final note
That he meant for his bride

[Chorus]
Don't wait for daylight
Don't run from tonight
Just open your eyes
The stars fade with the light

[Bridge]
Sing out, sing out
Your voice is all you have
Sing out Sing out
Sing out, Sing out
I know you will
Sing out, sing out
Sing out, sing out
It's up to you
Sing out, sing out

[Chorus]
Don't wait for daylight
Don't run from tonight
Just open your eyes
The stars fade with the light

[Bridge]
Sing out, sing out
Your voice is all you have
Sing out Sing out
Sing out, Sing out
I know you will
Sing out, sing out
Sing out, sing out
It's up to you
Sing out, sing out
