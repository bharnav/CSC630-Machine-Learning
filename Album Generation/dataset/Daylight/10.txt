[Verse 1]
Love, love isn't always
Love the way that we mean
Just like you are right now is all, all that I need

[Chorus]
Let's start over, don't be afraid cause I won't keep track
Let's climb to the top
If you won't look down, I won't look back

[Verse 2]
Love, love isn't always
Love, the kind that you hold
I will be here waiting if you, you can let go

[Chorus]
Let's start over, don't be afraid cause I won't keep track
Let's climb to the top
If you won't look down, I won't look back

Let's start over, don't be afraid â€˜cause I won't keep track
Let's climb to the top
