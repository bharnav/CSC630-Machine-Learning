[Verse 1]
I am chosen, bought out and broken by the light I have inside
Our love is greater than I could ever give to you, I must confess
If this song is all I have now it would fall way short of you

[Chorus]
I am more than
I am more than tonight
I am counted, called out and alive

[Verse 2]
You heard we were playing our songs tonight and you
Thought you might stop by
Your eyes opened and cried out to get back
All the time you took to find
If I wouldn't sing so softly
Would those stars be in your eyes


[Chorus] X2
I am more than
I am more than tonight
I am counted, called out and alive

I am more than
I am more than
I am lost without your love
I am lost
I am more than
I am more than
I won't ever leave you now
No I won't
