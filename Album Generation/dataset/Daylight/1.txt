[Verse 1]
Tell me do you feel it
Feel it when your heart starts letting go?
I'm unsure now if I could ever tell you no
I've been seeing traces of everything I used to know was right
I can't leave now
I need you to remember
Cause it's not like all my love was understood

[Chorus]
Don't just tell me that it's over
I want to know how we can make it
I know I'm lost
I know I'm lost but not forsaken

[Verse 2]
Tell me do you want it
Want to make your heart stop goin' down?
I'm unsure now if we could ever make it out
I've been seeing traces
Of why I wanted to be in this life
I can't leave now
I need you to remember
Cause it's not like all my love was understood

[Bridge]
I'm not giving up
I'm not laying down
I'm not leaving without you
Cause we're all the same
We all need to stay
When they tell us that we're through

[Chorus] x2
Don't just tell me that it's over
I want to know how we can make it
I know I'm lost
I know I'm lost but not forsaken
