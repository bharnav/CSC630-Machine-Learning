[Verse 1]
Lift your eyes girl
I know you're broken
Left from the same war
That you never knew
Your way is to fall just like before you
But the way isn't too long
You're almost there


[Hook]
There's a feeling that you won't make
All you have in store
This time is just a season
You deserve much more

[Chorus]
Lift up your head
Look out the window
Cause it's almost over now
Take back the time
Your fear has stolen
Cause it's almost over now

[Verse 2]
Don't let it get you caught in the tunnel
The end is only a few steps away
There's a feeling of resistance
You can't seem to fight
This time is just a season
You can make it right

[Chorus]
Lift up your head
Look out the window
Cause it's almost over now
Take back the time
Your fear has stolen
Cause it's almost over now

[Bridge]
Your eyes open
Your heart clean
But are you lookin'
To be free?

[Chorus]
