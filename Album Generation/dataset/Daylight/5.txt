[Verse 1]
I could give just one more chance
If I thought that there would be romance
Seas of everlasting grace
Fall down upon this sinner's face
Tonight

[Chorus]
I see clearer, all I wanted
The time is right, I know it
You are here
And you find out all the pieces
The time is right, I know it
You are here

[Verse 2]
One last reason to exist
Is the thought that you'd get over this
Words forever left unchanged
And from your lips a sinner's saved
Tonight

I see clearer, all I wanted
The time is right, I know it
You are here
And you find out all of the pieces (Come on, come on, you its all you wanted)
And you find out all the pieces (Come on, come on its right)
The time is right, I know it
You are here
Give me away now take me all down now
You find out all of the pieces
Give me away now, take me away

[Chorus]
I see clearer, all I wanted
The time is right, I know it
You are here
And you find out all the pieces
The time is right, I know it
You are here
