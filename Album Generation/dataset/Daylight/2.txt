[Verse 1]
Somewhere between the end
And the point where we begin
There's a fire burning brightly
That's found it's way to dim
When the feeling's gone...

[Chorus]
Shine on Shine on
And onto something new its long and overdue
I will remember you
Shine on shine on
And let the other's see you've got your victory
Will you remember me

[Verse 2]
I was with you in the valley
And up upon that hill
So take just one more step in front of you
For I am with you still you still
And you're not alone

[Chorus]
Can you see my hands are open I am waiting just ahead
And you think you need it all now
But you needed me instead

Shine on shine on shine on shine on won't you won't you shine

[Chorus]
Can you see my hands are open I am waiting just ahead
And you think you need it all now
But you needed me instead


[Outro]
Somewhere between the end and the point where we began
