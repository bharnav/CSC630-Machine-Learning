[Verse 1]
Look up it's up to you
Remember all the reasons to
Give grace and mercy for all the time you're here
I know, I know it's true
Early on we're made to choose
We all make diversions for the way we are

[Hook]
When my eyes have led the way

[Chorus]
I get lost
I'm just a fool
I can't get it back
Get it back to you
My hands are washed
My heart is new
When I get it back
Get it back
To you

[Verse 2]
Don't wait cuz you might miss
The way that you'd get out of this
And it's easy when you're living to forget
I know you can't be lost
But finding is the greatest cost
We all know that getting back is only half the way

[Hook]
When my eyes have led the way

[Chorus]
I get lost
I'm just a fool
I can't get it back
Get it back to you
My hands are washed
My heart is new
When I get it back
Get it back
To you

[Bridge]
Get up, Get up
The world is with you now
Get up, Get up
Your love will show you how to
Get up, Get up
When there's nothing left to do
Get up, Get up
Ohhhhhhh ohhh

[Chorus]
I get lost
I'm just a fool
I can't get it back
Get it back to you
My hands are washed
My heart is new
When I get it back
Get it back
To you
