[Verse 1]
If you don't know just how you feel
Don't say those sweet things that you know I'd want to hear
If you don't know just what to think
Then put your thoughts away and keep 'em out of reach

[Chorus]
Haley don't hurt me, if you don't know
I could have moved on a long time ago
You're undecided, your eyes still show
Haley don't hurt if you don't know

[Verse 2]
If you don't know just where we are
Then slowly step away before we get to far
If you don't just where you stand
Don't brace the fall that you may never want to land

[Chorus]
Haley don't hurt me, if you don't know
I could have moved on a long time ago
You're undecided, your eyes still show
Haley don't hurt if you don't know


[Bridge]
We're on and off again
It's more than I can stand
Just let me know if you're for real this time
Your voice has shook again
We're reminding me of when
We talked away into the end

[Chorus]
