Crave, crave your fat face
On the floor with the hapless dancers
Soon, soon we must leave
Take the dawn streets with the drone financiers

Shades, apparitions in the colonnade
Dissuade, sobbing to the barmaid

Freeze, freeze and don't move
Lights come up on the hapless dancers
Leave, take your coat, go
You best scram before the brutes enchant her

Low, ruination in the store's glow
Humble, monsters, ex officio

Grand on your sampan
Hold a brave face for the hapless dancers
