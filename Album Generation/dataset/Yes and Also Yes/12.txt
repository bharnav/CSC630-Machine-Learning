If you go
To Astoria
I hope you get there

Seek your road
To Astoria
I hope you get there
I hope you get there

If you go
Down your lonely road on home
I want to come
I want to come along

Get a plate
Full of sag paneer
I hope you eat well

In the clubs
In your fallow year
That funny sweet smell
That funny sweet smell
