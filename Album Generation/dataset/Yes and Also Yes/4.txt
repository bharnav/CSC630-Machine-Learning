Creep
Creep the day through
Pale prophet does the hatchback trances

Claw
Man in a bottle
Reboot the blankness, glad and stranded

I believe in the loveliness
I believe in this sainted mess

I move to strike the motion
The jokes that you wrote didn't float, it gets broken
Dare you won't crack the most, don't
Emotional coaster, the tropes, you fail so far

Run
Sleep on the speaker
Show up your betters, gorgeous moochers

Cold
Thick on the gristle
Clipped on the rockets, foul and rounded

I believe in the mutineers
I believe I am in arrears

I move to strike the motion
The law that you saw on the stroll, it gets broken
Jeer, you won't stop the dumb show
Ferocious commotion, you choke, you got lockjaw

Fear the cheers out of here
Jeer the fear out of here

I move to strike the motion
The jokes that you wrote didn't float, it gets broken
Dare you won't crack the most, don't
Emotional coaster, the tropes, you fail so far

I move to strike the motion
The law that you saw on the stroll, it gets broken
Jeer, you won't stop the dumb show
Ferocious commotion, you choke, you got lockjaw
