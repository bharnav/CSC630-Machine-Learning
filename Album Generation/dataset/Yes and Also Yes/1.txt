Living in the dream time
Swim into the center of the dark, dark sea
Defy the nighttime
Push in close, let yourself get free, get free

Don't you waste it
Blaze your bright blaze in the blue, blue air
Can you face you?
Press-gang yourself, it's a shuck, it's a fake scare

Dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un

I'm gonna muck around
Pennsylvania Station with a blind chorine
Gonna bust the plow
Stealing seamy books, swilling nepenthe

And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un, uh

Living in the dream time
Swim into the center of the dark, dark sea
Defy the nighttime
Push in close, let yourself get free, get free

And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un
Dive into the un
And we dive into the un
Then we dive, and we dive
And we dive, dive, dive
