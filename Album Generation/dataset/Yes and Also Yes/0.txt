Well, your man won't dance, but I will
He's just a cup of punch that you'll spill
You're gonna hang him from the sails of a sinking sloop
Crowded with the goons and the dopes you duped

You get na na nothing, I found out that I'm a chump
And you were cold, cold-hearted to me
You got la la lucky that I told you what I did
And you're so, so sorry, but not the way you want
You're getting na na na na na na nothing from me
Na na nothing from me

I was in flux, I was a clunker, I was busted cruft
I was the swellest of the swells in the roughest rough
Now I'm bound to the bend of your bone-white wrist
Shun the pill-popper, love the pharmacist

You get na na nothing, I found out that I'm a chump
And you were cold, cold-hearted to me
You got la la lucky that I told you what I did
And you're so, so sorry, but not the way you want
You're getting na na na na na na nothing from me
Na na nothing from me

You get na na nothing, I found out that I'm a chump
And you were cold, cold-hearted to me
You got la la lucky that I told you what I did
And you're so, so sorry, but not the way you want
You're getting na na na na na na nothing

You get na na nothing, I found out I was a chump
And you were cold, cold-hearted to me
You got la la lucky that I told you what I did
And you're so, so sorry, but not the way you want
You're getting na na na na na na nothing
Na na na na na na nothing from me
Na na nothing from me
