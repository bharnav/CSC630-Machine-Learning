I was alone
Skipping along
Killing the song
Making it long gone

I was alone
Breaking it off
Making it soft
Trudging the road home

Sear it like a vegetable
Scarf it like a vegetable
Nosh it like a vegetable

Dip it like a vegetable
Fry it like a vegetable
Boil it like a vegetable

I was a chump
Making the jump
Chilling the bump
Driving the speedboat

I was a chump
Swallow a lump
Kid I smote
Picking an eighth note

Steam it like a vegetable
Green like a vegetable
Braise it like a vegetable

Cook it like a vegetable
Bake it like a vegetable
Burn it like a vegetable

Out of the black, skipping the track
Taking it back, I make a bid for the middle
Rough wrought like a cosmonaut
I got shunned for the refund
You're restless in your best dress
I'm depressed at your swank address
Live in the machinery
Salt sea of the hex you be
Hell-bound, surround the compound
Make the words swell in a villanelle
Ah, well, you got the dweller, dispeller
Tremble when you disassemble
Scrawl a rough map on the foolscap
Mr. Weinstein, drinking the strychnine
That's why I compel you to swim the wishing well

Steam it like a vegetable
Green like a vegetable
Burn it like a vegetable

Dirty like a vegetable
Make it like a vegetable
Fix it like a vegetable

Burn it like a vegetable
Dip it like a vegetable
Nosh it like a vegetable

That's right
