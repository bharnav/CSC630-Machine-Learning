The princess rang the apostate on the courtesy phone
I saw your reflection in the bell of my horn
I intro'd with the denouement and segued to a pause
I read out the manual to wild applause

Oh, if you won't let go, have at it
Oh, if I can't say no, have at it

I rode through the blank lands, all the people I must know
And I have drank three credit cards and gone through all my notes
All the blood ran to my belly, the customers swooned
I took the recommended dosage, called in the dragoons

Oh, if your crow must crow, have at it
Oh, if I can't say no, have at it
