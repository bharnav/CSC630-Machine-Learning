Spoken:
Shall we do it again?

Don't give me your claptrap
Don't give me your stinking words
You make me feel like a fat sap
Hapless in a dirty shirt

But I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man
Yeah, I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man

Days are darker now
The moon sleeps in the woods
Dogs that wander, pondering
Mysteries in the blood

But I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man
Yeah, I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man

Oisín
Oh, you made a brave mistake
Shame
Living in a failed state

Dig deeper we must now
Strain and drang, resist the pull
Your snubbed fire is worthless
I got a dark hole to fill

But I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man
Yeah, I'm a rational man, a rational man, a rational man

Oisín
Oh, you made a brave mistake
Shame
Living in a failed state

Action
Oh, it was farcical
Drained
Living on Popsicles

Don't shoot, Donna
Don't, don't shoot, Donna
Donna, don't shoot
Donna, don't, don't
Don't shoot, Donna
Don't, don't shoot, Donna
Donna, don't shoot
Donna, don't, don't
Don't shoot, Donna
Don't, don't shoot, Donna
Donna, don't shoot
Donna, don't, don't
Don't shoot, Donna
Don't, don't shoot, Donna
Donna, don't shoot
Donna, don't, don't
