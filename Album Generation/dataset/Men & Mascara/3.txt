Sunday dress hangin' on the bedroom door;
Empty bottle of wine on the hardwood floor
Last night, he said she was the one:
Oh, but men an' mascara always run

Did I give my love too soon or wait too long?
Did I take it a little too easy, or put it on too strong?
She was lookin' for love; he was lookin' for fun
Yeah, men an' mascara always run

She ain't gettin' any younger:
It wasn't s'posed to be this way
Starin' in the mirror
With little black rivers runnin' down her face

Tomorrow's gonna be a brand new day:
She'll wake up in the mornin' an' wash it all away
Last night, he said she was the one:
Oh, but men an' mascara, they always run
Yeah, men an' mascara always run
