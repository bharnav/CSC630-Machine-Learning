What I need is medication
In the form of a vacation
What I need is skies of blue

What I need is a perspective
One that's healthy but objective
What I need is a point of view
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

What I need is bread and water
And a father for our daughter
What I need is someone new
What I want is you

Everyone says, move on
That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you
(Only you)

What I need is loss of memory
To forget when you were with me
What I need is to admit we're through

What I want, what I need
Oh, what I want is you (only you)
What I want is you

(Only you)

All I want
Is you
