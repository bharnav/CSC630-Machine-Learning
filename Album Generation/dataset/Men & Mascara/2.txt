We met down at the floating dock
I snuck out, scared, I didn't want to get caught
We were nervous, mmmm, but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
There in his arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight
He saw my tan lines

And everytime my feet are danling in the water
I can't help but think about him
Lying there with his wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing
But we didn't care
That foating dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for pillow and just like that
He kissed me like he meant forever
And we were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, he said, he'd better go
He left his t-shirt for me to hold, a memory
A souvenir I could keep
So I stayed and watched the sunrise
Like it was waking up my life to what love was
I could still see us

And everytime my feet are danling in the water
I can't help but think about him
Lying there with his wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing
But we didn't care
That floating dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for pillow and just like that
He kissed me like he meant forever
And we were too damn young to know any better

Everytime my feet are danling in the water
I can't help but think about him
Lying there with his wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing
But we didn't care
That floating dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for pillow and just like that
He kissed me like he meant forever
And we were too damn young to know any better
We were too damn young to know any better
