I could go on out tonight and do anything I want
I can find someone to hold me
But I've got my reasons, but reasons I don't

I know you're gone, I just can't move on
Cause your memory is chained to my mind
That ain't a crime

I know I should forget you
That you're no good for me
But that doesn't mean I don't want you
And my broken heart and my broken dreams

I know you're gone, I just can't move on
Cause your memory is chained to my mind
That ain't a crime

I've tried and I've tried
I've cried and I've cried over you
Over you

I know you're gone, I just can't move on
Cause your memory is chained to my mind
It's there all the time
And that ain't a crime
