Mama don't cry, don't you worry about me
I'm a little bit scared but I'm gonna be all right
I've got the letter that you gave me folded in my pocket
I've gotta feeling like I need to read it maybe one more time
And let it ease my mind

It's a wide, wide world looking out this window
Thirty thousand feet above the ground I grew up on
Just a small town girl out here chasing rainbows
Doing what I can to stand up on my own
You taught me well, you raised me right
So Mama don't cry

I remember standing at the end of the driveway
Looking down that highway wondering how far it goes
And I can feel your hand resting on my shoulder
Hear you saying, baby, don't forget when you're grown
That road will always lead you home

It's a wide, wide world looking out this window
Thirty thousand feet above the ground I grew up on
Just a small town girl out here chasing rainbows
Doing what I can to stand up on my own
You taught me well, you raised me right
So Mama don't cry

It's a wide, wide world looking out this window
Thirty thousand feet above the ground I grew up on
Just a small town girl out here chasing rainbows
Doing what I can to stand up on my own
You taught me well, you raised me right
So Mama don't cry
