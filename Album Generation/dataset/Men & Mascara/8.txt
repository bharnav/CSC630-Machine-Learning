How long did it take to find this letter
I know it wasn't right when you got home
Was it about the time you started getting hungry
And looked to see what I left on the stove
Did it ever cross your mind to even worry
Or wonder where I am, is everything alright
No, that's why I left it on your pillow
Cause that's the only time I cross your mind

I refuse to be with you and be forgotten
So this afternoon I thought
Why not just go
After all I'm already lonely
I might as well be lonely alone

Maybe I've become a different woman
Or maybe you've became a different man
You wonder why I'm doing what I'm doing
Well, I'm not expecting you to understand
Cause you had no idea this was coming
How could you when I've always just been there
But you just go on taking me for granted
And for the first time in my life I don't care

I refuse to be with you and be forgotten
So this afternoon I thought
Why not just go
After all I'm already lonely
I might as well be lonely alone

After all I'm already lonely
I might as well be lonely alone
