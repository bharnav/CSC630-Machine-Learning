You know I almost didn't answer
But I just had to see
If you were really still with her
Cause this won't work until you're are free

I won't step on a bridge that's burning
I won't dare to cross that line
Don't get me wrong, it's not you
It's just something I can't do
I won't step on a bridge that's burning

Must be another lonely night
No, I won't let you stop by
You can't convince me to give in
Don't even ask me that again

I won't step on a bridge that's burning
I won't dare to cross that line
Don't get me wrong, it's not you
It's just something I can't do

I won't step on a bridge that's burning

Believe me this ain't no fun
Waking up with just the sun
Though when you're still with someone

I won't step on a bridge that's burning
And I won't dare to cross that line
Don't get me wrong, it's not you
It's just something I can't do
I won't step on a bridge that's burning

Don't get me wrong, it's not you
It's just something I can't do
I won't step on a bridge that's burning

You know I almost didn't answer
But I just had to see
