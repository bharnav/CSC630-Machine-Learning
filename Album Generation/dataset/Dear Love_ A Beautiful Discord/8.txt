[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss

[Verse 1: Jeremy DePoyster]
I'm looking to put a bullet
Into the tile floor, into the tile
I'm looking to put a bullet
Into the tile floor
It's obvious

[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
All I ever do is wish
Things were different
This envy is destroying me
And it is obvious, it's obvious, it's obvious
It's obvious, it's obvious, it's obvious
It's obvious, it's obvious, it's obvious

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Mark this
Mark this
Mark this
Mark this

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
I want to say something:
We were blessed
But now I wet my lips
And wait for them to dry
Wait for them to dry

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
The lust of the dress
The thought of her lips
Reverent smile
These letters I've wrote
Are shackled to my chest
Shackled to my chest
These letters I've wrote
Are shackled to my chest
Shackled to my chest
Shackled to my chest

[Bridge: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Her tantalization
She is misconception

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
Good evening, good evening, good evening, miss
