[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Hold diamonds to the sun
Sparkling misconception
Misconception

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Statement:
"We're the ones that ain't afraid to die"
Ashes, ashes

[Verse 2: Jeremy DePoyster]
After this battle
We'll laugh at the thought of innocence
"Remorse!" I scream for

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Pride roses platinum gold rubies
Pride roses platinum gold rubies
A transparent portrait
A transparent portrait

[Verse 4: Mike Hranica]
The grave widens and the masses are
Mindlessly marching to the necropolis
There is no mystery here
There is no mystery here

[Verse 5: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Nothing to grasp but adjacent bodies
(We can't let this come between us)
The cessation movement is synchronized
(We can't let this come between us)
Emotional poorness cannot be hidden by ivory

[Verse 6: Mike Hranica]
Here I lie myself down
I surrender
At what I've done
I'm ashamed on this raised platform

[Verse 7: Mike Hranica]
I compose the memoir of unworthiness
Drunken with the spirits of Godlessness
Spirits of doom
Devil jaws on your throat
Devil jaws on your throat

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Onward period die
Onward period die
Onward period die
Onward period die

[Outro: Mike Hranica]
Emeralds hold no hope
Emeralds hold no hope
(Hope, yeah)
