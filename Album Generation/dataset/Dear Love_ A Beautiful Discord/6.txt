[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Be gone with you, you articles of nothingness
I don't know what I have to do to prove myself
This audience is stern
Grey is what has risen from the pits
Choose a new medicine to control it

[Verse 2: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
You thought you had me fooled
The grey, is what has risen from the pits
You thought you had me fooled
The grey, is what has risen from the pits

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
My lady, let us waltz
We can ignore the firearms
Guns manufactured by fear

[Verse 4: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
And I will never be forgotten
I will never forget you
And I will never forget you
I will never forget you
I will never forget you

[Verse 5: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
With dead tongues and lonely hearts
We cough the poison out
And yet, I sing a song of hope

[Verse 6: Jeremy DePoyster & Mike Hranica]
With dead tongues and lonely hearts
We cough the poison out
And yet, I sing a song of hope

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Your final days approach

[Verse 7: Mike Hranica]
This will be our final confrontation
This will be our last
This will be our last
