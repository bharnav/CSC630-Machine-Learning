[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
This cold floor we know too well
We know too well
We know too well
Hearts poisoned with pride
Black blood dotting our warmth
Ending our contentment
This place is a contorted altar
A contorted altar

[Bridge: Jeremy DePoyster]
I must seek strength from somewhere
For I've reduced myself to nothing

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
We've been here
One thousand times
Cold idle hands
Floor-welcomed knees, knees
Hello autumn, I'd die for your companionship
Doubtless I stand, laying my heart into the hands of eternity
Revive me doctrines (revive me doctrines)

[Interlude: Jeremy DePoyster]
Await the day, when all our blood will wash away
Await the day, when all our blood will wash away

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
The world's balance I'm too familiar with
Selfishness outweighs generosity

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Blindness produced
By your own hands affront your face
Lips bleeding with guilt
Frightful little fiends
Frightful little fiends

[Verse 4: Mike Hranica]
If these words mean nothing
Then where is the conclusion?
Lyricism aside, Christ is the deduction
