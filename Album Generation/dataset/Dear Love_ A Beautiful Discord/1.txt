[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Here lies my pride, don't come back
Here lies my pride, just die
Here lies my pride, don't come back
Here lies my pride, just die
Don't come back

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Mass chaos is our weapon of unification
Tied are you by his scarlet thread
Eternal merciless lies

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Death harmonizes with your walk
Death harmonizes with your walk
Oh how I yearn to dismiss these memories
Oh how I yearn to dismiss these memories
Oh how I yearn to dismiss these memories
Oh how I yearn to dismiss regret
