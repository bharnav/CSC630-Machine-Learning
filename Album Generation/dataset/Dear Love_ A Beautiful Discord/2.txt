[Intro: Mike Hranica]
Welcome to the war
Welcome to the war
A martyr's challenge

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
Chainsaw brutality tornado strength
Chainsaw brutality tornado strength
Chainsaw brutality tornado strength
Chainsaw brutality tornado strength

[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
King of the diamond, king of the grave
King of the diamond, king of the grave
Lawlessness stains black on whitewashed tombs
We're too strong to compromise
Don't be ashamed of your faith

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Dear Lord, deliver me
From hypocrisy, and surcease
The scarlet desire
The scarlet desire

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
He wears a slick jacket and gold watch
Her dishonesty has scarred hands
Has scarred hands
He wears a slick jacket, he wears a slick jacket
