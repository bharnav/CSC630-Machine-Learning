[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
Now that it's here, it's too late
The whole wide world
Is fearing the wrong things

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Falling down a cold staircase
Falling down a cold staircase

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
And persistently I darken my shadow
To cover up regret but the train tracks
Still lie straight, lie straight
It'll be the end of deception
Vertical to the horizon
Vertical to the horizon
It'll be the end of deception
It'll be the end of deception

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
This is the gun to the manipulation
This is the gun to the manipulation

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Bring the end, bring the end, ow!
Bring the end, bring the end
Bring the end, bring the end, ow!
Bring the end, bring the end

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica]
Architecture is falling, yeah!
Denial, a repetitive trait
Repetition. The walls
Betrayal, a repetitive trait

[Verse 4: Jeremy DePoyster]
I thought this died so long ago
But reoccurring shame eats at me
It eats at me
I thought this died so long ago
This died so, so long ago
This reoccurring shame eats at me
She eats at me
She walked away
I'm hoping for forgiveness
Just one more time
I'm slurring, slurring
A compilation of words
A compilation of words
I plea for your forgiveness from you
Plea for your forgiveness, one more time
This one more time
This reoccurring shame
Slurring all your words
I plea for this, I plea for this
One more time
I'm asking for your forgiveness, God
Lay her to rest, lay her to rest
