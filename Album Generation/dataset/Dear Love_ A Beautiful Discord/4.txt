[Verse 1: Mike Hranica]
You were nothing but an obstacle in my pathway
Tripping me with my own trust
You were nothing but an obstacle in my pathway
Tripping me with my own trust

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
Without your hood of falsification
Your beauty is found to be nothing
Nothing to you but true revulsion
Nothing to you but true revulsion
And that's the only true thing about you

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
(The moon and the stars still retain these eyes)
This melody of my heart points to the composer of my regret
(The moon and the stars still retain these eyes)
Look north, the sun is still gleaming
You're falling now as I move forward
Fueled by the hope you couldn't take from me
And scarred by knowledge of painful winters

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
Christ still stands perfect in my mind
Christ still stands perfect in my heart
Christ still stands perfect in my mind
Christ still stands perfect in my heart
Jesus is the beautiful structure of love

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
Repent me to
Hope and love
Hope and love
Hope and love
Hope and love

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Beware nihilists, beware
You shall fall by the sword
Oh God, bringeth the day of judgement
Bringeth the day of judgement
You shall fall
By the sword
By the sword
