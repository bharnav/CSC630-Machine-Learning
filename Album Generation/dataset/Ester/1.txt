7 o'clock and my heart beat stops, my candy girl
Worn out cry, can she shout and still be heard
7 o'clock and my heart beat stops, my candy girl
Worn out cry, can she shout and still be heard
And I'm still here, my candy girl
Praying endless, praying endless
Praying endless, praying endless time
11 o'clock and my heart beat stops, my candy girl
Lose yourself right, your dying wouldn't end the stares
11 o'clock, I hope she's coming out of church
We'll take our time
And I'm still here, my candy girl
Praying endless, praying endless
Praying endless, praying endless time
My candy girl
My candy girl
My candy girl
