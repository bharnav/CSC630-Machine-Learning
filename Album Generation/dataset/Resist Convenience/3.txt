I am as old as my tongue
I am much older than my teeth
Been neighbors for years but nevertheless
Not a word was shared
Just eyes through the blinds
Venetian. Odds. Evens
The flop read:
"Good thing you bet the farm
Good thing you bet it all!
Those bastards are always bluffing blind
No matter what's dealt, drawn, or thrown down."
Where do all thoughts go
To lay themselves down for good?
Perhaps they will rot with the body
Or float up to the sky by the tail of the soul
Autopilot, take 'em there by surprise!

Go out in a blaze, a blaze of glory
Leave without a trace
Leave without a flaw
We'll catch up with those thoughts
When we catch up with ourselves
As we catch up with yourselves
Catching up with each other
Catching up with each other!
Well blow me down
Blow me back down
Blow me back down to Earth
As fast as half-way between go and stop
As fast as half-way between go and stop!

Throw your mama
From the train
Or my mom will shoot
