Excellency
By the time you read this
I'll be gone
Long gone
Gone long
No longer adorned in robes
Nor the finest of armor
Wayward grows a light
Exponentially beseeching me
Divergent boundaries suck the ocean in
Spit it out!
Spit it back at my face!
Testify/alibi
Mother Nature versus Father Nurture

Oh monarch, throw your towel in!
These minstrels must play their flutes at will
Hurry up, protect your people
Incompetent fool!
So overwhelmed with publicity
Lacked patriotic integrity
But what's more ridiculous-
Talking eggs breaking or the horses that are trying to fix them?

Dug as ditches and trenches. Bookends on benches
The life of the party
Hog-tie Park Ave, Monopoly
He claimed he knew Cinderella
She was a whore let me tell ya' (a whore?)
Insider trading with the earth
Chitter and chatter and haggle and hustle for all it's worth
It's either human flesh or soil replenished from each other
I can't stop recycling self
I can't stop recycling self
Come one! Dissemble the conscience
Long gone. Gone long
