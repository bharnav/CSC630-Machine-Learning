Aquatic fortitude!
Unscathed and witless
Below the hopes and fears of robotic fixtures
Proposed to the fluent lovers
Hopeless romantics enthralled in semantics
They'll flee the highlands
They'll flee their skin
Quick, under the cover of darkness!
Déjà vu and amnesia simultaneously

Haven't I been here before?
Did  I just ask myself that question?
Illustrious madmen knitting quilts for comforters
Well isn't it true that we all need outlets to grow?
It's everything that it's not. Knots everywhere
There's contradictions in all of us
In everything
Oh, luxuries maim lunatics
Auction/action
Ton, admire the implosions
We're burning ourselves alive
Screaming "Peace out!" at the ocean
Although the flames will engulf the laughter
Best bob while limbless and out of air supply

Anything that's worth doing is worth doing right
"Brevity is the brother of brilliance"
The screw that holds it all together in place, in time
Solo duets. Audiences fainted
Live dying to be someone else
Die living to be yourself

Possessions are lucrative at best
Investments buy some time
Exceptions forth, everything cast aside
Buy/sell Buy/sell
Live dying to be someone else
Die living to be yourself
Bovine divine!
