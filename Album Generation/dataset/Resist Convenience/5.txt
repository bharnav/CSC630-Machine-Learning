This place, more orange nowadays
The ashen badlands redeem your face
Through magnified glass, still draws me in
Those big eyes draw me in
Distrophy. Stale again. Entropy:
Care so much for Kamikaze copilots who where helmets

Encapsulated but commingling
Privatized public apologies that are bought an sold
Packaged and stored in attics for addicts
Cold hands strumming the mile-high regrets. Perplexed?
Perhaps! Impossible to postpone
Plights of professional penmanship
Unopinionated routines
Worn knees in a crawling season
Easy to imitate the oaks:
Shave a mountain man's beard
Insidious sight-seers
Holding candles to those clutching torches
Torture. How will they put out the flames?

Once proud to be the anxious naive marionette
But in time, became the shrewd, arthritic puppeteer
Compare and contrast
Were you better off then, as you alienated your limbs?
Alienated your purpose to flail?
