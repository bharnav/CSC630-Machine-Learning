Woe? Blame it on the rain
Woah! Blame it on the name
Game. Size-up,suit up self-esteem
Tie-down, dress-down, fight in the dog-days
Wolf-nights
Introspections and longing are a feverish solitaire
In fact, it's a lot like masturbation
When you win you beat yourself
See-saw, hear/say
Say-saw, heresy
Stimulus, responsive
Stimuli responded

Let's pick a definition!
Undue sense of ones own arrogance
Or a family of lions
Yeah, I'm afraid
I don't want to
Yeah, I'm afraid
I don't want to die
Not now. Not ever
It's a harsh reality, right?
It's the most offensive truth
Those songs you'll hear when you're deaf
What will they sound like when there's no sound at all?
Footsteps you see in the dark
Footsteps you see...

Cat and mouse is a game of subterfuge
The mind scratches itself to pieces
Spat-up. Chew it down or leave the pieces to dry in the sun
In summation, fright is nothing more than a collection
Of preemptive suicides
Do what you do to be alive
It's a massacre outside that hole
Wandering three-blind Mrs. Butcher
Suspense!
"It's that cat, Doc, he scares me to death,"
Confesses the mouse to the shrink
