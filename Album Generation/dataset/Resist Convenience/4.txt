In hind sight
For sore eyes on the prize fighter
Pilot, gunner, navigator in the sky
The mountain's lukewarm, metaphorically speaking
Speaking of metaphors...
The simile is a front-runner
The simile lacks a blueprint
With an enchanting proposal
One foot led the other, congruent

To think your only god would flaunt you!
To think your only god would fight you!
Raise a frail fist at the creator
Scream "I want to meet my maker!"

Persistently the ground
Tends to make way for you
Exchange all those hats for a hairline
Define the cycles of existence
To think and act just as we do
We're blasphemous separatists
De-railing the trains of thoughts

To think your only god would fight you
To think your only god would...
Reparations for misopportunities
Pay some respect: the transitional currency. Reimbursed
To think your only god would fight you (Sleeping soundly)
Should have soaked it all in
Absorbed the pouring rains past
Let sheets blanket the suits so the dust can settle in sorrow
Last showing
