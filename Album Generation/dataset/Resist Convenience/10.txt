Hand-fed triumph. Spoils
Battles which you can't recall fighting in
This fancies your fit
You settled down for a long winter's nap;
Simply grown tired of cheap thrills
But it's been years upon years
Of craving simplicities
Oh, the knavery/depravity!
Sentences become paragraphs
Become novels on cold fronts, warm backs
And this town needs an enema
I'll pass the time with a rhythm and a rhyme
That rhyme need a good once-over
But I'm no joker

I've seen people explode. Pieces!
You can't kill what's already dead
Subconscious white noise mauls prose
Odd, superfluous sounds
This is a physical challenge
Well beyond a double-dare
Commit to a legacy
On with all the fireworks and the parades
God-willing a momentum of silence

Silence!
It's what we'll all eventually have in common
