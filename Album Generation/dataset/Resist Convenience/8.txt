Breathe me in like air, innocent
My fingers bleed. I've been writing too much
Preventing these words from searing my battered throat
And I can't even scream so I sketch your face
Each line was a cry, each curve bore blindness
Prevent my arms from failing

Limitless expressions
To your face I can't conform
But give hands the chance voice wouldn't have
It was the first time that our words kissed
But our lips, they didn't even touch
No skin on skin
The first time in my life that I existed
And each time that we breathed, we were reborn
We're reborn each time we
Each time we breathe
Each time we breathe

These nights were gaining strength
Yet losing ground. A short-lived grace
Your tongue!
I taste your ways with a pen in my hand
In my hand, in my hand
I taste your ways

Well in a matter of time
My life went from day to night
Incriminating textures
Where on Earth did you go?
What happened to us?
With this retouching paint
I will use a brush, apply it to your canvas
This was once a beautiful painting

Each lasting memory
Will control each word that I write
And I used to think that my hands could dance
I only needed to hold
To hold myself up
You were never a crutch as you tore me away
Like this fringed papers' edge
You were never a crutch

Each lasting memory controls each word I write
I used to think that my hands could dance...
But now I see my hand's been broken for quite some time
These memories impale the senses to this day
I'm broken
