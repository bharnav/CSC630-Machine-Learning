In one eye and out the other
The heiress turned historian
Reach-out!
How did she handle herself/position herself
While writing this?
Book-signing autobiography
Prize-winning. Best-seller
Tie her hands to your heart
She bore no breath
She bore no cavity
Relinquish the pageantry
Little girl all grown up
All is said and done
Verity was supposed to be "the dirt"
All is fair in love and lies

Little girl
Growing gray
Silent
Silent and blind
Silent and blind
