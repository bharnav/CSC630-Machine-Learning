My baby cried all night long
Yeah my baby cried all night long
He saw me dancin' with a boy named Joe
A-huggin' and a-kissin' with the lamps down low
And my baby cried all night long

Yeah my baby cried all night long
Yeah my baby cried all night long
He saw me a-messin' with a boy named Lou
And baby can't do what Lou can do
And my baby cried all night long

Last night I cried all night long
Yeah last night I cried all night long
I saw my baby out on the town
Doin' all the things I done
And Lord it brought me down
And you can bet I cried all night long
Yeah last night I cried all night long
