Bet you never met yourself a little girl like me
Every single day it gets easier to believe
When I come at you your bones just fall apart
Give me your hand, let's make a new start

You never say
Just who you are
Let yourself go, my little girl
And you'll go far

Everything about you screams, I wanna disappear
But something keeps you around and that's why you're here
I'm not a stupid girl, I'm not your enemy
Get yourself together and then set yourself free
