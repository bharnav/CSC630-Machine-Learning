You're a lot like me
And I think that you should tell her
That the only difference between us is fear

And if you are like me
Then I think you should remember
If you ever wanna get yourself outta here

Now all you think
You hide are open secrets
And the pendulum swings back and forth, my dear

Don't believe
Everything you hear
Gather all you cherish
And keep it quite near

I can be your friend
Or I just just go and break you
And I think you'd better make what you want clear

'Cause I'm not quite sure
How long it's gonna take you
If you really wanna get yourself outta here?
