Why are you up and leavin'
If you really want to say?
I can't give much more meaning
To what you do anyway

Stop begging your bosses
Stop begging your bliss
Stop begging everything just 'cause
You want more than this

This can't keep on going
What are we gonna do
I stayed too late last night
And so did you

It's the same old story
Oh, time and again
But what makes it so boring
Is you know how it ends
