It sets me off to see the people
Always so easy to play
I'd rather keep my head down
Carry out the rest of my day
Somethin' 'bout the way that
People love their harm
I've got an eye for trouble
And that's what keeps me up in arms
You've got this thing about you
That keeps me on the edge of my seat
'Cause every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

It bothers me to notice
But it sure seems you like that game
Surprises me every time
But really it's just the same
You handle everything and everyone
With that velvet glove
But when you take it off
I can see your skin is not enough
There's something there about you
Like an animal ready to feed
And every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Speak a little softer now
Or maybe just use your eyes
Pull her in around you
Using love as your disguise
There's danger in everything
You say and do
I guess we're not so different
And that's what makes me blue
The funny thing about it is
I know you got what I need
When every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Yeah every time you smile I can tell
