Well, you're not gonna break my heart
'Cause my heart ain't what I'm givin' to you
And I'm not gonna beg for yours
'Cause that's not what I am here to do

You're not faithful but you're true
And I don't know what to do
'Cause it never bothers me
When you're where you need to be
Oh no

I mean what do I expect
To put a rope around your neck
And just declare you property
Well babe, you know it isn't me
Oh no

And I can't just estimate
When it's gonna be too late
You do what you wanna do
And I'll just do the same thing too
Oh yes

And if we go our separate ways
I won't say we was too late
'Cause we never were on time
And babe, you never weren't mine
Oh no
