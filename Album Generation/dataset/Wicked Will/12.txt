If I'm ever on your mind
It's a slow disease
Corrosive and behind
Closed doors you're on your knees

When you're the worst there is
There's nothing to fear
That's why you and I are here

Have you ever been afraid
Of all that couldn't be?
Just spending all your time
Pretending that you're free

I can offer some reprieve
But it won't cure your ill
So weigh out the little time
That you have before the kill
