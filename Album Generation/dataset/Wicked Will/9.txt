There was a time
When I would have jumped at
Anything you said

But you took too long
To pay attention
Now that dog is dead

Too late, too late
Old as the moon and stars
Too late, too late
Stay right where you are

You're the pebble in my shoe
I tell ya
You won't just let me be

So I just hide
And watch your face
While you're lookin' for me
