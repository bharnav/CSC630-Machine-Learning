I got you in mind
But he's watchin' with his eye on me
Here tonight
Is the only place I want to be

I see how you are
And I'm pretty sure you've got what I need
Boy, don't bring me down

Do you feel the same?
I gotta know right now or else I
Start getting the shakes
Wonderin' what it is I can do try

To get you alone
And see what you and I can do tonight
Oh, don't bring me down

Are you bad like me
Or are you too good to follow me now
To be in your arms
Is the only thing keepin' me around

So don't be afraid
'Cause with me the secret's safe and it's sound
No, don't bring me down
