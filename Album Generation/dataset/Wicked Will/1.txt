I can't believe you keep comin' 'round
When it's so clear I just bring you down
You're all alone 'cause you choose to be
Please, don't pretend it's to do with me

You wanna be out
Away from your noose
You wanna be free and
You wanna be loose

You haven't the backbone
To handle the truth
I'm telling you, girl
You're just an excuse

I wonder what it's like to be you
Every day barely getting through
Mother's advice hanging by a thread
The world out here ain't what's in your head

You gather your lies
You make a great wall
You teeter atop it
And try not to fall

I tried to help you
But still you refuse
You've done it now girl
You're just an excuse, now

You wanna be out
Away from your noose
You wanna be free and
You wanna be loose

I wish there was something
I could do for you
Unfortunately
You're just an excuse
