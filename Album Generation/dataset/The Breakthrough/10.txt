[Verse 1]
Now no matter what I do
I want you to pull me through
Cause I need you
Every day and every night
You make wonders in my life
That’s why I call on you

[Chorus]
This is true
I can’t get enough of you
This is true
I can’t get enough of you

[Verse 2]
You bring joy instead of pain
Bring me flowers after rain
You bring me lovely days
I know I can count on you
To turn my grey skies blue
That’s why I love you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I love the way you tell me the truth about me
It’s the only thing that can set me free
You love me more than I love myself
No one can give me this confidence

[Verse 3]
Please don’t ever leave my side
I can’t live without you
I’ve already tried
Don’t think that I can make it and I’m not prepared to take it
If you’re not with me
I can’t make it through the storm
I need your love to keep me warm
It’s what makes me strong

[Chorus] + [Bridge]
