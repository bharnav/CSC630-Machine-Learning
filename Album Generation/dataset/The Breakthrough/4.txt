[Intro]
Hey yeah, oooh
La la la oh
Come on (Clap, clap, clap)

[Verse 1]
If you've been stressin', you've been hurtin'
(It's gon' be alright)
I know times get so hard that you could cry
(But not tonight)
I know just what you came for
Get up, up on the dance floor
Or wherever you are
While the DJ's breaking it down

[Hook]
Ain't no telling what we're gon' do
But I'm gonna breakthrough and take you
And take you where it feels so good

Ain't no telling what we're gon' do
But I'm gonna breakthrough and take you
And take you where it feels so good

[Verse 2]
All I wanna do
Is get in touch with you
To be real, how you feel
Everybody goes through things sometimes
So let your mind just be free
Anything you wanna be, be
But whatever you do
Let this music get to you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We gon' tear it up all night
(We gon' tear it up)
Dance until the morning light
(Morning light)
It's something that's gon' soothe your mind
(It's gonna soothe your mind and make you feel so good)
Baby let your body be
Anything you wanna be
Just let go and you will see

[Rap: Brook Lynn]
Check it out
It's time to breakthrough
MJ gon' take you there
Get your hands in the air and get you a three step
Lil' something for the clubs and it feels so hood
Got the whole world sayin' "How she still so good?"
It's a gift, God-given, I'm a ribbon in the sky
So fly, I'mma ride like the queen I am
Pay homage, mic check, one two one two
Pop bottles, get it crunk, that's what we came to do
Get your back off the wall cuz united we stand
Together we ball, everybody up on the floor
Like dun dun na (Come on ) dun dun na (Come on)
Dun dun na (Come on) Get your ass on the floor, let's go

[Hook] x2

Gonna breakthrough, gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough, gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough, gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough, gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough, gonna breakthrough
Gonna breakthrough
