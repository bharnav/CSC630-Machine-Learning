Baby can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh, oh, listen

[Verse 1]
Boy you had me fooled I can’t believe you
Cause you never done anything that I asked of you
Always talkin’ like I just can’t do right
Blamin’ me for everything and that just ain’t right

[Chorus 1: Mary J Blige]
(Cause I can’t do this alone, alone) I don’t know what to do, I’m tryna stay with you
(It’s not all about you)
(Boy I can’t do this alone, alone) You’re makin’ this harder, boy I’m bout to leave ya, cause I can’t do this alone
(Alone, alone, alone)

[Verse 2: Dave Young]
And I gave you everything I had, there, and I never said nothin’
Did everything for you, what did you do, nothing
Then you got the nerve to wanna run your mouth
Like I ain’t never held you down
Baby what did I do to deserve this?
Cause I put you on a shelf, girl I need help
Cause I can’t do this alone, baby

[Chorus 2]
(Cause I can’t do this alone, alone) I don’t know what to do, I’m tryna stay with you
(It’s not all about you) I can’t do it
(Girl I can’t do this alone, alone) You’re makin’ this harder, girl I’m about to leave ya, I can’t do this alone
(Alone, alone, alone)

[Bridge: MJB & Dave Young]
[Mary J Blige]
And I try to work this out
But boy you’re changing now
What do I do? I’m so confused baby
[Dave Young
And I try to work this out
But girl you’re changing now
What do I do? I’m so confused

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I don’t know what to do cause boy I’m so tired of you
Said I don’t know what to do, girl I’m so tired of you
Do what you gotta do, cause I can’t do this alone

[Chorus]
