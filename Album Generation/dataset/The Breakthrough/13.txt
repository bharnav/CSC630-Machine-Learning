Can I talk to you, baby?

[Verse 1]
When I was a little girl I didn’t have a father
Unless one leanin’ on you
When I was a baby I didn’t get a hug from daddy
That’s why I need a hug from you
Oh, it’s not easy and I thank you for putting up with me
When you don’t have a daddy’s love
(To say that you) To say that I’m your little girl
(Are his little girl} Oh, why didn’t you love me?
(And give you the love) I get love, yea
(You really deserve) And I believe I deserved it, and that’s why

[Chorus]
That’s why I need the father in you
That’s why I need the father in you
That’s why I need the father in you
That’s why I need the father in you

[Verse 2]
Oh things got bad, to the point where mommy couldn’t hold us down
And that’s when it hurt me so much to see her
(To see her cry) Oh don’t cry, mama don’t cry
(Each and every night) We’re gonna be alright, that’s what I used to say
(I say that’s some day) That I would try to take his place
(It was so hard) It was so hard tryna be a man, not [?] but that’s why I need a father

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Because we never had one at home
As a little girl
So I understand why daddy couldn’t be there
Cause it’s so obvious nobody taught him how to be a father either
And I’m not sayin’ this to reminisce on the past
I’m just sayin’ this to make you understand that I needed a father
And this is my problem, this is why I couldn’t keep no one
This is why I couldn’t stay alone, I was so scared alone
Every woman needs a man and I don’t think she understands
That she really needs a father, the father in you my brother
Boy, she really needed a father, the father in you
When your wife is speaking fellas, pay attention, yea, don’t ignore her
I really need the father in you
