[Verse 1]
Can’t you see, look at my face is glowin’
And it’s all because of you
Everything about ya, you see I need
And I thank God for sending you through

[Chorus]
(I found my everything)
See I found my everything in you
(I found my everything)
See I found everything and I trust in you
(I found my everything)

[Verse 2]
Ooh the way you kiss me is like a real man
I leave the prom when I look in your eyes baby, yea
And every night is like a highlight baby
And there’s no better keeper than you

[Bridge]
You’s the one who understands me
Needs to hold me, really feels me
You’re the one alone, you’re the one that I need
I know you’ll find me, step inside me
Won’t deny, you define me
Now my world feels so free

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I know just what I wanted
What I needed, where I’m goin’
I can see most clearly now
That I found you, you, you, you
I love it when you call me tender
Hold me tight, through the night
Seems like we met in heaven before this earth

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
This time is the greatest
That I’ve ever felt before
You’ve given me a reason to smile baby
Cause I never had a reason to smile before

[Chorus]
