[Intro: Jay Z]
Yes
It’s just beautiful music ladies and gentlemen
Turn the music up louder
I got a feelin’ in my soul
MJB, the voice
H-O, listen

[Verse 1]
I’m coming for ya, I ain’t wasting time
Because all night long, you've been on my mind
Go get ready baby, 'cause I’m on my way
You talk a real good one, but let’s see today

[Bridge]
I just wanna see what you’re made of (I just wanna see)
Can you handle me, are you really tough?
(Are you really that tough?)
Lovers come and go, so what you gonna go?
(What you gon' do, baby?)
Boy, this ain’t no joke, it’s time to show and prove
(Show me, show me)

[Chorus]
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), no you can’t babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), it’s too strong, babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me

[Verse 2]
Now that I gotcha, this is what I’m gon’ do
Boy I need your body to move like I move
Wrap your arms around me and don’t be shy
What you feel is a real woman, probably for the first time

[Bridge]
I just wanna see what you’re made of
(Can you show me, please)
Can you handle me, are you really tough?
(Can you handle me, baby?)
Lovers come and go, so what you gonna go?
(What are you gon' do, baby?)
Boy, this ain’t no joke, it’s time to show and prove
(Show me)

[Chorus]
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), no you can’t babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), it’s too strong, babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me

(Jay Z: That's that knock)

[Interlude]
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love
Ohh

(Jay Z: It's a beautiful thing)

[Chorus 2X]
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), no you can’t babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me
You can’t hide from love (hide from love), it’s too strong, babe
I’mma make you want, make you want my love
What you waitin’ on? Come to me


You can’t hide from love 'cause it’s comin’ to getcha
Oh yes it is!

You can't hide from love

[Outro: Jay Z + (Mary J. Blige)]
Yes
It’s just beautiful music ladies and gentlemen
That's that knock
Turn the music up loud
(You can't hide from love)
MJB, the voice
H-O
(You can't hide from love)
