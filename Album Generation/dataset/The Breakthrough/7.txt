[Verse 1]
I know I do some things that make you so confused
One minute I’m so in love and the next I can’t stand you
But if you may ask it’s just some things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess that I’ve been through

[Chorus]
All of this baggage with me
Don’t wanna make you pay for what
Somebody else has done to me
I don’t know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It’s what someone’s done to me
I don’t mean to hurt you

[Verse 2]
Heartache and pain, I just can’t do it again
So I look for the worst and brace myself for the hurt
But nobody has ever treated me this way
Please be patient with me cause I want you to stay

[Chorus] 2x

[Bridge]
This is no way to be livin’ my life
But I can’t get it out of my mind
You know I love you, yes I do
So don’t go and get [?]

[Verse 3]
Don’t be confused cause boy you know I really do love you
I want you to stay with me I never meant to hurt you baby
It won’t be easy getting’ rid of all this baggage, see
All, all this baggage, yea, yea

[Chorus] 3x
