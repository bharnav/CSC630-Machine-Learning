He resurfaced on the sidewalk of my block the other day
Yeah it's a fat check sorry charlie, honey, he's back from LA

So son you better turn around
Yeah christ is on his way across town
He was getting tired of hanging around
Yeah he's back jack smoking crack
Find him if you wanna get found

He's having supper with the upper management of a new regime
He's in a new jacket tax bracket sandals & a dark pair of jeans
He's got deductions right on down the line depedent claims on all of mankind
Have no fear he's right here drinkin' beer just trying to get down

He resurfaced on the sidewalk of my block the other day
Yeah it's a fat check sorry charlie, honey, he's back from the grave

You better turn your frown upside down
Christ is on his way across town
He was getting tired of hangin' around
Yea he's back jack shootin' smack find him if you wanna get found

Yeah he's back jack smokin' crack find him if you wanna get found
