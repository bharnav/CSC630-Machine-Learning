When i say she's a rapist that really isn't what i mean
It was all in my imagination
To be claimed so easily

She's not so well-rounded
She has horns you don't see she does whatever she wants
& i swear she wanted me

Loving force of willl
By deceiving me with skill
Somehow religion enters in
& god cracks through her moist skin
Twittles from her batton
Her hair suggests roller skating
Whispers through her perfume
Just above her parents room

She's not so well-rounded
She has horns you don't see she does whatever she wants
Oh i swear she wanted me

She knows what she wants
She wants what she knows
She wants this to mean nothing
& that sounds fair to me

She's not so well-rounded
She has horns you don't see she does whatever she wants
Oh i swear she wanted me

Oh i swear she wanted me
