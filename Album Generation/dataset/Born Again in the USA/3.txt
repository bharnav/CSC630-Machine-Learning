Now gather round and check this shit out
I found a simple way to keep us all devout
If there's one thing we can all agree about
Why not make it ten and banish any doubt

Let's start it rolling by coverin' number ten
Cut off the heat then there'll be a retreat
Amen

Now we come to number nine
Falls neatly next in line
Woah after number ten
Don't think we'll see them here again

Steal a look at number eight
What better way to procreate
Just take em out one at a time

You can't be serious
You look so good in that wedding dress
I need time to assess
I don't wanna acquiesce

Six has a spicy ring to it
A harder one to commit
I think this one will be a hit
Now that's what I call holy writ

We wanna take a closer look at number five
Could it apply if implied that they're not alive

Number four is such a pain
The Sabbath thing is so arcane
I don't wanna desecrate
My only day to sleep in late

Don't take his name in vain
From this one you want to abstain
We must set a clear mandate
The best damn way to conjugate

We're almost to the end
If Heaven you want to ascend
Just take 'em out one at a time

You shall have no other God but me
You shall have no other God but me
You shall have no other God but me...
