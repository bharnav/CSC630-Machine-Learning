You always write to ask
How come i don't write back
Well i could tell you
But then i'd have to write

A letter that would start
I finally found it in my heart
Not to forgive you

What do you want me to see
Ask you how was your day
Well i could tell you
But then i'd have to care

What you did last nite
Or the thousands since you crossed my sight
I wouldn't know you

Is there a need for me to hear
Every last detail
Of pleasanties
That accumulate like unwanted mail

If it's as bad as you say
Maybe this will make it go away
This is an answer
