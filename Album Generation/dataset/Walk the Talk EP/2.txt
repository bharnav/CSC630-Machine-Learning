Oh, love, here you come again
Seduction is a wicked game that you perfected
Oh, love, I don't want to fight
Like a boxer in the ring caught with both his hands tied
Though we know this is madness
Can't control, can't resist it

Oh, love, you can cash the check
In exchange for making Monday nights more suggestive
Hopeless under your devise
And I'm young enough, dumb enough, tough enough not to, not to think twice
Though we know this is madness
Can't control, can't resist it

Sleep with one eye open on a bed of broken glass
In the middle of the ocean, yeah I'd do that
Nothing lasts forever, but she makes me want to try
I'd crawl across the desert, yeah I'd do that
I'd do that, oh, love

Oh, love, here you come again
And when you go, who will pull me out the wreckage
Oh, love, I will track you down
And I'm young enough, dumb enough, tough enough not to, not to think twice
Though we know this is madness
Can't control, can't resist it

Sleep with one eye open on a bed of broken glass
In the middle of the ocean, yeah I'd do that
Nothing lasts forever, but she makes me want to try
I'd crawl across the desert, yeah I'd do that
I'd do that, oh, love

Oh, love, how you speak in tongues
And every answer just suggests another question
Like oh, love, if and when we end
Don't pretend that we can hang it up and be friends, no

I'd do that, oh, love
Yeah, I'd do that
I'd do that, oh, love
