[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playin' clean
Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball
