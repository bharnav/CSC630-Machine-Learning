[Chorus]
Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping

[Verse 1]
Milkman come in!
And you baker
Little old lady welcome
And you shoe maker

[Chorus 2][x3]
Come to this house!
Into this house

[Verse 2]
You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Lets get them all in!

[Chorus 2]
Come to this house
Be one of us
Come to this house!
Into this house

[Verse 3]
Ask along that man who's wearing a carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station
Go into that hospital
And bring nurses and patients
Everybody go home and fetch their relations!

[Chorus]
Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
Drinking all night never sleeping

[Verse 4]
We need more room
Build an extension
A colorful palace
Spare no expense now

[Chorus 2][x3]

[Outro]
Welcome
