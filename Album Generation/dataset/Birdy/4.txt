Smeared black ink
Your face is ashen and I'm barely listening
To last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering
What's buried underneath

Where I am
Where I am

I'll wear my badge
A vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest
Tells your new friends
I am a visitor here
I am not permanent
And the only thing
Keeping me dry is

Where I am (You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (A stranger with your door key explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am (And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

D.C. sleeps alone tonight
D.C. sleeps alone tonight

Where I am (You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (A stranger with your door key explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am (And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights (where I am)
And leave the autos swerving into the loneliest evening (where I am)
And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
