[Verse 1]
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

[Chorus 1]
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

[Verse 1]
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

[Chorus 1]
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

[Bridge 1]
And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes awhile
To settle down
My shivered bones
Wait til the panics out

[Chorus 2]
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
Company
It's quite a company
It's quiet company

[Bridge 2]
And I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would
But then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

[Verse 1]
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

[Outro]
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
