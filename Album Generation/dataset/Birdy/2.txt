[Verse 1]
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
Guess he kissed the girls and made them cry
Those hard faced Queens of misadventure
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
Fiery thrones of muted angels
Giving love but getting nothing back

[Chorus]
People help the people
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
And nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain, oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

[Verse 2]
God knows what is hiding in this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone or sinking

[Chorus]
People help the people
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain, oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned, all those good hearts away

[Bridge]
Nah Naaah nah nah naaaaahhhhhh oooouuuu
Nah Naaah nah nah naaaaahhhhhh oooouuuu

[Chorus]
People help the people
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain, oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away
