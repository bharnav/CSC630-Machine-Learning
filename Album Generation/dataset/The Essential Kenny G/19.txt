Summertime
And the living is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high

Your mama's rich
And your daddy's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't cry

One of these mornin's
You're gonna rise up singin'
You're gonna spread your wings
And fly to the sky

But 'til that moment
Nothin' can harm you
With your daddy and mummy
Standin' by

One of these mornin's
You're gonna rise up singin'
You're gonna spread your wings
And fly to the sky

But until then
Nothin' can harm you
With your daddy and mummy
Standin' by
With your mum and your dad
Standin' by
