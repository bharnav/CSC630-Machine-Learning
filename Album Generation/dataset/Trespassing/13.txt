[Verse 1]
All you ever think is "Gimme, gimme"
But you never give back (eh eh ay)
All I ever do is over think and drink
Until I attack (eh eh ay)

[Verse 2]
We know how to talk it into the ground
We know how to wear it out
If we ain't gonna say that
Gonna end up in a grave and baby

[Chorus]
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my

Hey

[Verse 3]
I fed you a fantasy
But you've been drunk on reality (eh eh ay)
All you want is to be wanted
As long as you get it out of me (eh eh ay)

[Verse 4]
We used to be a jungle, sticky and wild
It used to be we owned the night
All the stupid games we play
And all the shit that we've been saying
(Eh eh ey)

[Chorus]
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my

[Bridge]
Remember remember the first time we collided
We lost it we lost it
Yeah!

[Chorus]
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done
What's been said?
Oh my

[Outro]
Ohh my
How do we take back
