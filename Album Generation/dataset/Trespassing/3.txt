[Verse 1]
I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never!

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna let a minute get away
Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to

[Chorus]
You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never!

[Verse 3]
It's so hard to think this could fade away
But what goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence
And always live in the now

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to

[Chorus]
You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never!

[Bridge]
O, yeah, o, yeah

[Chorus]
You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never!
