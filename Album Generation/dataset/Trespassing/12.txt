[Verse 1]
Steel to my trembling lips
How did the night ever get like this?
One shot and the whiskey goes down, down, down
Bottom of the bottle hits
Waking up my mind as I throw a fit
The breaking is taking me down, down, down

[Chorus]
My heart's beating faster, I know what I'm after
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice, now it's time I realize
It's spinning back around now, on this road I'm crawling
Save me cause I'm falling, now I can't seem to breathe right
Cause I keep running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running from my heart

[Verse 2]
Round and around I'd go, addicted to the numb
Living in the cold
The higher, the lower the down, down, down
Sick of being tired and sick of waiting
For another kind of fix
The damage is damning me down, down, down

[Chorus]
My heart's beating faster, I know what I'm after
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice, now it's time I realize
It's spinning back around now, on this road I'm crawling
Save me cause I'm falling, now I can't seem to breathe right
Cause I keep running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running from my heart

[Bridge 1]
Woah ohh
I'm coming alive
Woah ohh
Wake up now and live oh!

[Bridge 2]
Woah ohhhhh
I'm coming alive
A life that's always been a dream
Wake up now and live oh!

[Chorus]
I've been standing here my whole life
My heart's beating faster, I know what I'm after
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice, now it's time I realize
It's spinning back around now, on this road I'm crawling
Save me cause I'm falling, now I can't seem to breathe right
Cause I keep running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running from my heart
