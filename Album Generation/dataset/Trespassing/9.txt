[Verse 1]
Strip away the flesh and bone
Look beyond the lies you've known
Everybody wants to talk about a freak
No one wants to dig that deep
Let me take you underneath

[Verse 2]
Baby, better watch your step
Never mind what's on the left
You're gonna see things you might not wanna see
It's still not that easy for me underneath

[Chorus]
A red river of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my black and blue sky
And underneath
Under my skin
Underneath, the depths of my sin
Look at me
Now do you see?

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my world of truth
I don't wanna hide any part of me from you
I'm standing here with no apologies
Such a beautiful release
You inside of me

[Chorus]
A red river of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my black and blue sky
And underneath
Under my skin
Underneath, the depths of my sin
Look at me
Now do you see?

[Break]
Underneath, underneath, underneath...
Underneath, Underneath

[Bridge]
Welcome to my world of truth

[Chorus]
A red river of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my black and blue sky
And underneath
Under my skin
Underneath, the depths of my sin
Look at me
Now do you see?

[Bridge]
Underneath, underneath, underneath
Look at me
Do you see? Yeahh
Look at me
Do you see me?

[Outro]
Welcome to my world of truth
I don't wanna hide any part of me from you
