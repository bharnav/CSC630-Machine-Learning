[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm having a meltdown
It feels like I'm losing control
They tell me I'm a danger to myself
Now the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk that walk
Like you don't give a fuck
You got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away

[Verse 2]
I'm swinging off of my hinges
I'm cocked and I'm ready to go
Go on and pack up your things
And the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk that walk
Like you don't give a fuck
You got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away

[Bridge]
Lose my mind!
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Gonna get out of this straight jacket, whoa
(Cuckoo)
Gonna get out of this straight jacket, whoa
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party 'til they take us away
