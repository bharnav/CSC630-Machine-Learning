[Verse 1]
Oh, nowhere left to go
Are we getting closer? Closer?
No, all we know is "No"
Nights are getting colder, colder

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, tears all fall the same
We all feel the rain
We can't change

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old, we're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell, but I don't think we will
They've branded us enough, "Outlaws of Love"

[Verse 2]
Scars make us who we are
Hearts and homes are broken, broken
Far, we could go so far
With our minds wide open, open

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, tears all fall the same
We all feel the rain
We can't change

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old, we're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell, but I don't think we will
They've branded us enough, "Outlaws of Love"

[Bridge]
Yeah yeah mm
Oo

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old, we're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell, but I don't think we will
They've branded us enough, "Outlaws of Love"

[Outro]
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
