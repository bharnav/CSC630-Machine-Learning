Seen you smiling, good as rain
To the scorched moss in the canyons and the burning leaves
The windmills with their sorrow and cold eye
Standing on a hill
With arms as still as dirt in a tomb
Crying "where is the wind?"
We hit the air like feathers blowing south
The places that we've come and been
Nearly brought us to our knees

I see your smile through the fire of the burning lives
Ashes whipping up like water down a drain
Hang your headâ€¦

Heard you laughing as real as tears
The sound comes falling off your lips and eyes
And shakes the ground
The scarecrows with their spiteful eyes
Their arms hung down to their sides
Wondering what of their great deed deserves such defeat
I've seen a killing in the cold wild snow
The tones that rang from off the blade
Were never heard beyond the deed

I see your smile through the fire of burning lives
Ashes whipping up like water down a drain
Hang your head on me

[With luck we'll haul her
This stinking swamp will surely drown
The ocean wind had gone through
The scars they're hidden from their head
It's hidden in the tree
They were swinging like a frightful runnin'
And the heart as naked as a Jaybird
It brought me on my knees...]

I see your smile through the fire of burning lives
Ashes whipping up like water down a drain
Hold your head high!
