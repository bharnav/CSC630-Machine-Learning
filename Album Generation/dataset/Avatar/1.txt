Whitethorn ordained
Applause from the masses
A trite execution
To placade and please
Obscured by the light
Suffuse for the sake
While they dance on the grave
Amassed and acclaimed

Bound for lands end
Destined for the gallows
Down the road most travelled
From sterling to death
The demons command
A life most desired
In envy they conspire
For vengeance is stealth

No need for sight
No need for mourning
No need for sound
No need for mourning

Wither and lithe, recognise the last defeat
Farewell to arms, shoulder no more, rest in peace
A judgement severe, dissolve and adhere, the grand retreat
Wither and lithe, simonize the bomb

The darkness devours
In it's own silent way
In fathoms of decay
Lesser the beast
The dray horse resigns
As they watch from a distance
Without face or resistance
Heed the command
Dragged to the steps
Put forth for example
Bludgeoned and battled
A Satyrs despair
A Slight of the hand
And all is forgotten
Thrush spirits left haunted
Tidings at bay

No need for sight
No need for mourning
No need for sound
No need for mourning

Wither and lithe, recognise the last defeat
Farewell to arms, shoulder no more, rest in peace
A judgement severe, dissolve and adhere, the grand retreat
Wither and lithe, simonize the bomb

Goodbye to the century
Farewell to amnesty
Christen the sons and daughter
Let it lie
Let it bleed
Goodbye to the century
Farewell to amnesty
Christen my sons and daughter
Let it lie
Let it bleed
Let it lie
Let it bleed
