[Verse 1]
If you say it is, then I guess it is
What you say it is, but I don't feel anything
Cause your pendulum is in swing again
Yeah, your pendulum hasn't swung back in

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a champagne year full of sober months
Through my maudlin days, through my dry moments

[Chorus]
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the northern, Northern Lights

[Bridge]
Gotta get young fast
Gotta get young quick
Gotta make this last
If it makes me sick

[Chorus - Extended]
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
I saw the northern, Northern Lights
