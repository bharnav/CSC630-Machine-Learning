[Verse 1]
I've had good times
With some bad guys
I've told whole lies
With a half smile
Held your bare bones
With my clothes on
I've thrown rocks
Then hid both my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what good it serves
Pouring my purse in the dirt

[Chorus]
But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more
But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

[Verse 2]
I've played dumb
When I knew better
Tried so hard
Just to be clever
I know honest thieves
I call family
I've seen America
With no clothes on

[Chorus - Variation]
But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more

[Bridge]
I don't know what I deserve
But for you I could work

[Chorus - Extended]
Cause I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a bird eater no more
I don't wanna be a dirt eater no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
