[Verse 1]
Hey, it's your blood
That makes my veins run
It's true
So I tried to give it back to you

Young one, look at me
It's not your beast to leash
Oh, don't hold more than you can stand to carry

[Verse 2]
Must have been a case
Of hysterical strength
To stand up while the room moved off its axis

Old man look at me
Through the teeth of your grief
Oh, don't grab more than you can stand to carry
'Cause you went off to see what no one else could see
Oh, and left more than we could stand to bury

[Chorus]
But it ain't, it ain't
It ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

No, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

No, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

No, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

No, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

[Amazing guitar play]
