[Verse 1]
You're all legs
I'm all nerves
Black lacquered
Horse hair whip
By your heels
Heal my hurt
Horse hair whip
Be your floor

[Chorus]
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon

[Bridge]
No kisses, no real names
No kisses, no real names

[Verse 2]
Who will hear
Hear your word
Ring, ring phone
Send you home
Find my heels
Heal my hurt
White, white shirt
Back to work

[Chorus] (x2)
