[Intro]
Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

[Verse 1]
Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys, casually

[Chorus 1:]
Cruel, cruel

[Interlude 1:]
Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too

[Verse 2:]
They could take or leave you
So they took you and they left you
How could they be casually

[Chorus 2:]
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh

[Interlude 2:]
Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too, then you'll be happy

[Verse 3]
You were the one waving flares in the air
So they could see you
And they were the zephyr blowing past you
Blowing fastly so they canâ€™t see you

[Chorus 2](2x)
