[Verse 1]
Oh, little one, I know you've been tired for a long, long time
And oh little one I ain't been around for a little while;
But when you see me, wave

[Verse 2]
Oh, little one, your Hemingway jawline looks just like his
Our father in exile
For God only knows how many years
But when you see him, wave;
Through double pane
I'll be with you lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you

[Verse 3]
Oh, little one, I'd tell you good news that I don't believe
If it would help you sleep
Strange mercy

[Bridge]
If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up
No I, I don't know what
If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up
No I, I don't know what

[Outro]
I'll be with you, lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you
