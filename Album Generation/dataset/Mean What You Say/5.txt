Seven years is long enough
I made this trip just to spill my guts
The things I've seen I can't believe

I'm letting go
So I can move forward
I just need some sleep tonight
One thing could make it all better
If I could hold you tight

However long it takes
I'll make it back to you
However long it takes
However long it takes

A million miles is far enough
The things we do for the ones we love
We'd give anything for the old routine

I'm letting go
So i can move forward
I just need some sleep tonight
One thing could make it all better
If I could hold you tight

However long it takes
I'll make it back to you
However long it takes
However long it takes

Fear has filled this house before
But it takes a little faith to make it through the storm
And no matter what life has in store
Just know I'm proud of you and what we're fighting for

However long it takes
I'll make it back to you
However long it takes
I'll make it back to you

However long it takes
I'll make it back to you
However long it takes
However long it takes
