I drew a line
Tried to get to heaven
The mirror was my gate

But I expired
And didn't even notice
Until I'd been thrown away

I had to fall to make it through

I found a way to get close to you
Lose all the pain I've been holding
It's easy to say I'll get better soon
But I need it today, I need it today

I fell in love
It was going perfect
So I offered her my name

She started to cry
And said I wasn't ready
Inside I felt the same

I had to fall to make it through
I'm taking steps to find the man you knew
'Cause no one cares the way you do

I found a way to get close to you
Lose all the pain I've been holding
It's easy to say I'll get better soon
But I need it today, I need it today

(Close to you, close to you)

I found a way to get close to you
Lose all the pain I've been holding
It's easy to say I'll get better soon
But I need it today, I need it today

(I found a way to get close to you
Lose all the pain I've been holding
It's easy to say I'll get better soon
But I need it today, I need it today
I need it today)
