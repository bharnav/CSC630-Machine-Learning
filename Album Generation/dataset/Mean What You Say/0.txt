Old birds have opinions
They sing and they shout
Beautiful songs from the soul
That no one cares to figure out

I need to know but I'm just a kid
And I need room to grow

Tonight
We go where we wanna go
We say what we need to say
Even if the long road takes us home
Tomorrow's a new day

We form our opinions, yeah
Call it American
But who believes a smile from a child
With all of his teeth clinched

My feelings show cause I'm just a man
And I need room to grow

Tonight
We go where we wanna go
We say what we need to say
Even if the long road takes us home
Tomorrow's a new day

Tonight
We do what we have to do
We say what we care to say
Even if the long road takes us home
Tomorrow's a new day

Tomorrow's a new day

My feelings show cause I'm just a man
And I need room to grow

Tonight
We go where we wanna go
We say what we need to say
Even if the long road takes us home
Tomorrow's a new day

Tonight
We do what we have to do
We say what we care to say
Even if the long road takes us home
Tomorrow's a new day
