I cling to a wire
A distant sight of sand
My body is tired
But I'm walking by command
A foundation is fading
I've lost all memory of land
A ship in still water
Doing the best he can

I need to get this feeling out
The walls are coming down, the walls are coming down
I'd bleed for something real right now
Let's build it from the ground, build it from the ground

The searching is over
I take my place among the thieves
The sadness it covers
It's bringing me to my knees
The wolf draws closer
Accepting everything I've done
But his teeth leave empty
As I move closer to the sun

It's hard to have clarity in a catacomb
I'm a brick away from being made to laugh alone

Rebuild, Release
Rebuild, Release
