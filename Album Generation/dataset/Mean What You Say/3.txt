[Verse 1]
Tempting lies, with bloodshot eyes
It's not who I wanted to be
It's not who I wanted to be
Buried deep in a song I keep, are words that I needed to say
But words never come out right
We believe our hearts are pleased
Well
I don't feel good enough
I don't feel good enough

[Chorus]
We learn, along the way (That life has meaning)
Inside, we feel the same (Still we lack the will to change)
All this time, we know what's right
And we can make it out alive, if we learn from the night

[Verse 2]
Say goodnight with hurt inside
I guess I had something to prove
But your heart would not move
Terrified of the fear we hide
And words that we needed to say
But words never come out right
We hope at best
Our hearts, will rest well
That's not good enough
That's not good enough!

[Chorus]
We learn, along the way (That life has meaning)
Inside, we feel the same (Still we lack the will to change)
All this time, we know what's right
And we can make it out alive, if we learn from the night

[Bridge]
I see now that you won't give up (You never)
Close your eyes 'cause we mean too much

[Chorus]
We learn, along the way (That life has meaning)
Inside, we feel the same (Still we lack the will to change)
All this time, we know what's right
And we can make it out alive, if we learn from the night
