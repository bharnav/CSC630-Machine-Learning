Every inch we talk
They make a sound, we walk
You better mean what you say
You better mean what you say
Less God, more gun
They aim for the heart, but we ain't got one
You better mean what you say
You better mean what you say

I don't need to hurt with my hands
I could find some value, destroy it with my mouth
Hey, could you ever love again?

From the womb, we're taught
You make a sound, I walk
You better mean what you say
You better mean what you say
With words like drugs
We speak 'em hard like we know what one does
You better mean what you say
You better mean what you say

I don't need to hurt with my hands
I could find some value, destroy it with my mouth
Hey, could you ever love again?

I regret the things I've said
Could you ever love again?
