Oh, na, na, na, is this love, oh, ye, yo
I don't know, I don't know
But all I want to let it show, hey, ya, ya, ya

Woman, I love you like no one
That I ever love before, hey, ya
Woman, I need you like no one
That I need before, hey, ya

Every time I roll you, girl
You bring some stray to my world, yeah, ya
Every time me way from you
You take a piece of my heart, yeah, ya

Like a stamp to a letter
We be sticking together
Like a bird a for fredda
We be flocking together

Me and you foreva
Well betta fi betta gal you
