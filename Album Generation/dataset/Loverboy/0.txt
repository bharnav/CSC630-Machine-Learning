[Verse 1]
Dark clouds gather in the afternoon
Come together just to cry
Seagulls struggling against the wind
Falling out of the sky
Grandma's gathering aluminum cans in a rusty shopping cart
Born-againers get their lives together while my whole world's falling apart

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
It's happening all around you
If it hasn't found you
Well You know it's just a matter of time
Surprise surprise
What do you think the world owes you
It's not the way it's supposed to go
Well you know It's just a matter of time

[Verse 2]
Songbird sitting in a tree house with a trumpet to her lips
I'm laying on my back in the tall green grass staring up at the eclipse
Whispers lurking in the alley behind where the children were no shoes
Call girls and corner kids hustling saying what do you got to lose

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And there's nowhere you can run to because the eyes are upon you
Some of the coming up hard and hungry
Stepping up to take your turn
Some of them throwing their money in the fire
Just to watch it burn

[Chorus]
