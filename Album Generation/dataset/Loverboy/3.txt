Goodbye woman of my dreams
You were running for steam
I got swept in your slip stream
Like a vision, you came strong
Then you were gone, and you moved on
And all around me, things are moving, so fast
Im still tender from the crash..
Feels like im frozen in slow motion
You get further away x2
Now the curtains closing
Are you a tragedy?
Are you a comedy?
I was romancing on the phone
Dancing with a stone
That I could not move alone
And all around me, things are moving, so fast
Im still tender from the crash..
Feels like im frozen in slow motion
You get further away x2
(Instrumental)
Goodbye dreamer I have drawn
You belong among the love songs
Feels like im frozen in slow motion
You get further away
Feels like im frozen in slow motion
You get further away, further, further away X2
You get further away
