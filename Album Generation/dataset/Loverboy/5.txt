I saw you dance and sing on stage
With your bare feet and your hair in braids
You pressed your lips against your horn
If I could only be the notes you mourn

Ever since I heard my first love song
I've been looking for you all along
I know, I can't be wrong

I know you don't feel it now
But I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Someday baby, somehow
I'm gonna make you fall in love with me, ooh, ooh

I wanna strum upon your strings
And make you cry love, cry a loving
Dance drunk into your heart's beat
And kiss you in the moonlight in the middle of the street

I know that we've both been here before
In another lifetime maybe more
It's karma I'm sure

I know you don't feel it now
But I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Someday baby, somehow
I'm gonna make you fall in love with me, ooh, ooh

I took you driving down to Big Sur
Down the coast of California
You held your head out of the window
And you stared out at the ocean

You never heard the albums Graceland or Blue
I played them both for you
The songs of my youth

I know you don't feel it now
But I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Someday baby, somehow
I'm gonna make you fall in love with me, ooh, ooh
