You haven't said it but I
Can hear it so loud
And there's a cloud around your head

I'll stick around
I could be a stranger in your town
Oh I could fly halfway around the world
Just to be turned down

Don't hold back your tears from falling
Don't pretend they're for me darling
You can tell me I'm not the one
I know the sun is shining somewhere on someone
It's only rain it doesn't mean the day is over
It don't change the way I feel it doesn't change a thing
It's only rain, it's only rain
It's only rain, it's only rain, yes it is

You combed the magazines and the silver screens
They hear the gold that's in your heart
I'll be fine oh I can stay with an old friend of mine
I can find myself some California wine

Don't hold back your tears from falling
Don't pretend they're for me darling
You can tell me I'm not the one
I know the sun is shining somewhere on someone
It's only rain it doesn't mean the day is over
It don't change the way I feel it doesn't change a thing
It's only rain, it's only rain
It's only rain, it's only rain, yes it is

Alright, yeah

It's only rain it doesn't mean the day is over
It don't change the way I feel it doesn't change a thing
No it doesn't change a thing doesn't change a thing
Doesn't change a thing no it's only rain
It's only rain yes it is

Ooh it's only rain
