Woke up early this mornin'
To a thunder and rainstorm
Last night I forgot to close
My windows

My heart has been broken
And my heart has been blown wide open
I don't wanna feel ?
I don't wanna feel empty
I don't want no sympathy

Who am I to blame?
What can I say? I'll never learn
Going down in flames
Walk away, watch me burn
Walk away, watch me burn

I was thinking 'bout my place in the universe
Looking ?
How much my little heart can hurt
Some people got a lotta nerve

I'm not afraid
No, I never been afraid of failure
I'm not afraid of global warmin'
Or the market crashin'
Or the terrorists attackin'

Who am I to blame?
What can I say? I will never learn
I'm goin' down in flames
Walk away, watch me burn
Walk away, watch me burn

I swam in the ocean in the night
Under the stars it's so clear
My ? bouncin' in the waves
I felt I could disappear, I'm still here, yes, I am

Who am I to blame?
What can I say? I will never learn
I'm goin' down in flames
Walk away, watch me burn
Walk away, watch me burn
Walk away, watch me burn
