Like a southbound train
Here's a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing

Moon with a halo
Like a pearl in a peasant's hand
Religion on the radio
Advertising a promised land

Everything that attaches
Someday falls apart
When the plan collapses
It can break your heart

Like a southbound train
This is a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing
Like a southbound train
Here is a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing

To the airport in the rain
Sadness seeping through
Leaving faith on a jet plane
Hurling through the blue

Love is the tear
That taught me to fall
Whispered in my ear
Soothing me to my soul

Like a southbound train
Here's a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing

Quiet constellations
I don't walk through the night
Silent salutations
Under a southwestern sky

Battlegrounds behind me
Smoke in the trees
Memories to remind me
Puts my soul to ease

Like a southbound train
Here's a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing
Like a southbound train
This is a song for leaving
Don't you know the pain
It's a part of the healing
This is a train
Get on the train
Get on the train
