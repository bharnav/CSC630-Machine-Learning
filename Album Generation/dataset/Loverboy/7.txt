I was numb, I couldn't sleep
Gently strung out on caffeine
Did I fall in love?
Was I delirious?

I was dumb, found you
Mind mind was wonderin'
I was wishin' that I could be kissin'
Your skin

And now you're in my head
You're always in my head
And now you're in my head

I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
No I can't stop thinkin' about you
And it makes me sad
Because I know you don't want me
All these thoughts in my head
They tease me and they taunt me

All the broken hearts in London town
Strewn about the tubes
In the underground
All the voices burning in my brain
They're making me insane

And now you're in my head
You're always in my head
And now you're in my head

And I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
Oh no, I can't stop thinkin' about you

And it makes me sad
Because I know you don't want me
All these thoughts up in my head
They tease me and they taunt me, taunt me
Alright, yeah

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Na na na na na

I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
No I can't stop thinkin' about you

I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long it's all I do
From the moment
From the moment that I wake up
I can't stop thinkin' about you

I said I can't, I can't stop thinkin'
No I can't, I can't stop thinkin' about ya
Ah no no no, I can't stop
I can't stop thinkin' about you about you baby
From the moment from the moment
That I wake up
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't stop thinkin' about you
