[Verse 1]
Now that you found yourself
Losing your mind
Are you here again?
Finding that what you once
Thought was real
Is gone, and changing?

[Chorus]
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think
I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you
I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Coming to you at night
I see my questions
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe
In a year or two
We could laugh
And let it all out

[Chorus]
