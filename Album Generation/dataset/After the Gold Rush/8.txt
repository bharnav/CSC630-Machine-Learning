[Verse 1]
When you dance
Do your senses tingle?
Then take a chance?
In a trance
While the lonely mingle
With circumstance?

[Chorus]
I've got something to tell you
You made it show
Let me come over
I know you know
When you dance
I can really love

[Bridge]
I can love
I can really love [x2]
I can love
I can really love [x2]

[Verse 2]
Like a mountain that's growing
A river that rolls
Let me come over
I know you know
When you dance [Ooh Ooh]
I can really love
When you dance
Do your senses tingle?
Then take a chance?
In a trance
While the lonely mingle
With circumstance?

[Chorus]
