[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Cripple Creek ferry
Butting through
The overhanging trees
Make way
For the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down
It's a mighty tight squeeze

[Verse]
All alone the captain stands
Hasn't heard
From his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
It's the second half
Of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose

[Chorus]
