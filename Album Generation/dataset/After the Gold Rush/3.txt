[Hook]
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 1]
I saw cotton and I saw 'bacc
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?

[Chorus]
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 2]
Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!

[Chorus]
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?

[Guitar Solo Outro]
