[Intro]
Spitting venom

[Verse 1]
Here lies another grudge, another score never settled
For many who lead a life of resentment
Filled with foolish pride, that blinds them
Fighting the world but their own progress gets fought
Feeble minds, spit their venom at me
Reliving their grievances day in, day out
Living with all the shame that their life has spit out

[Chorus]
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Alone and provoked
Your anger is deep and lasting
Shaped and enraged
Filled with indignation
Believe what you may
Say what you will
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Spit, spit, spit
Spit
Spit
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Spit
Spit
Spitting venom in the eyes of the world

[Verse 2]
Anonymity will not last
So mock and slander with your empty threats
Identity always concealed
Spineless cowards soon to be revealed
Choose your conflicts, try again and fail
Expression of fear from the lives you lived
You stay here to lose again, you always will
I am undeterred

[Chorus]
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Alone and provoked
Your anger is deep and lasting
Shaped and enraged
Filled with indignation
Believe what you may
Say what you will
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Spit, spit, spit
Spit
Spit
I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world
Spit
Spit
Spitting venom in the eyes of the world
