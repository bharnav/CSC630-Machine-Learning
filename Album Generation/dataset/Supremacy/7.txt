[Intro]
When the conflict never ceases
And the enemies are immortal
Only their names and faces change
So a stance must always be held

[Verse]
Claw at my pride, your facade tears away
Another day dies, I'm looking, I'm lasting
Attempt to break my stride, fall deeper, tread faster
Another cry ignored, the most desolation

[Pre-Chorus]
If the conflict must last forever
So must our struggle for justice
In a state of faith denied
Is it any wonder where the answers lie?

[Chorus]
Enemies never die
Conflict is unending
Chaos never ceases
Where does the solution lie?

[Verse]
Claw at my pride, your facade tears away
Another day dies, I'm looking, I'm lasting
Attempt to break my stride, fall deeper, tread faster
Another cry ignored, the most desolation

[Pre-Chorus]
If the conflict must last forever
So must our struggle for justice
In a state of faith denied
Is it any wonder where the answers lie?

[Chorus]
Enemies never die
Conflict is unending
Chaos never ceases
Where does the solution lie?

[Bridge]
When the conflict never ceases
And the enemies are immortal
Only their names and faces change
So a stance must always be held

[Chorus]
Enemies never die
Conflict is unending
Chaos never ceases
Where does the solution lie?
Enemies never die
Conflict is unending
Chaos never ceases
Where does the solution lie?
