[Intro]
Some wars must be fought alone

[Verse 1]
Am I the only on standing in my way?
Am I my own merciless enemy?
Can I stand back looking deep into god's case
Can I turn and face myself on the knowledge of what couldn't be?

[Pre-Chorus]
To look into my heart was to look into hell (into hell)
Controlled by the voice of fear, I was completely overwhelmed
So concerned with the things I could never change
Now I must ensure to never fulfill that prophecy

[Chorus]
I must attain
Supremacy of mind
Supremacy of body
Supremacy of spirit
Supremacy of self

[Verse 2]
The war you want is the war I'm willing to give
Farewell to all the disbelief suspended in the depths

[Pre-Chorus]
To look into my heart was to look into hell (into hell)
Controlled by the voice of fear I was completely overwhelmed
So concerned with the things I could never change
Now I must ensure to never fulfill that prophecy

[Chorus]
I must attain
Supremacy of mind
Supremacy of body
Supremacy of spirit
Supremacy of self

[Outro]
Supremacy of self
Supremacy of self
Supremacy of self
This war will be won alone
