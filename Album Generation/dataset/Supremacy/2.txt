[Intro]
Mind over all

[Verse 1]
When I was at my weakest
And I had given in
Some had guided me help
Some rejoiced to my failures
The few that believed
Gave me power and life
Gave me strength with there trust
Surrounding me with light

[Chorus]
No limit to what can be achieved
Mind over all
Power that is yet to be seen
Mind over all
Envious ability
Mind over all
Stare now into glory

[Verse 2]
It's within and it's growing
Their mark is not worn
It's the purest devotion
It's the war of knowing
They are there for me
They are part of who I am
It's within me in spirit
And beside me in battle

[Chorus]
No limit to what can be achieved
Mind over all
Power that is yet to be seen
Mind over all
Envious ability
Mind over all
Stare now into glory
Mind over all

[Bridge]
Become empowered!

[Chorus]
No limit to what can be achieved
Mind over all
Power that is yet to be seen
Mind over all
Envious ability
Mind over all
Stare now into glory
Mind over all
