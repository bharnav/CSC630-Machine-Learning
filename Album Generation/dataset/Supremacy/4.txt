[Verse 1]
Here I am
Exposed to my brokenness for the world to see
Here I am
Screaming these words
It's all I've ever known of serenity
Here I am
Telling my pain bearing my soul to the world
Here I am
Venting on this page
Flawed and insecure no more
Here I am
Coming clean with myself
Knowing that this time would come
Here I am
Like a thousand voices
I know I'm not the only one
Now my fists must never become unclenched
Eternally prevailing against
I must endure the misfortune and bring starvation
For those who hunger for my defeat

[Chorus 1]
Give wings to my triumph!
Let this life ascend
Give wings to my triumph!
Give rebirth for every death

[Verse 2]
Here I am
Exposed to my brokenness for the world to see
Here I am
Screaming these words
It's all I've ever known of serenity

[Bridge]
Give wings to my triumph!

See my will before you now
Life ascends in every breath
A rise for every fall
A life for every death
Every death
Every death
Every death

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Telling my pain bearing my soul to the world
Here I am
Venting on this page
Flawed and insecure no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me wings
So I ascend
Let me soar
Take me further than ever before

[Chorus 2]
Give wings to my triumph!
Let this life ascend in every breath
Give wings to my triumph!
Give rebirth for every death
Give wings to my triumph!
And let me soar
Give wings to my triumph!
Take me further than ever before
