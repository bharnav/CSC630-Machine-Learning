Look up now into the mirror that you despise
Keep looking Â¸over your shoulder
They shadow me and always be around
It's living in you, on you, eating you alive
Appears the striking resemblance
Appears your scars

[Chorus 1]
Confront the horrors of self

What no one knows is why you fear those thoughts of reject
Only horror hidden in time
Concede what has been lost
Spitting into your own reflection
Spewing hatred to reality
You're just a spec of sand in an endless desert of agony

[Chorus 2]
Horrors of self

[Post-Chorus]
I must confront this
Confront the horror

[Bridge]
Horrors of self must be confronted to be forgiven
Horrors of self conceal my time annihilate the past to be forgotten
Horrors of self must be confronted to be forgiven
Horrors of self must be revealed to achieve constriction

[Chorus 2]
Horrors of self
