[Intro]
Let's go!

[Chorus]
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive

[Verse 1]
Alive to fight another day
Alive to reveal and turn the page

[Chorus]
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive

[Verse 2]
Alive to fight another day
Alive to reveal and turn the page
Alive
Alive to reveal itself
Alive because the pain reveals the most truth

[Bridge]
See the scars behind these eyes
The sting of daylight, the changing tide
Horizon haunt me no longer
The truth is born again into me

[Bridge]
My pain has revealed to me the most truth

[Outro]
The pain tells me I'm still alive
To fight another day
The pain tells me I'm still alive
Reveal and turn the page
The pain tells me I'm still alive
It reveals the most truth
