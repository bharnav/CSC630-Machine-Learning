[Verse 1]
It's a wish for reprisal
The vengeance the divine has chosen
In the reflection of this anger
Is the embodiment of all that is despised
They'll claim it's justified
They'll say it's divine judgment
With prayers and wishes to be granted
With destruction and murder behind their eyes

[Chorus]
Pray tonight, pray
Beg the sky, beg
The angels they claim
May be sent to take our life

[Verse 2]
I wish for something more than death
I wish for paradise to open
Born now are new saviors
Sent to steal our breath

[Chorus]
Pray tonight, pray
Beg the sky, beg
The angels they claim
May be sent to take your life
Pray tonight, pray
Beg the sky, beg
The angels they claim
May be sent to take your life

[Bridge]
Some claim it's justified
Some say it's judgment of the divine

[Pre-Breakdown]
How could it be the work the work of their divinity?
How could it be the work the work of their divinity?
It's divine retribution

[Outro]
It's a bloodshed meant to be
