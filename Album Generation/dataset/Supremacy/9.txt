[Verse 1]
The flame was almost extinguished as the will
Leaped faded and escaped from me
Two years have passed as they wilted away
All that was left were memories of things I never lived

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the fight is on until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on until my final breath
I never wanted anything more

[Chorus]
I must never let it die
I must never let it die

[Verse 2]
Bonds are strengthened when they've been tested and mended when they've been torn
So give all of yourself that there is to give
Cause in life to have never risked is to have never lived

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the fight is on until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on until my final breath, I never wanted anything more

[Chorus]
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die

[Verse 3]
So resolve, reassure and push on without fear
Ignite the flame because only you govern what tomorrow holds
It's inside your soul waiting to be awoken
It's more than words describe
This is the spark, let it burn, make it build, that will never be denied

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause the fight is on until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on until my final breath, I never wanted anything more

[Chorus]
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die

[Bridge]
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never)
Will we let it die, (never, never)

[Chorus]
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
I must never let it die
