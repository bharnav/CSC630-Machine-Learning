[Intro]
As diehard as they come

[Verse 1]
Some of us have had a grateful day
When harmony fades and life stands still
Those who are willing to sacrifice
Were blessed with the instinct to survive

[Pre-Chorus]
This is for those who escaped the torment
You know your courage
You're as diehard as they come
This is for those who never wavererd
You are feeling
You're as diehard as they come

[Chorus]
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come

[Bridge]
Never waver, never falter
Remain diehard

[Chorus]
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
