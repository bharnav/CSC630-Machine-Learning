[Verse 1]
This is the sound of the lost
Beaten and broken
Rising up and claiming what was been taken from us
From the shadows of the past
From the depths of our own failures
Stepping forward into the light
Denying our demise
Decimating all uncertainty
Bowing to only who can place judgment upon me

[Chorus]
Give me your broken
Give me your beaten
I will build them up
I will lead them
To the threshold

[Post-Chorus 1]
Make you stronger
Make you believe
I am one in the same
But now stronger then uncertainty
Within this army
This is more than a battle cry
It's the blood of our lifeline
Flowing faster

[Verse 2]
This is the sound of the lost
Beaten and broken
Decimating all fears
Stronger then ever
Beyond every dream
Ascension into supremacy
Now we're stronger then ever
Harder then ever

[Chorus]
Give me your broken
Give me your beaten
I will build them up
I will lead them
To the threshold

[Post-Chorus 2]
To the threshold
This is more than a battle cry

[Outro]
We were the broken
We were the beaten
I was once like you
Now I push myself to the threshold
Because I am stronger
Because I believe
Now I spit in the face of defeat
Now I'm stronger then all uncertainty
