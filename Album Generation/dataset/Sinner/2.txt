Pretty palm, pretty balm, pretty bomb, pretty oh oh oh
Pretty sigh, pretty sun, pretty one, pretty oh oh oh
Radio and my television screen
Is it image you want
Is it really me
I've falling over something that I just can't explain
No, no, no, no
You want me to
You want me to
But I can't define
Desire
Do you wanna watch me cry
I cry a lot
Do you want me to come out
Ready or not
Do you want big proof?
Is that what need
Do you wanna watch me squirm
Do you wanna watch me bleed
Do you want
Everything?

Pretty palm, pretty balm, pretty bomb, pretty oh oh oh
Pretty sigh, pretty sun, pretty one, pretty oh oh oh
Radio and my television screen
Is it image you want
Is it really me
I've fallen into something that I just can't explain
No, no, no, no
You want me to
You want me to
But I can't define
Desire
Do you wanna watch me cry
Do you wanna make me bleed
Do you wanna hear me say
What I don't really mean
Do you want it so real
Do you want it so fake
Do you want big proof
Is that what you crave
Do you want to watch me crack
Wanna see me shatter
Make me behave
Doesn't really matter

I can't define desire
I won't defend desire
I can't defile desire
I won't defend desire
Radio, radio, radio is blaring
Radio, radio, radio is scaring me
Radio, radio, radio is blaring
Radio, radio, my radio is scaring me
You said
Explain this shit
I said
Fire
Do you wanna watch me cry
Do you wanna make me bleed
Do you wanna hear me say
What I don't really mean
Do you want it so real
Do you want it so fake
Do you want big proof
Is that what you crave
Do you wanna watch me crack
Wanna see me shatter
Make me behave
Doesn't really matter
Do you wanna watch me cry
I cry a lot
Do you want me to come out
Ready or not
Do you want big proof?
Is that watcha need
Do you wanna watch me squirm
Do you wanna watch me bleed
