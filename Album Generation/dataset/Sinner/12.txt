I'm holding my hand out to you
And you're walking away
You're moving your lips
But i can't hear a word that you say
My eyes are all filled
From the tears
That i spilled over you
All of these years
I just covered my ears from the truth

Chorus:
I don't know how
You could do this now
It comes at a bad time
You know me so well
So why can't you tell
That this is a bad time now
Hey don't even start
I'll tear you apart
This comes at a bad time
I don't wanna fight
This doesn't feel right
It comes at a bad ad time

Once you are out
You are out and
You're out there alone
You'll never get back
What you had
And you can't go back home
There's things that we said
In our head
That we don't have to say
Keep your thoughts
To yourself
Cuz it's better that way

Chorus
I don't know how
You could do this now
It comes at a bad time
You know me so well
So why can't you tell
That this is a bad time now
Hey don't even start
I'll tear you apart
This comes at a bad time
I don't wanna fight
This doesn't feel right
It comes at a bad ad time

Chorus
