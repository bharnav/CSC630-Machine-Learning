Talkin' heads are talkin'
But listen to what they say
How they sit in judgement
An' claim to know the way
If dreams can be dismembered
An' our worth can be ignored
Need a new direction
Cause this one we can't afford

There's bad stuff happening
An' no one does a thing

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak
At us in riddles

Got ourselves in trouble
With no relief in sight
Everyday is such a stuggle
Cause they had to pick a fight

How can this be happening
Can't we do anything

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak
At us in riddles

The peace is the war
The rich are too poor
An' they just speak at us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak at us in riddles
We're stuck right in the middle

Clear skies baby
Healthy forests
No Child Left Behind
Wake up people

Big Brother is watchin' you
They're takin' all your rights away
Don't claim that you represent me cause
I don't believe a word that ya say

What can I do
What can I say
When they just speak at
Us in riddles
How can this be
Why can't ya see
That they just speak
At us in riddles

Let's see through the riddles
