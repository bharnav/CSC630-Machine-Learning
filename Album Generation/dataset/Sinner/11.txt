(J. Jett/K. Hanna)

Takes her time
Bittersweet
Reads the magazines
She's not meant to read
Switch hitter
You know she plays the field
She ain't concerned
Oh, as long as it's real

Um, and they call her baby blue
Baby blue
Top bottom
She does either
Always in control
She's a teaser

And they call her baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue
Ooh yeah (baby blue) baby blue
Ooh right (baby blue) black and blue
Ooh yeah (black and blue) baby blue
Ooh

Yeah she tries to speak
Through broken wires
Was meant to follow
Just feeds her fire

And they call her baby blue
And they call her baby blue
And they call her baby blue
Ooh yeah (baby blue) baby blue
Ooh right (baby blue) black and blue
Ooh yeah (black and blue) baby blue
Ooh oh yeah baby blue
