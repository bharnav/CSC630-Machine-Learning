It ain't mine
It ain't yours
But I'm here
I ain't goin' anywhere

It ain't his
It ain't hers
It's for all
Is that somethin' we can learn

It's time we stop all the hatin'
Let's start today
Go find a way

To change the World
Gotta change the world
Go change the world
Gotta change the world

Well do ya care
Bout what's fair?
It don't matter
As long as you get your share

Now I see
Disparity
What needs to be
Hell it isn't charity

It's time we stop all the fightin'
Let's start today
Go find a way

To change the World
Gotta change the world
Go change the world
Gotta change the world

I dare ya are ya scared?
I dare ya are ya scared?

It's time we stop all the hatin'
Let's start today
Go find a way

To change the World
Gotta change the world
Go change the world
Gotta change the world

To change the World
Gotta change the world
Go change the world
Gotta change the world
