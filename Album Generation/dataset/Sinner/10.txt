The changes that we both went through
Was it all a game?
I know that it was real to me

Bringing myself right back to me

Bringing myself right back to me
Turn it around
Bringing myself right back to me
Turn it around
Bringing myself right back to me
Turn it around
Bringing myself right back to me
Oh
