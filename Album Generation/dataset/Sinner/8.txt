Rain on your face
Looks like tears that I wanna erase
If I could
Take all your pain away
I'd do that everyday
You know that I would

You make me feel
Like I am real
Like I exist
You make the bad things
Disappear
Rain on my soul
All shiny and wet
Bleeding all onto your skin
Take me to a place far away
Where we'd be like we're twins
I wanna know
That this is real
But it's so hard
Am I afraid
To really feel

I wanna know
That this is real
But it's so hard
Are you afraid
To really feel

There's just one thing
I know I wanna do
Baptize myself
In the waters of you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Watersign
Watersign
Oh
Watersign
