She knows everything
And she's gonna
Tell on you

I can't fake happy
I will not take delight
Conversationally

You make me wanna stay at home every night

Again
You been talkin' up a storm
That you been drowning me in
Talkin' up a storm

Turn myself from your silver screen

Maybe in your dreams

Your just tube talkin'
Again

Again
You been talkin' up a storm
That you been drowning me in
Talkin' up a storm
That you been drowning me in
Oh yeah
Tube talkin' again
