Here comes Dick
He's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane
You know she's sporting a chain
Same hair revolution
Same build evolution
Tomorrow who's going to fuss

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know
Love each other so
Androgynous

Well don't get him wrong
And don't get him mad
He might be a father
But he sure ain't a dad
She don't need
Advice that they send to her
She's happy with the way she looks
She's happy with her gender

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know
Love each other so
Androgynous

Mirror image see no damage
See no evil at all
Cupie dolls and urine stalls
Will be laughed at the way
You're laughed at now

Now something meets boy
And something meets girl
They both are the same
They're overjoyed in this world
Same hair revolution, unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss

And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
Tomorrow Jane's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and a they don't last
And a today the people dress the way
That they please
The way they tried to do in the last century

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know
Love each other so
Androgynous
Androgynous
Androgynous
Don't you get it
Androgynous
