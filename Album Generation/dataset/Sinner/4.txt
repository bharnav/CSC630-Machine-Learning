I know that people talk
Don't tell me what they say
It used to get to me
But I won't change my ways
As time goes by
I will never learn
And I don't care
If everyone knows

Nobody understands
We don't play by the rules
I can't imagine why
They can't buy what we do
With all that's real
Is the way we feel
And I don't care if everyone knows

Owww
Just when I'm sure no one sees what I see
I realize that there's still you and me
You know I am there for you
I'll always care for you

I see 'em stare at us
Whenever we're together
They haven't got the right
Just cuz we're wearin' leather
If you're all right
If I'm all right
And I don't care if everyone knows
If it feels this strong
It can't be wrong
And I don't care
If everyone knows

People get scared cuz
They think we are freaks
But they will never bring me to my knees
You know I am there for you
I'll always care for you
If you're all right
And I'm all right
Everyone knows
If you're all right
And I'm all right
Everyone knows
If you're all right
And I'm all right
Everyone knows
