[Verse 1:]
Into the middle we go
I smell a rat and just in case
I set up traps and you're the bait, surprise
Surprise
If curiosity kills cats, we better
We better teach the cat to fight back

[Chorus:]
I'm waiting for you
I don't know why
When you always take your time
Into the middle we go
Let's see you try to kill me
Our eyes fell to the floor
Your eyes and mine

[Verse 2:]
The middleman straddles the fence
He never loses, never wins with confidence
And more power to him
He doesn't need a telescope
To figure out he's jumping rope
Hand over fist

[Chorus:]
I'm waiting for you
I don't know why
When you always take your time
Into the middle we go
Let's see you try to kill me
Our eyes fell to the floor
Your eyes and mine

That's fine

I'm waiting for you
I don't know why
When you always take your time
Into the middle we go
Let's see you try
Oh, I'm waiting for you
I don't know why
When you always take your time
Into the middle we go
Let's see you try to kill me
