When you cry
Try not to smile
You could fill up a lake
With the tears of a crocodile
We were too young
To be eating crow
As if I would know
(i'm scared)
11 hours till the electric arcs
(i'm scared)
Send scorches through the sky
(i'm scared)
Than the whole earth opens wide
And i cannot wait for the earthquake
That buries us in a warm grave
The one-legged race, on our last leg
The will is yours, so just take it
The will is yours
I'd rather find jesus outside of a book
The same thing goes for robin hood
Never darken my door again
If opportunity knocks, let's make him beg
Let's make him beg
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise i will kill you right now
Oh, where did you go?
Bring a match while you feather your nest
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise i will kill you right now
You could fill up a lake
With the tears of a crocodile
You lead by the nose and always get lost
(i cannot wait for the earthquake)
We always get lost
(to bury me in a cold grave)
Get outta this town
Hatchet men yelling timber
Will get us chopped down
Get outta this hell
Off this rusted train track
You still take lying down
So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink
So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink
You can still find me
Between devils and deep blue seas
In the desert's hands
On a sheet of sand
A dry tidal wave
Over my feet of clay
On unfinished glass
Looking for greener grass
Trying to make the welkin ring
But all my sounds are boomerangs
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise i will kill you right now
Oh, where did you go?
Bring a match while you feather your nest
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise you i will kill you right now
Not today, not again
Dress it up in stolen silver and garbage
