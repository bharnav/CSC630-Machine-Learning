Listen to me
Hey rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
I am not a machine so don't treat me like buttons
Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
We're not identical twins so don't finish my sentence
Tell me the truth or don't tell me anything
I'd rather have heart than courage or a brain
Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
Don't pay any mind to a voice behind curtains
If you meet the devil's wife
Make sure you wear a suit and tie
And leave him where he stands
And if he tries to shake your hand
Just hit him with her frying pan
And leave him where he stands
Listen to me
Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
If you want a picasso, you better start diggin'
Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
If i build the ark will you wait for the water?
The only thing that ever turned him blue
Was thinking the sky is what he should be turning to
Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi
There are snakes in the grass so we better go hunting
If you meet the devil's wife
Make sure you wear a suit and tie
And leave him where he stands
If he tries to shake your hand
Just hit him with her frying pan
And leave him where he stands
Let her take the kitchen sink
And cut her from her apron strings
Just leave him where he stands
All you need is amnesty
So grab my hand and come with me
Just leave him where he stands
Rikki
