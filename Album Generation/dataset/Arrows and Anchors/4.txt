[Verse 1:]
Stay close if you wanna keep up
But don't dare turn around
Go ahead, find a bull's-eye my friend
But know you're gonna get the horn
A yellow belly's never havin' the guts
But god how he gets the glory
The west was won from a cheater with a gun
And i hope he never lives it down

[Verse 2:]
Minced words from anonymous cowards
Fell down from kingdom come
The threatened source of this obstacle course
Had us cornered in a guessing game
Every attempt turned a kettle of fish
And loves making its waves
If I had to guess, he's still makin' a mess
Worse than any thunderstorm

[Chorus:]
No one turned over leaves
No one's branching out
No one went on a limb when he belted out
Get gone
Someone looked for a clue, someone got the axe
Someone yelled in the wake of the great collapse
Get gone

[Verse 3:]
Let's stall like a neanderthal
That can't make up his mind
And not sore if we've heard it before
Broken records wanna make a case
The croppers came
And were spinnin' a yarn
Our ears still opened up
If failed attempts were a lottery ticket
You can bet i'd be rakin' it in

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Get gone, my friend (x3)
Get gone

[Chorus]
