[Verse 1]
You should be counting your blessings
From the sky
Your eagle eyes found the great blind faith
I could be kickin' the bucket
But you should know
I never had very good aim

[Pre-Chorus]
The right of way
Is a wild goose chase

[Chorus]
It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars
Is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised land

[Verse 2]
If I worship the ground that he walks on
And it winds up that he has two left feet
Will we be walkin' on water?
'Cause you should know
We never like to get our feet wet

[Pre-Chorus]
The right of way
Is a wild goose chase

[Chorus]
It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars
Is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised land

[Bridge]
I got dizzy
I got lost

[Chorus]
It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars
Is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised land

It makes you wonder
It makes you wonder
(It makes you wonder)
It makes you wonder
And I'm just a stick in the mud?
