[Verse 1:]
From hand to heart and hands to head
These gritty teeth grind gears of infrared
He crash lands in dull white noise
All I hear is static in his voice

[Chorus:]
When those sweet red hands
Start their whirlwinds
And you're the drain
You're imagining things
Your pretend machine
Has sticks in its every spoke
You're inventing it all
From thin air and close calls
Welcome to the balancing act

[Verse 2:]
Your rabbit's foot is hare and hounds
And I drag pianos, eyes glued to the ground
When he dialed 911
Busy signals sang familiar songs

[Chorus:]
Those sweet red hands
Start their whirlwinds
And you're the plane
You're imagining things
Your pretend machine
Has sticks in its every spoke
You're inventing it all
From thin air and close calls
If we bought the stock we'd be broke

[Bridge:]
You taught us to claw
Put us through your speech
If I'm a red anchor
Then you're coming with me
And on the way down
We can sleep with the fish
As we go into the blue
We can both reminisce
And you better hide
Or learn how to climb
'cause you're coming with me
And on the way down
You will sleep with the fish
'cause you're coming with me

[Chorus:]
You're imagining things
Your pretend machine
Has sticks in its every spoke
You're inventing it all
From thin air and close calls
Welcome to the balancing act
