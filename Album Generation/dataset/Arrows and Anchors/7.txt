If you croak i hope ya know i'm gonna toss you in the trash
You can't really blame us, we're only doin' what you asked
If you have yourself a son, I'm gonna tell your baby boy
That father time's chock full of lies
So don't jump in just yet
Doubting thomas deserves much more than we can give
If we win the lottery, let's buy an island just for him
So when that hurricane tries beatin' down the door
We can make him bat its eyes until it can't see what's a-...
Until we can't see what's ahead
You can sew me in stitches
And curse at the cautious
While it lasts
'cause soon we'll all forget
If we croak i hope ya know it's gonna be in single files
Hunting for models that were never worth the while
Each one of us caught head for throwing jack frost in july
And staring at the sun till our eyes were done
And we could not see what's a-...
Until we can't see what's ahead
You can sew me in stitches
And curse at the cautious
While it lasts
'cause soon we'll all forget
