Now soon enough
Someone's gonna come along
Could be your husband, could be your wife
Hell, could be your best friend
They're gonna come along
And put a stick in your spokes
And I want you to thank them
'Cause is it so bad when you're airborne
That the only thing going through
That little head of yours, is hitting the ground?
