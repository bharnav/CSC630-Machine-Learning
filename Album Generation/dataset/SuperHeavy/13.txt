[Jr. gong:]
Greetings to the world

[Joss Stone:]
Oh what's the first enchanted tear
Crystal drop? little ra-ain
Then along came.. your face and
I'll never be the same again
Now you're a steak knife in the back
Selfish cause, complica-ate
This labyrinth, the world we make, is one to be reckoned with
It's a sound that I contain
No. one breathes. their faame
Their lines.. me.. so in a bank?
Lets search for some common ground

[Jr. Gong:]
Well me go so bow chu madame, an ya senorita
Have a likkle superheavy up in I ya mixtcha
It remain in all your stereo just like a fixtcha
When you see us all together what a pretty pictcha
They say lay up what we lay a we don't leap the textcha
It come together archive dem scotch money papah
Ay, me tek no sticka man a step up
So uh no tell um to de wolf sheep on shephard
Dat when the night
Turns to day
And girl and ride
Run away
The peace so astound that the love you found
While searching for common ground

[Joss stone, Chorus:]
Everybody come together hear this sound
Open up your ears look at what we found
Common ground
So gather round
Don't matter if your white, yellow, green or brown
Every boy and every girl and in every town
Gather round
There's common ground

[Mick Jagger:]
There was a calvary
Down in new orleans
And when the band would play
Their feet went flying
And underneath the ponds
Bodies were swaying
And in each other's arms
Lovers were prayin
You may the one for me
Love is all around
But what I've found I've been lookin for
Searching for common ground

[Joss Stone:]
Everybody come together hear this sound
Open up your ears look at what we found
Common ground
So gather round
Don't matter if your white and a green or brown
Every boy and every girl in every town
Gather round
There's common ground
