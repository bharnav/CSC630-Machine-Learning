In life what you treasure
Joy and pleasure
It depends on how you measure
Everybody want to live it up yeah, oh yeah

In life what you treasure
Joy and pleasure
It's the simplest of things
It depends on what you measure okay, oh yeah

You choose what you pray for
Some like it hot and some love the cold weather
Don't take the pressure on man, oh no

Long life, upward mobile markets and
Happiness and everybody want it and
More love less stress and panic
Enjoy yourself, take full advantage

When the noise dies ever
I will be dancing
Music lives forever
And it never says never, no way, no way

It goes on and on and on
On and on and on
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on

And the love of the light thats in no lie
He was strolling through life without a light
And he trips on his soulmate, he took the bite
Now he rocks me gently
Now he rocks me gently

When the good get better
Sure is fun when we're building together
Nobody wants to be alone yeah, oh no

Jah rising sun
Make it play for the dawn
And the night is done
Everybody wants to make it home

Long life, upward mobile markets and
Happiness and everybody want it and
More love less stress and panic
Enjoy yourself, take full advantage

When the good get better
It sure is fun when we're building together
And nobody wants to be alone oh yeah

Whenever our eyes meet
There's a question why (there's more)
We don't have to try babe (hello!)
Our eying!

And the love of the light thats in no lie
He was strolling through life without a light
He trips on his soulmate, took the bite
Now he rocks me gently
Now he rocks me gently

When the noise dies ever
I will be dancing
Music lives forever
And it never says never, no way, no way

And the love of the light thats in no lie
He was strolling through life without a light
He trips on his soulmate, took the bite
Now he rocks me gently
Now he rocks me gently

It goes on and on and on
On and on and on
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on
