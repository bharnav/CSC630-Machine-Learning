Now it's, now it's, now it's war
Nice to be important but important to be nice
So just stare that at I

Tell me love, what would you say?
If I came to you on judgement day
And I laid out my life
How did I do for you love?
Was I a lover?
Or did I choose to fight?
Did I embrace my brother, no color, no stripes?

While the world keeps turning
(I'll be waiting all day long)
And life goes on
(When the night falls I'll still be standing strong)
And the fires keep on burning
(And the morning will still be ours)
Let your heart stay strong
(Oh yes we will)
Let your heart stay strong

Long live the world
How do you feel?
Watching our babies die just for dollar signs
This is real

We can hear you all
Your opinions are true
There's only one thing left to do
Speak, we'll hear you
Speak, we'll hear you
Loud and proud

While the world keeps on turning
(I'll be waiting all day long)
And life goes on
(When the night falls I'll still be standing strong)
And the fires keep burning
(And the morning will still be ours)
Let your heart stay strong
(Yes I will, yeah)
Let your heart stay strong

Now tell me love
How should we feel?
So your speech be nice in such harsh times
The human race gets bold

So send out some life now
It's true today we lie
So send them some smiles
Send them some smiles

While the world keeps turning
And life goes on
(When the night falls I'll still be standing strong)
And the fires keep burning
(And the morning will still be ours)
Let your heart stay strong
(Oh yes we will, yeah)
Let your heart stay strong
Let your heart stay strong
Stay strong
