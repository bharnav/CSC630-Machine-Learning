Satya hai Jeevanam
Satya hai Junoon
Satya deta hai Sukoon

Satyameva Jayate, Jayate

Hey hey! Come onâ€¦ alla rakha

Khul ke kaho ji mil jhul ke kaho
Satya hi rab hai vo
Tera yeh mera yeh
Nahi nahi nahi
Satya hi sab ka ek mazab ho

Wake up!
Satya ke daage se
Get up!
Dil ko jodo, hey hey!
Wake up!
Satya ke daman ko
Get up!
Yoon na chhodo

If you wanna be a winner
Make friends with the truth
Let your life be a lover
It's a choice for you to choose

Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!

I wouldn't tell a lie fi a dinna
Wouldn't tell a fib just to ride in a beamer
Big gunzilla, me no like petty thief
And me no like steala
[?], the truth is a winner
Would I lie fi a stuck
When mi no like [?]

The way the victim suffer
I just wish I had a rocket
Super to the heavy fire at all pickpocket
Tell them to stop it

Satya hai Junoon
All the [?] must tell the truth
Satya deta hai Sukoon
It's a wake-up call I hope you hear it soon

Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!

Satya hai
Satya hai
Satya hai
Satya hai
Satya hai

Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!

Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
Satyameva Jayate!
