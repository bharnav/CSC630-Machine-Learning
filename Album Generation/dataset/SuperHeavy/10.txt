Out by the desolate shore
The waves come in with a roar
The children are playing

Throwing stones in the water
Dogs are chasing
The seagulls are flickering, bickering, bickering, bickering

Horses are out in the pasture
Seeing who’s running faster
And inside the house a young girl is sewing

What a peaceful scene
Like a faded dream
It all looks like a sepia photograph

I don’t mind
If you live in my mind
I’m happy to keep you there

And that’s fine, oh you
You’re all in my mind
And my imagination’s clear, ooh ooh

The sun shines bright on the water
I walk with my daughter
And the whole world is shimmering, shimmering, shimmering

I hear a church bell ring
With a kind of lilt and swing
Just then the noise of the planes is shattering, shattering, shattering

Out by the desolate shore
By the marshy moor
The children were playing

Horses are out in the pasture
Saddled up for the master
Meanwhile the clouds are gathering, gathering, gathering, gathering

I don’t mind
If you live in my mind
I’m happy to keep you there

And that’s fine, oh you
You’re all that I like
And my imagination’s clear, ooh

And even though you’re just a figment
Of my thoughts I’m still loving every segment
And my imagination got me desperate
And you’ve already took away my next breath

Which means I’m doomed from the outset
'Cause I’m in love without an outlet
Which means I can’t make no progress
Means my ambitions are hopeless

I want to wrap around you like a necklace
But I can’t, so you got me moving reckless
To you I’d rather give more and take less
'Cause you make me want to conquer every conquest

I’m trying to tell you that I love you from the longest
I’m trying to tell you that my loving is the strongest
I’m trying to tell you that sweet dreams are made of me
And who are you to disagree?

I don’t mind
If you live in my mind
I’m happy to keep you there

And that’s fine, oh you
You’re all that I like
And my imagination’s clear

I don’t mind
If you live in my mind
I’m happy to keep you there

And that’s fine, oh you
Happy to, happy to keep you there
