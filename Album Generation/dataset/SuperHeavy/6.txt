With your red red lips, on your white, white face
And your twisted smile, gone down a trace
And your father's money, and your mother's taste
And your sister's wardrobe all cinched in at the waist
What does it matter to me, now that you vanished 'cross the sea?
With your dancin' mind, and your sparkling wit
And your lit'rary connections that you care for not one bit
With your jewelry dripping off your hands, it's strange
I know you're never gonna change, your ways
What does it matter to me, now that you vanished 'cross the sea, yeah?
A pearl in the ocean so blue, that's what I think of when I dream about you
With your red red lips on your poor suckling skin
And your cocktail dress made for posing in
And your father's money and your mother's grace
You always have your very very own way
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna change, your ways
You're never gonna change, oh my
But you're never gonna change
You're never gonna change!
