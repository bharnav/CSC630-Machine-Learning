On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man, we set the bar
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

Yo! surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee. keep so far!
Because we're heavy. superheavy

You better watch your step
Keep your distance
You gotta understand
A'fore it gets too dangerous
It's two steps back
And the dog won't bite
And all hell will stop
Don't matter if its day or night

On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man, we set the bar
Because we're heavy. superheavy
Yo! surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee. keep so far!
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy
Yo! unto the war we don't know what line of star
Give us a loan from your old style of car
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

From Argentina to Zanzibar
Not go no place with me strum on guitar
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

We gonna rock yourself
And take no prisoners
You got no choice
And it's none of your business

When the walls come down
We know we got love
It's a gift to us
From the heavens above, yeah

On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man, we set the bar
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

Yo! surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee. keep so far!
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

Yo! unto the war we don't know what line of star
Give us a loan from your old style of car
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

From Argentina to Zanzibar
Not go no place with me strum on guitar
Because we're heavy, we heavy, heavy, heavy
SuperHeavy, SuperHeavy

We're superheavy in love
We're superheavy trusting
Superheavy, in love, yes we are!

Yeah. its about real heavy. its about mercy
Large amount. you understand?
Excess heaviness. heaviest
Heavyweight title holder
Heavyweight contenders, you understand?
Ha! huge! yeah!

Pep up! pep up! pep up!

Heavy! superheavy!
