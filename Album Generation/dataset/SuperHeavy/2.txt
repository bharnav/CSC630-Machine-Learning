[Damian Marley]
Now this one reaching out to all the lovers
Who might be thinking of breaking up... huh!
Or maybe, even, making up... check it!

[Joss Stone & Damian Marley]
I missed a part of you I can't get back
Don't be a silly nilly
I'm always here for you
Through the thick and thin not just because we argue
See I wanted to be true, but I can't do that
Why not, what's stopping you? Don't be preposterous
I've got a lot of love, not just a lot of lust
If I only was a fool, I'd be loving
Well that's your own opinion and you're entitled to it
I'll be lost in oblivion if we don't continue through it

[Mick Jagger]
There's nothing wrong with you I can't fix
I come a-runnin' with my little bag o' tricks
In an emergency, I'm very well prepared
My scalpel, mask and gloves; don't ever get too scared

[All, Damian Marley]
Ooh, you're a miracle worker
Ooh, you're the surgeon of love (you have a medical condition)
Ooh, can't wait to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again if you work your miracles on me

[A. R. Rahman]
Oooooohhhhh

[Joss Stone & Damian Marley]
Your mentality was fresh, it touched my soul, ooh
Invigorating and refreshing and interesting and it feels right
My heart was drowning in stress, but you brought out the best in me
And the way you make me feel after wonder if I realize

{Mick Jagger}
My love and laser will regenerate your heart
No need for anesthetics, I'll go check your charts
I will reshape you, recast you from the mold
A brand new beautiful woman will blossom from the old, oh

[All]
Ooh, you're a miracle worker (yes you are)
Ooh, you're the surgeon of love (you have a medical condition)
Ooh, came await to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again if you work your miracles on me

Ooooh, [?]
Ooooh, [?]
Ohhh  miracle worker

Ooh, you're a miracle worker, yeah
Ooh, you're the surgeon of love (you have a medical condition)
Ooh, came await to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again if you work your miracles on me


Work your miracles on me
