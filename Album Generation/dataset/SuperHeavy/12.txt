Two warring people
Who see no reason
Two warring people
Suffering now

There's no forgetting
And no forgiving
Two warring people
No way out - there's no way out

And I laid down in the field of flowers
And watched the clouds roll by
Imagined all the withered souls
Rising to the sky

Two warring people
Going around in circles
Two warring people
Always in chains - always in chains

There is no answer
Only a cancer
Two warring people
Always in pain - always in pain

I walked along the (...)
I heard the willows cry
The waves rolled in, the dirty wind
They drowned a million sighs

Salaam, salaam, salaam, salaam
Conhara, conchita, conhara, conchita
Salaam, salaam, salaam, salaam
Conhara, conchita, conhara, conchita

Salaam, salaam, salaam, salaam
Conhara, conchita, conhara, conchita - salaam, salaam, salaam, salaam
Salaam, salaam, salaam, salaam

Don't you worry, don't you worry
(...) movie star-y

And it's hollow (...)
(...) anxiety
It's appalling (...)
(...) just stalling

(...) and you're warring - together
In your colour and with your culture - we say love
(...) and the army - say it with me now
(...) is coming - no more

Someone tell me

How do we forget the past
For the peoples' reconnections
(...) together
We'd be fighting for the same cause

(...)
They seem to have no remorse
(...) yeah
Salaam conchita

Together
We say love

Don't worry, don't worry - no more
(...)
We have no idea how it started - together
Is is true (...) - we say love

Don't worry, do not worry - say it with me now, now, now, now, now, now
In the colour and the culture - now, now, now, now, now, now

Together
Say it with me now, no more - no, no more
Now together, we say love
No more, no more
