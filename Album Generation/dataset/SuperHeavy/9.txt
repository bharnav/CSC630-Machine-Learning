Ah yeah
What the fuck is going on?

All you scurvy politicians
When you're in opposition
You promise me this
You swear you'll do that
You all sound like magicians

I can't take it, take it
I can't fake it no more (can't fake it no more)
I can't take it, shake it
I can't fake it no more (can't take it no more)

You got ruthless ambition
Crying endless contrition
It really gets my goat
It sticks in my throat
You're defying demolition

I can't take it, take it
I can't fake it no more (can't fake it no more)
I can't take it, shake it
I can't fake it no more (can't take it no more)
No more

The stink of corruption
It gets right up my nostrils
With your head in the trough
Your snout starts to froth
You're gonna blow like a volcanic eruption

I can't take it, take it
I can't fake it no more (can't fake it no more)
I can't take it, shake it
I can't fake it no more (can't take it no more)

(i'm gonna break you. no trouble.)
I can't take it, take it
I can't fake it no more
No more, no more, no more
