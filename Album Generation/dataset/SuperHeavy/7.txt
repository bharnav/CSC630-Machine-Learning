Hey, all you beautiful people
Don't let your life go by
Spark it up, live it up right now
Hey, you beautiful people
Don't let 'em dim us down (don't let 'em dim you down)
Spark it up, live it up right now!

Hmm, my identifications
Been stolen and been taken
Where my locations
Barely cryptic while I'm singing this song for you
Singing this song for you right now
So what you gonna do, baby?

Hey, all you beautiful people
Don't let your life go by
Spark it up, live it up right now
Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let them dim us down
Spark it up, live it up right now

Watch where you step...
...on my spot...
...carrying loser that I...
Go for creepy crawlers, Spiderman, Peter Parker
Kingston London, now you're a New Yorker
SuperHeavy

Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let them dim you down
Spark it up, live it up all right now
Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let them dim your life, oh no
Spark it up, live it up all right now

All right
Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let your life go by, oh no
Spark it up, live it up all right now
Hey, all of you beautiful people, beautiful people
Don't let your life go by, oh no
Spark it up, live it up all right now

Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let 'em your life dim down, oh no no
Spark it up, live it up all right now
Hey, all of you beautiful people
Don't let 'em dim us down
Spark it up, live it up right now

Hey
Hey
Beautiful people

And don't let...
Shine out, don't let 'em out ya
Don't care if they doubt ya
Shine bright or let 'em out ya
Don't care if they doubt ya
Shine bright or let 'em out ya
Don't care if they doubt ya
Shine bright or let 'em out ya
Don't care if they doubt ya
Shine bright or let 'em out ya
Spark it up, live it up right now
