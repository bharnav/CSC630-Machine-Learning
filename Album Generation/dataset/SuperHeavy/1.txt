Beautiful girl walks slowly
Young men all look on
The first rose is a pleasure to my nose
The wine is a cool in the club

Some say the night is lonely
Some say the night is young
But night is the time for fantasy
The fantasy of love

It's unbelievable
Never wanna give it up
It's unbelievable
Never wanna give it up

You say, where's the rub?
Nothing lasts forever, baby, ain't u heard?
You say, where's the rub?
Life is an illusion and its so unjust

You ask, where's the rub?
You say, where's the rub?
Life is but a dream and I will turn to dust

Out of the sight of moonlight
The stars in the dome above
Your hair is waving in the wind
Are you ready for love? Are you ready?

Whether you believe or fathom in a eve or adam
The world of particles molecules and atoms
Living organisms into organized patterns
Living the life you love, you better love it with a passion

It's unbelievable
Never wanna give it up
It's unbelievable
Never wanna give it up

You say, where's the rub?
Nothing lasts forever, baby, ain't u heard?
You say, where's the rub?
Life is an illusion and its so unjust

You say, where's the rub?
You say, where's the rub?
Life is but a dream and I will turn to dust

Forever
Forever

Some say the nights are lonely
Some say the night is young
Night is the time, night is the time for fantasy
The fantasy of love

Never wanna give it up
Never wanna give it up
Never wanna give it up
It's unbelievable
Never wanna give it up

Give me the kinda gat that cause a real revolution
Don't care your race nor culture nor fashion
Life worth much more than gold and cash-in
Living every moment with true compassion

Unbelievable
Never gonna, never gonna give it up
Unbelievable
Never gonna give it up
