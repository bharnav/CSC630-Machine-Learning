The wind hit my back, cold as I remember
And caught me off guard, in the middle of December
Sometimes a crowded room, can feel the most alone
Sometimes I wonder why, I won't pick up the phone when

This wall is glaring and it's too high for me to climb
I've ran and ran and now there's nothing left behind
I see a picture of a broken man inside
I've tried and tried and now there's nothing left but time

And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone
Together we will fly tonight
And leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you

These hands can feel like they're not even mine
A tree and a nail and a cry in the night
Sometimes a little step is the greatest divide
Sometimes I feel your breath right at my side when

This wall is glaring and it's too high for me to climb
I've ran and ran and now there's nothing left behind
I see a picture of a broken man inside
I've tried and tried and now there's nothing left but time

And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone
Together we will fly tonight
And leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you

Here I am at the edge of the road
One hand on the end of the rope
One crack and it breaks alone
Wondering who's gonna take me home
On my knees when you call my bluff
Begging please from the edge of the ruff
And I know when I've had enough, and I know it, and I know it

I see a picture of a broken man inside
I've tried and tried and now there's nothing left but time

And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you alone

Wait here, stay here, say you're the only one
I need, I know and I'm holding
Together we will fly tonight
And leave all of the rest behind

I'll wait for you, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
And I'll wait here, stay here, say you're the only one
I need, I know and I'm holding, yeah
I'll wait for you
