[Verse 1]
You fight me, flat on my lonely face I fell
Finding in the end I'll live well
In the light of the life that I have found
It's coming down
I don't know what isn't real
But it's easy to be me, suck it in
Life is sink or swim
Love is blinding, no surviving
I don't know what I want to be yet
But I can show that I need to see this
No time for lies and empty fights
I'm on your side

[Bridge]
Can't we live a life of peace of happiness?
I don't think so
No denying I am scared to lose the things I love
I'm in control

[Chorus]
This is how, this is how it's going to end
This is how, this is how it's going to end
End

[Bridge 2]
Everyone is waiting for here for everyone
Leave me alone

[Chorus]
This is how, this is how it's going to end
This is how, this is how it's going to end
End
