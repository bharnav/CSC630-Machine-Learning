[Verse 1]
Fruit on the vine
You've got yours, and I've got mine
Meat on your bones
They won't know, they won't know

[Hook]
I love your face, just get away
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me

[Verse 2]
I'm on my way to feel you dislocate
Safe in your space
I'm open, wide open

[Hook]
I love your face, just get away
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me

Like me
Like me
Like me

[Hook]
I love your face, just get away
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me

Me
Me
Me
