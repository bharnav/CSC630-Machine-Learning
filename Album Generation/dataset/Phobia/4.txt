[Verse 1]
Hold it together, birds of a feather
Nothing but lies and crooked wings
I have the answer, spreading the cancer
You are the faith inside me

[Bridge]
No, don't leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone, don't remember, remember

[Chorus]
Put me to sleep evil angel
Open your wings evil angel

[Verse 2]
I'm a believer, nothing could be worse
All these imaginary friends
Hiding the trail, driving the nail
Hoping to find a saviour

[Bridge]
No, don’t leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone, don’t surrender, surrender

[Chorus]
Put me to sleep evil angel
Open your wings evil angel


[Outro]
Fly over me evil angel
Why can't I breathe evil angel?
