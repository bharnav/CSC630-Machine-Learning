[Verse 1]
So clever, whatever, I'm done with these endeavors
Alone I walk the winding way (Here I stay)
It's over, no longer, I feel it growing stronger
I live to die another day
Until I fade away

[Hook]
Why give up? Why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

[Verse 2]
Surround me, it's easy to fall apart completely
I feel you creeping up again (in my head)
It's over, no longer, I feel it growing colder
I knew this day would come to end
So let this life begin

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I've lost my way, I've lost my way
But I will go on until the end
Living is hard enough without you fucking up

[Hook]
I've lost my way, I've lost my way
But I will go on until the end
The final fight I win
The final fight I win
The final fight I win
But I will go on until the end
