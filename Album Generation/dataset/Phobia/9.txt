[Verse 1]

Borderline, dead inside
I don't mind, falling to pieces
Count me in, violent
Let's begin feeding the sickness
How do I simplify?
Dislocate, the enemy's on the way

[Chorus]
Show me what it's like
To dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight

[Verse 2]

Full of fear, ever clear
I'll be here, fighting forever
Curious, venomous
You'll find me climbing to heaven
Never mind, turn back time
You'll be fine, I will get left behind

[Chorus]

Holding on too tight
Breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world tonight

[Bridge]

It only hurts just once
They're only broken bones
Hide the hate inside

[Chorus]
