[Ritual Of Communication]

Conspiring with the damned
Contact the other side
Converse with the deceased
Corrupt your virgin mind

We cannot comprehend a cold dead in between
The roaming spirit world where the living do not see
"It's just a game"...

Revealing horrid secrets
Identity unknown
What started out in innocence
With evil, it has grown

The opening of gateways obscene
The ancient horror, on this evening, will unfold
A wretched curse on thine own family
You'll wish the dead you'd never sought to know

Decrypting the words of the deceased
Of molestations of murder and disease
Hatred fueled by a searing jealousy
Forever fleshless— enshamed, they long to be

The secrets of our fate the dead have seen
Masquerading as a friend, initially
Profane possession, nightmare reality
Just place your hands upon the planchette and believe

Don't look now, the walls are bleeding
Crucifixes are inverting
Candles, black, are sickly burning
Throughout the air are pages whirling

You’ll pray to God to see you through the night
You’ll embrace a God, feeling threatened for your life
A twisting demon's face you'll come before in a dream
The damned abhorrent dead find refuge in your screams

Witness them speak...

The opening of gateways obscene
The ancient horror, on this evening, will unfold
A wretched curse on thine own family
You'll wish the dead you'd never sought to know
