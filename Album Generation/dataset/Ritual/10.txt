[Ritual Of Emancipation]

Deny this hell of their design
O' great burning nullifier
Almighty alterer
Perception's transformation

No mistress so harsh as this world
Guide us to the smallest beauties
Something to worship in a realm so godless

Take us away
Suffocate the day
The sands of time doth grate
We wrecks of nerves await salvation

Willing is our sedation
Lethargic our rejection
Prefer to take it on in sleep
May your magick comfort me

A higher power here on Earth
Do speak now, the hidden language
Traversing vast expanses
Locked within the convolutions

Gaze hard into our reddened eyes
The cracked stare of liberation
Agents to the numb
The pain of a trite, empty existence

We, lifted spirits, converge in flame
Great nullifier— coloring the greys
Terminal boredom, light and evade
Our prayers are Earthen— a ritual escape

Sanity is a full time job
In a world that’s always changing
Sanity, so quietly, is kept
Resisting archaic tradition

Now pass some down!

Take us away
Suffocate the day
The sands of time doth grate
We wrecks of nerves await salvation

Willing is our sedation
Lethargic our rejection
Prefer to take it on in sleep
May your magick comfort me

So bring us laughter
Coalesce in haze
Sweet nullifier accentuates

Gather the masses
Burn and celebrate
Our prayers unholy
The ritual remains

We, lifted spirits, converge in flame
Great nullifier— coloring the greys
Terminal boredom, light and evade
Our prayers are Earthen— a ritual escape
