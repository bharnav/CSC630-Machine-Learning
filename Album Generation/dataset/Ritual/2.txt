[Ritual Of Condemnation]

Oceans of madness, darkened
Alone, on hell, she rides
Lichen, undead and rotten
Dripping and dignified

She combs with violence
Upon the wailing storm
This spectral ship of doomed purgation barrels on awry

On stirring seas of salted blood
Condemned to forge her sails forevermore
Enslaved, her hull will never reach the shores
Damning these waters of irony filth

Beneath the stench of crimson winds
Her sails of flesh betorn
Red skeletons are oaring
The plasma stains their bones

Her rusting cannons fire blindly in the mist
This haunted vessel lost and damned
The prisoners of her endless quest

A burial at ancient sea
That cannot rest in fucking peace

The crew of wraith-like revenants
Merely seek peace and reverence
From purgatorial permanence
Their cursed bondage has no end

On, they ride
Through the throes of endless night
Her will never dies!

[Guitar Solo]

The compass pointing straight to hell
And that is where they're going
Beaten by curling waves of red
The storm, no signs of slowing now

On stirring seas of salted blood
Condemned to forge her sails forevermore
Enslaved, her hull will never reach the shores

Damning these waters of irony filth
Scabbed with the blood of ones they have killed
The ghosts of war must soldier on!
