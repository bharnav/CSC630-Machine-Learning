[Ritual Of Abduction]

I sodomize the young and dying
Sick hunger is my vice— my lust
To drip my rotten seed upon their cooling flesh, so fare
Of their gurgled screams, I could never hear enough

Bless their puny hearts and their sweet naiveties
Praise those little lemmings, but rats unto the piper
Bless those putrid beasts— their innocence, my blade's eager to meet
May my song of hatred lead them forever downward

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes
Ten seconds is the window— another child has met his fate
I hold the grisly treasure skyward, have a laugh into its face
Bless all Earth's most precious children with my blackened love insane

I've come to revel in the horror
No words nor nightmare could describe
The erotic waves of lurid rapture
That moment when they realize

Bless those little wonders and their curiosities
Praise those little maggots, but lambs unto my slaughter
A blessed life so cheap— their perfect flesh will be the ideal treat
May my song of worship bring them ever closer

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes
Ten seconds is the window— another child has met his fate
I hold the grisly treasure skyward, have a laugh into its face
Bless all Earth’s most precious children with my blackened love insane

I'm insane!

How they'll be hunting for us nightly
Tirelessly combing to no end
Your shameful death to be in a shroud of mystery
You'll never see the light of day again

Slitting their bellies open wide— so wide!
A great delight to look inside— inside!
I sit upon their chests until they cease
Expressionless— ejaculating whilst they die

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes
Ten seconds is the window— another child has met his fate
I hold the grisly treasure skyward, have a laugh into its face
Bless all Earth's most precious children with my blackened love insane
