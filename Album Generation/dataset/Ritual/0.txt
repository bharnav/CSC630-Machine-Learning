[Ritual Of Celebration]

"Let us go out this evening for pleasure...
...for the night is still young!"
Let us dance, skeletally
The chill of the autumn is stirring in me

Let us rape, let us murder
A night to sate thine perverted desires
A night on which to watch them die
To see the life whisked from the inside

A night so black as Satan's hide
When we ghouls do come alive
When the masks of mockery
Shall disguise our wicked eyes

To the death of all
Celebrate the empty breath of Fall
The 31st t'will not go silent
So long as evil doth dwell in man

Devil's night t'was a scorcher
But on this eve we bring hell

Here, in the season of the dead
Sanity hangs by a thread
We're descendants of the dark
Give us back our one true love

Manifest all hallows eve
Samhain grim, our one true love
No, you shan't kill Halloween
For we've bore it in our blood

Embrace ye the brown-leafed vertigo
For this undead night we have sold our souls
Hoist ye this black flag of blasphemy
Lift high this emblem of hate

Return the jack-o-lantern's smile
On this holiday for the defiled
Shed the thorned binds of Christ's denial
And so, let the devil in

Cultus diabolus
Laus ut flamma
Cultus obscurum
Amplexus fatum

Rejoice now, ye hellions of Earth
A glimpse of a future not far
When the dark one is said to return
Blackening this planet with ire

Let us rape, let us murder
A night to sate thine perverted desires
A thrill that cannot be quantified
To warm one's hands upon arson's fires

May the spoils of this evening rot our teeth to the gums
May the treats of our enemies sever their lying tongues

Here, in the season of the dead
Sanity hangs by a thread
We're descendants of the dark
Give us back our one true love

Manifest all hallows eve
Samhain grim, our one true love
No, you shan't kill Halloween
For we've bore it in our blood

In our blood!
