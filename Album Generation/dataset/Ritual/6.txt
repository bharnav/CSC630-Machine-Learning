[Ritual Of Mutilation]

Slicing, stabbing, hacking, maiming
Shredding, severing, rearranging
Mincing, dicing, mutilating
Surpassing mere dreams or masturbatings

Flowers of flesh and blood
Enthralling, unruptured skin
An empty easel, appalling

Dismemberment is my expression
This weapon is my sex phallic
My every thrust gaining
An entrance to the red

Your blood, your blood
Your blood is what I need
The sight, the smellâ€” the taste of it
Beside myself with glee

Posing your body to humiliate
Beyond recognition, my knives perforate

Den of the picquerist!
Den of the picquerist!
Den of the picquerist!
Den of the picquerist!
