[Ritual Of Observation]

Through midnight skies on desert winds
Bearing tidings of warfare
Of endless pestilence

Familiar to the darkened one
Empowering thalamic sign, immortalize
We bow to none!

Weak Christian lepers are fading fast
Enhungered beaks accept their flesh
Necrotic skin, dissolving
The Devil's will looming
A reach ever-boundless and omnipotent

With radiance, the hellbird soars
Anathematizing victims
Curse them with hatred from our lord

On wings of blackened grandeur ride
Envenoming our weaponry
With supernatural strength we strike

Sad Christian failures to fade at last
Bewinged fiends consume what’s left
Necrotic skin, erupting
The dark lord is laughing
Your father, forsaken, faithlessly
Suffer endlessly

Bird of omens—
Ill harbinger of blight
The raven waits—
With vengeance in his sights

"Do as thou wilt" is the whole of our law
This world befallen within blackened claws
Quarantined, contaminated
Destitute camps of putrefying

Grace plague on this world
Eliminated, raven returns
Reeking of their mass graves

Harken to his voice
Uphold our blackened creed
Their god be dead

Bird of omens—
Ill harbinger of blight
The raven waits—
With hatred in his eyes
