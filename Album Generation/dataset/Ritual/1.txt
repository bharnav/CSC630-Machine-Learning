[Intro]:
A code embedded deep within
Encrypted in vaults of bone and skin
A tug magnetic toward the dark
The wolf voracious hath witnessed it’s mark

[Verse]:
Internal pressure growing behind your eyes
It’s mounting still
Constant thoughts of evil are coming to a head inside you
Humanity decreasing
Blood is strong upon the passing winds
To forsake would be a sin
Let the night entrance you

[Chorus]:
You’ll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We’re all but beasts that hunger from inside
Cannot escape this longing

[Verse]:
These symptoms don’t remit for death
Becoming sick
The long hairs
Feel them stand
The nightworld calls again
Your existence turning black
There’ll be no coming back
A desire to tear and hack
It’s growing lord
Please help us

[Chorus]:
You’ll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We’re all but beasts that hunger from inside
You must subdue this yearning to feast

[Bridge]:
That very eve the devil cameth
And his will did force thine idle hands
Open his heart of molten darkness
Floweth forth foul rivers of the damned

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]:
Blood of the lycan within thee
Enthroned heir to their cosmic fathers unknown
Who traileth not far from where death would increase
Seek they to murder
To rid this world clean
A curse by the ancients of bloodline befouled
The clouds they are parting
The moon has come out

[Verse]:
Internal pressure growing behind your eyes
Its mounting still
Constant thoughts of evil are coming to a head inside you
Humanity decreasing
Blood is strong upon the passing winds
To forsake would be a sin
Let the night entrance you

[Chorus]:
You’ll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We’re all but beasts that hunger from inside
Cannot repress these urges to kill
To taste the red your only will
There’s no salvation
