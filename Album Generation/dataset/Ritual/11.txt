[Ritual Of Indoctrination]

It’s time— go get the gun
The one your family's hiding from
Sleeping in the dresser drawer
Do pull its trigger, I implore

Shoot your parents, then yourself
Push your life right off the shelf
Die for metal, leave this hell
Take this oath of blasphemation

When asked to kill— you won't or will
Casting aside the weak
When lord Belial, your name, he calls
Conquer or wallow in defeat

Blood in the ink!

The unholy writ on contract for your soul
Of your feeble peasant mind, we have control
We yank these hidden strings
The ones that make the razors go
We’re cancelling your favorite show
We’ve pulled the plug
We’ve closed the curtain

Drinketh deep now, this cup of poison
And drag a blade right through your veins
Slaughtering every soul around you
Of mortality, you'll take the reigns

Broken your bones in violent ritual
Tattooed black, your flesh in our name
We ask you now to wield the razor
At our command, you'll worship pain

Calligraphy in crimson ink
Thick and dark, each stroke
I hereby swear my life to him
Here is the sacred parchment—

Now part your skin and sign below:

When asked to kill— you won't or will
Casting aside the weak
When lord Belial, your name, he calls
Conquer or wallow in defeat

Blood in the ink!

Drinketh deep now, this cup of poison
And drag a blade right through your veins
Slaughtering every soul around you
Of mortality, you'll take the reigns

Broken your bones in violent ritual
Tattooed black, your flesh in our name
We ask you now to wield the razor
At our command, let your life drain

(Suicide is the only way out...)
