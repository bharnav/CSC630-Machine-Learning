Ancient human obelisk awakens from centuries of dust
Imprisoned in obsidian
A horrid golemesque abomination
The man of stone
Black soul within the ebon bone
Carved by the mad gods
Born from the mountains hull
Scrolls of blackened magick
Unearth this hateful will anthropomorphous
Propelling forward slow and sluggish
But rumbling to life
Beyond those whiteless eyes
A blinded rage of hatred, torment, and frustration
Eons of suffering
Eternal is the conflagration to crumble every feeble being
Found destruction his means of expressing

Juggernaut of endless enmity
Leaned hands equipped for throttling
The heartless devils who've bound him here
With malenchanments of the necrosphere
The end is near

His poisoned heart is pumping somewhere deep inside
From weakness armored for
When the skulls of man his flesh collides
Soldier of solitude
Of elemental pain
Driven to insanity when stone his form
Became incarcerated in his skin
Emancipate him from his sin
He once stood just like me
A peasant full of apathy
Petrified his family tree
Shake free from the chains of bondage and arise
Kill
Storm the mortals land
Unraveling his plan
Fists of iron swinging
Erase this Earth
Enraged in rain filled footsteps lie the dead and broken
The crushed and splintered
Untimely their demise

Juggernaut of endless enmity
Leaned hands equipped for throttling the heartless devils
That have bound him here
With malenchanments of the necrosphere
