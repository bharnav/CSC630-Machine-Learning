[Ritual Of Desecration]

The grave robber's work is never done
It's "up all night" and "sleep all day"
The hours are shit, with hell to pay

Pockets are brimming from our unique brand of sinning
When the ladies claw my back at night
I know I’m doing something right

I deliver the goods as long as they don't ask
Deny, deny, deny...
I’m a working stiff like dear old dad

And to you and yours—
Nothing but curses
You’ll slave your life away—
And for what?
You’re just as dead as these old fucks!

They’ll never get me
I'll never run out of stock
With every second that ticks past
The bodies, they're still stacking up

So I've clipped a few fingers off
To get that gold for which I lust
From the deadman's bank and trust
To the depths of hell or bust!

The blackened bits of exhumed evidence
Embedded 'neath my fettered fingernails
It's but a smallish part of what our dirty work entails
Come dance with me

This graveyard planet you've called Earth
You hold in such a high regard
It's but as worthless as a turd!
Will you follow me into the dark?
Will you follow me into the dark?

I rob the dead for what they're worth
Jewels, wealth, clothing, sex
When the mood prefers

To carve a sullen path through life
Within the fallen's shoes
You'd turn your nose at me
Although I smell of sheik perfumes

So I've clipped a few fingers off
To get that gold for which I lust
From the deadman's bank and trust
To the depths of hell or bust!

I'm haunted by faces when I try to close my eyes
So deeply it festers— the guilt is murder...

The blackened bits of exhumed evidence
Embedded 'neath my fettered fingernails
It's but a smallish part of what our dirty work entails

May the gods have mercy!
May the gods have mercy, oh!
