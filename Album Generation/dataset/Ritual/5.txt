[Ritual Of Conjuration]

The circle of bones has been sealed
Prepared for these most ancient rites
Three virgin cunts, arrested by chains
Gut them like pigs— let their filthy blood drain

Dark astral sigils brand their bruised backs
With eyes disembodied, enshroud them in black
Moaning, defeated— mere inches from death
We reach out to you, master, with this offering of flesh

Cremation of the captured
Inhaling the funeral plumes
Torches besoaked and then set ablaze
Accept now this token of dreck, death, and doom

Observing communion— satanic elite
Nails through the midst of the lamb's hands and feet
Affixing with hammers— a spear through the side
Staked with conviction as if it were Jesus Christ

Impaled and hung up high, there
Three of their most rotten thieves
In a black recreation, so hideous and foul
Of when this sickening lie was so deftly conceived

Unearthly ritual— bloodlet thine human sow
In flames, his face appears
Black intentions— crystal clear

Darkly, the mass has encircled
In silence, the hooded look on
The skies, they are threatening terrible storms
Protesting this crucifixion

So hear me now and rise up from the flames
Twisting leviathan
Our path, left-handed
We bear the bestial markings spelling doom

O' master, rear your horned head
Master, exhale your acrid breath
We are your humble servants
We bow before your blackened essence, true

Unearthly ritual— bloodlet thine human sow
In flames, his face appears
Black intentions— crystal clear

Accept our sacrifice
Their blood will giveth voice
Carbonized in cruciform
Black inversion of the one called "Lord"
