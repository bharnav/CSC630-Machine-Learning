[Verse 1]
Time for the final bow
Rows of deserted houses all
Our stable mates highway bound

[Verse 2]
Give us our measly sum
Getting the air inside my lungs
Is heavenly starting out
With nothing but crippling doubt

[Bridge]
We'll rest easy
Justified

[Verse 3]
Suffered a swift defeat
I'll endure countless repeats
The gift of memories
An awful curse
With age, it just gets much worse

[Coda]
But I won't mind
I won't mind
