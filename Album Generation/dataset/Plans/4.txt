[Verse 1]
Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 3]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

[Chorus]
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Outro]
Then I'll follow you into the dark
