It was 100 degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree whose tears didn't care
They just hung in the air and refused to fall
And I knew I'd made a horrible call and now the state line felt like the Berlin Wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on
Cause I built you a home in my heart with rotten wood and it decayed from the start

And you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along

I braved treacherous streets and kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all
Cause at night the sun in retreat made the skyline look like crooked teeth in the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech
But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave

And you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along

I'm a war of head versus heart and it's always this way
My head is weak and my heart always speaks before I know what it will say

And you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along
There were churches, theme parks and malls but there was nothing there all along
