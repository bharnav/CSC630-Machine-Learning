You think that money is everything
And yet it's anybody's spring
Go make a fortune, become a king
And still it's anybody's spring

And if you flash a bank roll
Do you suppose a brook would care?
Or that a rose would say:
"There goes a millionaire!"

It's more than diamonds around a ring
Because it's anybody's spring
You may be born with a silver spoon
And yet it's anybody's moon

You couldn't buy a ticket
To hear the first robin sing
It's free because
It's anybody's spring

It's more than diamonds around a ring
Because it's anybody's spring
You may be born with a silver spoon
And yet it's anybody's moon

You couldn't buy a ticket
To hear the first robin sing
It's free because, oh it's free because
It's free because it's anybody's spring

It's anybody's spring
It's anybody's spring
