She said nine o'clock, she said nine o'clock
Can I just keep breathing 'til nine o'clock?
Little heart, will you please hold together?
Till she's here, standing near again

Then at nine o'clock, we may see a sight
Like the world's first rainbow to glow at night
And if we get a kiss just then
We'll see miracles from nine to ten

She said nine o'clock, she said nine o'clock
Can I just keep on breathing until nine o'clock?
Little heart, won't you please hold together?
Until she's here, standing so near again

Because at nine o'clock, we may see a sight
Like the world's first rainbow to glow at night
And if we get a kiss just then
We'll see miracles from nine to ten
