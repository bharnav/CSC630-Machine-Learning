Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are, just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night

Here we are, gee, don't we look a mess?
Lipstick on my collar and wrinkles in my dress
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night

Here we are, crazy in the head
Gee, your eyes are gorgeous even when they're red
Two sleepy people who know very well
They're too much in love to break the spell

Do you remember the nights we used to cuddle in the car?
Watching every last fading star
Remember the doctor said your health was under par
And you, my little shnooks were ruining your looks

Well, here we are, keeping up the pace
Letting each tomorrow slap us in the face
Two sleepy people by dawn's early night
And too much in love to say good night
