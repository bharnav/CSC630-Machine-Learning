The night they invented champagne
It's plain as it could be
They thought of you and me

The night they invented champagne
They absolutely knew
That all we'd wanna do

Is fly to the sky on champagne and shout to everyone in sight
That since the world began, a woman and a man
Have never been as happy as we are tonight

It's as plain as it could be
That they thought of you and me

And they absolutely knew
That all we'd wanna do

And shout real loud to everyone in sight
That since the world began, a woman and a man
Have never been as happy as we are tonight

We will fly to the sky on champagne
And shout to everyone in sight
That since the world began, a woman and a man
Have never been as happy as we are tonight
