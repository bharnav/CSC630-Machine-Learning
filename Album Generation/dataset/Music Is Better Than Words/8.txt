We quarreled and we spatted
From morning until night
We used to think it funny
But now it isn't quite the laughs it was before
So if you'll open the door
I'll bother you no more

My little chick-a-dee
You may say that you're through with me
You'll have no more to do with me
You're all through with me and good day
But you'll find that love won't let you get away

I'll find an area more remote than Bavaria
I'll still get in the hair of you
In Bavaria or Bombay
And you'll find that love won't let you get away

It's finis and done with [Who will you have fun with?]
You're no laughs to be with [Who'll you watch T.V. with?]
You're no one to pine for [Who'll you chill the wine for?]
This is too-da-loo, we're through

Just leave no trace at all
Hide your heart any place at all
I won't miss your embrace at all or that face at all come what may
Darling girl, I hope this won't upset you
But I'd like to bet you
Love won't let you get away

Darling you astound me [Put your arms around me]
But we're through completely [But you kiss so sweetly]
Must you always flatter [Must you always chatter at times like this]
Let's kiss

Well here we go again
Caught in love's undertow again
Latching on to that glow again
Here we go again
Hip hooray!

Let the cynics laugh and try to get us
Their doubts won't upset us
Love won't let us get away

Love won't let us get away
