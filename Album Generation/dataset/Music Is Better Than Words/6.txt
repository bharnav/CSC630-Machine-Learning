Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked miserable past
I must have had a moment of truth

For here you are, standing there
Loving me whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

For here you are, standing there
Loving me whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or very wicked childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So some where in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good
