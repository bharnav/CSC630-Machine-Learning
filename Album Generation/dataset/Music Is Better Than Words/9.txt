Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met
It's easy to remember, so hard to forget

I hear you whisper "I'll always love you"
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember
And so hard to forget

So I must dream to have your hands caress me
Fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling
Stealing softly through the night

Each little moment is so clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember
And so hard to forget

Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me, brings me regret
It's easy to remember
And so hard to forget
