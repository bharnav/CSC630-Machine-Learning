You're the cream in my coffee
You're the salt in my stew
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

You're the starch in my collar
You're the lace in my shoe
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

Now, most men tell love tales
And each phrase dovetails
You've heard each known way
This way is my own way, dear

You're the sail in my love boat
You're the captain and crew
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you

Now, most guys tell love tales
And each phrase dovetails
You've heard each known way
This way is my own way, dear

You're the sail in my love boat
You're the captain and crew
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you
