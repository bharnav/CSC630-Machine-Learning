Darling, you and I know the reason why
Those summer skies are blue
And we know why birds in the trees
Sing melodies too

And why love will grow from the first hello
Until the last goodbye
So to sweet romance, there is just one answer
You and I

Darling, you, you and I, we know the very reason why
Those sunny summer skies are so blue
And we know why those birds in the trees
Sing happy melodies too

And why love is gonna grow from the very first hello
'Til the very last goodbye
So to a sweet romance, there is just one answer
You, you and I

And why love will grow from the very first hello
'Til the very last goodbye
So to a sweet romance, there is just one answer
You and I
