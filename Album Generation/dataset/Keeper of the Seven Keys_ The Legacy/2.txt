My mother died close to me
And while I lie sobbin' here
This world's going down with fear
Armies of minions is all I see
Creatures in anguish no place to flee
Living their nightmares the fall from grace
And so I'm standing here...

I was born on judgement day
And I have no words to say
Don't know goof or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you

There's no one beside me
I'm shuddering wearily
Utterly destitute and all...
Nobility has left mankind
Turned into vultures, bewildered eyes
Shoved to the abyss, a twisting whirl
Under the blood red sky

I was born on judgement day
And I have no words to say
Don't know goof or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you

Solos: Both – Weiki – Dani – Markus – Sascha - both

I was born on judgement day
And I have no words to say
Don't know goof or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you
