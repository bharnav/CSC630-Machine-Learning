I am the one who wants to show
You a secret of your cheating world
Wherever I will go, no-one can see me
Cause I'm the invisible man

I'm a creature with one goal
Rise up to Heaven
When the time has come
I have no body, but a soul
God's law is written on my way, forever

Time by time, I think it's over
The malediction I have got
When the world was young
Been captured in the name of God
To save people, but who cares?
Who cares?
Since a thousand years
Till the holy land will come

Here I am
The invisible man
A lost fallen Angel
Helping mankind where I can
My memories are there
To save your world
For you, I'm the invisible man

There's the destiny
You, don't you know?
I'm a guardian Angel
And whatever you will go
You'll fight through your life not alone
You can't hear me nor see me
But trust the holy flow

Here I am
The invisible man
A lost fallen Angel
Helping mankind where I can
My memories are there
To save your world
For you, I'm the invisible man

Here I am
The invisible man
A lost falling Angel
Helping mankind where I can
My memories are there
To save your world
For you, I'm the invisible man

Here I am
The invisible man
A lost fallen Angel, a lost fallen Angel
Helping mankind where I can
My memories are there
To save your world
For you, I'm the invisible man

I'm the invisible man, invisible man
Invisible man, a lost fallen Angel
Invisible man, invisible man
Invisible man, invisible man
A lost fallen Angel
