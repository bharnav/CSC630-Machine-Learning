Why...don't you...pick today...to be the day
That you...decide...for the first time not to lie

Do you talk to death
Overfed and programmed
What's the pain on your head
Of the world's eye

You can't let it go
You can't let it go
You can't let it go
You can't let it go

And if you can't find your way to a better world
Set your will inside
All the inside's live within your mind

I've been to the ends of the earth and
I've seen what it means to be dead and
This land is the best from the west, man
Rise up, pick your line of distraction

Why...don't you...pick today...to be the day
That you...decide...for the first time...this is your life

You can't let it go
You can't let it go
You can't let it go
You can't let it go

And if you can't find your way to a better world
Set your will inside
All the inside's live within your mind

I've seen what it takes to be free, man
Be bold, let go of the railing
These things can be had with a strong hand

Take what you want, it's yours, you can't let it go
Take what you want, it's yours, you can't let it go
Take what you want, it's yours, you can't let it go
Take what you want, it's yours, you can't let it go
Take what you want

It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time....
