You've got me spinning around your tornado
You keep on making me pay
You've got me comin' as soon as a ?
But you got nothing to say

It's the same old story
The same as the last time
How much more you think I can take
Play me like a fool and I'm down on my ?
Somehow I just can't get away

When I think of all your lies
Wonder what I ever did, to suffer you
We always make the same mistakes
This time I lay the burden down on you

I'll tell ya something I just don't understand
It's kind of tough to go and get a lesser man
You're so vain
?
I'm trying baby but I'm going insane
Out of my mind
Yeah

When I think of all your lies
Wonder what I ever did, to suffer you
We always make the same mistakes
This time I lay the burden down on you
