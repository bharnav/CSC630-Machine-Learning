Some of My fucked Up World

Send a little love
Only one where you should go
I want to take it real slow
I wanna drink your body down

Did?I know, I know, I know I didn't get enough
Let me show you some of my fucked up world
Do the music turn you on?
Do it make you higher?

Baby, are you down
For a trip to lost and found?
I wanna keep it on the ground
I wanna move you one more time

I know, I know, I know I didn't get enough
Let me show you some of my fucked up world
Do the music turn you on?
Do it make you higher?

Babe, I know? I know, I know, I didn't get enough
Let me show you some of my fucked up world
Do the music turn you on?
Do it make you higher?

Where did we go?

I thought I felt a vacancy
Took me straight through the night
I wonder, did you feel it?
I can be anything you hoped or could envision
Now, what ever happened to love?
What happened to our love?

I know, I know, I know I didn't get enough
Let me show you some of my fucked up world
Do the music turn you on?
Do it make you higher?

Shut up?I know, I know, I know I didn't get enough
Let me show you some of my fucked up world
Do the music turn you on?
Do it make you, do it make you higher?

Where did we go?
I thought I felt a vacancy
Took me straight through the night
I wonder, did you see it?
I can be anything you had hoped or could envision
Now, what ever happened to love?
What happened, happened to my love?
