Forgive me my presumption
Seems to be a problem here
Cannot weigh it all
But the signal's crystal clear

Oh, like animals
We hear the calls
The curtain falls
You fooled them all

Why you never see me here
Treat me like your dog
Wait 'til the day I rise
Never be undone

So I'm planning a rebellion
Oh, though you've demonized my eyes
But I see right through you baby
You won't blind me from your lies

I failed to mention to
These things that can't be said in words
Yeah
And you know you're running out
Why do it to me
When clearly you can set yourself free
And I can't give you that

Why you never see me here
Treat me like your dog
Wait 'til the day I rise
Never be undone

So many roads of life left to define
There's more to you
Or more to outshine
I must remind myself of one thing
I climbed the mountain just to get the truth
?
Pay the price just know that we're through
Now I'm running

Why didn't I forsee the end
Treat me like your dog
Wait 'til the day I rise
Never beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.... undone
