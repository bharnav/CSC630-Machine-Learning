Rollin' down the avenue
She said she wants to feel all right
Deprives me of the medicine
Then feel the drift in all of life

Close your eyes when you see me coming
Razor sharp
Do you know the kids plan
To make it true, to make it true, to make it true
Close your eyes when you see me coming
Razor sharp
Thinking of my master plan
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

Crawlin' up the boulevard
You know the kids can go all night
Deprives me of the medicine
(Crazy)
And feel the drift in all of life

Close your eyes when you see me coming
Razor sharp
Do you know the kids that plan
To make it true, to make it true, to make it true
Close your eyes when you see me coming
Razor sharp
Thinking of my master plan
To get to you, to get to you, to get you

Can you feel me
On the inside
Can't you see me
I'll be the one on fire
