Cry your eyes
I've seen this face a thousand times
Falling from my fantasy

Slipped inside
Your world to be
A victim of your sympathy

You seem to know
How to push the fire
That burns the box we live in

Isn't it a shame
The game persists like this
The game persists like this

Cry your eyes
I've seen this face a million times
Falling from my fantasy

Oh, slipped inside
Your world to be
A victim of your sympathy

Mmm, you seem to know
Just how to push the fire
Oh, that burns the box we live in

Certainty with indecision
You counter with pristine precision
And add to, you add to your shame

Falling
Falling out
Of love…with you babe

Falling
Falling out

Of love…with you!

Oh, you got me a sign
Oh, open up your eyes
Baby I know the deal
Oh, are you for real

Mmm, Cry your eyes
I've seen this face a million times, a million times
Falling from my fantasy

Slipped outside
Your world with me
A victim of your sympathy

Oh, you seem to know
How to push…you push

Oh, oh, yea
Isn't it a shame
The game persists like this
The game persists like this

Falling
Falling out
Of love…with you babe

Falling
Falling out
Of love…with you babe

Falling
Falling out
Of love…with you!

Falling out
Falling out of love with you
Falling out of love
