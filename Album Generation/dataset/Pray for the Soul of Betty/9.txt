The woods are oh so dangerous
Don't you wander off in them
Let me take you by the hand and show you
The way

To fear

Trippin' over myself
Flyin' no thanks to wealth
Feelin' everything that I see
Climbin' on up just to be me

I've gotta get outside myself
Gonna leave this human race
Gonna live like no one else
Listen just to what's inside of me

Line up children
Get in line
Find your partner
All hold hands up high

I've gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind oh

The woods are oh so dangerous
Let's go run around and then
Yeah
Let me take you by the hand and show you

The way

To feel, oh...

Line up children
Get in line
Find your partner
All hold hands up high

I've gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind oh...

Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
Gotta get my mind unclean
