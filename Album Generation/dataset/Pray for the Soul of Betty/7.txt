Hey whatcha' say
An empty day
Won't you be brave
You're everywhere
Oh you disappeared though

A grave mistake
For Heaven's sake
Ya did it all for Jesus
Did ya think it all would please us?

If you step outside
I'll warn you from your suicide
This pain in your eyes
Don't do anything
Just pray for something better
There's always something better

Oooooh, take you home
Hear me
Trespassing

Hey, whatcha say (what you say)
Do ya think you could stay (it's a beautiful day)
Did you do it all for Jesus?
Did ya think it all would please us?

If you step outside
I'll warn you from your suicide
This pain in your eyes
Don't do anything
Just pray for something better
There's always something better

Well I can feel it inside
You've got time to make up your mind
And turn your back to the sun
Cause baby babe you're gonna burn
My baby's gonna burn down yeah

She tried to tell me... you know
It's kinda weird she's got her mom's...
Thinking back I don't know if it was the right thing to do
But...
It wasn't enough to hold her hand
It's fucked up ??

If you step outside
I'll warn you from your suicide
This pain in your eyes
Don't do anything
Just pray for something better
There's always something better
[repeat]

There's always somethin'
Always somethin'
Always somethin' better
Take you home ...
