(Verse 1)
Spanish songs in Andalucia
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in a DC 10 tonight

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon


The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon

Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, (oh mi corazon)
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon(oh mi corazon)
(oh mi corazon)
(oh mi corazon)
