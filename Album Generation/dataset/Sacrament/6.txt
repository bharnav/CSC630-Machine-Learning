Seize the darkened day, there's only hell to pay
And no one left to see this prodigal return
Sweet apathy's black toll, you'll mourn the traded soul
I'll dig a deeper hole, sanctity a breath away
Just a breath away

Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow

A tragedy on display, a sickness for all to see
I will kill this part of myself that I hate
And that I see in you
It was always mine anyway
There's something you can't take away
I choose not to feel a thing
Sanctity a breath away
Just a breath away

Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow
Blacken the cursed sun
Blacken what's yet to be done
Blacken because now you know
There is no tomorrow

You're just a breath away [x2]

Better to die quick, fighting on your feet
Then to live forever, begging on your knees
Begging on your, begging on your
Begging on your knees

Can we still be saved?
Hell, no!
Does your God hold a place for us?
Hell, no!
Is there time to repent?
Hell, no!
Will we rise from the dead?
Hell, no!
Can these sins even be forgiven?
Hell, no!
Is there still hope for us?
Hell, no!
Were we ever even alive?
Hell, no!
Is any of this even real?
Hell, no!
