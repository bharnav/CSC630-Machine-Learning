I just got the news today you were dying
Hot damn, we're already partying
But please before you have to leave
Let me tell you a few last things

Suffer
Unto me
Indulge
My every need

I don't want to meet you halfway
I've always despised that fucking place

Suffer
Unto me
Indulge
My every need

I'm not offering you my way
I'm kicking you down the fucking highway

Get one thing straight from the get-go
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill

Get one thing straight from the get-go
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill

I never have and I never will
I never have and I never will

Fuck
Your
World
Up
Goddamn

Your
Last
Breath
I'll take it now
Your
Last
Breath
I'll take it now
Your
Last
Breath
I'll rip it away
And haunt your dreams in your final sleep

You can wish in one hand, and shit in the other
You see which one filled up first
Your number's come up
And it sure as hell ain't the lucky one son

Get one thing straight from the get-go
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill

Get one thing straight from the get-go
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill
Get one thing straight from the get-go
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill

I never have, I never will
Never will
I never have, I never will
Never will
