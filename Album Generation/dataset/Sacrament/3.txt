Somewhere between an excuse and a lie
You found something that you believe
So proud, I guess I can imagine why
Three cheers for what we used to be

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Sleep-walking the minefield
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around

Somewhere between illusion and denial
You'll drown in your own sympathy
Profound, at least you thought so at the time
A ghost of who you used to be

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Sleep-walking the minefield
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
