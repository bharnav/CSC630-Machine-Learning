This is a mean and cold town
I hate this fucking place
Watch the rats as they all drown
Dying slowly day by day
Decrepit and falling down
Cesspool of human waste
Swallow profit in deep
Now in death you'll finally know the taste

There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced

You fucking hypocrite
But hooks in lips they do not lie
Compassion served not on your plate
How many of them have you watched die?

I can't sing you a happy song
I can't write you a sing-a-long
The only catchy hook I've got
Is the one in my bleeding gut

Burn it down
Burn it down

There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced

Dead stares
Dead eyes
Choked hopes and vacant minds
Blank words
Blank lives
The end result of endless lies

There's no angels here
To get lost in the first place
Jackhammer a fault line
Pray for earthquakes
Mulhollands's on fire
And my cig started it
'92 should have burnt this fucker down
We're here to finish it

I'm not impressed by much here
Much less what you have to say
Don't give a fuck who you know
I just want to leave this hellhole

Know that you mean nothing to me
Nor the lies that seep from your teeth
Won't piss on you if you're on fire
One more self-important liar

Burn it down
Burn it down

There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced

Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it down
