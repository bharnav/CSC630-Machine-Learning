She's a slack one, born of greed
Speaking endless words, long and empty
A beggar who still wants to choose
A dethroned queen still demands her due
If you want something for nothing you take what you get
A virgin whore in a dirty wedding dress

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door
But just be careful what you wish for

There's a blood stain on the ceiling
But you're the only duck in the shooting gallery
Trying to look through a bricked-in window
Your destiny lies in the alley below
Trying to see yourself in a shattered mirror
When all else fails, she holds you with broken arms
There's poison in her veins, but the bitch comes for free
A quick fix for all that you think that you need

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door
But just be careful what you wish for
The patron saint of fools answers all your requests
She's all yours now, so deal with it

There's no shoulder left to cry wolf on
You're tied in knots that can't be undone
No more warnings will fall on deaf ears
You lied too many times now no one cares
No one cares

An empty promise with a heart of tin
Her crooked smile beguiles and it draws you within
The hope for something more, all that you wish for
A kick to the head and a boot to the door
Chasing a dragon in a lady's clothes
A paper trail ends in choking smoke
But you know you lit the match yourself
Play the burning cards that you dealt

Scream for salvation, beating on death's door
But just be careful what you wish for
The patron saint of fools answers all your request
She's all yours now, so deal with it

Broken
