[Verse 1]
Now, should you expect to see something that you hadn't seen
In somebody you'd known since you were sixteen?
If love is a bolt from the blue
Then what is that bolt but a glorified screw?
And that doesn't hold nothing together
Far from these nonsense bars and their nowhere music
It's making me sick and I know it's making you sick
There's nothing there, it's like eating air
It's like drinking gin with nothing else in
And that doesn't hold me together

[Chorus]
But for one crowded hour
You were the only one in the room
I sailed around all those bumps in the night
To your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September
In the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour
Would lead to my wreck and ruin

[Verse 2]
Now, I know you like your boys who take their medicine
From the bowl of a silver spoon
Who run away with the dish and scale the fish
By the silvery light of the moon
Who were taught from the womb to believe till the tomb
That as far as their bleeding eyes see
Is a pleasure pen, meant for them
Builded and rent for them, not for the likes of me
No, not for the likes of you and me

[Chorus]
And for one crowded hour
You were the only one in the room
And I sailed around all those bumps in the night
To your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September
In the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour
Would lead to my wreck and ruin

[Bridge]
O but the green-eyed harpy of the salt land
She takes into hers, my hand
She says, "Boy, I know you're lying
O but then so am I!"
And to this I said, "O well"

[Verse 3]
Well put me in a cage full of lions, I'll learn to speak lion
In fact I know the language well
I picked it up while I was versing myself
In the languages they speak in hell

That night that silence gave birth to a baby
But they took it away to her silent dismay
And they raised it to be lady
Now she can't keep her mouth shut

[Chorus]
And for one crowded hour
You were the only one in the room
And I sailed around all those bumps in the night
To your beacon in the gloom
I thought I had found my golden September
In the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour
Would lead to my wreck and ruin

Yes, that one crowded hour
You were the only one in the room
Well, I played a few songs for those bumps in the night
In fact, I played this very tune
But you said, "What is this six-stringed instrument
But an adolescent loom?"
And one crowded hour
Would lead to my wreck and ruin
