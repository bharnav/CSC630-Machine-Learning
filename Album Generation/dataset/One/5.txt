She's waiting to fall apart
Blind to how bad things are
And I know now
She won't last
She's got everything
But she won't last

Fighting herself again
Pushed aside her closest friends
And they know now

She won't last
She come to the end of the road
I know that's just the way these things go
Now I know better

Days melt like candle wax
She says that she'll be right back
It's all so sad
She won't last
See her falling down

She won't last
She come to the end of the road
I know that's just the way these things go
Now I know better
Just one of those things
Another bleeding bird in love with her broken wings
I know that's just the way these things go
Now I know better

She won't last
She come to the end of the road
I know that's just the way these things go
Now I know better
Just one of those things
Another bleeding bird in love with her broken wings
I know
Yes I know
I'm no better
I'm no better
Yeah I'm no better
I know...
