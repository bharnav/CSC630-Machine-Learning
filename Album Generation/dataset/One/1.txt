What can I say
Baby
What can I do
I tried and failed just to fit in
I greased the wheels
That only
Drove away
Always ends up the same

I don't have much left to lose
Flow and crumble
Breathe and burning through

Send your bullets in
Draw your blades
Spit my words right back in my face
If I must die
Just to be remade
So long
So long!

I don't have much left to lose
Flow and crumble
Breathe and burning through
For you...

Just you wait
Just you wait, I'm coming
Just you wait
Just you wait
Can I get a witness?

(I will)
Never tell another lie

No
I don't have much left to lose
Flow and crumble
Breathe and burning through

If I can't make you stay
I'll never find the way
Can you feel
What I feel?
These hard times
Will shine from far away
