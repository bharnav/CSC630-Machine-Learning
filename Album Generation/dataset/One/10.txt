Wait
The rain will come and soon enough
To wash away all that we've loved
Here it comes
Listen

Stop
The dialogs and the debates
Good things will come along just wait
In time
Listen

And you feel like crying
You want to scream out
But the tears won't fall
The words won't come
So just listen

Don't lose your head yet stick around
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
You're allowed
Forgiven

Because
System coats you like a shell
What you need nobody sells
Hell is your
Decision

And you feel like crying
You want to scream out
But the tears won't fall
The words won't come
So my friends your time is now
Open up what you've closed down
And it hurts so bad to speak
Oh

So just listen
So just listen
Hurts so bad
So just listen
Hurts so bad, to speak
(repeat)
