Special guest will you come tonight
Brief visit from the other side

I am patient, I am calling you
In the Teahouse of the Spirits
I can feel you
I can hear you
Give it all up just to be near you
I am praying, I am calling you

Why do you walk among the graves
Between the droplets in the rain

I am humble, I am calling you
In the Teahouse of the Spirits
I can feel you
I can hear you
Give it all up just to be near you
I am praying, I am calling you

From the silence comes the sound
The underdrone beneath the crowd

I am ready, I am calling you
I can feel you
I can hear you
Give it all up just to be near you
I am praying, I am calling you
I am praying, I am calling you
I am calling you
I am calling you
I am calling you
