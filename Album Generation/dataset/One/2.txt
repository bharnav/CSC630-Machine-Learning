Night bird scatter last call
Pleading needing a house call

Oh 3 o'clock and Mary's still
Working late up in the hills
Bloody Mary goes
Heaven only knows

Mary saves the night again
Plastic bags for plastic friends
Mary's got your medicine tonight

Stop now your manic complaining
Soon there's an end to the waiting

Oh she's the queen of midnight runs
Cell phones and the rolled up ones
Desperate don't despair
Call and Mary's there

Mary saves the night again
Plastic bags for plastic friends
Mary's got your medicine tonight
Bloody Mary's always on the phone
Never have to be alone
Mary's gonna bring you back to life

She drops the note into her bag
And laughs so you don't look so bad
She knows sometime soon
She'll be back for you

One by one they always call
High they stand and down they fall
All in all our Mary does them wrong
(she'll be back for you)
Bloody Mary saves the night again
Plastic bags for plastic friends
Mary's got your medicine tonight
Bloody Mary saves the night again
Plastic bags for plastic friends
Mary's got your medicine tonight
X2
Bloody Mary's got your medicine tonight
