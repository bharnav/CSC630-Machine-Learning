Smile and pose
Shaking hands and stealing votes
Can we all agree? Oh
Not what you said you would be

Not what you said you'd be
Not what you said you'd be
And not what we need

Friendly foes
Spreading lies, they speak in codes
Now we finally see
Not what you said you would be

Not what you said you'd be
Not what you said you'd be
Oh, you're not what we need

Now say it again
Say it, oh

Oh, not what you said you'd be
Not what you said you'd be
You're not what we need

At this rate
You would make a perfect candidate
For excommunication
Weigh it up and see, oh

Not what you said you'd be
Not what you said you'd be
Not what you said you would be
