I'm silent
In the rolling wake
Of lucky and adored
Ugly
A blur on the side
So easily ignored

Speechless
In my screaming way
They all laugh and smile
Spotlights
Give the loved a stage
But only burn the shy

I will always be the outsider
Will I always walk the road alone?

Disguised
So the crowd can't see
My strategies and plans
The last
Of the shopworn secrets
No one understands

I will always be the outsider
Will I always walk the road alone?
Will I always find it hard to
Make this world of lies
My own

I'd give it all
All to find my way
Inside you
I can't fake myself round
To fit the hole
That hides in you
Looking at me
I know just what you'd say
If you cared

I will always be the outsider
Will I always walk the road alone?
Will I always find it hard to
So hard to
Make this
World of lies
My own
