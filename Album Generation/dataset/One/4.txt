A break in the fighting
Under desert stars
"I'll wait for you"
She said
But she couldn't know
What could come home

I stay awake and
Make no mistake I
I fight this war for you
Hey
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
Oh

All my problems
They're camouflaged
In these fatigues
I've begun
To doubt our breed
Of violent peace
Yeah

I stay awake and
Make no mistake I
I fight this war for you
Hey
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
Oh no

Hey
I stay awake and
I make no mistake I
I'll write your wrong for you
Hey
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
Was it worth all this?
All this?
Oh no
