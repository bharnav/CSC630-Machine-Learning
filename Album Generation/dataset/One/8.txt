Another lifetime ago two people made
One solemn vow to love honor and obey
Now we got nothing but the shame
And lame excuses

Hold me down but you won't hold me back
Somehow this bruise will be the last
This bruise will be
The last
This bruise will be
The last

It's hard to talk
With your tongue between your teeth
It's hard to walk
With only the eggshells underneath
The stabbing of winter white will reap
Fresh abuses

Hold me down but you won't hold me back
Somehow this bruise will be the last
This bruise will be
The last
This bruise will be
The last

Hold me down but you won't hold me back...

Hold me down but you won't hold me back
Somehow this bruise will be the last
I'm gone, I'm never coming back
Mark my words -
These black eyes
When they've healed
Will have seen
The end
