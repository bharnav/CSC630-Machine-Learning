[Verse 1]
Little dog who can’t get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can’t get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

[Verse 2]
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

[Verse 3]
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don’t have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

[Verse 4]
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don’t care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste

[Verse 5]
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want

[Verse 6]
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy

[Verse 7]
I am an up while you’re a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I am up while you are a down
The spring and the will follow me around

[Outro]
Tell me what it is you want
You sniff your shit in the wind
Follow me around
Pathetic little dog
