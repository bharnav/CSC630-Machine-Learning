Woke up screaming on the wrong side of the head
Dreaming of demons who'd be better off... better off dead
Now I know I'm accountable for the things I've said before
But I just can't shut up and get out the door

So let's sing volumes for the souls that aren't for sale
Indeed, lately there's been hellhounds on my trail

Woke up screaming on the wrong side of the zen
So get up and say the word

Say the word and I'll be gone
Say the word and I'll be gone

Say the word and I'll be gone for ever and ever
(Get up, get out)

Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
Now the enemy plays for the whole fucking world

Sooner or later, the nights with the satyr
Will bring back the memory, leaving you money and time
Sweet locomotive with you as the motive
The beauty, the agony, mixes the honey with grime
Sly imitator, the cat's in the cradle
The dogs in the stable will always remain on your mind
Sooner or later, it comes to the table
Reminding them all that the memory always was mine

Wake up running in the only way that I can
This type of dependency turns a boy into a man
Now I know I'm accountable, now I know I'm responsible
No peace for you, little man

Say the word and I'll be gone
Say the word and I'll be gone

Say the word and I'll be gone for ever and ever
(Get up, get out)

Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
(Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall)
Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
Now the enemy plays for the whole fucking world
