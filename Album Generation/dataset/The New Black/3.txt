Because we love you
We return...TO ROCK YOU!
Be consumed
Because you...we want you

Workers are going home
Workers are going home
But once you've been alone...
And everybody knows...
Work begins alone

Workers are doing time
For you...there's nothing now but time
But once you cross the line
And everything is fine...
WORK STARTS IN THE MIND

What do we want?!?
HATE

...Do you wanna know why??
Because we love you
We return...TO ROCK YOU!

OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER...LITTLE MAN?
UNCOMFORTABLY YOU BELIEVE
(we want you...)
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER...LITTLE MAN?
We warned you...
So you have mercy, you know why now

Be consumed
Because you...we want you
Be consoled...be controlled
We want you...WE WANT YOU!
