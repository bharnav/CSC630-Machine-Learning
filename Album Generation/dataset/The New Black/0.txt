Penetrate and desecrate my soul
Penetrate and decimate them all

God, have you always be listening to me?
...Hell has a way with the prose
Give me the strength, give me the strength now to know

Penetrate and demonstrate your calling
Every word and every note in everything at all

God hasn't always been listening to me
...Hell has a way with the prose
Give me the strength, give me the strength now to choose

OH...IT'S IN YOUR NATURE TO FEAR
FEARING THE CRACKS IN THE EARTH!

S.Y.L. S.Y.L. S.Y.L. S.Y.L

OH...IT'S IN YOUR NATURE TO FEAR
FEARING THE CRACKS IN THE EARTH
OH GOD...
IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO FEAR
FEARING THE CRACKS
...FEARING THE CRACKS IN THE EARTH...
'I'
