[Verse 1]
I don't need her money
I don't need a ride
I got enough connections
I don't need a piece of her hide

[Chorus]
I just want to please her
I just want to squeeze her
I just want to crash her [x2]
If I could only flag her down [x2]

[Verse 2]
Well, it's not because of her beauty
And her brand new low cut blouse
It's not because she's so snooty
Or a fine famed millionaire
It's not because she's in motion
In a brand new Cadillac car
It's not because of her lotion
She's a real sweet candy bar

[Chorus]
