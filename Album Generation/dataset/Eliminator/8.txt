[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what do you gonna do?
Now that I've left you and I said we're through
All along you been running  round
But you ain't the only game in town

[Chorus]
I dug your brush and your ass was fine
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind
But you rubbed it on another guy
You're history and this is why
You're just a dog a scurvy dog

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, when we got it on
You made me feel like there ain't nothing wrong
Just don't bug me like you're so naive
I'm cracking up, I'm gonna take my leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey baby well it's over now
I'll make my exit and I'll take a bow
Your problem's cured with a dollar bill
And if it won't I know a flea collar will

[Chorus]
I dug your brush and your ass was fine
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind
But you rubbed it on another guy
You're history and this is why
You're just a dog a scurvy dog
Arf! arf!
Hey! Get that dog out of my yard!
