With a wink and a nod we're all giving favors four pink pale boys in an accountants hand..
Examples must be made
This planet must be retained
We're all little men here with a choice to
Kill all my hunger
Three minutes and thirty seconds
Kill all my hunger
Three minutes and thirty seconds

At the top of the world
We're all just the bottom line

Someones been shook red handed
Dead float center and the shit "hip" parade
Beware beware beware
""
Wow and its bland to be part of the future
A box on your phony kings
And on that night in slumber you dream of electric sheep

Kill all my hunger
Three minutes and thirty seconds
Kill all my hunger
Three minutes and thirty seconds
At the top of the world
They're all just the bottom line

In the parish with the hands and the shakes
Our body is longing for the exoskeleton
The filth they said
Is the filth im dragging my belly through

In the parish with the hands and the shakes
Our body is longing for the exoskeleton
The filth they said
Is the filth im dragging my belly through

And the beat is drowned out
And our own fucking sound
And the teenage brigade has opinions

And I can't get respect cause im not at the bar
And the teenage brigade has opinions

But its weak and its bleak and they're all "capping" me
With the cold and the blood trying to stip me
And I can't get respect cause im not at the bar
And the teenage brigade has opinions

So turn your hand for a new day with you at the bottom of a rabbits hole

And we all sound like this
