We'll book this tour it will be oh oh oh so good
We're gonna steal your guarantee ... shit!
Oh steer clear, we're on a wicked path
We've got plans, wicked plans

Its the least we can do
'Cause we've got to get ours somehow
It would be too easy making ten percent off the tours we book for you
So we figure we'll take as much as we can cause its not up to you
The music the bands provide brings the kids to the show, so you know we just dont care
There are a lot of other bands we can use if you dont want this tour
The point is
Is even though everyone knows
We treat the bands like shit
And nobody has the guts to speak out
'Cause they're afraid that they won't get the tours at the end of the day

You fucking kids have got to learn the golden rules
You gotta use who you can on the way to the middle
You only give a favor for a favor in return
You get burned if you turn the other cheek

We dont believe you kids are so naive
To think that things could change
'Cause nothing ever changes in the real world
We're going to drive that message home
'Cause money fills the gas tank in the van

Oh steer clear we're on a wicked path
We've got plans, wicked plans
Its the least we could do
