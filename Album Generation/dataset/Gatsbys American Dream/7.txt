Consuming every little thing we get our claws around
I do subscribe to the thought that we are the dinosaurs
With pebbled skin, sharp teeth, a wicker tail and stinking breath
We are to say the least a pack of filthy beasts
All we want is dinner
We stalk the landscape in an endless search for easy prey
The days are very long but hunger keeps our sleep at bay
With hopes of finding weak or wounded that have run astray
We are to say the least a pack of filthy beasts
All we want is dinner
Just looking for a feast because we are the filthy beasts
Lots of teeth = lots of respect
And some things you can't protect
We'll fill our bellies with the things you hold dear
