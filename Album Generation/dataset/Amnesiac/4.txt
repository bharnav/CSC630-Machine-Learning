[Verse 1]
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

[Chorus 1]
Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

[Verse 2]
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

[Chorus 2]
Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all

[Bridge]
Keep it moving
Keep it moving
