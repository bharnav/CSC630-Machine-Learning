[Verse 1]
Morning bell, morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Your clothes are on the lawn with
The furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around, around, around
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
