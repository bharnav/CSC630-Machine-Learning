[Verse 1]
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

[Hook]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case

[Verse 2]
After years of waiting
After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize you're looking in
Looking in the wrong place

[Hook]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case

[Bridge]
After years of waiting

[Hook]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
