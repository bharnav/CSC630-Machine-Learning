I had a tough time getting off the dime
Before I met you couldn’t make up my mind
I was on and off again
I’d say we’d benefit if we’re some kind of friends

Count me in I’ve made a decision
Count me in if you’re in, I’m in
I know what you’re thinking and you know I’m with you
Count me in if you do, I do

Many years together tells me something is right
Wake up every morning, the feeling is nice
We’re not living the dream, we’re living the life
Holdin’ to the source, we’re holding it tight
Guarding the flame before it goes out
And it will go out, that is not doubt
The cycle of everything is what it’s about
Ready now I’m about to

Count me in I’ve made a decision
Count me in if you’re in, I’m in
I know what you’re thinking and you know I’m with you
Count me in if you do, I do

You know they try to keep me just living in a box
But the second I try got ideas for blocks
Running down the concept cause everything counts
Give me a pen and pad and I trounce, ooh

We watch the moon across the sky
And my thinking is gone but I don’t know why
Til the moon turns to blood
You and me will go on
We can make war or we can make love
Til I figure out how you know what I’m thinking of
You are under my skin

Count me in I’ve made a decision
Count me in if you’re in, I’m in
I know what you’re thinking and you know I’m with you
Count me in if you do, I do
I know what you’re thinking and you know I’m with you
Count me in if you do, I do
