It’s all kinda starting to make sense, the difference
Between us and them, from the beginning
We’re looking for such different things, it is insane
But we wouldn’t want to be the same

We are beyond supposed separations
All of those are just our creations
Caught up in the days of mistaking this
Everyone of us is weightless

So weightless, weightless
All weightless, weightless
We’re all weightless, weightless
Everyone of us is weightless
Everyone of us is weightless

A summer night and the starlight
That slowly does appear
My god it’s been gone for all these years
And yet it really still is here

We are beyond supposed separations
All of those are just our creations
Caught up in the days of mistaking this
Everyone of us is weightless

So weightless, weightless
All weightless, weightless
We’re all weightless, weightless
Everyone of us is weightless

Gotta get away, now make it somehow
Zero gravity, no pull has got me
Hurtling through space, all time is misplaced
We’re all weightless in this place
Only matters if you are here with us
Because the route we take is so circuitous
We are floating now, there’s no pull here in space
We’re all weightless, hey!

It’s all kinda starting to make sense, the difference
Between us and them, from the beginning
We’re looking for such different things, it is insane
Everyone of us is weightless

So weightless, weightless
All weightless, weightless
We’re all weightless, weightless
Everyone of us is weightless

So weightless, weightless
All weightless, weightless
We’re all weightless, weightless
Everyone of us is weightless
