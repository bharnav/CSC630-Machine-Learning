Ticking like a time bomb, where did you come from
Nowhere that you can run, that is all gone
Your eyes are getting salty, it’s not my fault
He’s gonna need assistance, that’s the difference

Boom vato loco stepped in the room
Soon all your homies will be singing this tune
Step back pinche culero cuz we’re gonna explode
We got the place surrounded don’t try and be a hero

Bet you didn’t think that we thought of that
Came up with that shit way back
Innovation ruling that nation
The dancehall’s back but you know about that

Let me introduce you to the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Tickin like a time bomb
Watch, we go off
Let me introduce you to the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Tickin like a time bomb
Watch, we go off

Aye yai yai yeah you know how we roll
No se bronca, no yo pedo
You know, you know
We’ve been down

Well, I’m rocking on the mic saying things that you like so
We won’t let you down we are the system of sound
The excitable crew, we do this with you
The innovator came to stay so what you gonna do

This is what we want and I say
This is what we need
Go, go, go back in memory to that tiny baby
Universal heart and pulse never stops beating sing

Let me introduce you to the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Tickin like a time bomb
Watch, we go off
Let me introduce you to the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Tickin like a time bomb
Watch, we go off

I remember back in the day
We would work hard, getting down our parts
There was no crew me and you
Planning out what do do
Work hard play hard getting down our parts
I remember back in the day

Let me introduce you
To the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Ticking like a time bomb
Watch we go off
Let me introduce you
To the excitable crew
This is just how we do
Ticking like a time bomb
Watch we go off
