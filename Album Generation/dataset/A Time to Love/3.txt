[Verse 1]
Me and my heart took a
Vow from the start and a
Vow to my heart i never break
Seasons may come and the
Seasons may go but know
Through every time and space
My love will always stay forever and always

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my heart, i love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long i'll love you
Try forever that's how long i'll feel this way

[Verse 2]
Me and my heart got a
Promise from the stars that they'd
Keep this love burning endlessly
People will come just as
People will go but know
Whatever life has in store
Through all eternity you will have my love for always

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes, forever is how long my love will stay
Forever is a long, long time
But so what?
