[Verse]
True love
Why'd you take so long
Every time i thought i found you
I was oh so wrong
True love
Were you playing with my heart
Or me not trying to feel that
They weren't it from the start
I'd say yes i found you
And think maybe so
I'd say here's my love true
And feel are you sure
But love is that feeling
Sharing no room with doubt
For i knew you were the key to my heart
Oh sweet love
Never go away
Let our love have us forever
To prove why we can't stay
Oh true love
Are you saying touch√©
Let is live as perfect lovers
With a promise for always

[Outro]
Let us live as perfect lovers
With a promise for always
