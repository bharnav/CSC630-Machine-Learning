[Verse 1]
You lift me to the sky
When i'm flat on the ground
You put me on a high
When i'm all the way down
And when trouble comes around
Trying to blow up the spot
You look it in the eye and say "i think not"

[Chorus]
Tell your heart i love you
I love you, yes i do
Tell your heart i need you
You need to know its true
Don't nobody in the world love you the way i do

[Verse 2]
You make me feel like a trillion bucks
When i don't even have a dime
You put a smile on my face
In a time i could be crying
And when negative comes around
With nothing good to say
You give it a stare that makes it get the hell away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Long before my mind believed
My heart could not help but conceive
That i love you, yeah
And when my head did suggest
My heart had already confessed
That i love you, love you, love you

[Chorus][x3]
