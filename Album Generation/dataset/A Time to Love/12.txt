[Verse 1]
Can you picture mother earth in the palm of your hand?
The entire universe as a tiny grain of sand
And it feels impossible to do

[Chorus]
As i can't imagine love without you

[Verse 2]
Think of drinking every sea with its salty waters dry
Sprinting around the world three times faster than a rocket flies
And the thought of it you can't pursue

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Some thoughts are just no brainers
Not worth an ounce of time
Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind

[Verse 3]
Travel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind
Travel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue
And the thought of it you can't pursue
Because it feels impossible to do

[Outro]
As i can't imagine love without you
I can't imagine love without you
