[Verse 1]
Look at how they stop and stare
As if they've never seen a heart in love
And though i see them i don't care
Cause i'm too busy thinking bout our love
Thinking about that each and every morning
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
And though it seems i'm hooked on this fixation
I will not stop my daydreaming
Until my nights are true with you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, i'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

[Verse 2]
Listen at me call your name
As if you're witness to my every word
And though it seems sometimes insane
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
So i wait so patiently the moment
When my love fantasies will come to life
And all i need from you is confirmation
Then i'll be living truth, those moments
That i long with you

[Chorus][x3]

[Bridge]
On flute, hubert laws
And all i need from you is confirmation
Then i'll be living truth, those moments
That i long with you

[Chorus][x3]
