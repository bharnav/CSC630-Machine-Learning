[Verse 1]
Such a happy couple love and some
Until man goes busy just for fun
Man gets the guilt, tells fun girl we can't no more
Fun girl says if you stop i'll tell her right now

[Chorus]
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
That's all his lips could say
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She won't believe you anyway

[Verse 2]
I was blinded by sexsation
Temporarily out my head
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She mustn't know we went to bed
You could hear him moaning

[Bridge]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 3]
You should have thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You should have thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
What a pretty love pair, perfect fit
Til woman sights on one that she's just got to get with
Woman gets scared tells plaything we can't no more
Plaything says if you stop i'll tell him right now

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I was blinded by desire
Temporarily insane
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
He can't know we did the wild thing
And you could hear her crying

[Bridge]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Outro x2]
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you were giving up that pearl
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
