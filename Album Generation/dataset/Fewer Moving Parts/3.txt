[Verse 1]
A white ghost, making his way up the west coast
Trying to focus his high hopes on a vagina or two
He's taking his chances

Meanwhile, back in his living room
Bright smiles are watching his toddler run speed trials
Over a grandmother's rug
And nature advances

[Verse 2]
Up the interstate
He's been awake
And pretty drunk for three whole days
No one wants to stop
Until they get to where they're going
I'll get to where I'm going --
Pretty soon

[Chorus]
So he takes another drink
'Cause watching the scenery bleed
Into each similar scene
Isn't as sweet as it had been in his dreams

[Verse 3]
It's faster to buy cigarettes and some cold beer
If you don't rattle the cashier
By asking her back to your room
She's calling security

Our car's on fire in the parking lot
And nobody wants it to rain
But God isn't listening

So all of the windshields glisten
The water and oil mix
Causing the fire to spread
To five or six
Innocent automobiles
Waiting in their nearby spots
What a cruel God we've got

[Bridge]
Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on
Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on

[Chorus]
So he takes another drink
'Cause watching the formula bleed
Into each similar theme
Isn't as sweet as it had been in his dreams
