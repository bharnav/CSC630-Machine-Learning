The worlds have now learned of the worst yet to come
On the brink of an end, a boy learns to run
How you love, or could you, mr. Man-of-the-Year?
Walking tall with nothing to fear

Don't pass up this chance
Go tear down the walls
No Gods will be watching
No one cares enough at all
These words need now an ending
As they did at the start
But I'll keep on pretending I won't go

Don't cry no more, boy
You've got the other side of your life, so enjoy
I'll move out the front door, and take out your trash
But I'll no longer be haunting here, I'm not coming back

The world must know my story...
So long, Amory
Please drive me home one last time
