If you make a reference to some trouble that you know
Can it help you keep it under control
Or should I really reconsider my reasons for going solo

David Byrne on Bob Costas put it pretty well
But I put it better

I still run the show
And don't you forget it
So I had to let some go
Don't think I don't regret it
Cuz I do
And I don't think I'm better off alone

Man I could have had a big sound
But I love to let my friends down

Fewer moving parts mean fewer broken pieces
When every other start
Requires a brand new thesis

One good friend remarks with a rightfully angry
"Jesus dude none of us know what to do with you"
I in my pride responded
"I got news for you
None of you have to"

Cuz I still run the show
And don't you forget it
So I had to let some go
Don't think I don't regret it
Cuz I do
And I don't think I'm better off alone

Man we could have had a big sound
But I love to let my good friends down
