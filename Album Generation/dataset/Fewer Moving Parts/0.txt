[Verse 1]
You're so creative
With your reviews
Of what other people do
How satisfying that must be for you

Am I a Christian?
Are you a Jew?
Did you kill my Lord?
Must I forgive you?

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to be original
In fact nothing scares me more
Because Jesus only lets me do
What has been done before
The path of least resistance
Ancient holy wars
The same old easy targets
Yeah, we've all been there before

[Verse 3]
So if it starts to get you down
Just pretend
That you don't make your living
From selling advertising
Tracking trends
Corralling demographics
And maximizing traffic

Then if you get tired of making taste for free
You can always start a band with me
Or anybody
