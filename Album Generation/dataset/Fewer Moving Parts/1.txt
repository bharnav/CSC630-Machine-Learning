[Verse 1]
I go out in public now
More than you might think
But only after pills and drinks
That's how I remember

Then if I see any girl
I've ever met before
I run like hell for the door
That's how I remember

Memory records
Selected shorts and interpretations
Then later plays them back
As gospel fact

[Chorus]
That's how I remember
That's how I remember

[Verse 2]
With one eye open
You can focus like a camera
On whomever you are capturing
Without exception I prefer it as a way to document
The objects of my interest

Red and yellow, black and white
Are precious in his eyes
But who he roots for in a fight
That's how I remember

Every time I find a girl
Beaten, gagged, and bound
I let her go and write it down

[Chorus]
