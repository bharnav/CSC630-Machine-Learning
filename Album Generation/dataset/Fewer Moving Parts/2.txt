[Verse 1]
If you make a reference to some trouble that you know
Can it help you keep it under control
Or should I really reconsider
My reasons for going solo
David Byrne on Bob Costas puts it pretty well
But I put it better

[Chorus]
I still run the show
Don't you forget it
So I had to let some go
Don't think I don't regret it
Because I do and I don't
Think I'm better off alone

Man I could have made a big sound
But I love to let my friends down

[Verse 2]
Fewer moving parts means fewer broken pieces
When every other start requires a brand new thesis
One good friend remarks with a rightfully angry
Jesus dude! None of us know what to do with you
To which I in pride responded
I've got news for you
None of you have to, cause

[Chorus]

Man I could have made a big sound
But I love to let my good friends down
