Calling all rednecks
To put down their sluggers
And turn their attention
From beating the buggers
Pick up machine guns
And kill camel-fuckers

Backwoods nation

Calling all doctors
Of spin and the smokescreen
To whip the new hate-riots
Into a frenzy
Of good versus evil
Ignoring the history

Of the backwoods nation

Ain't it a shame?
When due process
Stands in the way
Of swift justice

Calling all frat boys
To trade in their hazing
Their keggers and cocaine
And casual date-raping
For cabinet appointments
And rose garden tapings

Backwoods, backwoods, backwoods nation
