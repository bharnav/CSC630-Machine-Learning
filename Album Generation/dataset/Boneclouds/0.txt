[Verse 1]
Be here now
No other place to be
Or just sit there dreaming
Of how life would be
If we were somewhere better
Somewhere far
Away from all all worries
Well, here we are

[Chorus]
You are the love of my life

[Verse 2]
Be here now
No other place to be
All the doubts that linger
Just set them free
And let good things happen
And let the future come
Into each moment
Like a rising sun

[Chorus]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
Yeah, you know you are

[Bridge]
Sun comes up and we start again

[Pre-Verse]
And it's all new today
All we have to say
Is be here now

[Verse 3]
Be here now
No other place to be
This whole world keeps changing
Come change with me
Everything that's happened
All that's yet to come
Is here inside this moment
It's the only one

[Chorus]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
Yeah, you know you are

[Bridge]
Sun comes up and we start again

[Pre-Verse]
And it's all new today
All we have to say
Is be here now
