I was travellin' in a caravan
Out across the desert sand
Both batallions of the infantry
Heading in towards the enemy
Or at least what they're tellin' me

Wind blowin' across a cross-eyed sun
Shapes moving on the hills
I'll picture you by a swimming pool
Tell me baby am i still your man
Fat kid in the scorin' land
Foreign land

I heard nothing but the sound of death
I was pushed through the ground
I woke up on a forest floor
Looking up through a group of men
Looking up at where the sun had been
Sun had been

Looking up at where the sun had been
Looking up at where the sun had been
Looking up at where the sun had been
Looking up at where the sun had been
