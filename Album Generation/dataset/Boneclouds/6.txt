Got so lost that I went to church
Sorry god but you made it worse
Made me sit behind the fence
Haunted by the evidence
I guess you don't want me to think so instead I'll dream and drink
Got too drunk to drive home
In the cab, I grabbed my phone and made a call I might regret to a girl that I just met. Lately things are not okay
I just wanted to hear somebody say

If you need a reason as to why you're here, you don't need to look farther than me

Lovely, lovely quiet lake
How can this be a mistake
Too dark now to see your face
Your hair is blowing all over the place
The moon is caught in a frozen glass
We could not let this moment pass

The sun is waiting far away
Until I have the chance to say
All that's missing, all that's lost
Every hope at any cost
Every dream too good to come true floods my heart when I'm with you

If you need a reason as to why you're here you don't need to look farther than me

Got so lost that I went to church
Sorry god, but you made it worse
Made me sit behind the fence, haunted by the evidence
I guess you don't want me to think, so instead I'll dream and drink
Got too drunk to drive home
In the cab, I grabbed my phone and made a call I might regret to a girl that I just met. Lately things are not okay. I just wanted to hear somebody say

If you need a reason as to why you're here you don't need to look farther than me

Oh, if you need a reason as to why you're here, you don't need to look farther than me
