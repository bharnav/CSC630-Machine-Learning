Which Way Your Heart Will Go
By: Mason Jennings

Little airplane in the sky
You point up at it
I watch your face as you watch it go by
Everything is perfect

Where would I be right now
If all my dreams had come true
Deep down I know some how
I'd have never seen your face
This world would be a different place
Darling there's no way to know
Which way your heart will go

Summer sun on a sandy smile
Silver swing set shining
How can life feel so alive
And still feel like dying

Where would I be right now

If all my dreams had come true
Deep down I know somehow
I'd have never seen your face
This world would be a different place
Darling there's no way to know
Which way your heart will go

A stack of books beside our bed
Living out of boxes
Why does the empty space fill with dread
Why does change still shock us

Where would we be right now
If all our dreams had come true
Deep down I know somehow
I'd have never seen your face
This world would be a different place
Darling there's no way to know
Which way your heart will go
Which way your heart will go
