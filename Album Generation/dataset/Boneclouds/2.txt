On the train ride to Paris
Or from sunny Barcelona
We rose up through the mountains
As the sun started setting
And the sea came out below us
As we rode through a village
We passed ten feet from a little porch where a man was serving dinner
And our window was open
And we could hear them laughing

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?
If you ain't got love
What do you got if you ain't got love?

At nine in the morning
After nine months of waiting
You were born and I saw your face
And you looked up at me
But before I could hold you
The doctors raced you from me
They told me that you might not live
Your heart was not healthy
And with wires coming from you
I sat beside you

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?
If you ain't got love

What do you got if you ain't got love?

Someday, someday soon
You and I will both be gone
And lately I can't help but think
That the love we feel will live on

At a little wooden cabin
Up in northern Minnesota
We ran together down to the dock
And you jumped right off it
And from out in the water
You called me to join you
And I said "baby, I can not swim if I jump I'll surely drown you."
You said "life has no limit, if you're not afraid to get in it."

And Oh, baby I jumped to you
Since then there's nothing I can't do

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?
If you ain't got love
What do you got if you ain't got love?

Someday, someday soon
You and I will both be gone
But lately I can't help but think
That the love we feel will live on
