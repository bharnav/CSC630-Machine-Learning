Jesus are you real
Did we make you up
Is salvation what you want or
Is faith enough
Do you know where I'm bound
You know who I am
Are you just a word I use but I don't understand

Standing like a statue in the sea
In a little truck stop in Tennessee
And bombs are crashing down in waves
On a giant TV screen
And I am struck I cannot move
To make it stop what can I do
People are dying in their beds
While this flag flies over our heads

Jesus are you stronger than a loaded gun
I'm beginning to believe you're not the only one
Strong enough to show your love
Strong enough to give
Strong enough to go through hell
Strong enough to live

And all night long I sat with you
In a darkened hospital room
And nurses checked in by the hour
I was made aware of a higher power
And how this fragile life we live
Is not ours to keep but ours to give
What in the world am I gonna do
If anything should happen to you

Refrain
And all i do is doubt you god
All i do is love you god
All i do is question you
What else can i do
This world was never solid ground
The past is coming back around
All i do is search for you

What else can i do?
And when i say i search for you
I mean i search for peace
I search for hope
I search for love
And one day for release

Jesus my life does not feel the same
New things happen everyday
Things i can't explain
But i am not a man of faith
I'm a man of truth
But is this feeling in my heart
Is this feeling proof

When you do not know you know
When you know you do not know
And when you think you do you die
And when you do not think you grow
Are we left here in the dark
Or are we left here in the light
It seems to me that both are true
And its up to us to know what's right

And all I do is doubt you God
All is do is love you God
All I do is question you
What else can I do
This world was never solid ground
Religion can not help me now
All I do is search for you
What else can I do
And when I say I search for you
I mean I search for peace
I search for hope I search for love
And one day for release

God give me strength to accept the things
That i just can not know
And even when i lose control i will not let you go
