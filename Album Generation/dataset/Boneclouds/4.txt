When i woke up
You were crying
In the dark next to me
And i did not
Reach out to touch you
You were ten thousand miles from me

Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water

How could you say that
Do you really mean that
What a hurtful thing to say
I know we're breaking
I know we're you're leaving
That don't mean you can treat me this way

Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water

Please just hold me
Hold me closer
Let's pretend that we're new
I would crush you
If i were able
I would squeeze all the love from you

Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water
Moon sailing on the water
