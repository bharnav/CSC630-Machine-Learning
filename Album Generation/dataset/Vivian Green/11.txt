Tonight I wanted to have fun
I wanted to breakout, paint the town
Just me and the girls
But somehow you came apart of that simple equation
And all I'm thinkng about now is the love we could be making

I could be your sweet thing yeah
I could be your sweet thing yeah, yeah
I can do anything sweet sweet thing
Do you feel how much I want you
I could be your sweet thing yeah
I could be your sweet thing yeah, yeah
I can do anything be a sweet sweet thing
Do you feel how much I want to

Cause I want you baby
And I know you feel it too
I'm crazy bout you
Cause I want you baby
And I know you feel it too
I'm crazy bout you

Couldn't help but notice you
Your sitting right across the room
Your fine, your fly, just the right type seems like
It's not like my imagination to run wild
But there something about the energy your given me

I could be your sweet thing yeah
I could be your sweet thing yeah, yeah
I can do anything sweet sweet thing
Do you feel how much I want you
I could be your sweet thing yeah
I could be your sweet thing yeah, yeah
I can do anything be a sweet sweet thing
Do you feel how much I want to

Cause I want you baby
And I know you feel it too
