[Intro:]
Yes, I like it
But I don't need it
Cause I like it
Don't mean I need it

Yes, I like it
But I don't need it
Cause' I like it
Don't mean I need it

[Verse 1:]
I like the way you move
I like the way you talk
You have such a sweet way

I like to spend my days
With you always the same
Such sweet consistency
But it's cool
Don't mess with it
Leave it this the way it is

[Hook x2:]
Baby, with you
It's quite alright
So much better than
It's been with the other guys

But I don't need a label
Just leave it alone
Don't wanna tie you down
You're free to go

[Chorus x2:]
Yes, I like it
But I don't need it
(I don't wanna be your girlfriend)

Cause I like it
Don't mean I need it
(I don't wanna be your girlfriend)

[Verse 2:]
Ooh, yeah
It's mighty good
No need for me to front
I can separate the two
A boyfriend ain't what I want

Now we can kick it baby
Just like the way we've been
I just need to be free
Don't need you to rescue me

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
No no
Not me

Don't wanna be in love
I just wanna be single and fabulous
Fine independent women
It's my time
The last thing on my mind
Is committing to some guy

Too much that I need to do
And I'm sorry to say
But the list don't include you
And don't you say
I didn't tell you what it was a first
Look at the situation
Take it for what it's worth

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Outro x2:]
Yes, I like it
But I don't need it
(I don't wanna be your girlfriend)

Cause I like it
Don't mean I need it
(I don't wanna be your girlfriend)
