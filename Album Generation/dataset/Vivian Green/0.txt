(Verse 1)
Remember wanting me so much
I used to tingle from ur touch
And i'd wait for you to come home
Ur sittin right beside the phone
And there was nothing else but you
And who could seperate us to
I'd never know when we got lost
But now im counting up the calls

(Chorus)
I wish we could go back (to love less complicated) i
I wish we could go back (ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it no)
Please tell me u miss that (that new love, crazy love)
Cuz i wanna go back i know its possible
Tell me you feel it to

What i wouldn't do to rekindle our romance
O what i wouldn't do not many get a second chance oh no
Come on baby cuz our love hasnt yet died (it hasnt died we gotta give love one more try)

(Verse 2)
We barely talked we barely smiled
No hint of what we used to be
No courtesy and no romance
Not to much left of you and me
But its not to late i believe
But baby we can get it back
Cuz lifes to short for us to let
What we had die and just forget

(Chorus)
I wish we could go back (to love less complicated) i
I wish we could go back (ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it no)
Please tell me u miss that (that new love, crazy love)
Cuz i wanna go back i know its possible
Tell me you feel it to

Lets go back (i know its possible o what i wouldn't do)
Lets go back (i know its possible dont you wanna go back baby)
Lets go back (i know ts possible o what i wouldn't do)
Lets go back (go back go back to the way we used to be be)

I wish we could go back (to love less complicated) i
I wish we could go back (ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it no)
Please tell me u miss that (that new love, crazy love)
Cuz i wanna go back i know its possible
Tell me you feel it to

What i wouldn't do to rekindle our romance
O what i wouldn't do o wat i wouldn't do
Come on baby cuz our love hasnt yet died (i know its possible tell me you feel it to)

I wish we could go back (to love less complicated) i
I wish we could go back (ready to prove our love when they said we couldn't make it no)
Please tell me u miss that (that new love, crazy love)
Cuz i wanna go back i know its possible
Tell me you feel it to
