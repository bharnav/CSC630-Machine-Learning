Touched by Jeqon
The inciter
Well-rounded woman
Flesh doth tempt
The angels of
The watch to sin
And their sons
Are Nephilim

Thrice blessed are we in his garden
We have the world, our health, our kin
As we "go forth and multiply"
We take from each other's skin

Endogamy – the choice of millions
In (all their) elemental ugliness
In the echoes of repetition
Imperfection sires itself

Nothing in life
Has any business being perfect
It's an affront
To anyone with good taste

Choice is divine
So choose family over strangers
Why trouble the waters
Of the gene pool for a mate?

Carbon vessel
Carbon content
Carbon copy
Carbonize

Like a lump between two surgeons
Man quivers 'twixt desire and need
The law is the will, and we've chosen
The kingdom of which we would be

In filial sect
We are genesis incarnate
In our faces
We see manifest destiny

(And) leave nothing alive
Leave nothing alive
Leave nothing alive

With thoughts of heaven come deeds of flesh
We'd look once more upon his holy visage
And our children whom we've known and wed
(Are) our means to recreate his image

In lurking fear of his displeasure
After dark, between their cries
In the eye of the beholder –
This is where beauty dies
