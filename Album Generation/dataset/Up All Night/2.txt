[Verse 1: Liam & Harry]
I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing

[Verse 2: Niall &  Niall and Zayn]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

[Pre-Chorus: Louis & Zayn]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing
Get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing

[Bridge: Harry & Liam]
You've got that one thing
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

[Chorus: All & Zayn & Harry]
So get out, get out, get out of my head (get out, get out, get out of my head)
And fall into my arms instead (instead)
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)
Get out, get out, get out of my mind (out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing
