[Verse 1: Liam]
I’m broken, do you hear me?
I’m blinded 'cause you are everything I see
I’m dancing alone, I’m praying
That your heart will just turn around

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can’t look you in the eyes and say

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this

[Verse 2: Niall]
If I’m louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same, you save me
When you leave, it’s gone again

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I’m on my knees, praying

[Chorus: Harry and All]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this

[Bridge: Zayn &  Zayn and Liam]
Yeah, I’ve never had the words to say
But now I’m asking you to stay for a little while inside my arms
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That’s shining from the stars above

[Chorus: Harry and All & Liam & (Zayn)]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah ('cause I can love you more than this)
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight (holds you close)
It just won’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this, yeah ('cause I can love you more than this, yeah)
When he lays you down, I might just die inside (oh, yeah)
It just don’t feel right 'cause I can love you more than this
I can love you more than this
