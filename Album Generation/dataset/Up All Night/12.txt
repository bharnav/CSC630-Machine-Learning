[Intro: Harry]
Waiting for a girl like you

[Verse 1: Liam]
The light shines, it's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends, they look good but you look better
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, 'round, 'round

[Chorus: Harry]
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart, with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

[Vers 2: Liam]
I'm weaker, my worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on 'head, don't you fail me now
I start to say I think I love you but I make no sound
Oh 'cause all my life I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around

[Chorus: Harry]
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart, with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

[Bridge: Zayn]
There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you and we can stay here tonight
'Cause there's so much I wanna say, I wanna say

[Chorus: Harry]
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart, with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart, with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you
Been waiting for a girl like you
