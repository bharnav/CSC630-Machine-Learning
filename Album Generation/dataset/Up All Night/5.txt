[Intro: Liam]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam]
He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes, and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?
When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder whenever I'm near you

[Chorus: Harry and All & Zayn]
But I see you, with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that was me

[Interlude: Liam]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2: Harry]
He looks at you the way that I would
Does all the things I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

[Pre-Chorus: Harry and Zayn]
'Cause I got three little words that I've always been dying to tell you

[Chorus: Harry and All & Harry]
But I see you, with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh how I wish that was me

[Bridge: Harry and Zayn]
With my hands on your waist while we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you'll call later on 'cause you wanna say good night

[Chorus: (Liam and Zayn) & All & Harry & Zayn]
('Cause I see you, with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see)
But I see you, with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish that was me
Oh, how I wish that was me
