[Intro: Niall and Zayn]
I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh

[Verse 1: Liam]
It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed

[Chorus: Niall and Zayn & All]
I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman, but for you I'll be super human
I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight

[Verse 2: Zayn]
Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
'Cause he don't adore you
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn you

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
What you want, what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears

[Chorus: Niall, and Zayn & All]
I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman, but for you I'll be super human
I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight

[Bridge: Louis]
Up, up and away, I'll take you with me
Up, up and away, I'll take you with me

[Chorus: Niall, and Zayn & All]
I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman, but for you I'll be super human
I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight
I want to save you, save you, save you tonight
I want to save you, save you, save you tonight
