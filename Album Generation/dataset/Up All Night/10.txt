[Verse 1: Harry]
Circles, we’re going in circles
Dizzy’s all it makes us
We know where it takes us, we've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blaming each other

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Got to make up our minds

[Chorus: All]
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

[Verse 2: Liam]
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Got to make up our minds

[Chorus: All]
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes

[Bridge: Liam]
Don't look back but if we don't look back
We’re only learning then
How to make all same mis-, same mistakes again

[Chorus: All & (Zayn)]
So we play, play, play all the same old games (same old games)
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
(Well, nothing's gonna change)
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
(Nothing's gonna be the same)
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is (crazy is)
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
(There's nothing to fix, oh, oh)
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
(Everything will be okay)
While you're making all the same mistakes
