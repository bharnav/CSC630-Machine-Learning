[Intro - Danny:]
It's all about you
(it's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about)
It's all about you
(it's about you)
It's all about you

[Verse - Tom:]
Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew
So I told you with a smile 'It's all about you'
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
Said, 'You make my life worthwhile, it's all about you'

[Chorus - Danny:]
And I would answer all your wishes
If you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Don't know what I'd do
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
It's all about you
Yeah...

[Solo]

[Chorus - Danny & Tom:]
And I would answer all your wishes
If you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Don't know what I'd do
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
Yes, you make my life worthwhile
So I told you with a smile
It's all about you

[Outro - Danny:]
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(it's all about)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about you)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you
It's all about you
