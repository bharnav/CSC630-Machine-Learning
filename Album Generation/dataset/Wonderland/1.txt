[Verse 1]
The world would be a lonely place
Without the one that puts a smile on your face
So hold me 'til the sun burns out
I won't be lonely when I'm down

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got you
To make me feel stronger
When the days are rough
And an hour seems much longer

[Verse 2]
I never doubted you at all
The stars collide, will you
Stand by and watch them fall? (by and watch them fall)
So hold me 'til the sky is clear
And whisper words of love right into my ear

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got you
To make me feel stronger
When the days are rough
And an hour seems much longer
Yeah, when I got you
Oh, to make me feel better
When the nights are long
They'll be easier together

[Bridge]
Looking in your eyes
Hoping they won't cry
And even if they do
I'll be in bed so close to you
To hold you through the night
And you'll be unaware
But if you need me I'll be there

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got you
Oh, to make me feel stronger
When the days are rough
And an hour seems much longer
Yeah, when I got you
To make me feel better
When the nights are long
They'll be easier together
Yeah, I got you
