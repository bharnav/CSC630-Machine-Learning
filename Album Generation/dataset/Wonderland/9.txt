[Verse 1]
One by one
Drinks are gone
Do I have to stay?
Hate the sound
Of one more pound
As it rolls away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why did I need your proof
When I knew the truth

[Chorus]
And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd have tried

[Verse 2]
I dont want to know your game
Let alone her name
No matter what you say to me
We are not the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why do you make me cry
Try to justify
Don't right your wrong
With my mistakes
'Cause my head's held high

[Chorus]
And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd have tried
And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd have tried

[Bridge]
Dreams we have as kids all fade away
Now it's not the same

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd have tried
And I don't know why
I just let it slip by
Me all the time
I just wish you'd have tried, yeah
