[Verse 1]
Two years away
I got back today
Tried calling up this girl I used to know
But when I said 'Hello'
She didn't know
Who the hell I was supposed to be

[Chorus]
Memory Lane
We're here again
Back to the days
And I'll remember you always
So much has changed
Now It feels like yesterday
I went away

[Verse 2]
The word's around
That she moved town
About a thousand miles away from here
And I found something she wrote
A long time ago
And it reminds me of a place I know called

[Chorus]
Memory Lane
We're here again
Back to the days
And I'll remember you always
So much has changed
Now It feels like yesterday
I went away

[Bridge]
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed

[Chorus]
Down Memory Lane
We're here again
Back to the days
And I'll remember you always
So much has changed
Now it feels like yesterday
I went away

[Outro]
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
Down Memory Lane
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
Down Memory Lane
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
So much has changed
