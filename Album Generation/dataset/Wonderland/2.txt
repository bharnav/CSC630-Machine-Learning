[Verse 1]
Nothing goes to plan
"It's all the game of chance," they say in Wonderland
There's magic in the air
A tragic love affair that I don't understand

[Chorus]
These summer girls are really something else
Our lives are short but the nights are long

[Verse 2]
Mrs. Halloween
Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans
She throws another dart
And narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart
Torn apart

[Chorus]
These summer girls are really something else (it won't be long)
Our lives are short but the nights are long
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on

[Bridge]
So pinch me, I must be dreaming
My life has lost all its meaning
But I like the way I'm feeling now
Kissing your lips at midnight
Under the stars and moonlight
But I never thought we'd be this wrong
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on

[Verse 3]
She's looking good tonight
I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light
Intoxicate my mind
I know that love is blind
And I'm not seeing right
Not alright

[Chorus]
These summer girls are really something else (it won't be long)
Our lives are short but the nights are long
These summer girls are really something else (it won't be long)
Our lives are short but the nights are long
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
The nights go on and on
