[Verse 1]
Tell me that you want me, baby
Tell me that it's true
Say the magic words
And I'll destroy the world for you
An army for the broken hearted
Marching through the streets
And every city's burning
To the ground under your feet

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad

[Verse 2]
I'd melt the polar ice caps, baby
And watch them flood the earth
I'd do anything to show you
What your love is worth
So won't you say you show me your devotion
To heal my aching heart
It's like a neutron bomb explosion
Tearing me apart

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad

[Bridge]
Attention please
We interrupt this program
With some disturbing news
A worldwide evacuation
We're going to lose
And they've pulverised the nation
I guess it shows us just what love can do

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad, bad, bad
I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad
