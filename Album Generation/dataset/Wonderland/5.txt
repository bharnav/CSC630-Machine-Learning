[Verse 1]
I never meant the things I said to make you cry
Can I say I'm sorry?
It's hard to forget
And yes, I regret
All these mistakes
I don't know why you're leaving me but I know
You must have your reasons
There's tears in your eyes
I watch as you cry
But it's getting late

[Chorus]
Was I invading in on your secrets?
Was I too close for comfort?
You're pushing me out
When I wanted in
What was I just about to discover
When I got too close for comfort
When driving you home?
Guess I'll never know

[Verse 2]
Remember when we scratched our names into the sand
And told me you loved me?
But now that I find
That you've changed your mind
I'm lost for words
And everything I feel for you I wrote down
On one piece of paper
The one in your hand
You won't understand
How much it hurts to let you go

[Chorus]
Was I invading in on your secrets?
Was I too close for comfort?
You're pushing me out
When I wanted in
What was I just about to discover?
I got too close for comfort
Driving you home
Guess I'll never know

[Bridge]
All this time you've been telling me lies
Hidden in bags that are under your eyes
And when I asked you, I knew I was right
But if you turn your back on me now
When I need you most
But you chose to let me down, down, down
Won't you think about what you're about to do to me
And back down...

[Chorus]
Was I invading in on your secrets?
Was I too close for comfort?
You're pushing me out
When I wanted in
What was I just about to discover?
I got too close for comfort
You're pushing me out
When I wanted in, yeah, yeah

Was I invading in on your secrets?
Was I too close for comfort?
You're pushing me out
When I wanted in
What was I just about to discover
When I got too close for comfort
When driving you home?
Guess I'll never know
