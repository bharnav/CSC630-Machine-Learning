[Verse 1]
He's drinking cold Corona
Feels like he's getting older now
And noticing how he's finding
Grey hairs left in the shower
Tattoos fade by the hour
And he can't understand these feelings
Why life is getting him down
He used to smile, now he frowns
And cries inside
It's been this way for a while
And he can't seem to put things right

[Chorus]
When life has been unkind
And you're losing your mind
Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find
It feels like time's not on your side

[Verse 2]
He doesn't like to mention
Applying for his pension
So his children don't know he's heading
Into a mid-life crisis
He can't afford the prices
For the new kitchen floor he's buying
He's been a drunk all his life
Two kids, a dog and a wife
He doesn't know
And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows

[Chorus]
When life has been unkind
And you're losing your mind
Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find
It feels like time's not on your side

[Bridge]
Don't know why but somehow
The ones you love you hate now
You feel down and blue
Look at what you've thrown away
They stood beside you all the way
Now it's too late
It's too late for you

[Chorus]
When life has been unkind
And you're losing your mind
Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find
It feels like time's not on your side
