[Verse 1]
When everything is going wrong
And things are just a little strange
'Cause for so long now
You've forgotten how to smile
And overhead the skies are clear
But it still seems to rain on you
And your only friends all have
Better things to do

[Chorus]
When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost along the way
Oh, just tell yourself
I, I'll be OK

[Verse 2]
Now things are only getting worse
And you need someone to take the blame
When your lover's gone
There's no-one to share the pain
You're sleeping with the TV on
And you're lying in an empty bed
All the alcohol in the world
Would never help me to forget

[Chorus]
When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost along the way
Just try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, just tell yourself
I, I'll be OK

[Bridge]
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're not alone

Just tell yourself
I, I'll be OK
Oh, just tell yourself
I, I'll be OK
Won't you tell yourself
Aah

[Chorus]
When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost along the way
Try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, just tell yourself
I, I'll be OK
I, I'll be OK
I, I'll be OK
