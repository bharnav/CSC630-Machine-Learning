[Verse 1]
He's more farce than fodder
He's more of a dog than dogs are
It depends, we're just dots and commas
I'd still say you got one on us

[Chorus]
There's no reason for it
Don't despise it and don't adore it
It's just a habit
It's just a habit I formed

[Verse 2]
This one's a super sonnet
This one's got too much on it
This one's a freak
This one's for free

[Chorus]
There's no reason for it
Don't despise and don't adore it
It's just a habit[x2]
