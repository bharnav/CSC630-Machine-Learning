[Verse 1]
You wait, you wait
You wait for summer
Then you wait for rain
You wait, you wait
You wait for darkness then you wait for day
Yeah, you wait
You wait, you wait

[Chorus]
And she said patience, patience, darling
Patience, patience, it will come

[Verse 2]
You wait, you wait
You wait for August
Then you wait for May
You wait, you wait
You wait together
Then you wait to play
You wait, you wait
You wait for someone that'll make the waiting worth the wait
You wait
You wait
You wait

[Chorus]
