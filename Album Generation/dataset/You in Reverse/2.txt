[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

[Verse 1]
When things are all you think of
And plans are all you make
And thoughts are all you dream of
Your falls are all you take
Look out, the world's destroying you
Relax, it isn't fair
Mother nature's disposition
She don't mind, she don't care
She don't mind, she don't care

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

[Bridge]
Passing over, passions pour
Passing everything

[Verse 2]
I would only be a liar
No, I would only be a liar
If I told you that
It takes up all of your life
These decisions you make
It takes up all of a day
Making them wrong
Well, outside on the patio
The piano's weeping too
Forget about it all for a little while

[Bridge]
She don't mind, she don't care
She don't mind, she don't care
She don't mind, she don't care

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

[Outro]
You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor
