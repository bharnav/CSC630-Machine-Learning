Let's leave tonight
One last time
Before it gets too cold

Just one more round
In that tourist town
With another home for sale

And then one more year
Becomes one more year
And you'll forget me soon, I fear

Through the crooked roads
And the static codes
On the hotel radios

Broken down
Again
So steal the wire
From the rain

Miles away
And it won't play
Not another sound
'Til you say
You're okay

And the motor starts
Its cold and vicious heart
Moves me close to you each day

And when I arrive
My god, you'll be surprised
By all the lines that changed

And one more year
Becomes one more year
And the lights become less clear

So let's meet the road
Tonight we'll drive back home
Forget the hotel radios

Broken down
Again
So steal the wire
From the rain

Miles away
And it won't play
Not another sound
'Til you say
You're okay
