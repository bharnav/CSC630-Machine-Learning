You're two-faced
All sideways
You're dry-eyed
And nightfly
Your thin chokes
And splits spokes
You're high-staked
You're right-faked
Your floor creeps
And deep sleeps
You catch up
You young pup
You old dog
You good fuck

Double X12

You drive paved
You grew a shave
You hardball
You held gold
You last heard
Backward
You luck charm
You black diamond
Your next kin
Your lost twin
Your short-step
Your better rip
You cast light
You snapshot

Yeah, you're my double shadow
You're my double shadow X2
You're my.. double
You're my..
Double shadow
