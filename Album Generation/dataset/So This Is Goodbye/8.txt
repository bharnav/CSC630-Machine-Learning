When no one cares
And the phone never rings
The nights are endless things

You're like a child that cries
And no one heeds the crying
You're like a star that dies
And seems to keep on dying

When no one cares
You count souvenirs
And they glisten with your tears

You can't believe a love like hers
Could come from someone new

When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you
