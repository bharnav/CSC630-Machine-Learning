Feels like time we close the room
You're back in town
Guess ya heard the news:
I'll be gone

Turn to cough
Twist my arm
Call the girls
To nurse my charm

Yeah, I'm like a child
I'm like a child

Stay a while
We don't have long
We could talk for hours
Till my strength is gone
Though I get so tired
I still get wired

My pulse is still
When the doctors gone
I think of you and then I know
What went wrong

I'm like a child
I'm like a child

Close the windows in my room
Stay and hold me like you do
I've go the end in sight, yeah

Like a child
(Yeah ya hold me)
