[Verse 1]
Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right

[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

[Verse 2]
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me

[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

[Verse 3]
And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me

[Outro]
I'm not together but I'm getting there
