[Verse 1]
It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through

[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you

[Verse 2]
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhymes
I'm going to sing my way away from blue

[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you

[Verse 3]
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too

So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do somethings you wouldn't let me do

Oh
I'm going to find another you
