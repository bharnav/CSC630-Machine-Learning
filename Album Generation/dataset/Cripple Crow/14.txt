Well how’s about tellin’ a story?
One that’s really about somebody
What they saw and what they did
How they died and how they lived

By the time I found a name I moved onto another game
Called write a song, toes and spines, is goddamn...
Now I can’t think of any story lines
But you know I’d love to try and sing about a person, place, or thing

Mansonite and the Wolfman, Katmandu, and Honest Abe
Something happens up in Tucson and then it happens again in Maine
San Francisco, sweet thing, ladeedada da... na na!
