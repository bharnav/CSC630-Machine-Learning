Crying out loud for someone to save you
Numb to everything in life
I’ve been dead to you for way too long

You take me away (away)
Now you're bringing me back to life, back to life

Here we are buried under our lives
In a world, oh so cold
Frozen in a moment, just close your eyes
Life was all a dream so put me to sleep

I’ll follow the blood, to you my God
Bring this puzzle back, back to life

I’ve been dead to you for way too long

You take me away (away)
Now you're bringing me back to life, back to life

(Life was all a dream so put me to sleep
Life was all a dream so put me to sleep)

Bring me to life, life, life
Bring me to life, life, life
Bring me to life, life, life
Bring me to life, life, life

I’m on the edge of losing it all
Desperately looking for something
Crying out for someone to save you (Something)
Through the words that somebody gave you (Something)
Breathe into me

He took me away
Now he's bringing me back
Now he's bringing me, now he's bringing me
Now he's bringing me back

You take me away
Now you're bringing me back to life, back to life

Bring me to life, life, life
(I’ve been dead to you for way too long)
Bring me to life, life, life
Bring me to life
