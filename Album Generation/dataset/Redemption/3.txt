How can I
Make you see the price
How can I push you under
How can I
Lead you in the fight
Are you gonna take it farther

There's only so much
That I can do
Is it enough
To make it through

It's not up to me
It's up to you can
Reach for something

You can reach for something

Find what
You gotta find
Just give it A try
You're waking up. x2
X2

How can I
Show you where to go
How can I give direction

I shouldn't
Tell you how to grow
You gotta learn your lessons

There's only so much
That I can do
Is it enough to make it through

It's not up to me
It's up to you can
Reach for something

You can reach for something

Find what
You gotta find
Just give it A try
You're waking up. x2
X2

You're in the dark
So fight it
You've got a spark
So light it

Find what
You gotta find
Just give it A try
You're waking up. x2

There's only so much
That I can do
This is up to you

How can I let you win the fight
Aren't you gonna take it farther this time

Your word's enough. x2

How can I show you where to go

Find what
You gotta find
Just give it A try
You're waking up. x2
X2

You're in the dark
So fight it
You've got a spark
So light it

Find what
You gotta find
Just give it A try
You're waking up. x2
