I've held these words
On the back of my tongue
For far too long

Where do you turn
When your whole
World's gone

I get shot to the bottom
Am I on my own?

They'll try to bash on me
Help me find my way home
Home. x3

It's too late, I'm too late
It's clear you've given up on me

You've given up all hope
Given up on what we used to be

When I'm surrounded
My back against the wall
It's you

I know you'll never be there
When I need a helping hand

All along you've said
The same words
I guess forever
Was just a lie

It's keeping me awake
The way you
Bend and break

You never hesitate
My mind's gone
Six feet under the ground

When I'm surrounded
My back against the wall
It's you

I know you'll never be there
When I need a helping hand

I just thought
You should know
I've reached
An all time low

My mind is barely breathing
'Cause getting even's
All I've ever known

Tell me you're
Right there

I can't fight
Feeling's of hate for somebody
Who didn't care

I watched her everywhere

When I'm surrounded
My back against the wall
It's you

I know you'll never be there
When I need a helping hand

I just thought
You should know
I've reached
An all time low

My mind is barely breathing
'Cause getting even's
All I've ever known
Whoa!
