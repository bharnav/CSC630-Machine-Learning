You're standing on the shoulders of a giant belief

I can't believe what you told us
You're just a liar to me

Just be honest
Honestly I'm sick of all your games

Only time will tell
You're fake 'til our judgement day

Oh, no! Where did your heart go

You've been dressing
Up in sheep's wool
Dancing with the devil

Oh, no! Where did your heart go

Did you think
That you could fool us
With another twist of faith, twist of faith

It's not about who's louder
It's not a trophy you wear
I swear you're not a martyr
Eternity in despair

Just be honest
Honestly I'm sick of all your games

Only time will tell
We're realizing all your charades

Just be honest
Honestly I'm sick of all your games

Only time will tell
You're fake 'til our judgement day
Oh, no! Where did your heart go

You've been dressing
Up in sheep's wool
Dancing with the devil

Oh, no! Where did your heart go

Did you think
That you could fool us
With another twist of faith, twist of faith

Don't fake it
Don't waste these words
Are not for you
Don't fake it, x2
Don't waste it. x2

Your words, x2
Are not the truth. x2

Just be honest
Honestly I'm sick of all your games

Only time will tell
You're fake 'til our judgement day

Oh, no! Where did your heart go

You've been dressing
Up in sheep's wool
Dancing with the devil
Oh, no! Where did your heart go
X2

Did you think
That you could fool us
With another twist of faith

Oh, no!
Don't fake it
Where did your heart go
Don't waste it

You've been dressing
These words
Up in sheep's wool
Are not for you

Dancing with the devil

Oh, no!
Don't fake it
Where did your head go
Don't waste it

Did you think
Your words
That you could fool us
Are not the truth
With another twist of faith
