I've come to see what lies behind those eyes

Try to hide it
But you can't hide
You're full of lies

It gets plain to see
You ways have been disguised

You can't deny it
You've got something to hide
I just want you to know

You're a backstabber
That's all you'll ever be to me
I'll waste my words

What else do you hide behind those eyes?

I've grown so sick of spending my whole life believing your eyes

You can try to fight it
But you know you're what I despise

Then when you're down
And that I hope your thoughts

Are what you regret

You let it show with every single game you play
And everybody knows

You're a backstabber
That's all you'll ever be to me
I'll waste my words

What else do you hide behind those eyes?

I think it's time
To find what you've done wrong

You don't know
What you've done
Everytime you lie

You're just a ghost to me
What else do you hide behind those eyes?
This is the last time

Backstabber, x2
That's all you'll ever be to me
I'll waste my words

You're a backstabber
That's all you'll ever be to me
I'll waste my words

What else do you hide behind those eyes?

Backstabber
That's all you'll ever be to me
You're a backstabber
That's all you'll ever be to me
I'll waste my words

I've grown so sick of spending my whole life believing your eyes
