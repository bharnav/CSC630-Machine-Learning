I'm crawling my way to you, it's brought me to my knees
I never believed your words would knock me off my feet
I'm pushing away the mud that stops me in my tracks
I'll never believe I'd see you standing on my back

It's just wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong

I know you're dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies
Dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies

I'm trying to swim to you trying for one more breath
And everything for you, I do it the best I can
I'm starting to figure out, you're gonna let me drown
Nothing is good enough, you're standing on solid ground

It's just wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong
It's wrong

I know you're dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies
Dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies

Make it up, make it up, we're out of time
I see the truth in your eyes
Say it just make up your mind
Make it up, make it up, we're out of time
I see the truth in your eyes
Say it just make up your mind
Just make it up, you're out of time

I know you're dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies
Dying inside, the things that you hide
Won't let you rest at night, when you're full of lies

Full of lies
Full of lies
