It can be hard at times to realize the gift we've all been given

If we just believe, it'll set us free

We don't always spend our lives
The way we should
Just ask and be forgiven

Give me the strength I need
Give me clear eyes to see

I fell off the map
Been there before
This world is far from perfect

Just give it a chance if nothing more
This life is more than worth it

Give me the strength I need
Give me clear eyes to see
Give, give it all I need, everything

Take it away, x2
Our world full of pain make it okay

Everything
Whoa!
Oh! x7
Whoa!
Oh! x3

Tell me what can we do
The choices we made
The words that you say make it okay

Everything
Whoa!
Oh! x7
Whoa!
Oh! x3

I fell off the map
Whoa! Off the map
I've been there before

I've lost everything
Whoa! Everything
But you give me more

You've given all we need to be everything
