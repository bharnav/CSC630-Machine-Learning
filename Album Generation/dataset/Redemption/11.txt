Me and you got a life
We're chasing
Gotta run, gotta hide to save it

Keep it quiet in the silence
Make it out alive

Let's run away
In your light together
What we give just to live forever

Anything if we ever make it out alive
We don't have to say a word
We don't have to fool this world

Go until
There's nothing left. x4

You are the only thing that's close to me
So quietly we'll make it on our own
Make it on our own

You are my everything
The air I breathe
And I won't let them make me let you go

So lead me down this road

What we got
Is a life worth living
Even if it's light we're missing

In the hope
There's a vision
Make it out alive

We don't have to say a word
We don't have to fool this world

Go until
There's nothing left. x4

You are the only thing that's close to me
So quietly we'll make it on our own
Make it on our own. x2

You are my everything
The air I breathe
And I won't let them make me let you go

So lead me down this road. x2

Time and time
And time again
We'll take the night
And we'll light this flame

I'll find the time to see your face
Some way. x4
X2

You are the only thing that's close to me
So quietly we'll make it on our own
Make it on our own. x2

You are my everything
The air I breathe
And I won't let them make me let you go

So lead me down this road. x3
