We just can't seem to find our way
We are the broken. x2

Whoa!
Oh! x2

We've gone off course
Wash off this poison
We're done wishing

Follow our hearts
But they've been beating
Different patterns

If we surrender, have we lost our inner battles?

Bend back and forth
Find a way out

Oh, x3
We are the broken
Broken, x2
Oh, x3
You are the chosen

We just can't seem
To find our way
We are the broken. x2

Help us to find a better way
We are the broken
You are the chosen

Won't you please show us
The way back home

When I step forward
Why does it feel like two steps back

We're always sinking
Seems so cold
It's never cracked

I think we lost it
All hope we've had locked within

The path we've chosen
Leads us to a bitter end
End, x3
Oh! x3

Leads us to a bitter end, bitter end
Oh! x3
The path we've chosen

We just can't seem
To find our way
We are the broken. x2

Help us to find a better way
We are the broken
You are the chosen

Won't you please show us the way back home

We've walked the bridge and this is to call you out

Your fight is now
Show us the way out

Searching for answers
Find a way out

We just can't seem
To find our way
We are the broken. x2

Help us to find a better way
We are the broken
You are the chosen

Won't you please show us the way back home
