We're not who you say we are

We are everything that you can handle
You've done it once
When will this end

Broken in pieces
This life's in shambles
Damaged from the start
Your dreams are dead
Oh, no! x2

You've pushed me
To the edge again, again

And now you're
Barely breathing. x2
Oh, no! x2

Their truth is torn apart
When will this end
You need revival regression

I can't stand the way
You take the show
'Cause the questions

No repercussions for your actions
You don't deserve our trust

Second chances are not something I have lived for

I am done with this
I am done with you. x2
Oh, no! x2

You've pushed me
To the edge again, again

And now you're
Barely breathing. x2
Oh, no! x4

Their truth is torn apart
When will this end
You need revival regression

Your dreams are dead
Yeah, they've been
Damaged from the start. x2

I'll sing it one more time
You've gotta show some heart

You're spreading lies
You can't
Disguise them now. x2

We found you out
It's endless, you need revival

Oh! Now you're barely breathing
Oh! Let the struggle sink in

Oh, no! x2

You've pushed me
To the edge again, again

And now you're
Barely breathing. x2
Oh, no! x2

Their truth is torn apart
When will this end
You need revival regression
