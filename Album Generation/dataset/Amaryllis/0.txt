[Verse 1]
Give me the wheel, so we can move a little faster
I make it real, I'm not a glorious disaster
What part of living says you gotta die?
I plan on burning through another nine lives
One more for measure, that's ten for the soul
That never sleeps, so are you ready to go?

[Chorus]
Bloodshot against the clear blue sky!
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry!
My my!
I can't lie!
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head!
Bang! Bang! Cause the needle's in the red!
My my!
I can't lie!
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My my!
My sweet adrenaline!

[Verse 2]
Crack in the vision, who said the motivation's all wrong?
Not your decision, the detonation of a time bomb
Which way is up, when your high is low?
It's time to find it are you ready to go?

[Chorus]
Bloodshot against the clear blue sky!
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry!
My my!
I can't lie!
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head!
Bang! Bang! Cause the needle's in the red!
My my!
I can't lie!
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline!
My my!
My sweet adrenaline!

[Bridge]
My my, I just can't lie
It's the speed and the sound that I'm dying to try
My my, I just can't lie
It's the love of the chase that created the ride!

[Chorus]
Bloodshot against the clear blue sky!
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry!
My my! (My my!)
I can't lie! (Can't lie!)
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head!
Bang! Bang! Cause the needle's in the red!
My my! (My my!)
I can't lie! (Can't lie!)
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My my! (My my!)
I can't lie! (Can't lie!)
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My my! (My my!)
My sweet adrenaline!
