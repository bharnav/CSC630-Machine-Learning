[Verse 1]
Say it once, tell me twice
Are you certain I'm alright?
Just a sign, to remind me
That tomorrow's worth the fight

[Partial Pre-Chorus]
Ever changing, the story line that keeps me alive
So make a wish, and say...

[Verse 2]
Give me life, give me love
Scarlet angel from above
Not so low, not so high
Keep it perfectly disguised

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever changing, the story line that keeps me alive
My Mona Lisa's making me smile, right before my eyes!

[Chorus]
Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are...
The miracle in me

[Verse 3]
Show me faith, like you do
I'm amazed at how you move
Side to side, front to back
You know how to make it last

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever changing, the story line that keeps us alive
My Mona Lisa's making me smile, right before my eyes!

[Chorus]
Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are...
The miracle in me

[Bridge]
These are the moments you can't pass back
Let's turn the water to wine, one more time

[Chorus]
Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are...
The miracle in me

[Outro]
The miracle in me
You're the miracle in me
