[Verse 1]
In a while now I will feel better
I’ll face the weather before me
In a while now I’ll race the irony
And buy back each word of my eulogy
All the uninvited tragedies
Step outside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ask yourself now where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the moment you can’t forget

[Chorus]
So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach
Oh oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom

[Verse 2]
Stay a while now, undress your colors
'Cause they’re like no others, I’ve ever seen
I could get used to your company
Step inside

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ask yourself now where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the motions you can’t resist

[Chorus]
So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach
Oh oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis

[Bridge]
In a while now I will feel better
I will be better...

[Chorus]
So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach
Oh oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
