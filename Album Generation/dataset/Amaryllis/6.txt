[Verse 1]
All it takes is a main attraction
Scattered bones underneath the fashion
Lower life on a higher plain
That's what you want
That's what they're givin' away

[Pre-Chorus]
Photogenic, come and get it
You can have it
Take it all!
Schizophrenic, so sadistic
I don't know
I don't know
Politician's sick admission
Dyin' for a curtain call
Counter culture, full of vultures
Bet you think I'm one
We're goin' all out
But get 'em up, get 'em up
And if they wanna take a picture
Tell 'em I don't give a fuck!

[Chorus]
No one needs you after all
That little social scene
It's just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You've inspired
The birth of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

[Bridge]
Nowhere!
Kids
Nowhere!
Kids
Nowhere!

[Verse 2]
The new face of an old distraction
Another victim with the same reaction
A catastrophic contradiction at best
I know you're hanging onto zeros
Cause you got nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
Photogenic, come and get it
You can have it
Take it all!
Schizophrenic, so sadistic
I don't know
I don't know
Politician's sick admission
Dyin' for a curtain call
Counter culture, full of vultures
Bet you think I'm one
We're goin' all out
But get 'em up, get 'em up
And if they wanna take a picture
Tell 'em I don't give a fuck!

[Chorus]
No one needs you after all
That little social scene
It's just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You've inspired
The birth of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

[Interlude]
Nowhere!

[Chorus]
No one needs you after all
That little social scene
It's just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You've inspired
The birth of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

[Outro]
Nowhere!
Kids
Nowhere!
Kids
Nowhere!
Kids
Nowhere
Kids
Nowhere
Kids
Nowhere
Kids
Nowhere
