[Verse 1]
All dressed up
In a white straitjacket
Shut your mouth
No, you can't have it

[Pre-Chorus]
Paper airplanes
Open window
Here today
And gone tomorrow

[Chorus]
I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape
I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you okay
'Cause I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright

[Verse 2]
All messed up
And slightly twisted
Am I sick
Or am I gifted

[Pre-Chorus]
Paper airplanes
Open window
Here today
And gone tomorrow

[Chorus]
I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape
I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you okay
'Cause I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright

[Bridge]
Whoa, I don't care if you apologize
I can't lie
Whoa, I can't lie

[Chorus]
I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape
I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you okay
'Cause I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright

[Outro]
Maybe I like that I'm not alright
