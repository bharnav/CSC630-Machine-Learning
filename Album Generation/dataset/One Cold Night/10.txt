[Verse 1]
I am a plastic man
Wish I could be the one you could be proud of
I'm losing heart again
Wish I could show you what you think I'm made of

[Partial Chorus]
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade

[Verse 2]
I am a perfect sale
Just wrap me up with a bow and flowers
I will neglect to tell
I'll sell your story that we love each other

[Chorus]
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I'll sing my last refrain

[Bridge]
Why don't you let me be?
And I'll pretend I'm well
'Cause you're too blind to see
And I'm too tired to tell
And in your apathy
Your head begins to swell
Another tragedy
That you're too cold to feel

[Chorus]
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I'll sing my last refrain
