[Verse 1]
Hold me now I need to feel relief
Like I never wanted anything
I suppose I'll let this go
And find a reason I'll hold on to
I'm so ashamed of defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to get by

[Chorus]
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

[Verse 2]
I can't face myself when I wake up and look inside a mirror
I'm so ashamed of that thing
I suppose I'll let it go till I have something more to say for me
I'm so afraid of defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to defy

[Chorus]
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

[Bridge]
Hold me now I need to feel complete
Like I matter to the one I need

[Chorus]
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

[Outro]
Now I'm ashamed of this
I am so ashamed of this
Now I'm so ashamed of me
I am so ashamed of me
