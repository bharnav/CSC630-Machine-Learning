[Verse 1]
Last night I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on
I wanna be that magazine
That she bases life on

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
Burn the house down

[Chorus]
She's got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for me

[Verse 2 + (Original Sargon Gas version)]
Last night I saw that beauty queen
Watched her cut her face off / She's getting high on Revlon
I wanna be that magazine
That she wastes her life on

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
Burn the house down

[Chorus]
She's got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for ME!
ME!

[Bridge + Original Sargon Gas version)]
When I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on
I wanna be that magazine / I wanna be the one unclean
That she wipes her ass on

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
Burn the house down

[Chorus (x2)]
She's got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for me

Except for me / For me
Except for me
