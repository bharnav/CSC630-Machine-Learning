[Melvin]
Life on a mattress in a robe
In a room full of emptiness

[Fat Mike]
Knowledge has much better uses than self-pitty and superiority

[Melvin]
Maybe you are or could be the next Hoffman, Mahatma, or Chomsky
But no one will ever know
A sum of your parts are not gonna change any hearts
Not with hate in your eyes

[Fat Mike]
In order to lead by example you have to show a path to a better world
Not a cell
