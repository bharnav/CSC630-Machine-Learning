We call the heartland
Not very smart land
IQ's are very low but threat levels are high

They got a mandate
They don't want man-dates
They got so many hates and people to despise

In the dust bowl
Cerebral black hole
The average weight is well over 200 pounds

I hate to generalize
But have you seen the thighs
Most haven't seen their genitalia in a while

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why they're so scared of us
We've concerns others than fear  and hunger pangs

Queers, transgends, and lesbians
Vegans and vegetarians
All you brownish red and yellow ones
Come out and join us on the coast

No longer svelte
They gotta punch new holes in the Bible belt
They've blown out the fire
Under the melting pot
The red blood of America is starting to clot

No compromise
No sight through others' eyes
They're just flies spreading pieces of shit

You gotta emigrate
Stop living in hate
What makes this country great is dwelling on either side

[Chorus]
They don't want visitors in Jesusland
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland

We want people with college degrees
Drug use experience and STD's
People with open-minded philosophies
Come hug California trees

Cultural revolution now
Neo-conservatives run outta town
We're gonna burn Orange County down
And then we're off to Riverside
Bakersfield and Fresno too
Then we're comin' after you

The fear stricken
Born again Christian
They got a vision, a homogenized state

Textbook decline
Intelligent design
They got Bill Nye on the list to execrate

[Chorus]
They don't want visitors in Jesusland
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland

Punk Rockers and emo kids
People doin' things the church forbids
Buddhists, agnostics, and atheists
We're moving out of jesusland

Art students and thespians
Excluding country, all the musicians
We want all hookers and comedians
Nihilists are welcome too

No longer svelte
They gotta punch new holes in the Bible belt
