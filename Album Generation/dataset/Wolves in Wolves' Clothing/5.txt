When they tightly strap me in, give me lethal injection
Just a few moments to live, no remorse for what I did
It was for the betterment of man, I made the utmost sacrifice
Before more damage could be done I took his life

There was a split second of silence when the dart punctured the skin
Beady eyes rolled back in head, the body dropped from the poison
They could incapacitate me but could not erase my sneer
I heard a thousand people screaming while three billion others cheered
He was gone and I would soon be...

Executed by the state, all appeals would be in vain
I was not criminally insane, in fact I was found to be
An otherwise caring and respectable member of society
A minor threat except for that one man I killed

As the sedatives take effect, I just smile and close my eyes
There's a priest kneeling next to me, he asks me if I realize
I was going straight to hell and he thought that I should know
That the man I killed's replacement planned this whole scenario
And what I did had no significance at all
