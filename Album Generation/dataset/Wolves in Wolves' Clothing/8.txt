I'm on the wagon now
But she doesn't know
I'm getting high on the down low
Cuz when I got the new thing
I got no place to go
Unless I got a bottle in me

I'm in a Cadillac
I'm starting to stare
Who's the guy with the blood in his hair
The last thing I remember
I was going somewhere
And then the stop sign got in the way

[cough]

I'm laying low in a hospital bed
I got a dent, and a crack in the head
That's okay cuz i've got no idea what I just said
Gotta love the hospital meds

I'm getting high on the D.L
