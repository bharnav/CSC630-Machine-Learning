Tired of shootin' smack, tired of on the run, traded the needle... for the gun
Tired of livin' small, tired of the withdrawal, no more retreat give it the all

Oh Benny how many times you tried to kill yourself
OD's and robberies and super stunts, I never thought you'd die from them

Riding around in tanks, fire a round of blanks, Benny had never had such fun
Until he took a wrong step into bomb, and that's when Benny got blowed up

Alone, under a blanket soaked with sweat and piss
We figured Benny would end up like this
We just didn't think for them
