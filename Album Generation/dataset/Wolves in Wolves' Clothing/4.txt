[Verse 1]
We meet in underground parking lots
And late night in coffee shops
With voices low unless we're drunk
We've got hats and cop sunglasses
We question all that is wrong
We discuss conspiracy
Are we enemies of the state
Or idealist bourgeoisie?

[Chorus 1]
I'll get this one, put it on my card
I get frequent flyer mileage
And a booklet of upgrades
So next time I visit the third world
I won't have to fly second-class
The people's revolution
Is gonna be a podcast

[Verse 2]
We took the bus to the anarchist book fair
I left the hybrid at home
I scored an extremely rare
Signed copy of The Communist Manifesto
We protested the G8
Got maced by female police
In hot black uniforms and boots
I got one's email address

[Chorus 2]
Still I'm waiting to see
If my bid on eBay was enough
To get Today's Empires Are Tomorrow's Ashes
On Soviet red vinyl
It's going on the wall
Next to Tubthumper
And The Battle of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles
