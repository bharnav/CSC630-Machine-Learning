We're Rome, Aztec Mexico
Easter Island paradigm
We are followers of Jimmy Jones
Cutting in the Kool-Aid line

We are Animal Farm Pigs
We are a Terry Gilliam film
We are fear Oligarchy
We are wolves in wolves' clothing
We are this planet's kidney stones

In the process of getting passed
Metamorphosis from first to last
A system breaking down beyond repair
A product of three million millionaires
And 100 million easy marks

We are Marie Antoinette
We are Joseph McCarthy
We've finally become the divided states
A nation built on freedoms, fears, and hates
The denotation of Irony

We all want a Hollywood end
But we're getting a foreign one
The script has already been penned
Titled: "the epitaph of a drowning nation"
