[Verse 1]
You and me, we're cut from the same cloth
It seems to some we famously get along
But you and me are strangers to each other
Cause you and me: competitive to the bone
Such tragedy to trample on each other
With how much we've endured, with the state this land is in
You and me feel joined only by gender
We are not all for one and one for all

[Chorus]
Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in

[Verse 2]
You and me estranged from the mother
You and me have felt impotent in our skin
You and me have taken it out on each other
You and me disloyal to the feminine
Such a pity to disavow each other
With how far we've come, with how strong we've been
You and me are on this pendulum together
You and me with scarcity still fueling

[Chorus]
Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in

[Bridge]
We may not have priorities same
We may not even like each other
We may not be hugely anti-men
But such a cost to dishonor a sister

[Verse 3]
You and me have made it harder for the other
We forget how hard separatism has been
You and me we can help change their minds together
You and me in alignment until the end

[Chorus]
Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in
Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in
