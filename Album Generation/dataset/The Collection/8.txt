[Verse 1]
You've been my golden best friend
Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things

[Chorus 1]
I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken

[Verse 2]
You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you, I knew God's face was handsome
With you, I saw fun and an expansion

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything

[Chorus 2]
I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken

[Bridge]
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe

[Chorus 3]
I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together
But I was sadly mistaken
