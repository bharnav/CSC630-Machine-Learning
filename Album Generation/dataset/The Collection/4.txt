[Verse 1]
A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door
While all those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you, my friend, and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip in

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Verse 2]
See yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together, they were friends at school
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it, no, no, no
If I were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Bridge]
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy?
In a world full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, crazy?
In a Heaven of people, there's only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy?

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

[Chorus]
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy
