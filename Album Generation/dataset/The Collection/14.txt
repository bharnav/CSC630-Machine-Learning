[Verse 1]
Like anyone would be
I am flattered by your fascination with me
Like any hot blooded woman
I have simply wanted an object to crave

[Chorus]
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Verse 2]
Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch shepard meet shepard

[Chorus]
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Verse 3]
Like any uncharted territory
I must seem greatly intriguing
You speak of my love like
You have experienced love like mine before

[Chorus]
But this is not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Outro]
I don't think you unworthy
But I need a moment to deliberate
