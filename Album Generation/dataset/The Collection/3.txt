[Verse 1]
I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
I can withhold like it's going out of style
I can be the moodiest baby and you've never met anyone
Who is as negative as I am sometimes
I am the wisest woman you've ever met
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen and you've never met anyone
Who is as positive as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

[Verse 2]
I blame everyone else and not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I'm terrified and mistrusting and you've never met anyone
Who is as closed down as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

[Bridge]
What I resist persists and speaks louder than I know
What I resist you love no matter how low or high I go

[Verse 2]
I am the funniest woman that you've ever known
I am the dullest woman that you've ever known
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known and you've never met anyone
Who's as everything as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here
And you're still here
And you're still here
And you're still here
