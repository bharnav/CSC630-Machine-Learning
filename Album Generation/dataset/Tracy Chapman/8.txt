[Hook]
Two weeks in a Virginia jail
For my lover, for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover for my lover

[Verse]
Everybody thinks
That I'm the fool
But they don't get
Any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you

You (x9)

[Hook 2]
Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed
For my lover, for my lover
They dope me up, and I tell them lies
For my lover, for my lover

[Verse]
Everybody thinks
That I'm the fool
But they don't get
Any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Cimb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you

You (x9)

[Verse 2]
I follow my heart
And leave my head to ponder
Deep in this love
No man can shake
I follow my heart
And leave my mind to wonder
Is this love worth
The sacrifices I make?

[Hook]
Two weeks in a Virginia jail
For my lover, for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover, for my lover

[Hook 2]
Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed
For my lover, for my lover
Dope me up, and I tell them lies
For my lover, for my lover

[Verse]
Everybody thinks
That I'm the fool
But they don't get
Any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you

You (x9)
