[Verse 1]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry, like sorry

[Verse 2]
Forgive me
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive, me forgive me

[Hook]
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine

[Verse 3]
I love you
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you, I love you

[Hook]
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine
You'd be mine
You'd be mine
