[Hook 1]
Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

[Verse ]
While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

[Hook 1]
Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs

[Bridge]
Don't you know
You better run, run, run, run,run,run,run,run,run,run,run
Oh I said you better run, run
Run,run,run,run,run,run,run,run,run,run

[Hook 2]
It's finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
It's finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh

[Verse]
While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

[Hook 1]
Don't you know
Talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
And finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
It's finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
