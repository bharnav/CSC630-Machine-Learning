[Verse 1]
Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
What the little fish are saying

[Refrain]
Oh oooh
The people turned away
The people turned away

[Verse 2]
Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left
To pass the time of day

[Refrain]
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

[Verse 3]
See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run
Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

[Verse 4]
Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growin'
Knowing where they're goin'

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, the people turned away
Oh, the people turned away

[Outro]
Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again

[Refrain]
The people turned away
The people turned away
