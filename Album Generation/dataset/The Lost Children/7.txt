[Intro]
Give it to me

[Verse 1]
Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Raging inside
Pleasure the horror in me
Remove the sickness
Plaguing my mind

[Chorus]
Two worlds are warring in me
Killing us now
Show me the light
Two worlds collide
Whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
While tearing my color away
I swallow my pride
But never forget what I want
Starting to long for a time
I bury the war in my mind

[Verse 2]
Two worlds are warring in me
Both sides are losing
Patience has died
None of them mourner in me
Drowns my conviction
Regions divide

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Tell me when it's time
Show me the light
Tell me when it's fucking over

[Verse 3]
Two worlds collide
Whenever I step to the front
I look for a new place to hide
While tearing my color away
I swallow my pride
But never forget what I want
Starting to long for a time
I bury the war in my mind
