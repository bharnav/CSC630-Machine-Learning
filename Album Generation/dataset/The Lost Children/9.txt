[Intro]
Take me away yeah!

[Verse 1]
That's enough of all your taunting
Seems I can't remove you from my mind
Don't you know that sometimes
I wish they'd kill me for wanting you
I will sit alone in silence
Can't allow the meaning I can find
Will you be defeated when they
Kill me for wanting you

[Chorus 1]
I can't believe that my sanity
Lies in abandoning you
I can't recall the helpless times
Perpetrated by you

[Chorus 2]
Sickened from wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don't say anymore
Now my mind isn't changing
This reckoning's long overdue

[Verse 2]
Alabaster walls surround me
In the prison of my own design
Will I win my freedom if they
Kill me for wanting you
Maybe the arms of Hell will hound me
Just as long as I remain confined
I will be completed when they
Kill me for wanting you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
So I have determined that I am undone
Will I bury another problem
In the graveyard you allowed me to find

[Bridge]
So I have determined that I am no one
When I finally cling to something
And it's never been tied to
Erasing the memory of you

[Chorus 2]
Sickened from wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don't say anymore
Now my mind isn't changing
This reckoning's fucking overdue

[Chorus 3]
