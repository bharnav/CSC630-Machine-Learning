[Chorus 1]
You've got nowhere to hide, and all bullshit aside
You've committed a terrible crime
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life

[Verse 1]
Fucked over again, I even called you a friend
A mistake I won't be repeating
I just don't understand how you can even continue to deny

[Chorus 2]
You know why
You don't remember why
Don't you pretend that you don't know why
You fucking parasite
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life

[Verse 2]
Now what a surprise, to discover the lies
You'll be telling again in no time
You just don't realize they'll come back and be fucking up your life
In trouble again, I just don't understand
This whole pattern that keeps repeating
You know you'll do it again and admit you can step into the light

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Determination has been running on high
No control, for just a taste of my life

[Verse 3]
Because your association has been getting you high
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
