[Verse 1]
I've begun to realize
That I'm better when I am with you
You deliver me from the pain in my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
Til' the day you arrived

[Pre-Chorus]
Certainly I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
An ending in sight and we both know why

[Chorus]
'Cause' you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine

[Verse 2]
Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
They depart me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
You're the one who resurrected
A man who had died

[Pre-Chorus]
Your power, it gave me new life
You made me reborn and revived
Rebuilt from inside and we both know why

[Chorus]
Cause' you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine

[Bridge]
I never thought I would ever escape
At times I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
Thought that I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered, now I
Owe you a debt that I could never repay
I still believe 'cause you're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning inside and we both know why

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine
I can regain control because you're mine
I can take over the world because you're mine
