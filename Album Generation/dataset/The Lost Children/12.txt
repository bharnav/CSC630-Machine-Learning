[Verse 1]
Lost in slumber, a threat to no one
Weak and humbled to my disgrace
Sweet departure, is what I long for
Careless moments to comfort me
Dead philosophy

[Chorus]
If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again
Left behind

[Verse 2]
Too determined, to be forgotten
Nothing left to enrapture me
Hard and silent, softly breaking
No beloving to comfort me
Ooh dead philosophy

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Feel the determination built into my mind
You're never gonna find me, I'll wipe the world away
Your face it will remind me, just how much I have to leave

[Chorus]
If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one to be dehumanized again

[Chorus]
Said if I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again
Left behind

[Outro]
Into my mind
