Na Ha-nha

[Verse 1][x3]
Get in get in get in get into now
Get in get into come take over me

[Bridge]
Get in get in get in get into now
Get on get into like me

[Chorus 1][x2]
Time, not having an easy time
Never going have an easy time
Given the run around to me
I can feel it coming around again
Time, a-changing a-wasting
Come and get up in my face again, yes
Time, given the run around to me
And I'm not having an easy time
Never having it easy
You know this time it has never gone easy
Time never having it easy
You'll never meet another like me
Get in get into like me like me [x2]
Get in get into lie to me like me

But you're never going to give into me
Want a Deity like me

[Chorus 3][x2]
Time, Get it Get it
Time, is just another God Of The Mind

[Chorus 1]
Time, Never having an easy
You know this time it has never gone easy
Time, never having an easy
You'll never meet another like me
