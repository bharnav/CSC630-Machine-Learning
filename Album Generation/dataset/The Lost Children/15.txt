[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning then I'm gone
I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I took the city about one A.M
Loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again
Loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel
Loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal
Loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm aiming for you
I'm going to floor you
Her body's coming
All night long

[Verse 3]
The air's electric, sparking power
Loaded, loaded
Sheâ€™s getting hotter by the hour
Loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Then I'm gone [x2]
