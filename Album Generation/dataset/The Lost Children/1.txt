[Intro]
Shout!

[Chorus 1]
Heavy! You want it heavy!
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it grinding down and
Heavy! I want it heavy!
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it grinding down again

[Chorus 2]
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of light
To another time, to another place
And let the broken ones taste my misery
Rip away the disguise and you will realize that you find
The truth is sickening!
We don't need to change that, really
I kind of like it ugly!
Leave it! Make it!
Binding! Seething! Blinding! Screaming!

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3][x2]
The race of the Mother Culture is thickening!
The rape of the Mother Culture is nearing!
The race of the Mother Culture is sickening!
The rape of the Mother is the loving I need
Bleeding now - 1! 2! 3! 4!

[Outro]
Heavy! You want it heavy!
Welcome to my world, grinding down and
Heavy! I want it heavy!
Feel the weight of the grind and
Heavy!
You want it heavy![x3]
