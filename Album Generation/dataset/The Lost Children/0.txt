[Intro]
Rrwoooaaaw!

[Chorus 1][x2]
Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell!

[Verse 1]
Read me tonight, when the warnings said leave a shudder upon you
Running from all that you feared in your life
Soul of the night, when the sun mislead in a horror upon you
Marking the moment, displaying in my ghost of a life!
And I can’t get round the way you left me out in the open
To leave me to die!
So how can I, forget the way you lead me through the path into Heaven
To leave me behind!

[Chorus 2]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you Hell!

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Free me tonight, as the animal kings breathe their terror upon you
Caught in the moment, engaging in my
Bloodlust tonight, now I can’t control my venom’s flow
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised!

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me

[Chorus 3]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Soul of the night, I know

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]
