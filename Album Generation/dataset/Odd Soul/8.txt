[Verse 1]
I am a nervous reck
Jesus is coming back
Going to catch me at the porno rack
I'm about to have a heart attack

[Chorus]
Am I on hell's highway
Cause I'm walking paranoia
I'm walking paranoia

[Verse 2]
Preachers are on the prowl
And they got me on the TV dial
Say your prayers or burn and rot
Got to move fast when you're on the spot

[Chorus]

If I'm on hells highway
Then I'm going there the right way
Cause I'm walking paranoia
I'm walking paranoia

[Outro]
Better get right or get left
Don't you forget
