[Verse 1]
Rise under pressure
We get tired of learning lessons
On the go is how we survive
We don’t know when it’s goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
But as long as we have
Faith in each other

[Chorus]
Nothing’s going to stop what we started
Nothing’s going to break what we’ve bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It’s all on us

[Verse 2]
The goal is to stay above ground
Control the nervous breakdown
Watch your step
The floor will crumble
We don’t know how it all will end up

[Pre-Chorus}
But as long as we have
Faith in each other

[Chorus]
Nothing’s going to stop what we started
Nothing’s going to break what we’ve bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It’s all on us

[Verse 3]
If we’ve got the same heart that we use to trust
The same spark in our eyes
If we’ve got the same love that used to carry us
Then we can make it out alive

[Chorus]
Nothing’s going to stop what we started
Nothing’s going to break what we’ve bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It’s all on us
