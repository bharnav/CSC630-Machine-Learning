[Verse 1]
I was once a son, now I'm on my own
Wade through everyone and I've got myself to show
The trials and tribulations seem to always track me down
I'll ride off into the sunset and try me another town

[Chorus 1]
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul

[Chorus 2]
Walking side roads
Cause that's the only way I know

[Chorus 1]
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul

[Verse 2]
Watch for who you know, careful what you try
Everywhere I go I still got myself to fight
And if one day my child ever wonders what is wrong
I won't bat an eye when I tell him "Daddy don't belong"

[Chorus 1]
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul

[Chorus 2]
Walking side roads
Cause that's the only way I know

[Chorus 1]
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul

[Chorus 3]
Walk inside rocks
Just trying to find a place called home

[Bridge]
Got an odd soul
Is that all right?

[Outro]
I see it
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul
I see it
I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul
