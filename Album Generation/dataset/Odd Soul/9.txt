[Verse 1]
Serving the time
I walk in shackles across your mind
Dead in the water
I know I've got to convince you why

[Chorus]
You should give me one more reason
Give me on more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high

[Verse 2]
Flower made fool
I keep parading while dressed in rain
What else can I do
Might as well wait here until you break

[Chorus] x2
Just gimme one more reason
Give me on more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high

[Verse 3]
I've been changed
I swear I've been changed
Anything for you
Why not for old times just smile for me
Am I getting through
Or this just how it's got to be
