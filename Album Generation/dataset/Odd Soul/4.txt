[Verse 1]
Aligning stars that you wait for
Always know if you're holding back
Don't slow yourself down anymore

[Chorus]
We watch the days fly
While all the years try
Telling us something
Don't waste a whole life
On just a half try
It's all or nothing

[Verse 2]
Cold sparks are seconds from burn out
Everyone has an hour glass
To turn back upside down

[Chorus]
