[Chorus] [x2]
La, la, la, la, la [x2]

[Verse 1]
Troubled waters, showboat martyr's fall
Overbooked cavalries avoiding everyone's calls

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand on your own, your own
Every chance you take
You own [x4]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Haven't you suffered enough
On the straight and narrow
Stand on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand on your own
Every chance you take
You own [x4]

[Chorus] [x2]
