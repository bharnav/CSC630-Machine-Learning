[Verse 1]
When I was young and unafraid, it was all a game
I was wrong to tell you that
And when I thought all was fair in love and war
I was wrong to tell you that
But it always sounds so good in my head, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have to tell you that
Better watch yourself, you know me well
I'm on a trail and here I come

[Chorus]
Tell your heart heads up [x2]

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't have that thing inside
That tells me when I've said enough
I was going to tell you that
And I don't have a perfect line
For every fight to cheer us up
Or I was wrong to tell you that?
And I know no one keeps you on guard more than I do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Watch out
Tell your heart heads up
And I don't get it
I don't know
What do you want?
Honey, you better

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
You better, better tell your heart heads up
Better, better, heart heads up
Tell your heart heads up

[Outro]
Heart heads up
