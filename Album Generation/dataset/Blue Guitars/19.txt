Ride the wind
Ride the rain
Steal the thunder
Take the pain
Keep it burning
Keep the flame
'Til I find my true love's name

Twelve wild angels
Sing this song
Into forever
They drag me on
Lashed with leather hurricanes
'Til I find my true love's name

This path of hailstones
Is easy to choose
Without a lover
There's nothing to lose
My wrists may bleed
But nothing will change
'Til I find my true love's name

Still I smile and I go on
Let the Devil sing his fearful song
I will not rest
I will not be chained
'Til i find my true
Oh 'til I find my true
Oh 'til I find my true love's name
