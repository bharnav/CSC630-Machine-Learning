I went down to the juke joint
See what I could find
I went down to the juke joint
See what I could find
Well I lost all my money
Too much drinking on my mind
There was a girl down from Jackson
Oh my she looked fine
Yeah there was a girl down from Jackson
Oh my how she looked so fine
She took off with all that I had
Too much drinking on my mind

Now I'm laid out in a jailhouse
But I did not do no crime
Now I'm laid out in a jailhouse
But I did not do no crime
Where I was I don't remember
Too much drinking on my mind
Yeah, they fixed me up real good
Yeah, they fixed me up real fine
I could not think of no alibi
Cos too much drinking on my mind
