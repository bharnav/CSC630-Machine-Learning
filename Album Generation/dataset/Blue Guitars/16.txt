I see her coming down the catwalk
She all silk and high heel shoes
She dressed to kill anybody
Oh this darling she can't lose

She's a diamond in the night
She kick away your aching blues
But it ain't what she's wearing
It's in the way that she moves
Oh, it ain't what she's wearing
It's in the way that she moves

See that big red roasted tail
See him crying like a child
Oh he's got to have this angel
Oh, she's gonna drive him wild
See her see-thru silk kimono
Oh I swear she's gonna blow some fuse
But it ain't what she's wearing
Oh no, it's the way she moves

She got a face that spins your head around
She got a smile you can't refuse
She got eyes that knock you over
Oh this darling she can't lose
She's got a see-thru silk kimono
Oh I swear she gonna blow some fuse
But it ain't what she's wearing, no
It's in the way that she moves
