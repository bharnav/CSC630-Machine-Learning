Better look out
Cos she's coming for you
Oh, you better get ready
Oh, she's waiting for you
She's a whole heap of trouble
I know what she's gonna do

She'll give you lipstick fever
Ttake your eyes off her mouth
She got that come on over look
You know what I'm talking about
Well, she's a whole heap of trouble
She's gonna take you out

She don't care nothing about you
She play around 'til you're broke
You better hand onto your money
Or it'll go up in smoke, yes it will
She's gonna burst your bubble
She's a whole heap of trouble

She's going to break your heart
She's a whole heap of trouble
She's gonna burst your bubble
She's a whole heap of trouble
Yeah, she's a whole heap of trouble
