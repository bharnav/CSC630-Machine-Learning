Oh I moved to the sound
Of my father's shadow
Always pulling on these chains
Trying to break free
Over the wall
Into the darkest night
Not knowing
What was just ahead for me
He used to say
You got to know the way
You got to do some schooling every day

Son, I'm so scared, scared of what I see
Oh you got to cool down or you'll end up like me
Chasing the soul
Of my father's shadow

Oh I hear what they're saying
What they whisper I know
A chip off the block
With a raging fire down below
And no guessing, no guessing
It's so easy to see
Always punching at them walls
Always trying to break free

But I hear mama say
Only trouble goona come my way
Moving to the sound
Of my father's shadow

Mama say God help my child
Mama say I feel he's running wild
She say why why why
Oh cry cry cry
So well I know
So well I know
That raging fire below

Chasing the soul, chasing the soul, chasing the soul
Of my father's shadow
Chasing the soul, chasing the soul, chasing the soul
Of my father's shadow
Oh of my father's shadow
