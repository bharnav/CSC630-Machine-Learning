You say you need some space
Don't want to be tied to nobody that way
I'm hanging on with hands that bleed
Trying to make sense of what you say
And every time I try to make a deal
When morning comes
You forget it
So here's a whole heap of space
Cos if that's what you want
You got it

I been dragging round
Bailing you out
Every time you click your finger
So many things you say you can't do without
You need a slave
And babe that slave ain't me
And I am afraid that's how you'll always be
So if that's what you want
If that's what you want
You got it

Give and take
You'll never understand
It's all take take take
Take as much as you can
So a life without responsibility
I'll gladly give you that
Here, take it from me
Fly away
And you'll find out
What life without me
Is all about
Cos if that's what you want
If that's really what you want
You got it
