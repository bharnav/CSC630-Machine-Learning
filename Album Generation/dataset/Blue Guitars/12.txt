Oh I got me a wild pony
I sure can't stay on top
Oh I got me a wild pony
I sure can't stay on top
Every time I try to pull her in
She always throw me off

Oh I got me a wild pony
She's the type so hard to find
Oh I got me a wild pony
She's the type so hard to find
If she done a rodeo
She kick you off every time

Oh wild pony
Here she come now

Me and my wild pony
Someday I'm gonna break her in
Me and my wild pony
Someday I'm gonna break her in
Gonna take her to the race track
For sure I know she'll win

Wild pony, come on wild pony
