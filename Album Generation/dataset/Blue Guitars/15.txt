Everyone tells me, everyone say
Nobody loses
The American way
Doctors and teachers
So much they can do
Food on the table
And a future for you

Sweet little angel, sleeping so still
I got to run for the boarder now
You won't see me until
Your papa got a good job
Got some money in his hands
Tell your Mama what I'm saying
She will help you understand
So while I'm gone
Pray that it won't be long
We'll be together again
On a shiny new day
Living the dream
The American way

I met a guy on a corner
I gave him all that we could
He said get me a green card
Mama's scared
She thinkd he's no good
I said this time it will work out
Anyway it's all we can do
'Cos we live for your future
That's why I got to get through
So while I'm gone
Pray that it won't be long
We'll be together again
On a shiny new day
Living the dream
The American way
