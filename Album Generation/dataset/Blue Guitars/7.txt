I walk in your garden
And I feel your soul
This time like no other
I don't fear to go
My eyes are wide open
And I'm ready to be
Whatever you're thinking
I already see

Come change my world
Make it better that it was before
Come change my world
You come banging on my door
Two broken angels
Sharing life's scars
You don't wanna change me
And I love what you are
Come change my world

Cos I walk in your garden
This time I can see
This time forever
It feels so safe to just let it be, let it be
Come change my world
Make it better that it was before

Come change my world
You come banging on my door
Two broken angels
Sharing life's scars
You don't wanna change me
And I love what we are
Come change my world
Oh come change my world
