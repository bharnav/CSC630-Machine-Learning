Some say she's a broken honky tonk
Some say she's an ageing queen
But I don't give no fuss
For that bitchin' kind of stuff
Cos honey you're the best I've ever seen
Take me to your darkest secret
Oh tell me of your wildest dreams
Baby just one night is
All I want to do
Get a night with you
All I want to do
Get a night with you

Talking with some boozed up crowd
That put you down
Oh the cold blooded whispers
Man they like to twist it round and round and round
But they can't teach you anything oh no
Cos there's only one thing I need to know
Take me to your darkest secret
Oh tell me of your wildest dreams
Baby just one night is all I want to do
Get a night with you
All I want to do
Get a night with you

Take me to your darkest secret
Oh tell me of your wildest dreams
Baby just one night is all I want to do
Get a night with you
All I want to do, yeah
Is get a night with you
