Sometimes there are no words
To set you free
Sometimes you have to let it go
And let it be
Sometimes there is only
A deep ocean blue
And a wave above
An endless sea

Take off on your sails
And let the wind take you
Take you where she pleases
Where she goes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes all you had
Seemed lost forever
Sometimes nothing you can do can make a change
Sometimes all there is, is deep blue ocean
One pair of footprints is all that remains

Take off on your sails
And let the wind take you
Take you where she pleases
Where she goes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
