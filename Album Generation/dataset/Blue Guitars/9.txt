White god standing
By the breaking waves
Thirty pieces of silver
Everybody gave
You drop 'em in
Eat 'em up
You drink his wine
From a plastic cup
The soul of this place
You've taken from me
So screw you
And your deep blue sea

Complex phrases
Hide what's true
The biggest lies
You ever knew
The virgin angel
She screams and chokes
She's drowning now
In a pool of bootleg coke
I'm getting off while my soul's still free
So screw you
And your deep blue sea

They say the Lord
Turned their sins to stone
The gold and silver fell off
The dried up bones
The golden beaches
Of my younger days
Thirty bits of silver
Sold into the poisoned waves
The soul of this place
You've taken from me
So screw you
And your deep blue sea
And your deep blue sea
I'm getting off
While my soul's still free
Yeah screw you
And your deep blue sea
And your deep blue sea
