When tomorrow comes
The first day for me
That I will rise
Not so young
But free
Gonna paint the town
The brightest red
A drink for every time you said
That we were one
Always to be
I leave at home the ring you gave to me
And I will smile
As the sun comes shining through
If I ever get over you

I'm gonna laugh
No more the silent one
Dance upon tables
Never home 'til midnight, been and gone
I'm gonna throw away
All my clothes so blue
Gonna try everything, everything that's new
And when tomorrow comes
The first day for me
Then I will rise not so young, but free
I will smile
As the sun comes shining through ...
If I ever
If I ever get over you

Somebody said this new life
That I have come to know
I should have tried it
Oh so many years ago
The glimpse of freedom
Sings such a happy song
It's such a shame that it's only there
Only there for one
And I will smile
As the sun comes shining through
If I ever, If I ever
Get over you
