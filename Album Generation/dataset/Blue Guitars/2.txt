She come on like a whorehouse
All painted in lipstick red
She had some kind of making
You believe everything she said
She said guilt and confusion
It's just an illusion
Only a fool plays by the rules
Only a fool plays by the rules

Stick with me baby
Try to look cool
Cos only a fool plays by the rules

She show me things that I never, ever seen saw
She took me way past my red light
Showed me what the night was for
Guilt and confusion
Now I know it's just an illusion
Only a fool plays by the rules
Only a fool plays by the rules
Stick with me baby
Try to stay cool
Only a fool plays by the rules
