[Verse]
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

[Outro]
"Wrong, do it again!"
*knock* "Time to go!"
"Are you feeling okay?"
"He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!"
"Hahahahaha!!!!!!"
Is there anybody out there?
