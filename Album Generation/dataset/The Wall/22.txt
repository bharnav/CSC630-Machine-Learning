[Intro]
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton Town Hall where we're going to be...

[Verse 2: Waters]
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

[Verse 3: Gilmour and Waters]
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Outro]
