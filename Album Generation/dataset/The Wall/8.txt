[Verse 1]
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh, baby set me free

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Outro]
