[Spoken: Harry Waters]
Look, Mummy
There's an airplane up in the sky

[Intro]
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo

[Verse 1]
Di-di-di-did you see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-did you hear the falling bombs?
Di-di-di-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave, new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

[Bridge]
Oooooooo
Oooooooo

[Verse 2]
Di-di-di-did you see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

[Outro]
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
