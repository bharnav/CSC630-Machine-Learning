For so long, the king was alone
King Baby Duck sat alone on his throne (oh no)
Everyday went and alone he remained
Then came the Queen Bee and everything changed
You can't have some rock, lest you got some roll
Now the two are complete and they rule the whole show (whole)
(Shh... here they come)

Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Stop!

The King and Queen, they couldn't take no chance
Baby Duck and Queen Bee have to make us dance
And with a wave of their hand and by a royal decree
Baby Duck and Queen Bee will make us see... ooh

(Here they come, it's the King and Queen)
(You there, come here, I want to sing for you)

Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Hail the King and Queen
Queen Bee and Baby Duck
Hail
Stop!
