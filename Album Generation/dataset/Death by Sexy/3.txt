I like to move, yes I move in the night
You know I mellow down easy; yes it is a sight
I like to stroll, yes I take my time
& when them woman start dancing...
Got to make them mine

You know we move, yes we move
Cuz we like our dancing

I wasn't shakin, then I'z shakin so hard
That's when I saw a mean women struttin in the yard

She got the shakes, yeah she shake it real cool
Yeah she make me start a dancing, now she makes the rules

You know we move, yes we move
Cuz we like our dancing
