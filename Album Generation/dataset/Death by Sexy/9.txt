I'm ready to roll
You know I'm getting ready to do it
I gotta feeling on a Saturday night
I'm gonna bow for a woman
Who could help me chase the devil, oh yeah
I'm gonna chase the devil tonight
I'm gotta feel it and I feel real good
I gotta feeling on a Saturday night
I wanna bow to the woman
Who can help me chase the devil
Yeah, help me chase the devil tonight
Get down!

Gonna chase the devil tonight
They chase the devil tonight

Ready to roll, you see the devil on a post
Yeah he's lookin' for a woman
Who can soften a rope
And drive the little woman to the hoop holes
Fill out when about
Ready to roll, I bet I feel real cool
I said I feel pretty cool on a Saturday night
I'm gonna browse for a woman
Who can help me chase the devil
Yeah, I'm gonna chase the devil tonight

Chase the devil, I want you to deliver too
Put your ass on the street corner
Dancin' with your feet

Chase the devil tonight
They chase the devil tonight
