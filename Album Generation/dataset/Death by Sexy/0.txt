A-ha-ha-ha...

I want you so hard, I want you so good
But can you trust me? Yes, you know you could

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
Don't waste your time cause the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
Just leave him alone cause the boy's bad news

I want you so hard, I want you so good
Now take a chance, momma, you know you should

Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
You're wastin' your time, the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
Leave him alone, 'cause it's just bad news

I want you so hard, I want you so good
But can you trust me? Yes, you know you could

Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
You're wastin' your time, girl, the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin' and they're tellin' you
Just leave him alone cause the boy's bad news, bad news

The boy's bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
