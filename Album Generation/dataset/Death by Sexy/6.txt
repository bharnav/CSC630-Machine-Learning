Pointy kitty won't you give us a play?
It's enough time that you can blow in our mind
Come on now girl now won't show me the way
So what's your secrets
Cause you know we're gonna play

Keep your head up
Oh honey won't you keep your head up

Pointy kitty you gonna give us a play?
Go on and do it, don't you give me no sass
Come on now baby won't you shake your behind
We'll show you secrets we're never gonna play

Keep your head up
Oh honey won't you keep your head up

Oh you wanna pass?
Well I know you will try this side of my ass!

Keep your head up
Oh honey won't you keep your head up

Ronald Reagan!
