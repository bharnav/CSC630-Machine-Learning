Sunrise...

Get your motor running
Come on, dance with me
Your momma and your poppa always hassle me
Get you home by midnight but it's ten to three
Stop huffin' and a'puffin' like a shasta beast

A little voice is saying I'm a bad man
Don't you listen!
Just keep on rollin'!
It's a chemical reaction
We'll shake some tail feather baby
'Til we see the sunrise

Get your motor running
Come on, dance with me
Your momma and your poppa always hassle me
Get you home by midnight but it's ten to three
Get your motor running
Come on, dance with me

Huffin' and a'puffin in my backseat
But I don't worry, no, I don't hurry
I'm a toy some come play with me
We'll shake some tail feather baby
'Til we see the sunrise

Get your motor running
Come on, dance with me
Your momma and your poppa always hassle me
Get you home by midnight but it's ten to three
Stop huffin' and a'puffin' like a shasta beast
I wanna pick the lock and break your chastity
I've got the combination and the master key
I'm a dancer and romancer not a monster beast
None come before you
None come after me
