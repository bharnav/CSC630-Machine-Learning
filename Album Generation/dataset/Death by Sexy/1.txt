I gotta feeling that you wanna come over
I get you here and I will make you roll over

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
I got the flesh and I will make you scream, ohh
You're doing things that make my flesh burn hot, oh
I got to give in, damn, Baby, please don't stop, oh

Now look it, baby, you're just nineteen
Now look it, baby, you're just nineteen

You know I love it when our bodies move closer
And when it's finished, yeah, it only starts over

I touch you there because I know the spot
You know I'm everything that he's just not
And when I hear it, yeah, you feel a shot
I'm comin' for ya, baby, ready or not

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
Flesh so hot, ready or not

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
You got the flesh that's gonna make me hot

I gotta feeling that you wanna come over
Ohh, I get it in and I will make you roll over

I touch you there bcause I know the spot
You know I'm everything that he is just not
Ohh, you're doing things that make my flesh burn hot, oh
I got to give in, damn, Baby, please don't stop, ohh

Now look it, baby, you're just nineteen
Flesh so hot, ohh, ready or not, oh

Now look it, baby, you're just nineteen
You're so hot, oh
