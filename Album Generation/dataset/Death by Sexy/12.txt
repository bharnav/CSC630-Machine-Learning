Oh yes I got me some trouble lord because I changed one womans name
Oh yes I feel so sad and lonesome
Words will dress me up all up in shame
Just like the good lord walk the wall so long ago on the sea of gallilee
Suddenly a big ol' Bag O' miracles come and lift that woman right off of me

[Spoken] Amen

Oh yes I got me some trouble lord because I changed one womans name
Oh yes I feel so sad and lonesome
Words will dress me up all up in shame
Just like the good lord Jesus walk the wall so long ago on the sea of gallilee
Suddenly a big ol' Bag O' miracles come and lift that woman right off of me

(clapping)

[Spoken] Amen...praise God!
