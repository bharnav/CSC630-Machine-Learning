[Brick & Lace]
You want sexy
I give you sexy
Heh-he
It's brick and lace and Jurassic 5
And I like that

Mercy yeah!
Mercy yeah!

There's Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, she looks like Sugar and the Plum
Plum plum

[Jurassic 5]
Yeah
You're too cute too resist
And you'll probably wanna mention
That you are not used to this
Hope I don't seem hard pressed
Can a brother get your number email address
I'mma keep my eyes glued
And hate on any brother you that talks to you
Cuz anytime another
Comes around harder than i
Put it on paper this is what i would describe
Intelligent
The fly female
Perfume smell even if its not from Chanel
Hair and fingernails
The fly debutante is what I want
And you can trust me
Plus give me props when you discuss me
Its about to be super ugly
But tonight's the night that's gonna make your love
It's in the pocket

[Chorus: Brick & Lace]
There's Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, she looks like Sugar and the Plum
Plum plum

[Jurassic 5]
Yo
What it look like
She look like
We, my ticket at the end of the night
Ugh, she my type
Tall just my height
Tall brown skin
African decent
So decent
World wide princess
Get down to business
Ain't by the bullshit (mmm-hmm)
Y'all know
Stand up tall
Queen of the bar
Nah, she ain't a pimp y'all

[Jurassic 5: Chali 2na]
Back and forth
Forth and back
With your back support
Got your back
We gonna have a laugh
'lil chat
Some food after that
Have a pack
Bake a crack
Take a step back
(there's a)
Push it with a burst of air
Will it work
Will i thurt
Will i persevere
Till the dirt
Im a flirt
First one with dear
Im afraid when the worst is near

[Chorus: Brick & Lace]
There's Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, she looks like Sugar and the Plum
Plum plum

[Jurassic 5]
Her day starts with a bus and backpack
Half burn cigarette
Study and some black facts
Baby got it gonna on in the her own hood
All the fellas on the ride
Know it's all good
Is it really tho?
Ask me how i figure tho
Give me just a second and
I'mma tell you what a brothers know
She was 15
Following her for-scene
You know flossin'
Moe when tossin'
Baby had dreams but she put em off often
She'd rather slow one and grow a damn high
Living in the hood is like walkin' on a landmine
Yeah, come on

[Brick & Lace]
Watch me shake it to the left and copy it up on the right
Me gots the goods to deliver
I got the mind to shiver
Come for rockin'
Come for rockin'
It's in the pocket
No one can stop it, yeah

[Chorus: Brick & Lace]
There's Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, Brown Girl in the Ring
Tra-la-la-la it, she looks like Sugar and the Plum
Plum plum

Show me emotion
Tra-la-la-la
Show me emotion
Tra-la-la-la
Show me emotion
Tra-la-la-la
He looks like a sugar in a plum
Plum plum
