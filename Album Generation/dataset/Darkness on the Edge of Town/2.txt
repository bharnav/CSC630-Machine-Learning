[Verse 1]
I'm riding down Kingsley
Figuring I'll get a drink
Turn the radio up loud
So I don't have to think
I take her to the floor
Looking for a moment when the world seems right
And I tear into the guts
Of something in the night

[Verse 2]
You're born with nothing
And better off that way
Soon as you've got something they send
Someone to try and take it away
You can ride this road 'till dawn
Without another human being in sight
Just kids wasted on
Something in the night

[Bridge]
Nothing is forgotten or forgiven
When it's your last time around
I got stuff running 'round my head
That I just can't live down

[Verse 3]
When we found the things we loved
They were crushed and dying in the dirt
We tried to pick up the pieces
And get away without getting hurt
But they caught us at the state line
And burned our cars in one last fight
And left us running burned and blind
Chasing something in the night
