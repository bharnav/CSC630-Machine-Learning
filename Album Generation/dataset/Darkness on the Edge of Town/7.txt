[Verse]
When the night's quiet and you don't care anymore
And your eyes are tired and there's
Someone at your door
And you realize you wanna let go
And the weak lies and the cold walls you embrace
Eat at your insides and baby I ainâ€™t no liar, I walk
Streets of fire

Now I'm wandering, a loser down the tracks
An' I'm lyin', but babe I can't go back
Cause in the darkness I hear somebody call my name
And when you realize how they tricked you this time
And it's all lies but I'm strung out on the wire
In these streets of fire

I live now, only with strangers
I talk to only strangers
I walk with angels that have no place
And so looking at my face
Don't a come little close, cause I'm strung out on my wire, cross
Streets of fire
