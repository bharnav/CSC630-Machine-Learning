What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
And why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
But you took my heart and you threw my heart away.
That's why I ask the Lord up in Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?
