Blow, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good, no good

Go, ill wind, go away
Skies are, oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that ain't good

You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
And ain't that a shame ?

It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Please let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
