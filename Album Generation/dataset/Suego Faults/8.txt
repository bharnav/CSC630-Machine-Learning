"Where Are You Now"


I tried to move, I cannot see
Yeah, you have got a hold on me again
And everywhere I turned I saw your face, you made my world a pretty place back then

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

And in the day and in the night, nothing can recall your sight to me
And I don't know why we didn't stay and leave like it was supposed to be
Oh, now every time that I stand still silence sticks of rolling hills go by
And in the night you see your face, but I will never know that place will I?

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Hey girl you got a hook on me, I tried to fight it but I could not see
And if you ever want to come back to me, oh oh oh
You're a strange girl, you've got a hook on me
When the morning comes, come on don't take away this dream
But if you ever want to come back to me, oh oh

So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?
So where are you now, where are you now?

Where are you?
Where are you?
