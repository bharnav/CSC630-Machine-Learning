"The King And All Of His Men"


Well you can ﬁght it but you know that you won’t get your way in the end
Too many people, the King and all of his men
And if you’re dealing a line of cards
Won’t you take me to the queen of hearts?
And if you’re trying to tear down what you see
Pack up the stars before you come for me
And if you’re dealing a line of fate
Who’s going to tell her the reason I’m late?

You took her soul, so incomplete
Why don’t you stop ﬁghting me?
You’re in control so why should you be
Fighting me? Fighting me? Fighting me?

How to be sure that what you say is the truth
When I see ﬂaws in everything that you do?
And if I’m passing a sentence on you
I would give you the crown for a fool
And now you’ve lost, there’s nothing left to defend
You came so close to the King and all of his men
And if you’re dealing in a trick of the light
I need to see her face for one last time

You took her soul, so incomplete
Why don’t you stop ﬁghting me?
You’re in control so why should you be
Fighting me? Fighting me? Fighting me?
