Heat is rising
Feeling high and I'm on my way
Tell me if you wanna take a hit
Right beside you
I came to fight so get out of my way
Cause daddy told me don't you ever
Take no fucking shit

So get it right
I'm gonna get to you

Laughing as I spit your way
Faster that a fucking flash of light
Stomach's burning alcohol
I must have burned
A bottle full
And you ain't got a chance
In hell tonight

So get it right
I'm gonna get you

A thousand miles of chicken wire
A foot of lead
Daddy didn't raise no fucking fools
Coming up on your right
Coming up on your right
No one is going to fuck with
Me tonight

So get it right
I'm gonna get to you
