[Verse 1]
White lemon days
Blue colored lines on your face
Devil in your best
Settling like death to the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Now loosening your grip
Feel the wheel slip from your hands
Walking the devil's dog
And carrying his groceries

[Chorus 1]
I fell on black days
Fell on black days
How would I know that this would be my fate
White lemon days

[Verse 2]
Love steal the schemes
Drive around like spaceships on bald tires
Burn the mother's milk
So another fog is in line

[Pre-Chorus]
Now getting the devil's kiss
And wipe the mothers kiss from my face
Keep a stiff upper lip
Spitting on my past to the pain

[Chorus 2]
I fell on black days
Fell on black days
How would I know that this would be my fate
How would I know that this would be my fate
I fell on black days
I fell on black days
