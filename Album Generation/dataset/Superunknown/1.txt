[Verse 1]
Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels alright
Break, if you like the sound
If it gets you up
If it takes you down
Share, if it makes you sleep
If it sets you free
If it helps you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave
Hey

[Verse 2]
Cry, if you want to cry;
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray, if you want to pray
If you like to kneel
If you like to lay

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave

[Chorus]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave

[Verse 3]
Cry, if you want to cry;
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave

[Chorus]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

[Outro]
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off, keep it off
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off, keep it off
Keep it off my wave
