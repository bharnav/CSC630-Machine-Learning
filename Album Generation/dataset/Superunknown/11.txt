[Chorus 1]
Long time coming
It seemed to get me through
Long time coming
Many served the few
And long to taste the shame
That bows down before you

[Verse 1]
Long time coming
It seemed to get me by
Long time coming
It seemed to satisfy
You longed to taste the shame
That everybody tries

[Chorus 2]
Shame shame
Throw yourself away
Give me little bits of
More than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue
Or naked in your eyes
Give me little bits of
More than I can try

[Chorus 1]
Long time coming
It seemed to get me through
Long time coming
Many served the few
And long to taste the shame
That bows down before you


[Chorus 2]
Shame shame
Throw yourself away
Give me little bits of
More than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue
Or naked in your eyes
Give me little bits of
More than I can try
