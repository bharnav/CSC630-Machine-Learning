[Verse 1]
Hello don't you know me
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
The most important fool you forgot to see
I've seen how you give it
Now I want to receive
I'm sure, for you would do the same for me

[Chorus]
Cause I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah, I'm riding you all the way

I'm riding, yeah

[Verse 2]
For all of your kisses
Turned to spit in my face
For all that reminds me which is my place
For all the times when
You made me disappear
This time I'm sure you will know that I'm here

[Chorus]
Cause I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah, I'm riding you all the way

Riding you all the way
Riding you all the way
Riding
Riding all the way

[Verse 3]
My place was beneath you
But now I'm above
And now I send you a message of love
A simple reminder of what
You won't see
A future so holy without me

[Chorus]
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the...
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah, I'm riding you all the way

I'm riding you all the way
Yeah, I'm riding you
Yes, I'm riding you
I'm riding you
Yes, I'm riding you
I'm riding you all the way
Yes!
