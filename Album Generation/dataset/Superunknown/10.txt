[Verse 1]
Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
My mother says that's the only life

[Chorus]
So do it right
Do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

[Verse 2]
Kickstand, I got a saddle made of leather
Kickstand, I got the words to come together
I got the urge to ride your trike
My mother says that's the only life

[Chorus]
So do it right
Do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

[Verse 1]
Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
My mother says that's the only life
