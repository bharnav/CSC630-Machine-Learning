[Verse 1]
I see that smile
I see that smile
I see that smile on your face

We hear you cry
We hear you wail
We see that smile on your face

[Verse 2]
We see you laugh
We see you dance
We take that away every day

We see you cry
We turn your head
Then we slap your face

[Chorus 1]
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down with your life
Head down
Head down
Head down hide that smile

Head high
Head high
Head high you've got to smile
Head high
Head high
Head high you've got to smile

[Verse 3]
We see you try
We see you fail
Some things never change

We hear you cry
We hear you wail
We steal that smile on your face

[Chorus 2]
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down live your life
Head down
Head down
Head down hide that smile

Head high
Head high
Head high you've got to smile
Head high
Head high
Head high like a song you like
