She's a hotel senator from a nightstand fatherland
She's a representative of the broadcast prison band

And if you need her around, she's around and around
When you're down on some downs on the down

She's a hotel senator on the sunny side of nights
Makes the world turn again like a real gun-shaped knife

Hotel Senator, you're my destination
Hotel Senator under investigation
Hotel Senator, we're going on probation

At the Hotel Senator, there's a Bible by the bed
Where the nightstand overflows and the blood is Bible red

Hotel Senator, you're my destination
Hotel Senator, pending liquidation
Hotel Senator, we're going on probation
