Eyes that never close, hands too numb to hold a glass or matchstick
Everybody knows this old house is cold and crowed with halfwits
Cemetery Row is not such a bad place -- don't you want to go?
Bars that never close one every corner, Cemetery Row

Lemonade and gin
Life is wearing thin by general consensus
Nothing is a sin
Fall out of your skin so free and defensless
Cemetery Row is not such a bad place -- don't you want to go?
Bars that never close one every corner, Cemetery Row

Used to be afraid
Now we love to fade into the procession
No more the insane
Memory lane runs in the other direction
Cemetery Row is not such a bad place -- don't you want to go?
Bars that never close one every corner, Cemetery Row
