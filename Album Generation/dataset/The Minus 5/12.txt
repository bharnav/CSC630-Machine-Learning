Original Luke was a careless man
Heart as hard as the Grand Coulee Dam
With silos tall over great north gorge
A shadow in each hand
A shadow 'cross the land

Original Luke bartered better times
Clanking 'round like a bag of wine
His halo gone and his hat below
An antique in his prime
A man so out of time

I'm just trying to tell you how tired my soul is tired
I'm just trying to tell you that the wires are all unwired
My globe is rolling down and down, and my lost soul is so tired

Luke was run down by a coffee stand
A famous caffeinated brand
He dove right down in a black manhole
A good girl in each hand
A shadow 'cross the land

Original Luke guzzled gasoline
He drank it down 'til his tube was clean
Pine trees bent down to make a box for ashes and a dream
There's nothing much between
