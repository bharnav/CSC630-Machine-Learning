You're worn out
I'm worn out
We're all worn out
A million days, a thousand years, a house that falls down
Nothing seem to make a difference anymore, and nothing's such a lonely sound
Somewhere in the distance feet might find a floor, but it's all worn out

Here I am Birmingham
So all worn out
Dull and void, another box, too small to stand up
Nothing seems to make a difference anymore, and nothing's such a lonely sound
Hard from such a distance to kick down the door
These boots are all worn out

Found a gun
Can't melt it down
Too all worn out
Time will tell, not very well
The worst to come, dear
