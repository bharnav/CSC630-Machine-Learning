Ask me for a moment to reflect
And I will tell you where I was when you went down
Show me where the lines can reconnect
And I will parallelogram you to the ground
There's no sound like falling down
And the mineshaft's pretty deep
There's no mattress, no soft ground
And no film treatment for my life as a creep

People try to put you in a book
The words look good in black and white, I guess they should
Gazing from the cliffs, you overlook
The road that separates the future from the woods
There's no town like safe and sound
And the walls are smooth and steep
There's no mattress, no soft ground
And no film treatment for my life as a creep

I just hope one day you'll understand I'm not supremely evil
And I can be better than I am

You can take your guns to town or run
But there is no forbidden planet far enough
The slasher knows you'll trip over a tree trunk
But you still wander off alone no matter what
There's no end like safe and sound
And no beauty like asleep
There's no mattress, no soft ground
And no film treatment for my life as a creep
And no film treatment for my life as a creep
And no film treatment for my life as a creep
