I had six white Russians tonight, and two of them were people
It's not pretty when your best friend is a saloon
And you're always out there on the maroon

Like a pencil sticking in your neck, this feeling's getting creepy
It's not easy when you can't get off the balloon
And you're always out there on the maroon

Sometimes you feel like you haven't got a friend
But they're not so far away
Sometimes it feels like it's never gonna end
But do you want to lose these days?
Do you want to lose these days?
No

I know you're strapped in the intensive care chair
But don't ever call me sleepy
You're in a typhoon, and I might as well be on the moon
It's all so lonely out there on the maroon

So put a pet rat in your backpack
Take a walk when it's cool and breezin'
Never regret all those days drawing Sailor Neptune
She stood by you out there on the maroon
And you're always out there on the maroon
I know you're always out there on the maroon
