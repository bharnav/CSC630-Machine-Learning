I heard the wolves begin to howl
(We're gonna be there soon)
I saw the old farmer ditch his plow
(We're gonna be there soon)
Midshipmen plunging from the bow
Down at the Twilight Distillery

Give me a lantern and a pail
(We're gonna be there soon)
I'll take a head that's full of nails
(We're gonna be there soon)
I'm sticking with whatever fails
Down at the Twilight Distillery

Cause twilight 's alright
Twilight's alright
I'm gonna leave my feet behind
And there is nothing in my mind
There is nothing, and I don't mind

(We're gonna be there soon)
(We're gonna be there soon)

I'll crawl across Death Valley floor
(We're gonna be there soon)
Fight through the fire of the earth's core
(We're gonna be there soon)
I'll float like Casper through all doors
Down at the Twilight Distillery
Down at the Twilight Distillery
Down at the Twilight Distillery

Twilight 's alright
Twilight's alright
Twilight's alright
Twilight's alright
Twilight's alright
Twilight's alright
Down at the twilight distillery

We're going to be there soon
