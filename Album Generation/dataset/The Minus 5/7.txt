Your mama knew it, now I know it too
Across the kitchen table she barely looked at you
The paperbacks were piled up
She read them all right through
Saying all you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze

Your mama knew it
Now I know it too
All you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
(Woo hoo hoo)

And if i go to Houston, I'll find your daddy's grave
I'll thank him for the sunshine that dragged me from a cave
I'll ask him to forgive me for being such a screw
And I'll tell him that I'll always be in love with you
Be in love with you

Your mama knew it
Now I know it, too
All you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze

I'm not frozen back in time
Time fall forward in a line
The spread of ashes, the sting of lime
The floating mold, the stain of wine
Next thing you know, situation is lose-lose
When all you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze

Your mama knew it
Now I know it, too
All you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
(Woo hoo hoo)

You barely had a family
It's lucky when you can
Believe in something different and hold it in your hand
It's smaller then a breadbox
More fragile than a plan
No different than a seabird
Rotting in the sand
Rotting into the sand

Your mama knew it
Now I know it, too
All you really need
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
Cigarettes, coffee and booze
(Woo hoo hoo)
