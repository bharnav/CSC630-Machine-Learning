The quartermaster bakes a radio
The traitor's a rag doll in the tornado
The funnel fades to gray
With hands upon the bible, who's to say?

I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is all that I can shoulder anymore
I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is colder than the one I held before
Is colder than the one I held before

If happiness is warm, I'll take the fur
A wolverine that dies all for your pleasure
One bullet wins the race
The bible chucked into the fireplace

I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is all that I shoulder anymore
I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is colder than the one I held before
Is colder than the one I held before

She's not a girl the missus much reveres
But someone else appears inside the mirror
Through a window-painted face
The room is filled with smoke and bible flakes

I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is all that I shoulder anymore
I never meant to lie
This rifle called goodbye is colder than the one I held before
Is colder than the one I held before
The quartermaster broke the radio
