I like with a gun
The way you shine
Silver barrel in the sun
It's no wonder I sleep underground
'Cos I just want to
I just want to be around

I'll kick your sister's ass
I'm going to take your brother's face and smash it in the grass
It's no wonder I am spiral-bound
'Cos I just want to
I just want to be around

Every day when I feel this way
I need somebody to say, "It's okay"
Shoot some holes in my crow-black sky
Saying, "Life doesn't really half-suck most of the time"

This is a tale of dynamite
Like those two ships that blew up in the night
It's no wonder I'm that sinking sound
'Cos I just want to
I just want to be around

I like you with a gun
I'm so loaded
Chamber's spinning 'round
But I just want to
I just want to be around
