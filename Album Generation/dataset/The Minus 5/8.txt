It was late when you fell into the show
And I was too far gone to abort the mission
Metal plate in my head, felt it start to glow
Then you came into my world like an incision

I don't want to be that strong
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, when I'm gone
Every week is two years long
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, on and on

More than fate, when your dream don't coagulate
And the ones you love hate you for good reason

(People say)
People say you can't hang in the congregation
They'll want to cut you out like a foreign lesion

I don't want to be that strong
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, when I'm gone
Every week is two years long
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, on and on
On and on

It's too late, when you're trying to swim through the snow
No angel wings or heavenly transmission
No more dates
Every calender is unemployed
But I've still got an X to mark the incision

I don't want to be that strong
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, when I'm gone
Every week is two years long
(Leftover life to kill)
Leftover life to kill, on and on
On and on
On and on
