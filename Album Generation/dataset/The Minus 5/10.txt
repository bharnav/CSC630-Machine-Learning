Let's set the date for the funeral parade, cause I can't wait to be forgiven
And I'll be there like a pillow in the snow, that covers the fair like J.Lo linen
I never want to let you go, and that's why I bought this rope
We've got a flask and the barker's got a smoke
Let's all share a glass to beat the freeze out
You can drink on my ride any time, if i can swing from your treehouse
I never want to let you go, and that's why i bought this rope
I bought a rope

Here comes the light - what a fine morning to mourn
I mourn the night without a sleep-sound
The choir sings and the bell bangs right along
Cut steel strings in the treehouse
I never want to let you go, and that's why i bought this rope
I bought a rope
