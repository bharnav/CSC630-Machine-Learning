Years have passed since that night
Still the scars are fresh and alive for those involved
A mother deep underground
A father to a cell forever bound
The child nowhere to be found

Spiritual deception once showed its face
An evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day
When horror stepped through their door

Journeyed to the east far and long ago
Once a feeble child but now has grown
Still black in his soul
His uncle, the poor man worked hard yet unsuccessful
To feed his fatherâ€™s leverage

Spiritual deception once showed its face
An evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day
When horror stepped through their door

Meanwhile, aging in a bedlam
Innocent still took the blame

He was sane when he entered
But those walls drove him mad
Conjuring up a grave revenge
Kept his diary closest when he finally broke out
Time for them to alas reunite

Compelled to place his vengeance
Upon the bastard progeny, his only creed
As he arrived to the house
Old Damfee waiting outside

Gnawed and faint, leaning on his frayed cane

Damfee
"Why did you come here?"

Father
"Bring him before me, he must die
I shall have his head, you cannot deny me that"

The old man grinned and whispered
"Things are not all what they seem
I once brought forth a demon
That had its way with your wife one night
Her uterus defiled
Raped by the demon, befouled all heaven's light
Please close your eyes and come inside my home"

He then followed Uncle Damfee
When he looked there was a rancid setting
Everything was just appallingly dirty
In front of him stood the lost child
In frustration he attacked
The androgynous child of evil
In the background there stood Damfee
Chuckling at the whole damned spectacle

All turned black 'til he later woke up
In his cell with the padded walls
That he once left, was it a dream?
Ripped out was a diary page
On it written all that happened
In that godless phase
In someone else's handwriting

Spiritual deception once showed its face
An evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day
When horror stepped through their door
