Welcome you fool of blunder
Insert rite of nether dreams
Sheep or leader, your worth equals filth
I grant illusions of purging flesh
No dog shall be spared

Pollution I carry unsuspected
Erupted sanity I hereby sell you reign
Fallen figures on their knees cry sacrilegious
Enticed by fruits of life
As death was sent to collect

Silent praying spreads
Through the air without response
Storm of sick and wealth
Lights go out, stunning chill
Waves of sin brought to kill
Screams eroding panic
Wxplodes to their delight
Storm of sick and wrath

Fair angels demons follow
Where there is grace they shall nest
To smear their loathing and put them to rest
Wings of gold ripped off cold
Left dead without a soul
Upon dethroning their glory, a bleeding fist

Bereft of life indeed
Ripe and sweet, birth out of grain
Rotting meat all that remains
Sin may bring relief

Witness in awe the sight of celebration
Plow through it all, find nothing but deception

Leap into the furnace flames
Attack in numbers, let them stroke
Sanctimony breeds here undisturbed for reasons
No one knows and no one will
Darkness leads, eminent in gifts levitate and shifts
Watched from below transformed and flawed
No one's left behind pain
Is here to stay these last of days

Silent praying spreads
Through the air without response
Storm of sick and wrath
Lights go out, stunning chill
Waves of sin brought to kill
Screams eroding panic
Explodes to their delight
Storm of sick and wrath

Thief of them all
Portrayed as distant somber
Hence they shall fall
Provoked and in time to reap the call
Fair angels demon follow
Where there is grace they shall nest
To smear their loathing and put them to rest
Wings of gold ripped off cold
Left dead without a soul
Upon dethroning their glory, a bleeding fest
All that's left dies here with sorrow
Where angels go demons follow
Declining not shining deep
Is the pit where they all now sleep
