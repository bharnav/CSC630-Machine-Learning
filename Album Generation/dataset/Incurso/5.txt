Even the purest of sinless souls
Sometimes attracts themselves
To spirits long forgotten sleeping
A man of curious nature this soon would learn
In his grandma's old attic
He found the hidden piece of wood
That forever would change his blissful life

Tool of evil, board of riddle
Transmitter to the ancient
Unforgiving, lures the living
Of hell designed mechanics
Sends a signal to the shunned side
One asks it, one reads it
Whom will answer God only knows

Although his Granny warned him deeply
He still brought it home for study
All he wanted was to try it
For mood he list some candles
Poured a glass of vintage absinthe
Innocent, wonder
Soon to leave for hell, séance begin

His hand grabbed the planchette
Sweating exited of it went
In backwards circles back and forth
Demon speech of unknown
Twitched his hand and took control
Letters started shaping into several words

Come join us the sentence read
Why he wrote, no reply
Who are you, we are mere friends
Hear our offer gentle caller
You may have goodly gifts
Just for us to simply visit you

The short conversation led on
Convincing our host
To trade what the spirits wanted
Debauching intent, plotting for his soul
Brood of ill, attributed to his newly found friends
Their agreement sealed a subconscious deal
Though he could not foresee
The effects coming
Nails and hair fell off
A lump in his throat was born
He started feeling woozy
Bowel control he kept losing
Soon swimming in his own filth
As he got invaded by the tricksters from beyond

Wrenching on the floor
The voices pounding in his mind
Raving on about death
Started to get owned in fetal position
Realized the mistake he had made
Yelled out tortured leave me be
Badly choking on his phlegm
Begged in tears for deaf ears
Serpents from the other side
His body now possessed

A broken human woke up in daze
First thing his eye caught
On the floor a pile of ash
Must've lit the board on fire
Not sure of what had happened
It all felt weird and blurry
He managed to stand
Still in pain from last night’s ordeal

Back flashes started
To haunt his weak memory
Grandma's face covered in blood
Limping steps took him there
To her house door unlocked called her name
Silence would not break
Up the stairs, met by a horrible death
Sight of what he'd done

Old granny torn apart
Down her throat he had rammed her heart
Her eyes stared open wide and cold
What was all this meant for?
The spirits of the board for years
Had tried to take her soul
This was their vengeance
That's why they sent him
To execute her and be freed forever
