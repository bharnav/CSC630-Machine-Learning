How did I get here, surrounded by snow
Strong winds keep tearing the flesh off my bones
Frost and cold wants my soul
Thrown into a blizzard led by crows
I hear them croaking to taunt my unfair demise

Finally I give up all my strength
There's no point resisting when I'm dazed
And lost forever in this white and wintry hell
Then I see what looks to be a light
Could it mean salvation
I start crawling towards it
Unbeknown of its purpose and plan

On my hands and knees I pull myself
My muscles ache from the storm
My heart is pounding hard and out of time
Then I see the light as I lie there ripped
Vanish out of sight, down the entrance to a crypt
Down the hole I go into the unknown

Slapped in the face by the smell
It's so foul and hints something evil here dwells
Still I keep going for what could be worse
Than the weather outside
Seemingly this place should be a peaceful haven
I keep pressing but where is the light that saved me
Getting further down the dungeons narrow passage
Fail to realize the gate behind me closing

I light up a match to find myself
Covered in blood spattered cloth
Something is telling me
I'm not alone in this wretched sewer

A puff of air blows out my tiny flame
As a snorting, gnarling sound approaches me fast
From every direction, this is it
Cornered by a horde of godless creatures, can't flee

I see myself get massacred
Disjointed by these entities of demon
Their glowing eyes lights up my death bed
Tears me up and leaves me gutted
Seems they found it inside my dead body
My soul was all they wanted in the end
