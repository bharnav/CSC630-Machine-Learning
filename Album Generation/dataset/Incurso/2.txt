Sunless skies stared at him as he escaped
Warned by doctor after doctor
But nothing could keep him away
From that which for years had kept him insane
Obstinate and keen to seek out all remaining elements
Pertaining the blemish on his soul

Ran off with a strong conviction
That what he had seen was real and not imagination
He knew it, he felt it
All those pigs in white scrubs tried to fuck his mind

Locked away since that delirious day
But now free by choice to once again
Rattle the forbidden cage
Deep in those treacherous woods he found it
A spot on the ground
Marked with the three pebble stones he once found
He shouldâ€™ve walked away
Instead he ferociously began to dig deep

Clawing through the dirt and roots
Unfed desire, a resurrection at last shall spire
With nervously chewed down finger nails
Kept on delving further down
What he finally found was breathing still, breath of the...

Bodiless sleeper revived
Tender skull acquired

Deformed beyond reason
He gently pulled it out of its hole
Lips touched, tongues played
Time to do what had remained unique

Insurgent abominator wrecker
Of all shifting prayer
Though no one can comprehend
Its meaning and its act
Bodiless sleeper revived
All the knowledge in this head
He now possessed to stir from resting
Forever since he got caught
He knew replacement was the key
Tender skull acquired

Their bristly chins scraped one another
As he measured between his shoulders
He made a mark at his neckline
Where the blunt and rusty saw soon would be placed

Closed his eyes and let the jerking motion cut
To finally remove the weakness
His head fell off yet still alive
His headless body replaced it fast

Slowly he worked with a needle
And thread to carefully secure the head
Connected they fused very well
The stitches healed so nicely
This body now wanders around
Slightly confused but with knowledge like few
Under the three pebble stones
Grave of the head is now empty
