[Verse 1]
I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinking in some cross town bar

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying

[Verse 2]
My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand down and take it babe
All for loving you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
Nothing seems to change
Bad times stay the same
And I can't run

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying
