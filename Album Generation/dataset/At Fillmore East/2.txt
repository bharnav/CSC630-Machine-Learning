Oh, tell me 'bout the car I saw parked outside your door
Tell me what you left me waiting two or three hours for
Tell me why when the phone rings baby you're up and across the floor
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer

I think about the bad times, I think about yours and mine
You were lost in the silver spoon, I pulled you out in time
And I hope that you got reasons for the way that you've been lyin'
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer

I think I'm gonna go now but you know that I'll be back
You can think it over baby tell me how you're gonna act
I'm gonna keep on holding on but I don't get no stronger
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer
Oh please don't keep me wonderin' no longer

And I know, and I know, and I know
I have never been in love before
Oh, oh baby
