[Verse 1]
Well, I've got to run to keep from hidin'
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I've got one more silver dollar

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider

[Verse 2]
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider

[Verse 3]
And I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider

[Outro] [x3]
No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
