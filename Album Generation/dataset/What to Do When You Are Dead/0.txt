Believe the news, I'm gone for good
Call off the search, no one will know that I'm down here
Believe the note I left for you
You can't turn back the clocks, you can't pull me up from here, so don't try

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

Make time slower, give me longer
It's too late for me, no one will know that I'm down here
And believe your dreams of me sinking
So far, below, you can't pull me up from here so don't try

In a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

Leave it up to me. To burden you again
This ones not your fault. Please forgive me

Leave it up to me (leave it up to me). To burden you again (To burden you again)
This ones not your fault. So forget, so forget, so forget me

Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is I would still die for you

And I would still die for you
I would still die for you
And I would still die for you
I would still die for you
And I would still die for you...
