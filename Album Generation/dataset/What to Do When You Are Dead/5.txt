Now I'm just spacing out again
If I try hard enough I pretend
That I'm flying above some trees
And they're smiling and waving at me

With the clouds on my back I can see
All the people down there fast asleep
Now I see your house far far below
So I'll fly down to give you a show

Can you see me through your bedroom window?
Are you waking up your friends to watch with you?
Can you see me at all?
Can you see me at all?

Can you see me through your bedroom window?
Are you waking up your friends to watch with you?
Can you see me at all?
Can you see me at all?
