Remember two years ago
When you broke down and cried to me
About how you couldn't be alone
How you needed me next to you

You made me promise on your tears
To never let you be without my voice inside your ears
Well I found my way back
You'll never be alone again
Isn't that what you want
No you'll never be alone again
I am right here with you

I know you feel me next to you
You can't shake me off, you can't shake me off, this time around
You're trying hard to kill the truth
So stop playing around, stop playing around, you know you're not alone

Remember when I was here
I tried to be as thick as the world
You called me out just to see
If I could be real enough
To never take your heart from you
And leave it all alone
I came back down to stay with you
Even if you don't know

I know you feel me next to you
You can't shake me off, you can't shake me off, this time around
You're trying hard to kill the truth
So stop playing around, stop playing around, you know you're not alone

I tried my heart doesn't beat
There's no ground under my feet
I am floating over your bed now
I'll be the voice in the dark
The freezing cold in your heart
That you thought died away with me
But I'll be right next to you
You'll never be alone again
Cause I'll be right next to you
You'll never be alone again

No you'll never be alone again
I am right here with you

I know you feel me next to you (so stop playing dumb)
You can't shake me off, you can't shake me off, this time around
You're trying hard to kill the truth (I am right here with you)
So stop playing around, stop playing around, you know you're not alone

I know you feel me next to you
