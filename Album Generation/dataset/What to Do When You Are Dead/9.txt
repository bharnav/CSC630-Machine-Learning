Now I'm hiding behind your stair case
Waiting to tell you something you'll never believe
I've got a lot to tell you about me
That won't go over well, but I don't care

You can't turn off, that you're dead
You just deal with (you just deal with it) it
Thought I was dreaming
My heart stopped beating
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you
I've got a secret
But you won't believe it
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you

I see the timeline of your whole life
I admit that I'm not more than the scratch I left behind
But there's a pull you can't swim away from
And I know you feel, won't let you go

You can't turn off, that you're dead
You just deal with (you just deal with it) it
Thought I was dreaming
My heart stopped beating
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you
I've got a secret
But you won't believe it
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you

The ghost of what I left behind
Is dragging me right back next to you

Believe me
It's the truth I swear
Believe me
It's the truth I swear
Deal with it

Thought I was dreaming
My heart stopped beating
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you
I've got a secret
But you won't believe it
But I've got this feeling
That I was put here for you
