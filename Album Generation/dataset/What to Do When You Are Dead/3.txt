I wanna live again
I wanna start everything over again
I wanna get this right
I'll meet you in another life
Over again
I'm coming back around again
Coming back over again
I'm coming back around again
But now it's over

We're out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
Out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me

I'm gonna make this work
I'm gonna change everything wrong with me
I'm gonna prove you wrong
When I meet you in another life
Over again
I'm coming back around again
Coming back over again
I'm coming back around again
But now it's over

We're out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
Out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me

I never had the gift of holding on to you
You're so far, so far away
No I, never had the gift of holding on to you, now
You're so far, so far away

I wanna live again [x3]
I wanna start everything over again
I wanna live again [x3]
I wanna start everything over again

We're out of time and I can't breathe [x4]

We're out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
