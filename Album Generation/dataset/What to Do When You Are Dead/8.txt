Holding my breath walking alone with you
I get to hear your voice again
If this is a dream maybe you'll stay with me
Stay with me please stay with me

This is where we met
We're back here again

Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the way the world feels
When I'm walking alone
[x2]

Can you please keep talking to me now
Tell me all about your new friends
And don't think I can't hear you now
I'm listening I'm listening

And this is where we met
We're back here again
(back here back here again)

Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the way the world feels
When I'm walking alone
[x2]

Love seems like a mess
When it won't let go of me
But when it's gone I don't feel
When it's gone I don't feel alive
[x2]

Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the way the world feels
When I'm walking alone
[x2]

Love seems like a mess
When it won't let go of me
But when it's gone I don't feel
When it's gone I don't feel alive
