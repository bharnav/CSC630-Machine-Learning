You see me, Do I look okay to you?
Give me your hand
I'll shake it and shake it again
I'll smile till my face falls off my head
If it's good for you, It's good for me too

What did I say?
Why do you give a shit?
They're trying to pry in to my brain but I'm gone
I'm running down highways till I see your face
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
And I don't care about anything else
I don't care about anything else

Their words are flying over my head
I try and hear, but I'm somewhere else again
You laugh and I smile back to humor you
If it's good for you, it's good for me too

What did I say?
Why do you give a shit?
They're trying to pry in to my brain but I'm gone
I'm running down highways till I see your face
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
And I don't care about anything else

Its raining outside
There's a storm front on my back
Trying to keep, trying to keep me away from you
A stranger is up ahead holding up a knife
Trying to keep, trying to keep me away from you
Its raining outside
There's a storm front on my back
Trying to keep, trying to keep me away from you
The stars are falling now
Breaking up the road
Trying to keep, trying to keep me away from you
I'll scream till I bleed
I'll scream stay away from me
You can't keep me back, keep me back
I'll scream till I bleed
I'll scream stay away from me
You can't keep me back, keep me back

What did I say?
Why do you give a shit?
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
And I don't care about anything else
I just need to see you now
I don't care about anything else
