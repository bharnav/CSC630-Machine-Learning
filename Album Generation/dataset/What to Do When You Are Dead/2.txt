So here's the truth
You were right all along
They were never my friends
And I was living a lie
But I won't fall for it next time

You figured me out
I'm like a leaf in the wind
I try to find who I am
But wind up lost in the end
Sometimes it's hard to know what's real when you're not

'Cause you know I change myself
To impress whoever happens to be next to me
But I'm sick of trying so hard
Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you
Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you

Everyday I'm just making my rounds
Just digging a hole six feet underground
Sometimes it's hard to know what's real when you're not

'Cause you know I change myself
To impress whoever happens to be next to me
But I'm sick of trying so hard
Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you
Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you

Nothing's here for me
Nothing's here for me
But you
Nothing's here for me
But you

Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you
Waste all your time with me
I know I'm a mess right now
Don't give up believe
I'd wait it out for you

I'd wait it out for you!
I'd wait it out for you!
