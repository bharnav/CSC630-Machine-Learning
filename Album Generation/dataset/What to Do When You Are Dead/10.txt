I'm leaving again
For the second time around
You better believe
That this was all just a joke to me
And as I look down on them
I repeat these words in my head
"They never heard one sound out of my mouth
They never heard one sound."?

I saw pretty clear
That when I left
You all stayed the same
Now I think I believe
That I was never alive in the first place
They never heard one sound out of my mouth
They never heard one sound out of my mouth
They never heard one sound out of my mouth
They never heard one sound

Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather is perfect the day that you die
