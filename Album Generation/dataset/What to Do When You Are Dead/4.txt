I started looking out for myself today
But then I stopped cause I don't care
I'm feeling bored of feeling numb
So now I'll stop cause I don't care

I started looking out for myself today
But then I stopped cause I don't care
I'm feeling bored of feeling numb
So now I'll stop cause I don't care

So get it get it get it right
I'm not holding on to a thing here
Get it get it get it right
I'm not holding on and I can't say no

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground

I started feeling bad for myself today
But then I stopped cause I don't care
I'm dreaming less and sleeping more
But I sold my soul for the dream you stole

So get it get it get it right
I'm not holding on to a thing here
Get it get it get it right
I'm not holding on and I can't say no

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground

About 50 years left I'm just waiting around
Put your heart on your sleeve and watch me pull it down
Of my 50 years left I'm just waiting around
Put your heart on your sleeve and watch me pull it down

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground

Holding your head up
Is hard when you just want
To stay on the ground
To stay on the ground
