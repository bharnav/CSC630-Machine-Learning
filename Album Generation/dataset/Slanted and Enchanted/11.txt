[Verse 1]
Fame throwa pass out the gold
The diamond watch, the last reward
All the things we had before you sold us out and took it all
Head-borne cries from zenith sluts
Astral rites from dead-end ruts
These kids are sick-end wars

[Chorus]
"One of the nation's spies
One of our first recruits
Click with her leather thighs
One of our first recruits."

[Verse 2]
How can you know?
In the distance lies a grower
Nee rode off, king fame throwa
Son of groupie, red-worn sexan:
Spent his cash convincing us that the desert was a starscape
And sold our lives for a satellite so we could cry
"Naked, naked foul"

[Chorus]
