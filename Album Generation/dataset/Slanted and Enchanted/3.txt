[Verse 1]
Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?

[Verse 2]
Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, faith is down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's what I want, (It's what I want)
It's what I want, (Twine comes down)
It's what I want, (It's what I want)
Don't you know? I could make it dry

[Chorus 1]
I've been crowned the king of it
And it is all we have, so wait
To hear my words and they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up and it's up and down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (Ball and twine)
Don't you know that it's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg, and it makes you dry
Make me dry, make me dry, make me dry

[Chorus 2]
I've been down, the king of it
It's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait
To hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today
