[Verse 1]
Fun for an hour when the hour's gone
Can one trick nights feed 40 days?
In my bed at the break of dawn
She shivered like a vein slashed bright and new

[Chorus 2x]
She's got the radioactive
And it makes me feel ok (I don't feel ok)

[Verse 2]
Grip force the vials, strip the locks
Smash the set and slash the beds
And when it looks like a wife's ex-plot
We'll cover all the rugs with cheap perfume

[Chorus 2x]

[Outro]
Like a docent's lisp
Like a damsel's spit
Like a dry gin's twist (of lime)
Like a poor droll sir
Like a poke's dull spurs
Like a pastor's flock (no church)
