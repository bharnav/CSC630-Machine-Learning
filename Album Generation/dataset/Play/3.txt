[Chorus]
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?

[Post-Chorus]
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

[Chorus]
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?

[Post-Chorus]
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

[Outro]
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
