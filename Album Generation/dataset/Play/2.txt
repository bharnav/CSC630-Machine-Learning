[Verse]
In my dreams I'm dying all the time
Then I wake it's kaleidoscopic mind
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to lie
So this is goodbye?
This is goodbye...

[Bridge]
Tell the truth, You've never wanted me
Tell me

[Outro]
In my dreams I'm jealous all the time
When I wake I'm going out of my mind
Going out of my mind
