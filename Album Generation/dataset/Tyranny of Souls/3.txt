Blood brothers of Angels
Now hear us
We earthbound, your offspring
Don't fear us
God willing, we'll rise up
Be near you
So open your arms now
And take us

So we're believing in dreams
Like the Icarus of old
The plans we made for the bold
In the blue-eyed beyond
There is nowhere to hide
There's no going back now

As the wind whips over the hillside
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
Steady wind blows over the sand
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
As the breeze whips straight as an arrow
Let her go over Kill Devil Hill
Gasoline and the wind in the wires
Kill Devil Hill and the way to the stars

We stand on this seashore and wonder
What madness, what secrets
We plunder
All failure we learn from, discovery

The wreckage of Heaven
Lies on the sand
First chances abandoned
With wood string and wire
We can barely control our desire
For destiny's arrows

As the wind whips over the hillside
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
Steady wind blows over the sand
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
As the breeze whips straight as an arrow
Let her go over Kill Devil Hill
Gasoline and the wind in the wires
Kill Devil Hill and the way to the stars

There are no secrets, only our dreams
There are no secrets, only our dreams
There are no secrets, only our dreams
There are no secrets, only our dreams
