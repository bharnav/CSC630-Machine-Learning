When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning or in a rain?
When the hurly-burly's done
When the battle's lost, not won

A tyranny of souls that love has lost
A tyranny of souls, a Pentecost
Speaking tongues of fire
Enflaming our desires
Watching as we die

Who rips the child out from the womb?
Who raised the dagger?
Who plays the tune?
At the crack of doom on judgement day
No ocean could wash my sins away

A tyranny of souls that love has lost
A tyranny of souls, a Pentecost
Speaking tongues of fire
Enflaming our desires
Watching as we die on our own cross
A tyranny of souls

We are the black space
We are the black light
We shine where no others dare

Killing my head with the neon
Suffering the fate for no reason
No is a relative stranger to my life

Deeds of the faithful
Seeds of betrayal

Hammer the nail into my hand
Anger is ruler in my land
I am the killer of weakness in my head

We are the black light
We are the black space

A tyranny of souls that love has lost
A tyranny of souls, a Pentecost
Speaking tongues of fire
Enflaming our desires
Watching as we die on our own cross

A tyranny of souls that love has lost
A tyranny of souls, a Pentecost
Speaking tongues of fire
Enflaming our desires
Watching as we die
