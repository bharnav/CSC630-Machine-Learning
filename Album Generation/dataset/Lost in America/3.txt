I didn't reach out
Cause I didn't need saving
I wasn't drowning
I was just waving
I apologize
For the misunderstanding
But I wasn't falling
I was just landing
I'm not over
Just getting started
I'm not gonna be some
Dearly departed
I wouldn't shatter
To the touch
Baby you worry
A little too much

(Chorus)
If you let me be
Who I'm becoming
Stop seeing me
As everything I've been
You could be free
From the wondering
Let me give you something to
Truly believe in

If I'm guilty
It's not murder
But is killing time
So unkind?
And we take this struggle
Further and further
Only to find
Oh no finish lines

(Chorus)
If you let me be
Who I am becoming
Stop seeing me
As everything I've been
You could be free
From the wondering
Let me give you something to
Truly believe in

We can chose to fight the war
Or find the little things
There's music in the notes
It's in the space between

(Chorus) If you let me be
Who I'm becoming
Stop seeing me
As everything I've been
You could be free
From the wondering
Let me give you something to
Truly believe in forgiveness
I truly believe
We can begin again
I truly believe
I can fix this
Let me give you something
To truly believe in
