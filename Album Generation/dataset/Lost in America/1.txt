On the six O clock flight
It takes all my might
To find the reasons why
I'm buckling in
To leave you again
From the corner of my eye
I see a perfect lipstick kiss
That can't be what it is
On the outside of the plane
Smack right on the pane
Through rain clouds, ups and downs
Even in this thin frozen air
The kiss is still there
Kiss is still there
Was it an angel
Or a maintenance girl
Showing off for the crew

It's fine either way ( I think that is what he is saying)

Because here in 5A
It feels like I'm with you
Through rain clouds, ups and downs
Even in this thin frozen air
The kiss is still there
Kiss is still there (repeat)
The lover in waiting
Leaves the light on
I hope you feel it
When I am gone
Through rain clouds, ups and downs
Even in this thin frozen air
The kiss is still there
Kiss is still there
The kiss is still there
Kiss is still there
