If you had your way
You would be mine
When this beautiful ache
Is all that you find
You've got your life
We missed our time
Such a passionate crime

You'll always be
My mystery
You'll always be
My mystery

I'll touch your skin
You tremble and shake
And I fight the desire
When I'm awake

You'll break their hearts
Thinking of me
Such a careless disease

You'll always be
My mystery
You'll always be
My mystery

Nobody said it would be fair
They warned you before
You went out there
It's always the chance
To get restarted
To a new world - new life
Scarred but smarter
And nobody said it would be fair
But in the end I think it is
Karma, justice
Whatever you call it
It's waiting there
Keep looking for it

You'll always be
My mystery
You'll always be
My mystery

Oh yeah
