A born killer
Bitter and twisted
Taking it out
On your mother and sister
White lie
I've been a bad boy
Does anyone know the way
Out of the freak show
Kill joy
Jonny come lately
He's taking my pain
And driving me crazy
A child star
Messing with fire
Guns in my hand
And I'm walking the wire

Could it be I'm not worth saving
Do you see
Any redemption for my soul
I believe I can make it
When the darknes comes
Down on me

Outside you got the feeling
The walrus cried out
But no one was listening
He said "happiness is a warm gun"
Give me some chances
We'll work in the long run

Could it be I'm not worth saving
Do you see
Any redemption for my soul
I believe I can make it
Whent he darkness comes
Down on me

So wasteful
And distasteful
What can we destroy

Could it be I'm not worth saving
Do you see
Any remption for my soul
I beleve I can make it
When the darkness comes
Down on me

Down on me
