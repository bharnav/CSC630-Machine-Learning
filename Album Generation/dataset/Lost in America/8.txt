I can't believe it
What my eyes are seeing
When the big wheel stops turning
Theres nothing left to believe in

Release me
From this moment
Because I can't hold on anymore
And I'm falling
Into darkness
Will you be there to break my fall

Its too late to worry
I'll wait until morning
Comes around again
Because it feels like
I'm losing tonight

I'm fighting the reasons
Changing all I believe in
I'm reaching out slowly
To the distant ship she'll be

As the colors fade
To a different shade
In this town
The waters never flow

Release me
From this moment
I need to let go

Its too late to worry
I'll wait until morning
Comes around again
Because it feels like
I'm losing tonight

As the colors fade
To a different shade
In this town
The waters never flow

Release me
From this moment
I need to let go
Its too late to worry
I'll wait until morning
Comes around again
Because it feels like ohh
I'm losing tonight

Yeah I'm losing tonight
Well I'm losing tonight
Losing tonight
