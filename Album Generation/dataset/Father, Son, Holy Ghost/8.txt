[Verse 1]
Nothing's gonna get any better
If you don't have a little hope
If you don't have a little love
In your soul
Nothing's gonna get any better
If you're drowning in your fear
If you've got nothing but sorrow
In your soul

[Chorus]
And you'll have to forgive me, brother
And you'll have to forgive me, sister
And I'll have to forgive you
If we're ever gonna move on

[Verse 2]
No one's gonna find any answers
If you're looking in the dark
And you're looking for a reason
To give up
No one's gonna find any answers
If you're just trying to hide
From the things you know inside
Are the truth

[Chorus]
And you'll have to forgive me, brother
And you'll have to forgive me, sister
And I'll have to forgive you
If we're ever gonna move on

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
And I can hear so much music
And I can feel everything now
And I can see so much clearer
When I just close my eyes
