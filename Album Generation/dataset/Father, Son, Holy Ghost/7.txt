[Chorus 1]
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness

[Post-Chorus 1]
If there's one thing I know
It's that I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

[Chorus 2]
Let the whole world pass me by
Take me to the countryside
I must confess
If I manage to forget
Everything from as of yet
What a success

[Post-Chorus 2]
I feel like starting new
That's why I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
You've chased my fears away
That's why I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

[Chorus 1]
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness

[Outro]
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
