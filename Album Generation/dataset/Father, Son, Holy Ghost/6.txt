[Verse 1]
It just feels like it's gone
All of it's gone, gone away
It seems like nobody's happy now
It feels like nobody's happy now
It really feels like it's gone
Like all of it's gone, gone away
It seems like nobody's happy now
And nobody's happy now
It just feels like it's gone
All of it's gone, gone away

[Verse 2]
And nobody's happy now
It seems like nobody's happy now
It just feels like it's gone
Like all of it's gone, gone away
It feels like nobody's happy now
Nobody's happy now

[Bridge]
Keep me up, keep me down
Keep my feet on the ground
Keep me up, keep me down
Keep my feet on the ground

[Outro]
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
It's just a song
Love, love, love, love
Come along
