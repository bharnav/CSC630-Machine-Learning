Ice Caps I look for you
Ice Caps are we through?
There’s Less Of You
But there’s more at the bottom of the ocean floor
Northern lights. Will you stay
To hold the north while the ice melts away?
Can you feel past this great change
Thousands of years melt away
Northern lights. Cosmic rain
Midnight sun will you stay?
Can you feel past his great
Thousands of year melt away
