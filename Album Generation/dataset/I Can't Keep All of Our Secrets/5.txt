Chorus: London. Destroyer
You took without looking
London. Destroyer
You swallowed him whole
Standing here forever won’t change a thing
No pay phone in the world can reach him
I can’t look at you after what you did
Traffic like a river just pulled him in
Chorus
Standing here forever wouldn’t mean thing
But you cut him off without a feeling
Your grey buildings aren’t thinking about going back
In a city where the rain never ever ends
London. Destroyer
You took without looking
London. Destroyer
You swallowed him whole
Green northern lights off of the wing of my plane
I flew to London, but it’s was too late
