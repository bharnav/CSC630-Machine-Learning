I was cold like the town I grew up in
I did wrong in the name of being messed up and
I lit the whole truck on fire
Because I was scared of where we were going
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
I was lying
On that night after the parade
You found me alone cursing and swaying
You pulled me into a cab
And chased my nightmares away
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
I was lying
Last time we talked the damage was done
I called you up because I was scared to walk alone
I thought I had forever
To repair what Iâ€™d done
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
When I said there was and end to love
I was lying
I was cold like the town I grew up in
I did wrong in the name of being messed up and
I lit the whole truck on fire
Because I was scared of where we were going
