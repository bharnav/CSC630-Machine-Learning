You were wearing my shirt
We were holding plastic guns
In a fake shoot out
In our friends living room
We would have seen it from across the bar
If we hadn’t been drunk
We don’t belong to each other
We don’t belong to anyone
I started drinking again
And everything I touch
Burns to the ground
Or turns into dust
When I held you in my arms
I thought I could overcome, but
We don’t belong to each other
We don’t belong to anyone
I’m on a crash landing
I thought that you should know
I don’t have a plan besides
Burning up and going
He was wearing your shirt
A month after you were gone
I saw him from across the bar
And nearly passed out
I put my head on the table and
Sang our song
We don’t belong to each other
We don’t belong to anyone
We don’t belong to each other
We don’t belong to anyone
We don’t belong to each other
We don’t belong to anyone
