Everywhere we went everything we did
I’m the only one who remembers it
All the places that I go where you still live
Are fading out
I can’t keep all of our secrets
I can’t keep all of our secrets
I can’t keep all of our secrets
I can’t keep all of our secrets
Baby baby baby up against my body
Baby baby baby
Maybe when I’m nothing I will understand
Where you are now
Call with no answer
Call with no answer
I can’t keep all of our secrets
I can’t keep all of our secrets
Call with no answer
Call with no answer
Call with no answer
