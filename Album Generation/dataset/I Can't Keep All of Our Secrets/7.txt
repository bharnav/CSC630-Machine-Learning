They bind us and cut of the supply
They hold us hostage in our minds
They are the perfect place we built
When we found out it would never fly
I know I shouldn’t make
I know I shouldn’t make
Promises. Promises
Promises. Promises
The last thing we said before it died
Was I’ll see you on the other side
We’re naked without our shield of lies
But there’s nothing left to do, but try
I know I shouldn’t make
I know I shouldn’t make
Promises. Promises
Promises. Promises
