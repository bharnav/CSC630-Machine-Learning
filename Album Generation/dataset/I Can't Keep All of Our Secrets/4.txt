Are You Jealous? Are You Jealous?
Are You Jealous of the dead?
You have to share me with them
And there is no end
You can tear all the pages
From my books that you searched
But you will never remove him
Or the mountains of hurt
Are You Jealous? Are You Jealous?
Are You Jealous of the dead?
He sits where you can’t reach him
He sleeps in my bed
Are You Jealous? Are You Jealous?
Are You Jealous of the dead?
They are written and punctuated
And we are messy and unplanned
Are You Jealous? Are You Jealous?
Are You Jealous of the dead?
They Are All Around Us
And they’ve gone past the end
Ahhhhh
