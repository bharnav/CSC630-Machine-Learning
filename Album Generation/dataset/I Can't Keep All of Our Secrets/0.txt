Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
It’s starts a feeling and ends up a story
Strange to each other and lost in a country
Lost in our bodies with nothing to hold us
We drifted together out past the breakers
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
Wish I didn’t have to hold all our secrets
I feel like I’m being pulled down in them
If I look for the memories I get tangled on them
If I hold onto you then I start sinking
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
Ahh
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
Ahh
I’m at the bottom if you want to find me
I’m at the bottom alone in a memory
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
Ocean Blue. I don’t usually swim
But I followed you in boy. I followed you in
I’m at the bottom if you want to find me
I’m at the bottom alone in a memory
I’m at the bottom if you want to find me
I’m at the bottom alone in a memory
