[Verse 1: Buddy Guy]
Ain't no sunshine when she gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

{Instrumental Break}

[Verse 2: Tracy Chapman]
Wonder this time where he's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

[Interlude: Tracy Chapman]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 3: Buddy Guy]
I think I should leave the young thing alone
Cause ain't no sunshine when she gone

[Hook: Buddy Guy]
Ain't no sunshine when she gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

[Outro: Buddy Guy and  (Tracy Chapman)]
(Ain't no sunshine)
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine)
(Anytime he goes away)
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime he goes away)
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime he goes away)
Anytime she goes away
