I had a dream, just the other night
Me and my baby was having a fight
It felt so real, but it wasn’t funny
I took my love, and she took my money

But that’s all right, I was only dreaming
But you know what, it got me thinking

You gotta go, for what you know
Cause you’re gonna reap just what you sow
Cause life don’t always go your way
And that’s the price you gotta pay

I went to the kitchen, I turned on the sink
Got a glass of water, and I began to think
This lying and cheating has got to stop
Before I lose everything that I got

Sometimes I feel so strange
Other times I feel so ashamed

You gotta go, for what you know
You’re gonna reap just what you sow
Cause life don’t always go your way
And that’s the price you gotta pay

Well I tried to kick the habit
I couldn’t do it, I have to have it
I broke her heart, and I broke the rules
I get no sympathy for being a fool

I cried so hard ‘till I nearly drown
And I paid the price for sneaking around

You gotta go, for what you know
You’re gonna reap just what you sow
Life don’t always go your way
And that’s the price you gotta pay
