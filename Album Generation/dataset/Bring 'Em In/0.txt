Now you're gone
Now you're gone
You hurt me bad
I'm all too sad
I didn't know
I love you so
Now you're gone
Now you're gone

Now you're gone
You had a plan
Another man
Went off to hide
I could have died
(Now you're gone)
Now you're gone
(Now you're gone)
Now you're gone

(Let's go to the bridge right here)
What should I do
My world is blue
It isn't true
My life is through
Now you're gone
Now you gone

I want you back
How do I act
How do I make contact
How do I get respect

Now you gone

And I never loved nobody
That's been mean to me
I got a heart full of stone
And I hate the misery
And then you
And then you
And then you
And then you came along
You spoiled me with (?)
And now you gone
And now you, you gone
