Well, I'm looking for my baby
And when I find my baby
I'm going to kick back the rugs
I'm gonna pull down the shades

Well, I know everything
Gonna work out fine
Just me and my baby
And this glass of wine

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night

Now listen, if we're gonna have a good time
Might as well have a damn good time
Gonna kick back the rugs
We're gonna pull down the shades

'Cause I got to get to you
To be with you
'Cause your kind of love
I can never get enough

On a Saturday night, oh yes
On a Saturday night, ooh baby

Now listen, well, I'm looking for my baby
And when I find my baby
We're gonna go out the back door
I'm gonna lock up the front door

Well, I know everything
Gonna work out fine
Just me and my baby
And this big bottle of wine

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Now fellows, you know what I'm talking about
On a Saturday night

Let's do it right
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night, oh darling
On a Saturday night

Don't forget, lock up the front door
I don't wanna hear nobody askin' no more
On a Saturday night
