Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home

The girl around her father throws her arms to make him stay:
"My daddy dear it hails, it blows; you cannot go today!"

Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home

The April mud was on his boots, a' clinging through the fields
And desperate it send up its shoots-but at water's edge it yields

Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home

The waves were pounding the dock; the pillars creak and growl
The shoreman loading up the stock; the gulls were crying foul

Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home

The father called up to the ship, "You need an extra hand?"
"Ah yes, for just a little trip: one month be back at land."

The rain had stirred the sea too well; the salt poured on the deck
At last the captain rang the bell: they ship was left to wreck

Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home

It calm but now the fog if thick: so which way should they head?
The rest knew not and they must be quick-so father softly said:

Sing for me, my daughter, sing for me
When I'm away you'll be the siren that will finally lead me home
