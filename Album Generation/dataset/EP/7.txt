Back the bus he cussed "Space suits! Blackened boots!
Lad, little Lad," he sad, "I've a tip for you:
See, what about me: what about her? What about me?"
For five dollars I walked him to his Mom's
And on the threshold he said straight and calm
"See what about me: what about her? What about me?"
Can't kiss cousin Chris could knight, turn off the light
With what why's we wave. What wish? It came true
See, what about me. What about her? What about me
T'ord ta tippy top Tommy tongue-tied talked
Tricked Trish tra trance which church chit-chat
Nana nots no know, so down the firehouse we go
Fireman Frank friendly fed fee-free
Dank dusty doughnuts den da dribble drank
Driven droopy drunken; in Clinton lake we've sunk in
So Tomy, look here what you did:
Barnacle Bill's bound bonus bid
My mommy must a made up my mind
Many months me for Mandy Miller resigned
Right raise rank rise rust; and how she ever fussed!
About that out-lout doubt-route scout;
Seems he liked someone better than her
Oh! Tommy Trish and Frank
You can talk me to the bank
So I can bring a little extra today
Prop prince prize proof prize-proof, pry pray
When the word of your ward was the sword by your side
And you dug up the deed in the dump where he died
You seemed beside yourself; you're wandering all your wealth
‘While the warp and the woof of your words were worked
By perpetually pushing spirits and beers
Cause the coffin the cradle the curse
Were woven even worse
Since the ‘sary sends signs out the fire to whom it may concern:
Cause the coffin is for me cause I have nothing to do with it;
And the cradle is for me cause the old dragon attacked me in it;
And the purse is for me because I don't have money nor friends
