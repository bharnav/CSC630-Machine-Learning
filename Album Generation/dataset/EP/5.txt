In the back of a mini cab
Me and Georgie and Nigel and Sadie:
"Can I use your mobile?
Can I use your mobile, Sadie??"
On our way to Shoreditch;
Off to Fabric in Shoreditch:
Duffer St. George and I don't care
Duffer St. George and I don't care
On a Spitalfields Sunday
Get a two pound curry and roll ups;
Get a 12p bagel and a camouflage t-shirt and bracelets
"Let me check the stalls first"?
Nige wants a pint first
Duffer St. George and I don't care
Duffer St. George and I don't care
