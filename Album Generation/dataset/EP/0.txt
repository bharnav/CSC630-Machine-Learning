I married a man oh then
I married a man oh then
I married a man he was the plague of my life
And I wish I was single again
I wish I was single again
Cause when I was single, my pockets did jingle and I wish I was single again
He beat me and banged me oh then
He beat me and banged me oh then
He beat me and banged me he swore he would hang me and I wish I was single again
He went for the rope oh then
He went for the rope oh then
He went for the rope and I think I was broke
And then I wish I was single again
Cause when I was single, my pockets did jingle and I wish I was single again
My husband he died oh then
My husband he died oh then
My husband he died and I laughed till I cried to think I was single again
I married another oh then
I married another oh then
I married another he was the devil's grandfather and I wish I was single again
He beat me and banged me oh then
He beat me and banged me oh then
He beat me and banged me he swore he would hang me and I wish I was single again
