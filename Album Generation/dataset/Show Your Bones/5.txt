[Verse]
Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up, up, up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one

Now, take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'm
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And she's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And he's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And we're
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound

[Bridge]
She'll take on high
She'll take on high

[Chorus]
Well sometimes, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound

[Verse]
Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up, up, up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one

Now, take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
