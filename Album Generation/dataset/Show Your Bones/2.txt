[Verse 1]
I find it in an atlas
Or flipping over old news
Check what's in the trash bag

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

[Verse 2]
Blame me for where you are
Well, tell me what I gotta lose
About to get fancy

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

[Hook]
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it

[Verse 2]
We went over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes
Didn't need eyes
Watching from the nooks, ah
We went over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes
Didn't need eyes
Watching from the nooks, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

[Hook]
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
