[Verse 1]
When it's missing, then you want it more
It isn't right
Turning, turning out the door and back to this
Leave it like it was before and let me out
Must've been the end of the story

[Chorus]
Giving it all, giving it all away
You're gonna wake up someone
Well, study it all
The wings, the crowd, your face
You're gonna end up like one
Well, trouble at home
Travel the way, you say
The road don't like me
Well, travel away
Travel it all away
The road's gonna end on me

[Hook]
Man, they like me
'Cause I'm a warrior, a warrior
Stand on my feet
Dance the warrior, the warrior
Where would I be?
I'd be a warrior, a warrior

[Verse 2]
Now the strangers have caught on
And they're riding in the backseat
The river's gonna wash all
Yeah, the river, it spoke to me
It told me I'm small
And I swallowed it down
If I make it at all
I'll make you want me

[Chorus]
Well, trouble at home
Travel the way, you say
The road don't like me
Well, travel it all, travel it all away
The road's gonna get on me
And I'm small
The road's gonna get on me
Well, if it gets it at all
The road's gonna end on me

[Outro]
Like a warrior, a warrior
Dance the warrior, the warrior
