[Verse 1]
Lies and love
Lies, love
Bed wetting son of the great heat
It's all over me
It's all under me
The face ain't making what the mouth needs

Wonder more
Want, more
Than we did before
Try the new tease
Well, quiet you
Get over me
The shit is running and it runs deep

[Hook]
I'm way out
Way out
Way out
Way out
When you mean it on the inside, you still can't to me

[Verse 2]
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me
Fits around me

[Hook]
I'm way out
Way out
Way out
Way out
When you mean it on the inside, you still can't to me
