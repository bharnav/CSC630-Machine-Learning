[Verse]
Don't touch, can't sleep with the lights on
Touch, kid, how you surprise me
Now roll, kid, rock your body off!

You're something like a phenomena
Something like an astronomer
Roll, kid, rock your body off!

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby
You're gonna get your body off

[Post-Chorus]
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water

[Bridge]
Hot time, kid
Hot time, kid
It's cold under the blanket
They loved it
Then shot it
The fastest ran and got it
That story that ease my
They hide it up the sleeves, ma
They hide it
They hide it
They're never gonna find it

[Post-Chorus]
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby
You're gonna get your body off

Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby
You're gonna get your body off

[Outro]
Hot time, kid
Hot time, kid
It's cold under the blanket
Hot time, kid
Hot time, kid
It's cold under the blanket
