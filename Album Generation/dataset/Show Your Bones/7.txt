[Verse 1]
My arms are all twisted
The only thing I miss is
I messed up
I missed it
I messed up
The missing of you
It's getting to sound like they've seen you around with her

[Hook]
No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

[Verse 2]
Everyone knows the secret-est code of mine
They'll tell all my friends
And they'll tell all my enemies too

[Hook]
Mystery
No mysteries
No mysteries

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Take it away, Nick!

[Verse 3]
I don't even know what it's like not to go back to you
I don't even know who I like less, you or me
You or me
You or me
It's anyone's, anyone's guess
It's anyone's, anyone's guess

[Outro]
Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress
