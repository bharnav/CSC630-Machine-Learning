[Verse 1]
I know what I know
I know on the car ride down
I hear it in my head real low

[Hook]
Turn into
The only thing I ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

[Verse 2]
I know what I know
Well, I know that girl you found
Keeps that kind of window closed

[Hook]
She'll turn into
The only thing you ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

[Bridge]
Can't say why I kept this from you
My, those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us
Oh! Well, I know!
Well, I'll fall right in to keep you out
I'd like to tell you all about it

[Verse 3]
I know what I know
I know this last time 'round
I'll hear it in my head real low

[Hook]
Turn into
The only thing you ever know
The only thing you ever know

[Outro]
I know what I know
Well, I know
Ah, yes
