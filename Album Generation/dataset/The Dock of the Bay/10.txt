Ole man trouble, leave me alone
Go find you someone else to pick on
I live my life in doubt you see
Ole man trouble
Please stay away from me, oh now
Ooh oh yeah,yeah

Oh, I look like I'm down in my luck
Please send faith to just help pick me up
I've lived this way for so many years, now
Ole man trouble
Please wash away all my fears, oh now
Good God Almighty, help me

Sometimes, sometime I get a little worried
Ole man trouble, please please
Stay away from me
Ole man trouble, Ole Man Trouble
Stay away from me, stay away
You're nothing but trouble
Just stay away, stay away
Stay away, just please
Ole man trouble
