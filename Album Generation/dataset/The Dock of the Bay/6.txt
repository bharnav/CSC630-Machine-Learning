Hush, darling, and don't you cry
I'm coming home to dry your weeping eyes
Hush, little darling, and don't be blue
I'm coming home to see about you

It's been so long since I've seen you
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do
But if you're still waiting with your love so true
You'll make me...

Hush, darling, and don't you cry
I'm coming home to wipe your weeping eyes
Hush, little darling, and don't you be blue
I'm coming home to see about you

You know I got to see my baby—she's my one desire
Got to see my baby—she set my little soul on fire
Got to see my baby—she's everything I need
She makes me...

Hush, darling, and don't you cry
Otis is coming home to dry your weeping eyes
Hush, little darling, and don't you be blue
I'm coming home to see about you

You know I got to see my baby—she's my one desire
Got to see my baby—she set my little soul on fire
Got to see my baby—she's everything I need
She makes me...

Hush, darling, and don't you cry
I'm coming home to wipe your weeping eyes
Hush, little darling, and don't be blue
I'm coming home to see about you
I'm coming home...
