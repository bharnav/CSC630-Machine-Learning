I try to reach you so many times
I climb the walls till i know you’re safe on the inside
I
You could be my friend
You could hold it down
When you’re underground
I’ll put you back out

I want you to know
I believe in you
I believe in you

I’m afraid of babylon
I’m afraid of how we go wrong
I’m afraid of a memory
I’m afraid of what you do to me
I’m afraid of police lights (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of knife fights
I’m afraid of the enemy (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of you and me

You have forgiveness
But i have none
I store it up and serve it cold
You can be sure of my revenge
You could right my wrongs
And when i’m at my worst
You come inside and make me human

I want you to know
I believe in you
I believe in you

I’m afraid of a babylon (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of how we go wrong
I’m afraid of a memory (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of what you do to me
I’m afraid of police lights (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of knife fights
I’m afraid of the enemy (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of you and me

I’m afraid
I’m afraid

I’m afraid of babylon (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of how we go wrong
I’m afraid of a memory (I’m afraid)
I’m afraid of what you do to me
I believe in you
I believe in you
