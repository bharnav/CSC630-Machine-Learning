There’s talk of war all the time
So I think of you
My beautiful one
It’s all for you
I never wish it alone
With all that you bring
I do my best
To keep us in

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away

Strip away
Strip away

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away

Strip away
Strip away

It’s so easy to go and misunderstand
The distance we run
With this violent heart
It’s a dangerous world
And each accident
Brings us closer to those
Who mean the most
Who mean the most

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away

Strip away
Strip away
Strip

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away
Strip it back to you and me

So lost when you need something
Language is not an enemy
So lost when you need something
Language is not an enemy
It’s you and me
It’s you and me

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away

Strip away
Strip away
Heart of the matter

Fly straight to the heart of the matter
Elevate through bad weather (through bad weather)
Strip away
Strip away
Strip away

Strip away
Strip away
Strip

(Heart of the matter)
Fly straight
(Heart of the matter)
Fly straight
(Heart of the matter)
Fly straight
