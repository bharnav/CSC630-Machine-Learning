Watch your back as life comes over you
Choose your weapon before you have to
You disappear in a sea of danger
If you're going, baby go faster

I've seen you dance
I've seen you dance through the radio
For gold again
You're going for gold again

All my life
I have waited for this moment
All my life, tonight
Tonight

Touch the sky because now we are weightless
Floating out into empty spaces
We are faceless, we are soldiers
We believe what you told us

I've seen you dance
I've seen you dance through the radio

All my life
I have waited for this moment
All my life, tonight
(Feelings don't die)
All my life
I have waited for this moment
All my life, tonight
(Ocean-sized)

And I lose myself in you
And I lose myself in you

All my life
I have waited for this moment
All my life, tonight
(Feelings won't die)
We're running out of time
We've got to get this right
Here we are, here we are, tonight
(Ocean-sized)

All my life, tonight
(Ocean-sized)
All my life, tonight
(Ocean-sized)

Ocean-sized
