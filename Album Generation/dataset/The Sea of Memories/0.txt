You could say that all love breaks you
And every kiss is who you are
If I could tell you what I’ve been thinking
Maybe we could get along

See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It’s alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind

You can’t run from what’s inside you
And what don’t kill will set you free
All those days I felt my rage
But I found the strength to be me, yeah

See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It’s alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind
In a world of paradise
(In a world of paradise)

Don’t fake
Don’t fake anyone

Don’t lie
Don’t lie till you’re done

Dive in
Dive into everything

You could say that all love breaks you
And every kiss is who you are, yeah
See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It’s alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind
In a world of paradise, yeah
Watch them fade in the shadow of the sun
Each new day the last is done
