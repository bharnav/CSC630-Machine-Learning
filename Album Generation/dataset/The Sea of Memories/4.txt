She saw the pieces of her yesterday
She was wondering how she’d fade away
Who loved her and really listened in
Whether she had made a difference
He’s a soldier (he’s a soldier) of misfortune
Seven steps to make one forward
How the truth hurts
The lies, they crystallize

Try to wrap your arms around a memory
Maybe you are not where you’re meant to be
Lord knows we’re not who we think we are
All night doctors
All night preachers
All night girls to get you through (get you through, get you through)

Lost and wasted
Hope is fading
I wait here for you

The secret life of our interiors
Whey most girls are superior
Everyday i’m on the slide for you and
Every night is the same i’m waiting
For the world to change
For all the fighting (for all the fighting) to die away
Find comfort in your memory
I’m not where i am meant to be
You shine the world stops
And gods are humbled
All night doctors
All night preachers
All night girls to get you through (get you through, get you through)

Lost and wasted
Hope is fading
I wait here for you (for you, for you)

Were you ever my love
Were you ever my love
I don’t know (i don’t know, i don’t know)
(I sense)

All night doctors
(Were you ever my love)
All night preachers
(Were you ever my love)
All night girls to get you through (get you through, get you through)

Lost and wasted
(Were you ever my love)
Hope is fading
(Were you ever my love)
I wait here for you (for you, for you)

Were you ever my love
Were you ever my love
I don’t know
