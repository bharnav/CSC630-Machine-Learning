If i could change the things i’ve done
You could be the only one
There is no blame
There is no pressure
100 ways to make yourself better

I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brake
I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brakes

If i could see the holy ghost
I’d understand what hurts you most
It’s in your eyes and in your fashion
It’s deeper than you can imagine, yeah

I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brake
I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brakes

The other side of you
(Searching, searching)
The other side of you
The other side of you
(Searching, searching)
The other side of you

This perfect night goes on and on
We are swimming in the dawn
There’s a light in everyone
There’s even light where we can’t see
Even light where we can’t feel
Even light when we’re all blown up

I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brake
I ran through the red light
I was sorry not safe
I was speed not brakes

The other side of you
(I ran through the red light)
The other side of you
The other side of you
(I ran through the red light)
The other side of you
The other side of you
(I ran through the red light)
The other side of you
The other side of you
(I ran through the red light)
The other side of you
