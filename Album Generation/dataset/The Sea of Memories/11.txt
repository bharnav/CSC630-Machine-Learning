It’s a killer inside as i’m watching you slide out my hand
You’re slipping away as i’m watching you fade
Please hold on
If i’m losing you now i won’t give till i’m out
You’re my world
I’ll shoulder your pain
Ride the violent waves as i can

Be still my love
They can never take us
Be still my love
Be still
Be still my love

Now there’s strangers between
I can’t get to you
Please don’t fade off
Can’t stand to lose you
I don’t know what to do for your bleeding

We’re up all night
Sleep all day
We don’t care
Whatever you say
Our love is ocean sized

Be still my love
They can never take us
Be still my love
Be still
Be still my love

I won’t do no harm
I won’t do you wrong
I want you to come
'Cause you’ve been gone too long

Try to revive
Bring you back round
Now you are gone
Deep underground
And nothing could ever be the same again

Oh, I miss you my valentine
Lately so heavy without you

Be still my love
They can never take us
Be still my love
Be still
Be still my love

Be still my love
Be still my love

Be still
Be still my love

Be still
Be still my love
