Got lost in the kerosene sun
I'll make it back before the daylight comes
Time is short and time is swift
Got to focus who i spend it with
I wait for signs and i wait for maps
I don’t stop and i won’t come back
This is the time to decide what’s right
This is the time of our lives
This is the time to realise ourselves
Watch us come

Stand up
Take a bite
Whatever gets you through the night
Stand up
Stand up for your mistakes
Don’t give in to bad breaks
Stand up
Stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond

She tied me up left me in knots
We have words but not for stop
I met a girl she was in my sleep
I had to beg that she wouldn’t leave
I wish for days i could have again
I wish so bad i could see my friends
This is the time to decide what’s right
This is the time of our lives

Stand up
Take a bite
Whatever get you through the night
Stand up
Stand up for your mistakes
Don’t give in to bad breaks
Stand up
Stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond (and beyond)

Come on come on come on come on
Come around
You’ve got to hang on to yourself
Come on come on come on come on
Come around
You’ve got to hang on to yourself

You’ve got to hang on to yourself

You’ve got to hang on to yourself
We’re electric
We’re invincible
We’re unstoppable
For subordinates
We’re electric
We’re invincible
We’re unstoppable
We’re subordinates

We’re subordinates
Stand up
Take a bite
Whatever gets you through the night
Stand up
Stand up for your mistakes
Don’t give in to bad breaks
Stand up
Stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond
Stand up

Stand up
Stand up

Stand up
Stand up
Whatever gets you through the night

We’re electric
We’re invincible
We’re unstoppable
For subordinates
We’re electric
We’re invincible
We’re unstoppable
We’re subordinates
