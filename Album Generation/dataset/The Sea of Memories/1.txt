[Verse 1]
Mind strong, body strong
Try to find equilibrium
Head straight, screwed on
We screwed up for too long
I don't want to lean on the waves
I watched the storm evaporate
I think of you and starry skies
That keeps you so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

[Chorus]
It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

[Verse 2]
Medusa smiles and Judas lips
Open arms and finger tips
Love bites, and recompense
I'll be with you until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

[Chorus]
It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

[Chorus]
It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

[Interlude]
Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

[Chorus]
It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

[Outro]
It's like the sound of winter
Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself
