I ask myself what I think of this moment
I ask myself if I let you down
I can’t believe that you’re in my system
I can’t believe that you’re in my arms
Shall we dance before the ambulance comes
Shall we let the rain fall over us
Shall we sing a settlement song
Should have been who I was all along (all along)

Let your mind keep you strong
It’s too late
You’re long gone
It’s too late
We’re undone
I find you all by yourself on the street again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again

It’s dangerous cause the people are struggling
It’s dangerous cause you’re hard to see
I want to make everything better
I want to make you believe
I lost myself to the sea of memories
I lost myself to irreverent dreams
I lost myself when I first met you
I lost myself more than I ever knew

It’s too late
You’re long gone
It’s too late
We’re undone
I find you all by yourself on the street again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again

All for your love
For your love
All for you

All for your love
For your love
All for you

It’s too late
You’re long gone
It’s too late
We’re undone
I find you all by yourself on the street again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again
Baby come home

Baby
Baby come home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
