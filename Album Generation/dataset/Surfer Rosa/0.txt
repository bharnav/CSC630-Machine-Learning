[Intro]
This is a song for Carol!

[Verse 1]
You're into Japanese fast food
And I dropped off your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

[Refrain]
You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

[Chorus]
Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

[Verse 2]
I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep yep, yep!

[Refrain]
I make you pray, you make me hard
Your Irish skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

[Chorus]
Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

[Refrain]
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

[Outro]
Your bone's got a little machine
