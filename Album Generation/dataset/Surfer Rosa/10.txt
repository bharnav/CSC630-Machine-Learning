[Black Francis]
I went out for the team

[Kim Deal]

[Verse 1]
The day before that I was wed
She went upstairs and she shot her head

[Chorus]
I'm amazed
I'm amazed, ah!
I'm amazed
I'm amazed

[Verse 2]
And when I was a little boy
A ball of string, my favorite toy

[Chorus]
I'm amazed
I'm amazed, ah!
I'm amazed
I'm amazed

[Verse 3]
Before I died, I took my Honda
And packed it up, up, up to Arizona, honey

[Chorus]
I'm amazed, ah
I'm amazed
I am amazed!
