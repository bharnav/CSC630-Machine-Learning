[Verse 1]
I can see all the footsteps left behind
Every second I gave
Every song was a snapshot of my life
I needed something to say
I started out in the last slow motion scene
Watching everyone change
Made a map of a one-way road from here
Had no reason to stay

[Chorus]
I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following
On my own
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home

[Verse 2]
Think of me when the stars come out tonight
Take a look at the sky
Never said that I could burn out that bright
But I needed to try

[Chorus]
I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following
On my own
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home

[Bridge]
The day that I found my voice
I knew that I had no choice
The only way I'd ever learn to love
Is if I found it
On my own
On my own

[Chorus]
I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home
