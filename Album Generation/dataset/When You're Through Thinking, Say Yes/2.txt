[Verse 1]
Do you remember when I said you were my only one?
We were running underneath the California sun
Well, now, I look at you and you're still more than I can take
You're like a slow song starting to accelerate

[Pre-Chorus]
And all my life, I looked for you
For arms that I could fall into

[Chorus]
All I can think about is
You and me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now, I wanna chase forever down
With you around

[Verse 2]
You're making movies in your head when you fall asleep
Having nightmares, dreaming that I'm gonna leave
I know you've always been afraid of ending up alone
Somebody hurt you, now you're waiting on a dial tone

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm right here, so don't get blue
It's not just you, I need this too

[Chorus]
All I can think about is
You and me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down
With you around

[Bridge]
We were running underneath the California sun
Underneath the California sun

[Chorus]
All I can think about is
You and me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on

We put a record on
Kept singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now, I wanna chase forever down
(We were running underneath the California sun)
I just wanna chase forever down
With you around
