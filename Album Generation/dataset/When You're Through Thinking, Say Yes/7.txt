[Verse 1]
Look at me and listen close
So I can tell you how I feel before I go
Just a year, it's not much time
For me to show you
I am proud that you are mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I had known
The future in my heart
Was just about to start

[Chorus]
Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

[Verse 2]
Every lock, on every door
I put them there to try and hide you from the world
And you kicked, yeah, you screamed
You never understood you're everything to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just hope you know
The future in your heart
Is just about to start

[Chorus]
Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

[Bridge]
No looking back when I am gone
(Sing for me)
Follow your heart, it's never wrong
(Sing for me)
No looking back when I am gone
(Sing for me)
Don't second guess the note you're on

[Verse 3]
Out of time
All out of fight
You are the only thing in life that I got right

[Chorus]
Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

[Outro]
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
