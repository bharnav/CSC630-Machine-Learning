[Verse 1]
We seem to have the world
Here in our hands
It's smaller than we thought it was
But now I understand
Some of us survive
Some will get torn
If I lose my confidence
I'll borrow yours

[Pre-Chorus]
See me now
Hear me out

[Chorus]
Look for me tonight
I swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

[Verse 2]
Take every single year
From then until now
Fables start to change and my head
Reaches through the clouds
When I'm standing trial
I will need you
'Cause every wish we made is finally coming true

[Pre-Chorus]
See me now
Hear me out

[Chorus]
Look for me tonight
I swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

[Bridge]
(Mirrors show me upside down)
The clocks are counting backwards
(Here without you, I could drown)
You pull me to the surface
(Ticking time is running out)
But we've got symphonies still
Left inside us

[Chorus]
Look for me tonight
I swear that nothing's
Gonna break our hearts this time
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell

[Outro]
Save me from myself
And be the soundtrack
To these stories that I tell
