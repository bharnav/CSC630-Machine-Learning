[Verse 1]
4 AM, you call to spit some fire out
Did you think that I would listen to you now?
It's nothing new, so get in line with all the rest
And I will wait till you realize you're out of breath

[Chorus]
Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
They're watching you break down
(Break down)
Hate me all you want; I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)

[Verse 2]
You've got sadness twisted up with jealousy
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty
And I have seen what holding on can take away
If it's the past you love, then that's where you can stay

[Chorus]
Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
They're watching you break down
(Break down)
Hate me all you want; I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)

[Bridge]
Desperation kills
When it's on your sleeve, you wear it well
Underneath it all
You'll always have this war inside yourself

I'm letting you go now
(Go now)

[Chorus]
Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
They're watching you break down
(Break down)
Hate me all you want; I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)
