Yeah
Invincible, this darkness will spread
As these great wings engulf the sun
Emptiness, black across golden skies
Heavens will burn, and the young will die
Empty all courage and hope
Burning all wishes for peace
Rising hatred from this false light
Terror will be all across the lands
Possesion, my virtue of war
Blood-stained hands, this fall of creation
So, this requiem as we have said
Unholy battle until the end
Burning hatred for the end of gods
Crawling brave souls come to the end of times
Crucify a syphon of the lucid
Do something toward followers of light
A war, you see, nothing stops a cause
Take no prisoners without a fight
Forever in darkness we shall dwell
No forgiveness for all that have died
Rain of invasion upon the skies
Facing our blood solidified
Smashed skulls slide beneath our feet
When steel and bone meet
This war of god has just begun
Congress of freedom will be won
Never turn our backs in retreat
When steel and bone meet
For the king of the holy
The time has come, this war will be won
And his death shall be the domain
For the followers of the crucified one
It's death, and victory in our hearts
With dead bodies at our feet
So beautiful is the bloodshed
Lead the way for these deceased
The final breath of defiance
Battle to the death, raise the flag of the tower
Rain of invasion upon the skies
Facing our blood solidified
Tearing flesh with rays of teeth
When steel and bone meet
This war of god has just begun
Congress of freedom will be won
Never bow our heads in defeat
When steel and bone meet
Yeah
