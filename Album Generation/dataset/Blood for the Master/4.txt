Falling heavens in these black flames
Nothing will be excused from the end
Even the mighty gods will be reaped
Keeping this promise of the final harvest
Painful structure of gratification through massacre
This common ground of perversion
Excavating the blackest arts of desecration
Concealed in the chambers of unreason
Gods of this great death hear the voice of calling
Open the sun for bloodshed upon the heavens
Tributaries of origin flooding the harvest of war
Transfixed on the rotting convergence of ascension
A devouring dragon of war
Harvest the magic of decay
To be enslaved in evermore
A shallow existence of life
Shards of bone
Used to decipher
Unearthly kingdoms
Fading away in fire
Hammer of this ruin
Feeding on essence of revival
Denounce the ways of the light
Nether planes of existence
Silence falls upon us
In the temple of the unfed flame
Denounce the king of thorns
Master of this subterfuge
Bodily desecration
In lavish designs
Sculpting the skin
Into sigils that bind
The raven consumes the entrails of a dove
Symbolic transfer into darkness
A hex of purpose for diluted copulation
Birthing the great beast of vengeance
Lord of smokeless fire
Turning the air to cold
Infect the sky with dark
Devour the might of old
Return to the cold earth
Born from this decay
Forced to return to it's rot
On this lifeless day
