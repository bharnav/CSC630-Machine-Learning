[Verse 1]
Sleep is a party
But my name's mud[?]
And so I'm not coming in
My bed is a taxi
But I could not afford the fare

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun is coming up
Like a hungover socialite
Rolling out of bed
I think I may have missed my bus' horn[?]

[Chorus]
It's something or other o'clock in the morning
It can't be this hard to relax

[Verse 2]
Sorry I'm always late to leave you
In my dream[?]
But I'm to tired to call and to be going
Out tonight it seems
