[Verse 1]
I've been mumbling for far too long
I'm tired of people pointing at my posture
Those remarks are going to cost ya'
There'll be no more [?]
Consider learning how to drive a car
I'm bringing myself up to par
So when you talk to me
I don't seem to hear
Because I'm thinking
Other things that are superior

[Chorus]
I'm questioning my mental health
I think I'm in love with myself
Yes I'm the one for me
[?]
[?]
So I'm saying goodbye
To low self-esteem

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you things that you don't want to hear
So the ice I'm standing on is quiet precarious
But I maintain its hilarious
So I threw my phone onto the railway track
Because I'm tired of practicing improper syntax
