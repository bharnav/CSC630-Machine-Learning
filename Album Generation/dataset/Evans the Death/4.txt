[Verse 1]
I haven’t washed in four days
And I’ve had no good reason
My dressing gown is my choice
Of apparel for this season
So I stare at the cat for a while
And the minutes have changed into miles

[Verse 2]
I can’t face the thought of getting up
And I shan’t open the door
And I certainly won't draw the curtains
What would I do that for?
So I stare at the cat for a while
And the minutes have changed into miles
And I’m too tired to walk

[Bridge]
When I'm watching the shopping channel
I will think of you
When I'm making a sandwich
I will think of you
When I try and get to sleep
I will think of you
