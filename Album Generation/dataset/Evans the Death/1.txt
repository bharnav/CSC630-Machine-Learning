[Verse 1]
I'm afraid of getting a job
I'm afraid of my neighbor's dog
And my social skills leave much to be desired
But when we discuss the public with a kiss[?]
I'm not afraid of catching your cold

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid of getting too old
I'm afraid of public transport officials
And I wince for you when I sound so trite
But when we discuss the public with a kiss[?]
I'm not afraid of catching your cold
