[Verse 1]
I'm going out tonight
I'm dressed to fit alright
But I'm not too sure
That I want to go
The music I won't understand
And the people I won't know

I will be sick again
You will be sorry then
So it's probably best
I stay in tonight
No people on the pavement
Asking me if I'm alright

[Verse 2]
Some people think I'm boring
But I'll be ignoring them
For the meanwhile
Cause I can't help but smile
In the pleasure of my own company

I'm going out tonight
I'm dressed to fit alright
But I'm not too sure
That I want to go
The music I won't understand
And the people I won't know
