[Verse 1]
I admit it, what's to say?
I'll relive it without pain
Back-street lover on the side of the road
I gotta bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes
I play

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?
Oh, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet
I pray

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You think I got my eyes closed
I've been looking at you the whole fucking time

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah

[Outro]
Once upon a time
I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time
I could love you, yeah, yeah
Once! Once! Once! Once!
Once! Once! Yeah, yeah!
