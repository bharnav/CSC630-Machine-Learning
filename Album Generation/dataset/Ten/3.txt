[Verse 1]
She scratches a letter into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child
Won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed by some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees

[Hook]
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

[Verse 2]
She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone

[Chorus]
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught
Me put me here
Don't come visit
Mother, sing me

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught me
Put me here
Don't come visit
Mother, mother, yeah
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Whoa
