[Verse 1]
What the fuck is this world running to?
You didn't leave a message
At least I could have learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could be my time by you
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?
Oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
All the bills go by and
Initiatives are taken up
By the middle
There ain't gonna be any middle anymore
And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch
Left the porch

[Chorus]
Oh
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me
I just need to say

[Vocal Ad-lib Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Lie beside me
I just need to say

[Outro]
I could not take
Oh, just one day
I know when I would not ever
Touch you, hold you, feel you in my arms
Never again
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
