Crowds were waiting on the quay
For their hero of the sea
From the greatest of the sea
A toast to freedom for everyone

He talked of fear and the cannons roar
Sent a thousand souls to the ocean floor
Victory was a simple plan
Put in place by no common man

Set sail for the southern star
Set sail for the southern star
Haul away you restless souls
Set sail for the southern star

He says that he won’t sail no more
He’s banging up his uniform
But he cannot control his soul
He’s got to take that pot of gold

Set sail for the southern star
Set sail for the southern star
Haul away you restless souls
Set sail for the southern star

Ever fearless universe, hold our nations together
Teach these words to young and old, forever

Cut the anchor today we sail
On trackless seas through storm and gale
To where the deepest water lies
To the warmer winds and balmy skies
Never to return

Set sail for the southern star
Set sail for the southern star
Haul away you restless souls
Set sail for the southern star
