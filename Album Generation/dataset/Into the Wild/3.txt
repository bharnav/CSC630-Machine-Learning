Dressed right to please the crowd
All eyes can see by the way you walk
Watching you dance around
Heaven lies down see the money talk

Kiss her in picture books
Watching her moves like a hungry hawk
Streets full of dirty looks
Heaven lies down see the money talk

Down for the money
Down, down for the money

Travel the dusty road
Trying your best not to fall apart
Let go your heavy load
See every man's got a hungry heart

Dressed right to please the crowd
All eyes can see by the way you walk
Watching you dance around
Heaven lies down see the money talk

Down for the money
Down, down for the money
