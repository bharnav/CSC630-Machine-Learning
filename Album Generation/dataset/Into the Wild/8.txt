I could feel the moving closer
But I didn't know you were in disguise
And I believe in the power of order
But I couldn't tell your truth from the lies

Feeling my way
Lost in the haze
No turning back
Lost in your gaze

I was free but now I run for cover
Ð’'cos I didn't know If I'd survive
I could feel my heart beat faster
But I couldn't tell what she had in mind

Feeling my way
Lost in the haze
No turning back
Lost in your gaze

Lost
So lost in your gaze

I can't breathe, she put me under pressure
Holds me down, oh won't let go
I didn't know if she was fire and water
I should of known she would take control

Feeling my way
Lost in the haze
No turning back
Lost in your gaze

Lost
So lost in your gaze
Lost
