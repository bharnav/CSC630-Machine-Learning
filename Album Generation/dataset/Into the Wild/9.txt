She's got me going crazy
Right over the speed of sound
And I swear if she knew what she can do
This thing would leave the ground

She's got a streamline body
Shines like pearls in a rich man's eyes
She's there on the list of desire
Won't you let me take my prize

I gotta have this T Bird Angel, so we can fly
I gotta have this T Bird Angel, and drive all night and day

Shecs a two door diva
Yeah, just what I'm looking for
And lost in this moment of madness
It only makes me want you more

I gotta have this T Bird Angel, so we can fly
I gotta have this T Bird Angel, and drive all night and day

She's my one temptation
There with her headlights on
She's never too much to handle
On the road where she belongs

We're burnin' out the highway
Me with my foot to the floor
No wonder everybody goes crazy
Gotta drive this T-Bird more

I gotta have this T Bird Angel, so we can fly
I gotta have this T Bird Angel, and drive all night and day
