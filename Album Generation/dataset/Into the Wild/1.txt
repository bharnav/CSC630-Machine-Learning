She's the candle that lights my room
Better look out 'cos she's coming here soon
Ooh, you're in my mind forever
I hear every word you say
Ooh, you come to wherever
And turn my darkness into day

You taught me how to live a life that's full
I never realized what it is to be cool
Ooh, you pushed me off the high board
And I took I took it like a man
Ooh, and now I hit the high score
Hear me Momma if you can

I can hear you, I can touch you
I can see you in my head
I can touch you, I can hear you
I can see you in my head

Hold tight to the driving wheel
You gave me strength and nerves of steel
Ooh, sometimes I do get lonely
I roll the dice and say a prayer
Ooh, I think about you only
I feel the power when you there

I can hear you, I can touch you
I can see you in my head
I can touch you, I can hear you
I can see you in my head

She's the candle that lights my room
Better look out 'cos she's coming soon
Ooh, if we can stay together
There'd nothing in our way
Here me Momma when I say

I can hear you, I can touch you
I can see you in my head
I can touch you, I can hear you
I can see you in my head
