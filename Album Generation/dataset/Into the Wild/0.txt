In your younger days with your godless ways
And your gold crest limousine
You were making trends with so called friends
With a power so obscene
Then your hollow heart it was torn apart
You were thrown a learning curve
If you turn your back on good advice you get what you deserve

We hit the nail right on the head
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again

Here's another guy he just want us to try
His best to make things good
He's an honest man with a helping hand
From a run down neighbourhood
Then you hear the thud, you see the blood
His good work come undone
Step aside for the one who said
Only the good die young

I hope you don't misunderstand me now
Cause I don't want to get you down
Just looking out at all the things I see
And they keep coming round and round

We hit the nail right on the head
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again
We hit the nail right on the head
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again

Now we have to go down a lover's road
On a path that ain't so smooth
Many ups and downs many tears and frowns
As the sweethearts look for truth
All the lies between what she believers
Gonna have to take the fall
No fear that she will ever look back
As true love conquers all

I hope you don't misunderstand me now
Cause I don't want to get you down
Just looking out at all the things I see
And they keep coming round and round

We hit the nail right on the head
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again
We hit the nail right on the head
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again

We hit the nail right on the head
