With the light of the world upon us
There'll be nothing to come between us
Something up ahead worth fighting for

You're thinking that life is easy
There's no danger that you cannot see
Do you know who is coming through your door?

To be one and free that's all we need
Let the morning sunlight take away your fear

Better believe you'll come alive again
If you believe that all the world will change
For me and you
Better believe you'll come alive again
ВЂ?Cos when you believe it, then it will happen

You will find that there's so much giving
Look for help and see how we're living
It's all the things you've never done before

If you're one and free that's all we need
Let the morning sunlight take away your fear

Better believe you'll come alive again
If you believe that all the world will change
For me and you
Better believe you'll come alive again
ВЂ?Cos when you believe it, then it will happen

Now I have your concentration
Now I've got you imagination
In a word I could not ask for more

When you're dealing with your frustration
All you need is determination
There is so much life worth fighting for

Better believe you'll come alive again
If you believe that all the world will change
For me and you
Better believe you'll come alive again
В'Cos when you believe it, then it will happen
