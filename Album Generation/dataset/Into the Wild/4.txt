The flame burns inside of me
Sending me to who knows where
Got my finger on the pulse of life
I take my chances I don't care

Walking with the sun shining down on my face
Seeing all the pieces just fall into place
When I feel I can understand
Why fate takes a hand
Well I know, that I'm ready

Running through the howling wind
Moving through the stinging rain
If you don't take what is given
You only have yourself to blame

Running through the howling wind
Moving through the stinging rain
If you don't take what is given
You only have yourself to blame

Walking with the sun shining down on my face
Seeing all the pieces just fall into place
When I feel I can understand
Why fate takes a hand
And I know, that I'm ready

I know so many people
Who never see the light of day
All kinds of trouble and
Worries seem to get in their way

Walking with the sun shining down on my face
Seeing all the pieces just fall into place
When I feel I can understand
Why fate takes a hand
And I know, that I'm ready

I'm ready
