I had a dream at daybreak
The whole of time stood still
And in my crystal vision
I saw a shadow on a hill
And then she started walking
In to the bright blue sky
I tried to follow closely
And I knew the reason why
Then the dream it turned so slowly
Like a dream within a dream
She appeared to me so ghostly
As she kissed me with a smile
And then I saw her falling
In to the strangest town
Our distance never changing
As the walls are crashing down
Then the dream it moved so slowly
Like a dream within a dream
Then she turned to me so ghostly
And she kissed me with a smile
Like a secret that the heart makes
Must be careful what I wish for
Could this dream, last forever
Until the end of time?
With a vision of ecstasy
Need the strength so, I can hold on
Donâ€™t want to die before I wake up
I had a dream at daybreak
You came and touched my soul
The deepest sense of wonder
Is knowing how to lose control
We left the ground together
So easy for us to fly
Leaving a trail of diamonds
That were seen for miles and miles
So the dream that moved so slowly
Was a dream within a dream
Then she turned to me so holy
And she kissed me with a smile
