[Intro]

She saw the look in his eyes, 'n' she knew better
He wanted her tonight, ah, and it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

[Verse 1]
Now Jamie wouldn't say, "All right", ah, she knew he'd forget her
'N' so they said goodnight, ah, oh, 'n' now he's gone forever

[Bridge]
She wants to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah
Uh just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

[Verse 2]
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahhh)
And she knows what love is for (ahhh)
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahhh)
Than one night stands, whoo

[Bridge]
She wants to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah
Uh just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
