[Verse 1]
I am a victim of the science age, uh
A child of the storm, whoa yes
I can't remember when I was your age
For me, it says no more, no more

[Chorus]
Nobody rules these streets at night like me
The atomic punk!

[Verse 2]
Whoa yeah, wow
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground, whoa yes
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Just look around, whoa yes

[Chorus]

Ooo, Ahhh

[Verse 2]
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground, oh, oh
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Look around, whoa yeah

[Chorus]
Nobody rules these streets at night like me, nobody, ah
The atomic punk
