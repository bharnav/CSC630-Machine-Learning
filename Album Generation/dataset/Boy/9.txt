[Verse 1]
Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to

Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out

[Chorus]
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Red, running red
Play for real
Talk and feel
A hole in your head
You won't shout
You're spoon fed

[Chorus]
If you don't know
Electric CoIf you don't know
Electric Co

[Verse 2]
Two, three, four
I can't stop
Useless is the castle wall
Useless is the metal wall
He's gonna jump

[Chorus]
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

[Outro]
Till someone leaves him below
He's searched high and low
A tap on the wrist and he'd know
Somebody hear him
Just leave him
I can't find my way home
I'm alone
I've lost my way home
You know and you know
And you know and you know
And you know
