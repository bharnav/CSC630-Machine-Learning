Wake up, the dawn of another dull day
Take up your dreams and on your way
Oh, oh, oh

Daylight, mother stands in the hall
Last night, head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh

When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day

Stop, shout
They come my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn
Oh, oh, oh

When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day

Stop, shout
They come my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
