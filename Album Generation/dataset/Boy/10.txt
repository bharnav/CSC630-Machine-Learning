[Verse 1]
I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see
A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by the hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

[Chorus]
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow, I will follow

[Verse 2]
I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found

[Chorus]
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow, I will follow

[Bridge]
Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes

[Chorus]
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow, I will follow
