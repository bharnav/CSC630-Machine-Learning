[Verse 1]
Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will

[Chorus]
Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat

[Verse 2]
And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one

[Chorus]
Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat

[Chorus]
Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat
