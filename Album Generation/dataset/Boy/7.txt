[Verse 1]
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I was sleeping, what's at stake?

[Hook]
A day without me

[Bridge]
Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
Shed a tear and let love go
