My world, your world
Angry, happy
Downward spiral
System breakdown
Nauseous, panic
Bring on havoc
So reach out with patience
And hold me while I hold you

I can't solve your problems today, Oh no
But you can lean on me now

Distance grows fonder
Sincere I wonder
Lover or ally
Cleanse me, don't try
Torture, cave in
Bruise me
'Til I say when
Cuz I've got
No patience
So hold me
While I hold you

I can't solve your problems today, Oh no
But you can lean on me now
I can't solve your problems today, Oh no
But you can lean on me now

I don't ever wanna see you cry no more,no more
I don't ever wanna see you cry no more,no more
I don't ever wanna see you cry no more,no more
I don't ever wanna see you cry no more,no more
No more, no more
See you cry no more
No more
No more
See you cry no more

I can't solve your problems today, Oh no
But you can lean on me now
I can't solve your problems today, Oh no
But you can lean on me now
