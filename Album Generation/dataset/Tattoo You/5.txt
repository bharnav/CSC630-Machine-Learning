[Verse 1]
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Have I got neighbors?
Have I got neighbors?
All day and all night
Neighbors
Have I got neighbors?
Ringing my door bells
All day and all night
Ladies, have I got crazies?
Screaming young babies
No piece and no quiet
I got T.V.'s, saxophone playing
Groaning and straining
With the trouble and strife

[Chorus]
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder

[Bridge]
That we fuss and fight
Neighbors, do unto strangers
Do unto neighbors
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
That we fuss and fight
Neighbors do unto strangers
Do unto neighbors what you do to yourself
Yourself, yourself, yourself
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Do yourself a favor
Don't you mess with my baby
When I'm working all night
You know that neighbor
Steal off my table
Steal off my table
And doing alright, alright, alright
Neighbors do unto strangers
Do unto strangers
What you do to yourself
