[Verse 1]
I dreamed that you've died
I'm forever alone
I'm weak and I'm frightened

This brings about a change
Thing you said to me
Believe and things you might find
Will turn into a march

[Pre-Chorus]
I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

[Chorus]
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

[Verse 2]
Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions

I swear to you
It will never be the same
It's not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

[Chorus]
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

[Chorus]
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

[Bridge]
Erase darkness from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

[Chorus]
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me
