[Verse 1]
How much can we take before we care to settle?
Thought we were set for a perfect scene
Everyone is waiting for a failure
Something that can please and justify
A void within our lives
Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have

[Verse 2]
Why don't you drop your guard
I'm on my knees for you
You got the mindset of a killer
And it will not take you far
If I had the answer would that make you stay?
This is the time and place
It is your moment of fate

[Pre-Chorus]
If this would be your last breath
Would that change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

[Chorus]
If you just let me, I will find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying

[Bridge]
What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?
If I had the answer

Would that make you stay
This is the time and place
You are waiting for something you can not have

[Pre-Chorus]
If this would be your last breath
Would that change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

[Chorus]
If you just let me, I will find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying

If you just let me, I will find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying
