[Verse 1]
Twisting tongue
Fallen off the edge again
Need some space
Need disgrace
I'm confused I'm in a maze

[Verse 2]
I need for you to pick me up
When I fall down
There's so much more
We can go far
But I can't control my selfish ways

[Chorus]
Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

[Verse 3]
Who's the man in front of me?
(Who's the man in front of me?)
I'm blindfolded, I can't see
Need a reason, I'm left empty

There's so much more
We can go far
But I can't control my selfish ways

[Chorus]
Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

[Bridge]
This inner apathy brings me to life
I know it's strange and it's draining me

I'm tired
I'm fed up
I'm a slave

I'm tired
I'm fed up
I'm a slave

[Chorus]
Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you
Question you
