[Verse 1]
You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside, numb the pain, come around with answers

[Chorus]
We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

[Verse 2]
Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It is useless to hide
An empty chamber, guess I was part of a plan

[Chorus]
We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

[Verse 3]
We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days, beginning of the end

[Chorus]
We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
