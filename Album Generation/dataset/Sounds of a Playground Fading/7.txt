[Verse 1]
September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter

Say
I have a better plan
I have a better plan
I have a better plan

[Chorus]
Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

[Verse 2]
When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

[Chorus]
Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

[Chorus]
(Never have to worry for all that we know)
(Truth be told)
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie
