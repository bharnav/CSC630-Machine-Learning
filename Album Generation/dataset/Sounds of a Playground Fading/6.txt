[Verse 1]
There's someone in the attic building a strange machine
Never really seen him, but I think he works all day
Blinded by the world outside, I stay inside
Hardly know my name, but it's getting better by time

[Verse 2]
I saw something in the mirror, someone's watching me
If I hide in the attic he will never get to me
I found some rope on the floor, I have to build a trap
So I start on my machine, I am never to be seen
