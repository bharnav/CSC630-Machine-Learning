[Verse 1]
Until the world ceases to move
A burning feeling, let me go, this is real
I wish one more thing
I flinch my hands and bang my head

Take whatever comes to you
All the while, I don't need another friend

[Chorus]
I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can give you all that you lost

[Verse 2]
I'm never told
Bad I stay, so sick in me
I'm dying alone

We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought of reason
We will never be okay

[Chorus]
I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can give you all that you lost

[Bridge]
A growing pain
It is hard to say
What brought the darkest burden
For some of us, there's no answer

Chains are breaking
I won't let this build up inside of me
There's a storm coming
I will serve no more till my very last breath

[Chorus]
I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can give you all that you lost
