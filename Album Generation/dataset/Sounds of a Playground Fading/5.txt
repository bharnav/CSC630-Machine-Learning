[Verse 1]
Big picture slowly fades
Walls are closing in
And there I was cursing the ground
Unable to understand

I won't let the world break me
So I need to change direction
Nothing's special, I'm far from perfect
Light the way for me

[Chorus]
Feel I was running an endless mile
The last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

[Verse 2]
Walking where the dead ships dwell
These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller
And I had to leave

[Chorus]
Feel I was running an endless mile
The last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

[Bridge]
All I hear is noise
Hearts of false hope, guess I took it for granted
I know I went too far
I won't say I'm sorry, I got what I deserved

[Chorus]
Feel I was running an endless mile
The last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Feel I was running an endless mile
The last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind
