[Verse 1]
And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldn’t have to feel this way

Looking for something to believe in
I think I’ve done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

[Chorus]
You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

[Verse 2]
Keep pretending
I can handle everything
You’ll never understand me

And I don’t care what you think
Or maybe I do
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

[Chorus]
You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light
Grab a piece of the light

[Chorus]
You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light
