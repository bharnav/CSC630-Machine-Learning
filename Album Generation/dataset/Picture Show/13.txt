Hey baby what’s been on your mind for so long?
I’m always starved for your attention
Hey baby what’s been keeping me so shut out
It hurts a little
Yeah it hurts a little

I can’t seem to get anyplace I want to
I’m needing some of your affection
What’s all the rushing and the pushing darlin’
Slow down a little
Hey slow down a little

Time’s on our side
C’mon and take me for a ride
You know that time’s on our side
I’m a little bit lonely
You’re a little bit scared tonight

Hey baby what’s been going on for so long?
I’ve been here hanging in suspension
Hey baby why you keeping me so shut out
It hurts a little
Yeah it hurts a little

We can’t seem to get anyplace we want to
We’re always needing some direction
Why all the rushing and the pushing darlin’
Slow down a little
Hey slow down a little

Time’s on our side
C’mon and take me for a ride
You know that time’s on our side
I’m a little bit lonely
You’re a little bit scared tonight
Why don’t you take me for a ride
You know that time’s on our side
We’re both a little bit lonely and a little bit scared tonight

Hold my hand
Don’t let me be
I will hold you close to me
I know we’ve both been lonely
Baby I’ve been lonely
Lonely oh so lonely

C’mon and take me for a ride
You know that time’s on our side
I’m a little bit lonely
You’re a little bit scared tonight
Why don’t you take me for a ride
You know that time’s on our side
We’re both a little bit lonely and a little bit scared tonight
We’re both a little bit lonely
Take me for a ride
We’re both a little bit lonely
Take me for a ride
Take me for a ride
