I found my love, it was just last week
She really had me turnin on
I fight for hours just to try and speak
To my babe I was the only one
Don't you know how it feels
To get days and months and years
Trapped inside a waking dream
I bet ya you and I could sit back tonight and try
To make it more than just a fantasy

We are fast youth goin nowhere
Burnin this town like we don't care
Nothin you say could ever put out our fire

We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
Outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight it's just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend

I found my love, it was just last week
Glasses on
I felt the fire in my feet
Get away while the night's still young
Don't you know how it feels
To get days and months and years
Trapped inside a waking dream
I bet ya you and I could sit back tonight and try
To make it more than just a fantasy

We are fast youth goin nowhere
Burnin this town like we don't care
Nothin you say could ever put out our fire

We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
Outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight it's just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend

We are the ones that put on the show
I'm the one that never let go
I'm never alone when I'm around you, around you

We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Nanananana
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Nanananana
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Nanananana

Nobody knows me like you
Nobody knows me like you
We got a lot to get through
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

Outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight it's just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend
