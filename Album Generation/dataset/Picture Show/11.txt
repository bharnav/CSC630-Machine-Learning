Lights go out on Sunset Boulevard
Never trust a town to tell you who you are
I'm gonna love you 'til it kills me
Love you 'til I'm outta my head
How's that for devotion baby?
Nobody here still believes in "til death"

And if we break through the night
It won't feel right
I never wanted you unsatisfied
Shake to the sin
Keep pulling me in
I never wanted you to cry again
If we fight 'til the dawn
Tell me what's wrong
I never wanted you to feel alone
I'm never ever gonna know
If you don't show

Lights go down on everything we know
Never trust a city when your blood's gone cold
But I'm gonna love you 'til it kills me
Love you 'til I'm blue in the head
How's that for devotion baby?
Nobody here still believes in "til death"

And if we break through the night
It won't feel right
I never wanted you unsatisfied
Shake to the sin
Keep pulling me in
I never wanted you to cry again
If we fight 'til the dawn
Tell me what's wrong
I never wanted you to feel alone
I'm never ever gonna know
If you don't
Gimme all your lovin'...

And if we break through the night
It won't feel right
I never wanted you unsatisfied
Shake to the sin
Keep pulling me in
I never wanted you to cry again
If we fight 'til the dawn
Tell me what's wrong
I never wanted you to feel alone
I'm never ever gonna know
If you don't show
I'm never ever gonna know
If you don't show
I'm never ever gonna know
If you don't show
