[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You, you got your head in a scream
And I, I’m trying to get your attention
You appear as a child with your heart on your sleeve
But you’re acting exactly as you do in my dreams
I said you; you are not what you seem
And you’re finding out that

[Chorus]
Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You’re losing the game
That’s the thing about trust
It’s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That’s the thing about trust

[Verse 2]
You, you got your head in a swing
Yeah, and I, I'm trying to give you salvation
You appear as a devil
Like a wolf in the woods
But you're acting exactly as we expected you would
I said you; you hear the words that I sing, its a shock to the system

[Chorus]
Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You’re losing the game
That’s the thing about trust
It’s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That’s the thing about trust

[Refrain]
Don’t lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don’t lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don’t lie to me when the pressure's on, you gotta have trust
Don’t lie to me when the pressure's on, I said you gotta have trust

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You’re losing the game
That’s the thing about trust
It’s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That’s the thing about trust

Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name
You’re losing the game
That’s the thing about trust
It’s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That’s the thing about trust

[Outro]
