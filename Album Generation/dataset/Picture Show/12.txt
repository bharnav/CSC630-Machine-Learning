Lost in the dark
You were high like a shooting star
I went to the moon
And I wanted to show you
Hey by the way
You took me down like a tidal wave
And I got lost in the places we'd go to

Nevermind the consequence of sin
Nevermind the pain you feel within
I don't care as long as you are here by my side

Here's a room where we can go
Where nobody else will follow
Put all of your trust in me
And I will give you mine

Nothing ever lasts forever
But as long as we're together
Tell me you love me

She is a queen
In a city of broken dreams
If she'd only believe in the power of devotion

You could turn away from here
Put your faith into the atmosphere
While I sing sing sing you to sleep

There's a room where we can go
Where nobody else will follow
Put all of your trust in me
And I will give you mine

Nothing ever lasts forever
But as long as we're together
Tell me you love me

We've been on the run
Since the day we were born
I can feel you next to me
Even when I'm alone

There's a room where we can go
Where nobody else will follow
Put all of your trust in me
And I will give you mine

Nothing ever lasts forever
But as long as were together
Tell me you love me
