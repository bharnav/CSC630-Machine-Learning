[Verse One: Neon Trees]
Love is a game that we could play
Even only for today
I don’t wanna lose you
We’ve been apart for far too long
Now we only have a song
Let the music move you

[Pre-Chorus: Neon Trees]
There was a part of me
That never left a part of you
I wish I could be everything you wanted

[Chorus: Neon Trees]
But I’m still young
Wide-eyed and hopeless
Yeah, I’m still young
I want your devotion to this
Can we kiss like we do in my head
Can we dance like we do on my bed
Oh, like we’re still young

[Verse Two: Neon Trees]
Love is a loss that we incur
When we gamble with the world
I don’t wanna lose you
I feel my life has just begun
I can hear you singalong
Now the music's in you

[Pre-Chorus: Neon Trees]
There was a part of me
That never left a part of you
I wish I could be everything you wanted

[Chorus: Neon Trees]
But I’m still young
Wide-eyed and hopeless
Yeah, I’m still young
I want your devotion to this
Can we kiss like we do in my head
Can we dance like we do on my bed
Oh, like we’re still young

[Bridge: Neon Trees]
Baby don’t you cry
I won’t tell you lies
I’ll just sit and sing you lullabies, lullabies
Baby don't you cry
I won't tell you lies
I'll just sit and sing you lullabies

[Chorus: Neon Trees]
Cause I’m still young
Wide-eyed and hopeless
Yeah I’m still young
I want your devotion to this
Can we kiss like we do in my head
Can we dance like we do on my bed
Oh, like we’re still young
