[Verse 1]
Take me on
What ever went wrong
My tongue on your tongue
Makes me feel better
Our first kiss
A slap on the wrist
My heart is a fist
And you're left of center
Gimme gimme gimme your attention
Strange ways babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna move like you move
I'm watching you

[Chorus]
Ohhh, Hooray for Hollywood
Ohhh, Hooray for Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Read my lips
I'll get my kicks
You get your fix and we'll go out dancing
You're so low
I'm watching you glow
The last picture show

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna move like you move
I'm watching you

[Chorus]
Ohhh, Hooray for Hollywood
Ohhh, Hooray for Hollywood
