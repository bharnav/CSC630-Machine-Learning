I'm pulling throttle back
Ready to attack
Turn the bow around into the wind

Waiting for the rush
Engines on full thrust
We shoot a metal bird into the sky

Power, Screaming, Burning
Afterburner, Afterburner

Let the eagle's cry
Launch into the sky
Like birds of prey
They circle high above you

We on the mighty beast
The challenger unleashed
The messengers of death
Will come among you

Power, Screaming, Burning
Afterburner, Afterburner
Afterburner, Afterburner

(Solo)

I'm pulling throttle back
Ready to attack
Like birds of prey
They circle high above you

Waiting for the rush
Engines on full thrust
The messengers of death
Will come among you

Power screaming, burning
Afterburner, Afterburner
Afterburner, Afterburner
Afterburner, Afterburner
Afterburner, Afterburner
