It was Back in 79
When we rode the mighty tide
It swept across the World
We came together
We never stood alone
Wherever we roamed
This legacy of rock
Will last forever

Show me your hands
Show me your hands
Raise up your hands
Deliver me

Defenders of the faith
To you this vow we make
When our back's against the wall
We'll not surrender
You may be young or old
There's no difference at all
Just raise your glasses high
And sing our song

Show me your hands
Show me your hands
Raise up your hands
Deliver me

Show me your hands
Show me your hands
Raise up your hands
Deliver me

It was Back in 79
When we rode the mighty tide
The music will go on
And never die

Show me your hands
(Show me your hands)
Show me your hands
(Show me your hands)
Raise up your hands
Deliver me

Show me your hands
(Show me your hands)
Show me your hands
(Show me your hands)
Raise up your hands
Deliver me
