Hear the whistle blowing
Another working day
Turn the wheels of power
Earn the daily pay
The blood and sweat of working men
Made this country great
The Kings and Queens of industry
This song we dedicate
No matter where you're going
Remember where you've been

It takes me back
To a simple life
I sing my song
The ballad of the working man

The rhythm of the engines
Pounding out a song
Pulling all together
To make this kingdom strong
To every man and woman
Standing tall and proud
We dedicate this song to you
Rejoice and shout out loud
It's not so complicated
Remember where you're from

It takes me back
To a simple life
I sing my song
The ballad of the working man
Working man

Another round of whiskey
Another shot of gin
The barmaid rings last orders
Get the last ones in
The place is full of laughter
Glasses full of beer
It takes me to a simple life
That's nearly disappeared
No matter where you're going
Remember where you've been

It takes me back
To a simple life
I sing my song
The ballad of the working man
The ballad of the working man
The ballad of the working man
