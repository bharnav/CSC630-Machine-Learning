The telegram came today taking me far away
Away from the ones I love I put my faith in god above
We march towards the sound of distant guns
White fire lighting up the sky
We came to fight and die in fields of blood
We follow the call to arms

I'll write you every day hope our love won't fade away
You give me strength to carry on until the final day is done
This hell, this hell is where we live and die
We fall comrades by our side
We pay to make it through another day
We follow the call to arms

If I die please don't forget me
If I live I want to live free
We pray to God these days will end
And bring us back safe to your arms

I saved all your letters
I keep them pressed close to my heart
They won't stop a bullet
They just keep me closer to you than apart

We live, we gotta live free
We die remember me
We pray to make it through another day
We follow the call to arms

A telegram came today
It's taking me far away
Away from the ones I love
I put my faith in God above
