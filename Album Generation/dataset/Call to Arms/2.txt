Nobody said it was easy when your back's to the wall
We started with nothing nothing at all
It's just you and me against the World
That's how it's meant to be
You can't escape the simple truth
It was our destiny

Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

They never thought we could make it but that was never the case
We made a vow to each other that nothing could break
Just stand your ground against the odds
That's what we've got to do
Together we can face the worst
That life can throw at you

Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

Don't let them drag you down
Keep both feet on the ground

You know we started with nothing with our backs to the wall
They never said it was easy we've got nothing at all
Just me and you against the World that's how it's got to be
You can't escape the simple truth this is our destiny

Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

Against the odds
We're surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds
