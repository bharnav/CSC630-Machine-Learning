I've been working like a dog I need some time
I've been running round in circles out of my mind
I've got to pack my bags and get away
I've had about enough I'm not going to stay

We're chasing, chasing the bullet
We're chasing, cha-cha-cha-chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet

I need a long vacation a little bit of therapy
I'm not gonna get it here until I'm running free
The clock keeps ticking on the wall
I'm running out of time
Staring into space I need a sign

We're chasing, chasing the bullet
We're chasing, cha-cha-cha-chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet

Everybody's left I'm on my own
I'm climbing up the walls I want to go home
The phones are ringing off the hook
The world is on the line
I'm running round in circles out of mind

We're chasing, chasing the bullet
We're chasing, chasing the bullet
We're chasing, chasing the bullet
We're chasing, cha-cha-cha-chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
