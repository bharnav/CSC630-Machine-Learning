See the full moon rising
Across the blackest night
Sails on the horizon
Dragon ships in sight
Gods are in the heavens
A crack across the sky
Coming with the thunder
Soon you're gonna die

Gods of war
Stand in fear
Strike you down
With the hammer of the Gods
Hammer of the Gods

Silhouettes at sunrise
Everything is still
Inside your heart is pounding
Waiting for the kill
Crashing through the silence
Come the Viking hordes
Screaming down with terror
Battle axe and sword

Gods of war
Straight from hell
Strike you down
With the hammer of the Gods
Hammer of the Gods

Prepare to meet the fury
Coming with the dawn
Take your wives and children
Protect them from the storm
Make your stand before them
Fight them to the last
The warriors of the Northlands
Soon will cross your path

Gods of war
Stand in fear
Strike you down
With the hammer of the Gods
Hammer of the Gods
Hammer of the Gods
Hammer of the Gods
Of the Gods
