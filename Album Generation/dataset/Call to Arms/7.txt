Resistance is futile
There's nowhere to hide
We've run out of options
We flow with the tide
We wait for tomorrow
To see if it comes
Defences are pointless
It's inevitable

Where will we be, what will we do
When doomsday comes
When doomsday comes

It's just an illusion
Nothing is real
We're here for a moment
And then disappear

Where will we be, what will we do
When doomsday comes
When doomsday comes
When doomsday comes

Can't stop the feeling
Of being alone
Dark and foreboding
It's taking its toll
The end of tomorrows
Will nothing survive
To remember the feeling
Of being alive

Where will we be, what will we do
When doomsday comes
When doomsday comes
