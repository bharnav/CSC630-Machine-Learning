I've been chasing rainbows all my life
Still haven't found that pot of gold
I send my prayers to heaven every night
Just close my eyes and let them go
Seems like everybody has got one up on me
Someone tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus]
Why does the sun always shine
On the other side, on the other side
Why does it always have to be
Oh raining
Always raining on me

Seems like I've been standing under the clouds
And it's always beenthat way
There ain't no silver lining to be found
Everywhere I look it's just another shade of grey
And I don't know why
And I don't know when
And I don't know where to begin

[Repeat Chorus]
I know there's a rainbow hiding just beyond the clouds
So I'll keep on keeping on
Ain't gonna let it get me down
I won't let get me down

[Repeat Chorus]
Always raining on me
Always raining on me
Always raining on me
