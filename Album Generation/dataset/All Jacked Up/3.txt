[Chorus]
Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a SKOAL Ring
Don't have to be wined and dined
We can stay home every night
I can do without anything
Except a man with a SKOAL Ring

He works a ten hour shift and comes home right on time
He don't complain a bit when I get out of line
He ain't richand he might have a little dirt on his hands
But that worn-out circle on his jeans makes him my kind of man

[1/2 Chorus]
I've always been a bandit girl and he's a long cut man
Somehow we still get along with different colored can's
When that boy comes home from work smellin' like the farm
That berryblend on his lips still turns me on

[Chorus]
Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a SKOAL Ring
Don't have to be wined and dined
We can stay home every night
I can do without anything
Except a man with a SKOAL Ring

The one thing that gets to me is a man with a SKOAL Ring
