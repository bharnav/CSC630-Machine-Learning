Rebel Child
Rebel Child, won't you heed my warnin
One of these days the rain'll come pourin'
Some of thouse sunshine blue sky mornin's
Might just turn to grey

I understand why you do the thing you do
There was a time when I was just like you
I know right now you think you know it all
There's no way that you can break
No way you can fall

(Chorus 2)
Rebel Child, won't you heed my warnin'
One of these days the rain'll come pourin'
Some of thouse sunshine blue sky mornin's
Might just turn to grey

I've been there and I know what you're thinking
You're flying highbut one day you'll blink and
THat cloud your're on will just startsinkin'
Don't wait till it's too late
Whoa oh rebel child

I know you can't learn from my mistakes
You've got your own road you've gotta take
And it might look like it's paved in gold
Just remember that you'll have to reap
All the seeds you sew

(repeat chorus 2)
Keep your feet on the ground
And one eye one heaven do
Do a lot of forgivin'
But not much forgettin'
And remember life is one big lesson

(Repeat Chorus 2)
Whoa oh Rebel Child
Whoa oh Rebel Child
