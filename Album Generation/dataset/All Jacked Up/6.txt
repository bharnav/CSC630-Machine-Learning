[Verse 1:]
I'm for the low man on the totem pole
And I'm for the underdog god bless his soul
And I'm for the guys still pulling third shift
And the single mom raising her kids

And I'm for the preacher who stay on their knees
And I'm for the sinner who finally believed
And I'm for the farmer with dirt on his hands
And the soldiers who fight for this land

[Chorus:]
And I'm for the bible
And I'm for the flag
And I'm for the working man

Me and Ol' hag
I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
Politically Uncorrect

[Verse 2:]
I guess my opinion is all out of style
Don't get me started because I can get wild
And I'll make a fight for the forefather's plan
(That's right)
Hell, the world already knows where I stand

[Repeat Chorus:]

Nothing wrong with the bible
Nothing wrong with the flag
Nothing wrong with the working man

Me and Ol' Hag
We're just some of many that can't get no respect
Politically uncorrect
Politically uncorrect
