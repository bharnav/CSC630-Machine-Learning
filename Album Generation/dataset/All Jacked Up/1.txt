[Verse 1:]
I ain't never had a problem with California
There's a lot of good women from Sacramento to Corona
But them Hollywood types
After a while wear on you

Strutting around in their size zeros
Skinny little girls no meat on their bones
Never even heard of George Jones

[Chorus:]
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left
That know how to rock your world

Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken
And dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls

[Verse 2:]
There ain't nothing wrong with plastic surgery
Well, Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
Everybody ought to be exactly who they want to be

But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
With her big fake smile
And her painted-on tan
She'd never have a chance at a real man

[Repeat Chorus x2]

Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad you glad there's still a few of us left
That know how to rock your world

Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken
And dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls

Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
