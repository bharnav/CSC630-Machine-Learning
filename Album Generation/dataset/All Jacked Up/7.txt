[Verse 1:]
I don't feel like loving you today
So don't you even try to change my mind
The best thing you can do right now is just go away
Cause I don't feel like loving you today

I don't want to talk about last night
I'm angry and haven't had much sleep
And I'm so tired and bloodshot
There ain't no telling what I'd say
Cause I don't feel like loving you today

[Chorus:]
But you know I will anyway
Even though we make it hard sometimes
I'll wind up forgiving you
And probably loving you for the rest of my life
But I don't feel like loving you today

[Verse 2:]
And I've got sixteen hours left to go
I might tell you that I'm leaving
Even though you know I'll stay
Cause I don't feel like loving you today

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
But I don't feel like loving you today
I just don't feel like loving you today
