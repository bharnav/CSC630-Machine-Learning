[Verse 1:]
Look at her
My God
She's dancing
Out there romancing in her new lover's arms

If he were here to see how she's acting
If he could hear her laughing
It would break his broken heart

[Chorus:]
'Cause he ain't even cold yet
The tears haven't dried yet
It's not written in stone yet
As far as he's concerned
He ain't even cold yet

The fire's still burning
She laid his love to rest
Showing no regrets
Lord, he ain't even cold yet

[Verse 2:]
If he found out
Lord, it would kill him
'Cause he's still living in yesterday

Whoever tells him
That she's not grieving
Would just be leaving flowers on his grave

[Repeat Chorus:]

She laid his love to rest
Showing no regrets
And he ain't even cold yet
