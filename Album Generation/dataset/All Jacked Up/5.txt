Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Grand Ol' Opry, here in Nashville, Tennessee. All the way from Pocahontas, Illinois, it's Gretchen Wilson

Well, I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago
I found an equalizer
That makes his memory a no-show
And I won't be jonesin'
For his loving anymore
'Cause I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago

I dropped a quarter
Played Golden Ring on the juke box (thank you)
Placed my order
With the guy behind the bar
And when he handed me a cold one
Well, I said, keep the change, darlin'
And as I drank it down
I felt the healing start

Now I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago
I found an equalizer
That makes his memory a no-show
And I won't be jonesin'
For his loving anymore
'Cause I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago

When he left me
He took my brand new Silverado
I started thumbin'
And I finally hitched a ride
I just came in here to drink a beer
And watch the rednecks fight
Now I don't feel so bad
Going home alone tonight

'Cause I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago
I found an equalizer
That makes his memory a no-show
And I won't be jonesin'
For his loving anymore
'Cause I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago

And I won't be jonesin'
For his loving anymore
'Cause I'm one bud wiser
Than I was a minute ago
Yes, I'm one bud wiser
