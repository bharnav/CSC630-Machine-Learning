I stood behind that bar till closing time
I served cold beer, warm whiskey, and Rotgut Wine
Now I'm up here on the stage
Everybody knows my name
And I can't believe how long they wait
In my autograph line

[Chorus]
Not bad for a bartender or an eighth grade education
Pretty good for a backwoods girl
Who had to make it on her own
I'm on the stool side of the bar these days
Buying everyone a round
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender

Swingin' doors and cleanin' floors is all I'd ever known
Out of nowhere somehow i found my yellow brick road
So when you're broke and paying dues
Look at me I'm living proof
And if there's hope for me
Know there's hope for you

[Repeat Chorus]
I'm on the stool side of the bars these days
Buying everyone a round
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Not bad for a bartender
