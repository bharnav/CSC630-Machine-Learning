I'm a Mother, I'm a lover
A chef, a referree
I'm a Doctor and a chauffer, seven days a week
I ain't asking for a medal, yea, I know you work too
I'd just like a little credit where credit is due

It's the hardest gig I've known, I work my fingers to the bone
Yea, the dishes and the diapers never stop
Lousy pay, there ain't no 401k
I know this may come as a shock..
But this here's a full time job

Well I'm takin' a vacation
I could use a little fun
I'll be sippin' on the silence
And soaking up the sun
I'm leavin' you my apron
You can try it on for size
You said there's nothing to it
So I'm sure you'll be fine

It's the hardest gig I've known, I work my fingers to the bone
Yea, the dishes and the diapers never stop
Lousy pay, there ain't no 401k
I know this may come as a shock but this here's a full time job

In a day or maybe two
You'll be changing your tune
By then you'll be ready to drop..
Working my full time job
This here's a full time job
