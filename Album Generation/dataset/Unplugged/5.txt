[Intro]
(But all I wanna know, baby is...)
(If what we have is good...) Oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Just pick up the motherfuckin' phone, man)
Ayye
Yeah, baby...mmm

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone
(And I'm not trying to hear that shit)

[Chorus]
What I wanna know baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?

[Verse 2]
Still light the fire on a rainy night
Still like it better when your holding me tight
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part (mmm)
Tell me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart

[Chorus]
All I wanna know is baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore


[Bridge]
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me Papa
Oh you gotta try
I'll get down on my knees
Hoping you please please please
Oooh won't you call me sometime Papa

[Outro]
Why on earth
Can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me
(why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
