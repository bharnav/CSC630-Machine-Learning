You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby, you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, and last
Baby, you know I'm worth it

Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
(That’s right, that’s right)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
(‘Cause why?)
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth
(‘Cause a…’cause a…’cause a…)

‘Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman’s worth
Break it down

Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm
Let’s do it like this, come on

‘Cause if you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby, I know you're worth it
And if you never play me
Now, don’t you bluff
I'll hold you down when ish gets rough
Baby, I know you're worth it

She walks the mile make you smile all the while being true
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Don't take for granted the passion she has for you
(What’s that? What’s that?)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
(You better recognize it)
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

Ooh
‘Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
Yeah

So I wanna know, do I have some, uh
Do I have some real men out in that audience tonight?
Yeah, don’t be shamed now, you know what I mean?
Gotta give it up—if you real, then you real
So I wanna know, do I have some real women in this audience tonight?
Yeah, yeah
Now I have another question for you
I wanna know, uh, y’all think that, uh, you wanna hear something new?
Let’s flip it around on ‘em, come on…
