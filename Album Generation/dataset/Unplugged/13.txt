[Verse 1]
Rememberin' the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream about you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)

[Verse 2]
Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' and waitin' for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine

[Bridge]
Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin' is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothin' ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Let's get away
Let's get away
Ohh
We can get away
We can get away
Ohh
Let's get away
Let's get away
Ohh
We can get away
We can get away
Ohhh
