Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts..

Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go

Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts
You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you
I can't take this loneliness you've given me
I can't go on giving my life away

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you everything that you wanted before
If you will stay with me

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

To you I'm a toy and you're the boy
Who has to say when i should play
Yet you hurt me, desert me

Ooooooo, oooooo

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you everhything that you wanted before
If you will stay with me

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts baby

Oohh yeeeeeeeeaaaaahh
Say yeah (yeah)
Yeahhh (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Wooaaahhhooo (every little bit)

Ohh you make me feel so sad inside

Every night i cry
Every night i sigh
Every night i wonder why
You treat me cold
Ohhhh you treat me so cold ohhh
