Uh, it's the bro life
Gotta go live yo life
Live it so right

[Verse1: Addy Lipps]
Kickin'  back to another Mtn.Dew
While Im Hitting up some ladies man it's really nothing new
And There's not much to do, so I'm searching for clue
These are just some late nights chillin  with the crew
We be Living up the life cuz there's no way to renew
Letting go of the bad past cuz theres no way to undo
Living in the now cuz there's no way to preview
Just Close your eyes see were it leads you

Im Zoning out I don't even have attention
And my thoughts are literally in an busy intersection
And I love  math,  7 digits  is my proffession
Nice to these ladies
And the haters Stay suppression
Im teaching myself a  lesson, red pennin my correction
Up for days on Meds so theres really no resting
And I am who I am  so bitch just get stepping
I'll do what I whatever I want and there should no question

[Verse2: Addy Lipps]
Cuz It ain't about the bitches  it's mutherfucker with it
So I eat my bread with honey n' I'm buzzing' with a lip in
N' its viargra hittin cuz they bodies always start to stiffin
When Im In the booth I'm sprinting
They be sittin like they shitting

Uh you girls legs spread wide like Air Jordan's
Or the eagles wings on my shirt cuz
That bird soaring
Rainy days in my bed like the old mans who's snoring
With my 2ndary chick who turns a day great from boring

I'm wakin up to the most nutritious breakfast
Taking notes tally marks girls on my sex list
Gotta walk it out but my legs are lets sit
To much caffeine in my system I'm staying restless

Sometimes I get high without knowing about what I'm smoking
And sometimes I get drunk without thinking about what I'm drinking
Sometimes I feel nice, sometimes I feel shady
Shit it just hit me, sometimes I wish i had a lady
