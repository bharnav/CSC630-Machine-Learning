On and on like a rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah the right one
There will come a day when I bury you
I will go the same way, together
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through

And the closet thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closet thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naïve and semi functioning
Hey this is a love song, hands up if you feel it

And the closet thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closet thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

And the closet thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closet thing between us is air
And the moment that's between us is everything
Don't say a word, that's not enough
