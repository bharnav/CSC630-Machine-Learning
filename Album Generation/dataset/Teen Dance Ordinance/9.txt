Started with a headache
I tried to fight it but I kinda like the pain
Reservations what I got
From the bottom to the top of a bottle five times a day
Started with a top line
You know It's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm shaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it. Get out, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that can happen?
What's the worst thing that can happen?

Bored out of your mind, fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that can happen?
What's the worst thing that can happen to you?

When there's nothing onâ€¦

You find yourself caught in a spotlight
To try to fight but you candle light the place
On your knees is what you're not, Keeping what you got
Don't try to hide your face
Caught in a flashlight
You know It's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm breaking and I feel so alright
Stand up and face it. Get out don't waste it
What's the worst thing that can happen?
What's the worst thing that can happen?

Bored out of your mind, fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that can happen?
What's the worst thing that can happen to you?
