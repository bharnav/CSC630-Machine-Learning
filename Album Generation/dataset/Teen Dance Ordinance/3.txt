[Hook 1]
I can't turn back if I wanted to no
I can't even feel you but I'm close to you now
I know that it's different but it felt the same and
I know that I'm different but I act the same and
Oh we're gonna fall
I don't wanna be here blaming but
I don't wanna hear you shading me
I don't wanna hear you trading me with no one else
I don't want to hear your playing me with someone else oh

[Verse 1]
Why you lying? Why you lying?
Who you hiding? Who you hiding?
Is he better than I've been?
Does he know you from inside out?
Does he love you, do you love him now?
I don't like to get emotional but wow
Whenever I'm gone do you bring him around?
Now I'mma go ahead and switch it up

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
I'mma go ahead and switch it up
I got all these drugs in my cup
Put a lot of drugs in my cup
I don't want to let you go
But I'll have to let you go
Money gonna fucking flow
I'mma laugh at you hoe
I'mma laugh at you fucking little
I'mma laugh at everyone sayin that I couldn't do it but I did it
Now I got money comin in and I'm lookin at the fuckin world different
I couldn't stop if I wanted
I don't even fuckin wanna

[Hook 2]
I can't turn back even if I wanted to no
I can't even feel you I know I'm not close to you no
I know that its different and its not the same
I know that I'm different I don't act the same
Oh we're gonna fall
I don't wanna blame on you but it's all your fault
I will not trade my position oh I worked to hard
I dont wanna play these games you're playing no more
Play with someone else
