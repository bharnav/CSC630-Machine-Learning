[Verse 1:]
I've tried
And I've lied to myself
To stop the tears
But it's been too many years
And you keep doing the same thing

Making the same old promises
Before you play with my heart again
I'ma keep it one hundred
It's been on my mind
And before you get to lying

[Chorus:]
Let me tell you I'm sorry
(Sorry)
But I can't be here anymore
(No, no, no)
Baby I'm sorry
(Sorry)
Not even love can make me stay another day

You're holding on to me
When I know we need to be free
I just need some time
So I can breathe

[Verse 2:]
You say
You want me by your side
But you won't even try
To listen when I'm telling you the simple things
(Baby it's the simple things that matter in life)

I don't wanna fight you no more
I don't wanna waste no time
I'ma keep it one hundred
This been on my mind
So don't lie

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Get back what you stole
Rebuild what you broke down
Won't be no more crying myself to sleep
I'm over you
Time is over due
No need for another lie
Cause I made up my mind

[Repeat Chorus:]
