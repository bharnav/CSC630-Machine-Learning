And where we're you tonight?
My dress fit me so nice, my hair lookin' so right
You're nowhere to be found
I fluffed all the pillows, for me to lay with you
You're making it so hard
When it should be easy, but you got it easy
Cause you know I won't leave
I do all I can, ya don't understand

I wanna fall in love, love
I wanna fall in love, whoa
I wanna fall in love
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
But you gotta catch me
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
Oh
But you gotta catch me

You don't answer your phone
And I'm only calling to see how ya doing
If you're coming home
A little attention, is all that I'm asking
Cause love should never hurt
As much as I want you, my heart's always cryin'
But I can't cut you loose
I do all I can but you don't understand

I wanna fall in love, that's all I wanna do
I wanna fall in love, oh
I wanna fall in love
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
But you gotta catch me
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
Oh
But you gotta catch me, oh catch me catch me

Oh I
And I stay cryin'
But I keep tryin' yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You gotta know babe
You ain't perfect

I wanna fall in love, can you can you can you can you
I wanna fall in love, fall in love oh I
I wanna fall in love
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
But you gotta catch me
(catch me catch me catch me catch me)
Oh
But you gotta catch me
I wanna fall in love love love
