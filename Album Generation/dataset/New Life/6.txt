[Spoken intro]

Only you can make me run only to you
And be there whenever I fall
I fall and I fall again over you
Anything
Everything you do makes me say
I need you now

Always in time to love me right
Hold me tight
Keep me coming home every night for you
Ain't nobody gonna change my mind
Don't think twice
I've been looking for you all my life

Baby, how did I survive all this time
Without you?
Without you, you, you
Without you

And I don't ever wanna let you go
(I'll do anything, anything, anything, anything)
To show you are the only one I love
Without you, you, you
Without you

You and me and me
Can we start a family?
We made it official, baby
Oh
With me and you

Every night I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that you're laying next to me
I didn't think it was possible
But loving you brings out the best in me, baby

I'll always take the time to love you right
Hold you tight
Keep you coming home every night
For you

Ain't nobody gonna change my mind
Don't think twice
I've been waiting all my life for you, baby

Got me wondering
How did you survive all this time
Without you?
Without you, you, you
Without you
(I'll do anything, anything, anything, anything)
