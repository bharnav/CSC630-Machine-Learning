La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, oh

I kinda feel like time is passing us by
But it's killing me to leave you 'lone
Cry all day long
Baby I'm so sure that we belong
Look in my eyes, they never lie

I see it so clear right now
I'm riding shotgun, we're headed there
If I should disappear right now
You wouldn't notice it or care
Not at all!

Baby you don't see nothing
You must be blind, out your mind, out your something
I see us so clearly, it's like twenty-twenty
I see us in love, like the people on TV
I see us in 3D I see us in 3D
I see us together, it looks like forever
I see us in love, now don't it look better?
In 3D

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la ooh

Lately it seems like you don't even try
I feel you wanna be left alone (like I did something wrong)
Baby come back to my door (door)
You'll feel so close in my sight (oh I, oh I, oh I)
Open your eyes

I see it so clear right now
I'm riding shotgun, we're headed there
If I should disappear right now
You wouldn't notice it or care (Notice me or care)
Not at all!

Baby you don't see nothing
You must be blind, out your mind, out your something
I see us so clearly, it's like twenty-twenty
I see us in love, like the people on TV
I see us in 3D I see us in 3D
I see us together, it looks like forever
I see us in love, now don't it look better?
In 3D

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la oh

Baby I can see us from a mile away
(Cause love is right in front of my face)
And it's so close I can touch it
Oh baby give us a chance
We will see

Baby you don't see nothing
You must be blind, out your mind, out your something
I see us so clearly, it's like twenty-twenty
I see us in love, like the people on TV
I see us in 3D I see us in 3D
I see us together, it looks like forever
I see us in love, now don't it look better?
In 3D

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
