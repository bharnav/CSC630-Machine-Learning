I tried to be a good woman
But it wasn't good enough
But I did everything for you, baby
The pleasure was all mine

But I know things are different
The proof is in your eyes
'Cause I don't see the fire

It's time
Time to move in
(Time to move on)
When the love is gone
Oh, yeah

I tell you it's time
Time to move on
When the love is gone
Oh

Now when we used to argue
At least you used to look at me
Oh
But see
Now we lay next to each other
And we don't even speak

Boy, I cry
While you act like nothing's wrong
And you know it's wrong
But there's no need in pointing fingers
Love has left us both, both, both, both

It's time, time to move in
(Time to move on)
When the love is gone
Oh, yeah

Gotta tell you it's time
Time to move on
When the love is gone oh, yeah yeah

God knows I try
(Yes, I try)
Try to make it last

God knows I try
(Yes, I try)
Try my very best
And I know you know

I say it's time
It's time to move on
Oh, oh, oh
(Time to move on)
When the love is gone
Oh, I had to let him go
And I'm happy about it now

I tell you it's time
Time to move on
When the love is gone
Said it's time to move on
When the love is gone
