Give me your hand, boy
Rest yourself
Put your head on my shoulders
I'll be your help

I know everybody says
That we can't be scared
But you don't have to be strong right now
No
You can shed a tear

So baby
Cry
If you want now
You can cry
Put your pride aside
Cause it's just you and I
Baby, it's alright
You can go and cry

And it's okay
I know it's hard
Cause it's never easy, no
Letting down your guard
But rest assured
I'll always be here
You don't have to worry, no
Baby, shed a tear

So baby
Cry
If you want now
You can cry
Put your pride aside
Cause it's just you and I
Baby, it's alright
You can go and cry

And I'll be there, baby
Baby, it's hardly breathing
So let me do
Do what I came for

Came for
Came for you and me
I'll be there
(I'll be)
I'll be oh, oh

Baby, you can cry
I said to put your pride aside
Baby, it's alright
You know you can cry
You can come and cry
