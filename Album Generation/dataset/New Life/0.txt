Hello?
Hey, Mary
Oh what's going on, sis?
Nothing
Just thinking

Man, gotta pack up my yesterdays
But sometimes
You gotta remember where you came from
To see exactly where you're going
Yeah

You are a great mother
A great friend
A great wife
And when you have a man that loves you as you do
And two children that adore you
And a mother that is always there for you
Uh, huh
You have a blessed life
God is with you everywhere you go
And He loves you

Yeah, you're right
You know what to do
Just enjoy your new life

I'm packing up my yesterdays
And I won't look back
No, no, no
Come too far from all of that
(All of that)

Won't look back
(Won't look)
Won't look back
(Won't look)
You know I gotta stay on track

(Oh, I gotta stay on track)
Won't look back
(Won't look back)
Come too far from all of that
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Life
New, new, new, new, new
New life
Gotta embrace my new life
