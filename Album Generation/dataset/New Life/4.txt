[Verse 1:]
Gave you a chapter of my life
Wish that I could rewrite
All the sh** that was done in the dark
Probably came to lie

Ten years I was with you
I remember everything you put me through
And I think that I'm the blame
For thinking you would change

[Chorus:]
I made the biggest mistake
Biggest mistake
To think that you would change
You would change
Saying bye bye what was this all for

Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
Oh

[Verse 2:]
You can go and run to her
Cause I don't wanna see your face
It reminds me of the sky that can't be arranged

This isn't an empty road
Constantly remind me of you
And I think that I'm no blame
For thinking you would change

[Chorus:]
I made the biggest mistake
Biggest mistake
To think that you would change
You would change
Saying bye bye what was this all for

Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
Oh
No, no, no, no

[Bridge:]
I'm saying goodbye
To all the memories
I regret even try to give you a chance

I'm not perfect
Everybody makes mistakes
But the one I made
I made of choosing you after all we've been through

Now, now, now

[Chorus:]
That I've made the biggest mistake
Biggest mistake
To think that you would change
You would change
Saying bye bye what was this all for

Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
Made no mistake
You won't be my mistake no more
