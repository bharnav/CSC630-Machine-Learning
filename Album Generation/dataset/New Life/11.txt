What a blessing it is
To realize that the only thing
That can keep me from my destiny is me
So I got out of my own way
Now I'm seeing better days
Trust and believe
That you can be

Won't look back
Won't look back
(Just believe)
I've come too far all of that

(New life)
Won't look back
Won't look back
(Stay strong)
Cause I know
I gotta stay on track

(Hold on)
Won't look back
Won't look back
Come too far all of that

(New life)
Don't look back
(New life)
New, new, new
New life
