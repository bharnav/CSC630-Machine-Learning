She was cold and all alone
Hadn't been there long
And didn't know what to say

So she sat in the corner of the room
She figured if she didn't move
No one would notice her

Underneath a winter's sky
Her eyes were bright
Tonight would be her night

A boy, he spotted her from afar
He too understood and felt her pain
Unsure of what to do and lacking in imagination
He said hello

Underneath a winter's sky
Her eyes were bright
Tonight he finds her
Underneath a winter's moon
The last we saw of her, it came too soon

Underneath a winter's sky
Her eyes were bright
Tonight he finds her
Underneath a winter's moon
The last we saw of her, it came too soon
