I don't want to fall in love
I don't want to see the stars up above in the sky
I just wanna catch your eye
I don't want to be wined and dined
I just want to bump and grind with you here tonight
Because you move so right

And we Dance (Dance)
And we move a little closer
Dance (Dance)
Oh yeah with a shuffle motion
Dance (Dance)
And we move a little closer. Touch a little tighter
Eyes a little brighter

Because it's not love
But it's still a feeling
No it's not love
But my body's reeling
To move closer next to you

I don't want to hold your hand
I don't want to go walking in the sand every day
So won't you come out to play?
And I don't care what people say
I don't care what your friends will think anyhow
'Cos you've got me here right now

And we Dance (Dance)
And we move a little closer
Dance (Dance)
Oh yeah with a shuffle motion
Dance (Dance)
And we move a little closer
Touch a little tighter
Eyes a little brighter

Because it's not love
But it's still a feeling
No it's not love
But my body's reeling, To move closer next to you
To move closer next to you
To move closer next to you
To move closer next to you
To move closer next to you
