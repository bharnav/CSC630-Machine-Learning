The shadowy darkness
Of a black painted room
Had been my inspiration
Sunshine, glow of her short blond hair
Was a bit of love's temptation

People come and people go
(Lord)
Time, alas, does too
(Baby, no matter)
Now we've gone our separate ways
In search of someone new

The lamp from the ceiling
The bed on the floor
The place I hung my clothes
The beautiful dreams of music and love, girl
I love you, heaven knows

People come
(Girl)
And people go
(Yeah)

Time, alas, does too
(Girl, yes it is)
Now we've gone our separate ways
In search of someone new

Yeah, but while I speak low
Low deep inside
I hear a voice begin
(Yeah)

Saying fare thee well
Goodbye, my love
(Lord)
Hope we meet again
Said bye bye, baby
Bye bye, bye bye, baby

Yeah, so long, baby
I'm sayin', "Goodbye, girl"
It's been nice
(Yeah)
Yeah good, baby
Man, I love ya

Bye bye, bye bye
