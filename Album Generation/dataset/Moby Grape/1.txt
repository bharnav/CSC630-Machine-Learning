Dawn to dawn, a lifetime
The birds sing and days begin
The heavens shine from dawn to dusk
With golden rays of sun

People on their way
Beginning a brand new day
I love hearing people say
"It's a beautiful day today"

People in the streets
Rushin' everywhere
Movin' fast and how I know
They've got to get somewhere

People on their way
Beginning a brand new day
I love hearing people say
"It's a beautiful day today"

From dawn to dawn, a lifetime
The birds sing and days begin
The heavens shine from dawn to dusk
With golden rays of sun

People on their way
Beginning a brand new day
I love hearing people say
"It's a beautiful day today"

I love hearin' people say
"It's a beautiful day today"
I love hearin' people say
"It's a beautiful day today"
