I wanna know where I'm going
You ain't going nowhere
We don't care
You ain't going nowhere

Why do you listen the meaning?
You got nothing to say
When she gave me your love
Yeah, I take it away

I don't care, she don't care
We don't care, we don't care
You can take everything
And throw it away

Takes so much time
Takes no time at all
I'm gonna walk the line
We're gonna watch you fall

I'm shining through today
See what you want to see
I wanna know where I'm going
You ain't going nowhere

I don't care, she don't care
We don't care, we don't care
You can take everything
And throw it away

Where's this place I'm staying
You ain't staying nowhere
Step inside my line
What do you think I did?

I'm gonna save the world
We got time to play
I'm gonna save the day
We're gonna see it hang
