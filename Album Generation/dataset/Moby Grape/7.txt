If you'd seen the naked dream
I had of you
Would you care
And come through

Take me far away
My wiles and mind can't beat a dream of death today
Hard to get by
When what greets my eye takes my breath away

In my dream you are around the stars
I watched your walls all fall away
You were [bare] of thoughts, we were to part
And [we] stayed that way

Some try to hide
Because they lied
They were not true
And they were afraid

They refuse to see
Or be free, be one with me
And to gods, they prayed
Cryin', "Save me, save me!"
Save me, save me, save me!
I'll save you, can I spend you?

And now this naked dream
I had of you
Will you care
And come through

Take me far away
My wiles and mind can't beat a dream of death today
Hard to get by
When what greets my eye takes my breath away

Cryin', "Save me, save me, save me!"
