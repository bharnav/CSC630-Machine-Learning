They called me a weiner
I called them a nerd
Called her a whore
And she called me a turd
I called her long distance
She said I's absurd
Not a discouraging word
On the range could be heard
And he asked me
"How does it feel?"
Come a-ti-yi-yippie-yippie-yippie-yay, o-lo-lo-lo-leee
Oh, don't you cry for me
I started playing on somebody's amp
Lasted me all through the night
Some cowboy grabbed that hay lady's snatch
Said "If you have her stamped, it's all right"
And I'm tired of being treated this way
Been used, abused, I'll be long gone
Don't try to find me
Just watch for the stage I'll be on
Ran out of money 'bout six months ago
Been livin' on cactus and plants
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout killin' my cow
But I hear that they're gods and thou shall not kill
And you ask me
"How does it feel
When your best friend is all veal
And you're hungry?"
They try to tell you on radio show
And on the TV screen
Nothin' these days seems make much sense
So, oh, vo-dee-o-do
I'm tired of being treated this way
Been used, abused, I'll be long gone
Don't try to find me
Just watch for the stage I'll be on
Along with this record a plan of attack
Ride up to you with a gun at your back
And we invite you to purchase our side
As you watch, on our ass, as we ride
And I'm tired of being treated this way
Been used, abused, I'll be long gone
Don't try to find me
Just watch for the stage I'll be on
