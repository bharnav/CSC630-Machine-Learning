We will meet down in the valley
Where it is hot, even in the shade
We will drink of love's sweet nectars
And we'll dream of plans we made
Well, if you ask me, will I love you
If you ask me, how will I know?
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
We'll meet again, again at sunset
High up on the hill
I'll be sitting, just a-wishing
As a lonely whippoorwill
If you ask me, will I love you
If you ask me, how will I know?
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
We will meet up there in heaven
When life has passed us by
Now I don't know, I don't know what's up there
Beyond the clear blue sky
But if you ask me, will I love you
If you ask me, how will I know?
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
I'll just look into your eyes and touch your soul
Just touch your simple soul
