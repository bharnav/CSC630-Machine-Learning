There's a bitter wind in Tanganyika
And it keeps on blowing 'cross my mind
There's a bitter wind in Tanganyika
As I sit here and try to unwind

Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round

There's a bitter wind in Tanganyika
As I sit here with a smile on my face
There's a bitter wind in Tanganyika
As I sit here, the same old place

Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round
Better watch, your messing 'round
