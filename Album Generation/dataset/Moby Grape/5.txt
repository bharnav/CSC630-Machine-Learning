What's to choose?
If you need of me and know I can't refuse
What to lose?
If I spend a while with you and don't remain
What's to gain?

Should I turn away and wait, I just delay
What's to say?
I can't sit outside and watch us all get turned
Unconcerned

What's to hide?
I've been away so long it seems I can't decide
What's inside?
And if I'm left with just a love you can't reclaim
What's to blame?
