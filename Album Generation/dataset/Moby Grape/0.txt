Never doubting
Always faithful
She returns

She says she loves me
And I could always
Come to her

She can't imagine how
Another lover
Could make her turn

And I'm so grateful
I'm still willing
To have her home

I'm so grateful
I'm still willing
To have her home

She says she loves me
She won't forget me
And then she's gone

She thinks that later
We could pick up the pieces
And carry on

And I forgive her
Never suspecting
She could be wrong

And I'm so grateful I'm
No longer willing
To have her home

I'm so grateful I'm
No longer willing
To have her home
