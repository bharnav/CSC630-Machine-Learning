Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da
Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da

You have to stay in a hotel because your house was falling to pieces
You left your luggage in the hallway and a thief ran away with it (he ran away with it)
His excuse was boredom, tell me how bored you have to be
And I promise you won't be bored, when it gets to the point that you're finished with me

Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, (Areeeea) dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da
Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, (Areeeea) dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da

You have to buy an alarm, the lasers pick up movements in the dark
It's better than a dog bark, it guarantees so you can be secure at night, (area area area area)
Your area's in ruin, Your area's in... ruin (area), Your area is free (area)
When it gets to the point that you're finished with me
When it gets to the point that you're finished with me and all the first are ready

Very certain that she has to go, where do you come from, what do you know?

Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, (Areeeea) dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da
Duh-der-dum, duh-der-dum, duh-der-dem, duh-deh-dam, (Areeeea) dah-der-dem, dah-der-dem, dah-der-dum, dah-der-dum, da

The doors have metal plates, fitted to the inside of the exit alleys to the front gates
Security's expensive, it can cost a fortune if you buy your locks (duh-doo-doo) from the wrong place (duh-doo-doo)
It's the area dis-ger-race
It's the area dis-ger-race
It's the area disra-hey-hey-haaaace

(Area's in ruin, area's in ruin!)

Ruuuuin! Ruuuuin! Haa-ha!

When it gets to the point that you're finished with me and all the first are ready

Very certain that she has to go
Very certain that she has to go
Very certain that she has to go

Where do you come from, what do you know?
