Natural disaster brought us together
In the name of science let me go
This town was built with honest labour
Sometimes it's all that people know

You could help us out

Would you help us out, would anybody help us out?
Would you help us out, could anybody help us out?

Children play at doctors and nurses
Grown men work at pest control
Have you lost all of your senses?
Leading the way is all about taking control

You could help us out

Would you help us out, would anybody help us out?
Would you help us out, could anybody help us
Out, out, out, out

You never help us out
You never help us out
You never help us out
You never help us out

Banks are broken, the shops are looted
Science warned this was bound to happen
Water in every quarter
All the world is waiting for action

You could help us out

Would you help us out, could anybody help us out?
Would you help us out, could anybody help us
Out, out, out, out
