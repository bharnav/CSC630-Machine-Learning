Many times we'd help each other out, favours for favours is nothing new
You're asking me to use my fingertips, what I'm sculpting and moulding isn't you
These may seem like stupid words, only two more that you've heard
Everybody's looking for their saving grace, in their race to find a place

I was watching through the window, you were going through the dances
I've been writing all of it down, I'll be taking all my chances
This always seems to happen

There's something that you do, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I just can't help myself (ahh ahhh ahhhh!)
And I wish that I could move more in time with you

I've watched you step and I've watched you turn, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I've watched you move like a knife in the water, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
Watched you move across the floor, over to me, (for all to see)

Now you're asking what it is I want, half a chance to dance with you
With a little time to work it out, I know the results could astonish you

I was watching through the window, you were going through the dances
I've been writing all of it down, I'll be taking all my chances
This always seems to happen

Theres something that you do, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I just can't help myself (ahh ahhh ahhhh!)
And I wish that I could move more in time with you

I've watched you step and I've watched you turn, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I've watched you move like a knife in the water, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
Watched you move across the floor, over to me, for all to see

Favours for favours (repeated in the background)

Theres something that you do, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I just can't help myself (ahh ahhh ahhhh!)
And I wish that I could move more in time with you

I've watched you step and I've watched you turn, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
I've watched you move like a knife in the water, (ahhhh ahh ahhh!)
Watched you move across the floor, over to me, (for all to see)
