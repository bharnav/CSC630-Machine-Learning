Cut down in their prime
In silence, on that day
February '58, they got what they need
From Belgrade and back home to sleep

More than a name, to millions
What could have been changed
By all the boys leaving Munich on that day
The snow came and sent them to sleep

(This, fall, was, greater than them all)
News and tributes come leaking in (in)
As all eyes turn to Europe
I'd forgotten the sadness in (in)
The voices that turn us to stewards

Cut down in their prime

February '58, they got what they need
From Belgrade and back home to sleep

(This, fall, was, greater than them all)
News and tributes come leaking in (in)
As all eyes turn to Europe
I'd forgotten the sadness in (in)
The voices that turn us to stewards
They're still singing despite the years (years)
Sending them back into Europe
There's a ringing in the ears (ears)
That lasts from here to Newark

News and tributes
(Leaking in
Leaking in
Leaking in)
