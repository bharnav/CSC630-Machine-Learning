A genius mind went to war and lost
He won the battle but he lost his trust in us
How big a price will he have to pay?
How big a price will we make him pay to us?

A million moves but the couldn't see one
Too many thoughts to play for fun
He had to think, he had to concentrate
He had to think, he had to concentrate for us

We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose

He had disposed of them all before
Unrivalled wealth on the road to war
He didn't care what he did to them
His only thought was how and when to win

All alone with his thoughts and fears
He alone knew the price would come in years
He had to think, he had to concentrate
He had to organise his mind and thoughts for us

We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose

The battle won he never fought again
He knew himself there was nothing left to win
Unequipped for the fight within
All he knew was the game and how to win

We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot cannot lose

We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot lose
We cannot cannot lose
