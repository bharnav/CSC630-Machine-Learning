Into a featureless face, they carve a smile
Time wasting style, of their own
Hurry up, we're losing faith
You have to use your face
Don't let them lose your face

She is a great, believer in fate
She gets upset, when we're not
Come on, we're losing faith
She has to use her face
Don't let her lose her face

(Face)
(Face)

Into a featureless face, they carve a smile
Time wasting style, of their own
Hurry up, we're losing faith
You have to use your face
Don't lose your face

She is a great, believer in fate
She gets upset, when we're not
Come on, she's losing faith
She has to use her face
Don't let her lose her face
She's losing faith
She's losing faith
She's losing faith
She's losing faith
(Woooww!!)
