If we have to fallout, we should fallout together
'cause we'll have to find a shelter
And stay in the shelter, it's safe in the shelter
The fall was hard, the fall was hard
The out was in....visable to you
What a miserable excuse

After days in the dark
Light broke through
And it was difficult to see you, (See see, you you, see see, you you, you you you you you you you you)
And sat in the warm with you

You put me down with your thumb
I can see clearly that you point towards sorrow
But the fingers point at me
We're gonna fall out tomorrow

The morning arrives, the morning arrives
As the night falls down
The shelter is in darkness
And the outside is in shock

After days in the dark
Light broke through
And it was difficult to see you, (See see, you you, see see, you you, you you you you you you you you)
And sat in the warm with you
After days in the dark
Light broke through
And it was difficult to see you, (See see, you you, see see, you you, you you you you you you you you)
And sat in the warm with you

(You you you you you you you you)

(You you you you you you you you)
