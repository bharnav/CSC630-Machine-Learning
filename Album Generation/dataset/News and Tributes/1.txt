He's the centre of attention, everywhere he goes
Loud noises, keep it up, he's a man that everybody knows
But he ruins everytime, because he tries too hard
But he ruins everytime, because he tries too hard

He's the master, of defences, every angle covered by smoke
He used to be handsome, he changed and his friends couldn't cope
He's the centre of attention, everywhere he goes
Loud noises, keep it up, he's a man that everybody knows

How, dare, you
How, dare, you
How, dare, you
How, dare, you

(Ahhhhhh, Oohhh, Ahhhhh, Ohhhh, Ahhhhhhh, Ohhhh, Ahhhhhhh, Ohhhh)

We make it
We make it
We make it hard for you to (cope)
We make it
We make it
We make it hard for you to (cope)
We make it
We make it
We make it hard for you to (cope)
We make it
We make it
We make it hard for you

How, dare, you
How, dare, you
How, dare, you
How, dare, you

(Ahhhhhh, Oohhh, Ahhhhh, Ohhhh, Ahhhhhhh, Ohhhh, Ahhhhhhh, Ohhhh)
