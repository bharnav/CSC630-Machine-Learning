On the way to Oklahoma, I turned into a cat
My true love was a Tiger, I'm sure you can see that
I called the tiger Dolly, it was my mother's name
On the way to Oklahoma I finally became sane

On the way to Oklahoma, a voice inside my mind
Demanding that my senses expanded space and time
The voice revealed a feeling of heated ecstasy
On the way to Oklahoma, I peed upon a tree

On the way to Oklahoma, I needed to eat meat
So I attacked a dog who was sleeping in the heat
While eating in the sunshine a pleasant thing occurred
On the way to Oklahoma I licked myself and purred

(chorus)
On the way to Oklahoma, his split became complete
Reality had faded, his fantasy complete
The world he had constructed, from felines and despair
On the way to Oklahoma, became as clear as air
