Old Woman:
What have my chickens done now

Young Girl:
She took a mouse out of a pouch
And made me put it in my mouth

5 Sisters:
We call out her name
And beg for a shaming

Young Girl:
She made me spit and shake and scream
She made me make myself unclean

Old Woman:
She calls out my name
But I'm not to blame, but
Maybe my chickens know how

Old Woman:
I don't know why she told on me
I'm sick and sad and eighty three

Young Girl
I knew when I named her
The devil had claimed her

Old Woman:
It must be my chickens somehow

They accused my daughter and
Scratched her on the face and hand

They bite their toungues and bear their teeth
Then they scratch me til I bleed

5 Sisters:
As long as she remains
We will keep her in pain

I know her chickens are foul

Old Woman:
I know I'm not to blame
But I'm tired of the bloodstains
I have to find a way out
Under stress I did confess
Just to make them stop, I guess
What can my chickens do now?

5 Sisters:
We knew if named her
God would not claim her

Old Woman:
My pain was in vain
For they were all against me

5 Sisters:
Around her neck they tied a noose
And they killed her family, too

Young Girl:
Only her chickens know now
