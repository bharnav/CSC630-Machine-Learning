Sleeping deeply in the blood
It turns my memories to mud
And gnaws inside me like a dog
Whose leg is caught beneath a log
It eats itself until it's free
But I'll eat them instead of me

HUNGER! ANGER!
HUNGER! ANGER!
HUNGER! ANGER!
HUNGER! ANGER!

PLEASE SOMEBODY! BURN MY BONES!
PLEASE SOMEBODY! BURN MY BONES!
PLEASE SOMEBODY! BURN MY BONES!
And leave the ashes in the snow
