He wasn't dreaming
When he started screaming
"He touched my penis
And it went away"

Removing his pants, he
Held in his hand, the
Shriveled up gland, he
Said was a fake

"He silently traded
Mine for this hated
Lump that is shaded
Olive and gray"

Pointing his finger
Right at the stranger
He said that the danger
Will escalate

Unless we kill it
Torture and spill its
Blood without guilt, it
Won't go away

The stranger was shocked when
Rocks began flocking
Around him knocking
His senses away

Like a mad hound he
Was pounded and pounded
'Til he was dead
