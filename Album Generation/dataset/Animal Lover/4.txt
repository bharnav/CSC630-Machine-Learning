When I think about my father
I see a silver ship
Sailing on the oceans of nirvana
When I think about my father
On his sad and lonely trip
I wonder if he misses me and mama

When I think about my father
I see someone who's sick
Of breathing life into a lost persona

When I went to see my father
I was his only friend
No one knew he was a lonely soldier
When I went to see my father
He was bitter at the end
When the wind was a blowing so much bolder
I went to see my father
Who was dying to pretend
The emptiness of life would soon be full of him

I went to see my father growing colder
