I see him when I'm dreaming
His teeth are white and bare
He's riding on a stallion
The wind is in his hair
If he were made of china
He'd have a special stand
Beside my china ponies
I love the monkey man

I wake up every morning
And smell his golden hair
He stands outside my window
And watches me with care
He smiles at all my ponies
And dances when he can
I'll look for him tomorrow
I love the monkey man

Monkey Man
Monkey Man
Monkey Man
Monkey Man
