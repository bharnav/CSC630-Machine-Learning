The Whispering boys will not go away
The Whispering boys have nothing to say
But they scream and they cry
And they run and they hide
From their bodies

The Whispering Boys have answered the call
The Whispering Boys surrender their all
To the blame and the blood
Of an albino dove
Made of love

The Whispering Boys are perfect and pure
The Whispering Boys are sacred and sure
And sometimes they are known
To take children whose homes
Are unknown

The Whispering Boys, they stay out of sight
The Whispering Boys, they meet late at night
But they bond to their fate
And they're saved when they
Self mutilate
