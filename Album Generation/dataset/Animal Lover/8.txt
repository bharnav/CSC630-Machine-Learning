Leave your burdens behind
Leave your burdens behind
Let your spirit be
Free from gravity
Leave your burdens behind

God is waiting for you
God is waiting for you
There's no need to be
In uncertainty
God is waiting for you

Once I was exactly like you
An empty vessel on full view
I thought that there was no other way
I thought the thoughts you think today

My wife was sinister and unclean
My children were morose and mean
My discontentment was so complete
My mind retreated into sleep

Love will live in repose
Love will live in repose
Let your leisure zone
Be your cornerstone
Love will live in repose

But soon a voice inside of a dream
Said "Son you can become My Cream,"
With words that echoed in me God said
"White people should remain in bed."

Take a load off your feet
Take a load off your feet
Turn your misery
Into ecstasy
Take a load off your feet

We will give it to you
We will give it to you
Sleep is purified
Sweet and sanctified
So we'll give it to you
