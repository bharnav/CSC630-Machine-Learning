Dead men are staring up at angels
Dead men are staring at the ground
Dead men have little inspiration
Dead men just like to lie around
Dead men were reaching out to glory
But nothingness is all they found

Heroes always go to heaven
Heroes never die in vain
Heroes always speak the truth and
Heroes never explain

Dead men are only in the way
Dead men are only in the way
Dead men are only in the way
Dead men are only in the way
