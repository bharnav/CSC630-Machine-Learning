[Intro]
Heeeeeeeeeeyyyyyy

[Verse 1]
I think it's turning back around
And I think I like it
I think it's turning back around
Though I don't know why it is
I think it's turning back on me
I'm down on the upside
I think it's turning back on me
Now I'm the good ride

[Chorus 1]
And nothing's going to put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around

[Chorus 2]
I think it's coming on the wind
Just like you said it
I think it's coming on the wind
And I'm going to let it

[Verse 2]
I think it's turning back on me
Everything's easy
I think it's turning back on me
Everything's real to me

[Chorus 1]
And nothing's going to put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around

[Chorus 2]
I think it's coming on the wind
Just like you said it
I think it's coming on the wind
And I'm going to let it

[Chorus 1]
And nothing's going to put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around

[Outro]
Turning back around
