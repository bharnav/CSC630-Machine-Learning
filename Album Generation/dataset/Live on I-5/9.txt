[Intro]
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the one thing

[Verse 1]
Someone said my words are out of balance
Nothing to say, you've got nothing to say
Dying words I bury everyday
Nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
Nothing but the one thing

[Chorus]
You've got nothing, nothing to say
Nothing but the one thing

[Verse 2]
Big bad word spell it with four letters
Nothing to say, you've got nothing to say
Oh my god, your words are out of balance
Nothing to say, you've got nothing to say
Nothing but the one thing
Nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
You've got nothing, nothing to say
Nothing but the one thing

[Outro]
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
