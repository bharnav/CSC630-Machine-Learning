Do you, 'cause you want it to like you?
Coming down fast but don't ever break you, hey
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
'Cause you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
You ain't no dancer

Do you, don't you want it to like you? Yeah
Coming down fast but don't let them break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
'Cause you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ah, hey
