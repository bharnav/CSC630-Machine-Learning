[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in a magic hat with smoke and mirrors
And tire rubber fires watch me disappear, yeah
What made it slow you down sucking on a ball and chain
Another motherfucker goes down the drain, yeah

[Chorus] [x2]
Hard headed fuck you all [x3]
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

[Verse 2]
Sick in the head sick in the mouth
Can't hear a word you say not a bit and I don't give a shit, yeah
Got a big glass, I got the steel, I got everything
All I need is your head on a stake, yeah

[Chorus] [x6]

[Outro]
Go, go
