[Verse 1]
I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now
Oh Yeah
I just looked in the mirror
Things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California
And feeling Minnesota

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you know, who gets mystified
So now you know, who gets mystified

[Chorus]
Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies
Gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Hey, I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined
Outshined
Outshined
Outshined

Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shedding
Oh yeah
I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking
I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you know, who gets mystified
So now you know, who gets mystified

[Chorus]
Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies
Gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Hey, I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined
Outshined
Outshined
Outshined

Oh yeah
Outshined
Oh, oh, oh
So now you know, who gets mystified

[Chorus]
Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah it gives me the butterflies
Gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling
I'm feeling

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah it gives me the butterflies
Gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again

I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined
Outshined
Outshined
Outshined
