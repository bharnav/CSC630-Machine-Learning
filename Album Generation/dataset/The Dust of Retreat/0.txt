Do what you like, you don't have to be nice
Just pour yourself a cup of coffee
Leave anytime, you don't have to be right
You've gotta live the best you know how

And if you love, well that should be enough
Instead it turns your joy into sorrow
And I can't breath, with the dust of retreat
I'm choking on the fumes of my wayward back

My woman lied, she was a witch in disguise
And she dressed her wounds in sack cloth and ashes
The children weep, at their dead mother's feet
Her husband's drunk, a wolf in a sheep's skin

And when we kissed, it didn't feel poisonous
And when you cried, I dried off your blue eyes
She smiles at me, as she is falling asleep
Says, "We gotta live the best we know how to."
