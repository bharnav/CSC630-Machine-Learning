I am alive
I am alive
And that is the best that i can do

You told me you lied
You swore you were mine
I took you back a thousand times

Talk of the town
You've been around
If he is the man you want then go

But tonight we'll leave
All our lovers behind
And try to live a quiet life
My love has dressed me like a clown

You are an asp
A snake in the grass
Vanity seeps from out your pores

And baby it's time
To pay for my crime
Nothing i say can make you mine

You either sing it in key
Or run into me
I can fake it as good as you

But tonight we'll leave
All our stupid songs
We'll drive and reach the hills by dawn
My love has dressed me like a clown

Tonight we'll leave
All our lovers behind
And try to live a quiet life
Margot, you dress me like a clown

Tonight we'll drink
Into an early grave
We'll laugh, but we will never be saved
Someone has dressed us all like clowns

Darling it's sin
Where do i begin?
Putting the contact lenses in

You say the lights
Scurry like mice
Reflecting the streets in your blue eyes

Out on the roof
Waiting for love
Turn me around and lock me up

Baby you are an asp
A snake in the grass
Vanity oozes out your pores

Oooh, ooooh
Oooh, ooooh
