Jen is bringing the drugs
She wants to get real fucked up
She used to laugh and smile
But the years of denial
Have taken their toll on her dial

But, me, I do as I please
I caught you and set you free
Cause I have been left alone by the people I've known
And I don't know when they're coming home

And Jen don't wanna be seen
But I saw her in a swank magazine
She had an airbrushed face
But the lines of distaste
Were crossed without crossing of legs

And I don't wanna be found
So when you get home
I'm skipping town
I'm leaving to go someplace
Where nobody will have any clue where I am

And Jen is bringing the drugs
She's gonna get me fucked up
Cause love is an inkless pen
It's a tavern, it's sin
It's a horrible way to begin
