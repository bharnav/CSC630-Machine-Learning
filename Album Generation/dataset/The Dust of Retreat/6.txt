On a freezing Chicago street we shook
Your hands were trembling from all those pills you took
And we got drunk on cheap red wine in a paper cup

And I was barely awake when you got home
And climbed yourself into bed wearing cheap perfume
And Sarah screamed your every breath is a gift
If you weren't so selfish than you might want to live

So if your lover should leave don't get too sad
And don't compose epic poems to win her back
Cause when your bird has flown, she'll never return home
Though all your life you'll wait she never will return
