Tourists rob you of your home
In sunken boats
You can hide quiet as a mouse
But they'll find you out

When she asked me, "Why have you felt so down and out?
You can stay with me at my house."

When I woke my back was broke from lying on the floor
Sunlight poured through all the cracks in my front door
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

Tourists robbed me of my child
They smoked him out
He was draft dodging some war
Until they found him out

He came home late in the night
To his mom and me
And he said, "Times they gotta change
But so do we."

When I woke I was alive in somebody's room
I felt life and love and hope infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you

When I woke my body was dying all over the floor
I felt apathy and hate infested my bones
Wake up you've got a lot of things to do
Wake up the sun is rising without you
