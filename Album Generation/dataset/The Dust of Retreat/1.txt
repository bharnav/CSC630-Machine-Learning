I did a sick, sick thing to my love
My lack of loyalty, it swallowed her up
And she cooked me food
She squirmed and turned
Like a skeleton key
She left her man and attended to me

And don't call me that
Don't claim you love me
Cause you know that ain't true
My dire affliction I'll attribute to you

And you're finally free
To twist and turn
Like a skeleton key

You've gotta let me know
You've gotta let me know

I did a horrible thing to that girl
I bred my misery and drowned it in her
And she got me high
And I hardly noticed there were tears in her eyes

And I miss you less and less everyday
This stream of whisky's helped to wash you away

And it's clear to see
You're nothing special
You're a skeleton key

You've gotta let me know
You've gotta let me know
You've gotta let me know
You've gotta let me know
