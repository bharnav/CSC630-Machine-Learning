I gotta go
And you're talking in code
Saying "I know where you've been
And I know where you go."

I've been tired from the minute I woke
I stopped listening the moment you spoke
And said I'm long gone
Yeah, I'm long gone

And I'm sleeping alone
In a house I don't own
Cause if you're touring your mind
You'll get lost every time
You'll sing me sad songs to keep me awake
In that bedroom where we hid away
Baby, I'm long gone
Yeah, I'm long gone

And your voice cracks like a piano
You keep moving
But where are you going?
Baby, we're long gone
Yeah, we're long gone
