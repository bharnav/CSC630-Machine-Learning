My paper cat
Has covered my skin in chills

My basement home
Has made me as cold as ice

So meow meow et chantez-moi
Meow meow meow meow meow mija

Meow meow meow meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

My island home
Is gonna be mine quite soon

Your concrete mouth
Is spewing that filth, again

So I'll walk in, shivering
Paws dried up from wandering

Meow meow meow meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

My glass-eyed pet
Is purring 'bout blonde on blonde

That sweet old man
Is gonna be your best friend

So wash your paws, alley cat
Once you're dead, you can't come back

Meow meow meow meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

Meow meow meow meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

Meow meow meow meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
