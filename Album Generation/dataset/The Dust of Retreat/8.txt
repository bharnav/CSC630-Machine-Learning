(Guy yells in the background "Happy New Year!")
She was a night owl
And had 'em like a high school drop out
Her brittle bones were cracking faintly
Her ode to was a lunch time lady

So I can turn back honey, come on back darling
Come on, come on, get back together
Waste your time in the new when I am talking to you
Shut up

She was cooling up from every thing we ever taught her
He said only try to talk when spoken to and believe it's now or never

So I can go back honey, You're folding money
Come on, come on get back together
Prance around in the nude when I am talking to you, shut up
Turn your self in to mush, you're taking it off
Come on get back together
Waste your time in the new when I am talking to you come on

Like a tiger creeping, oh Canada
You dug your teeth in
And this child is gonna walk himself home and nothing is gonna stop his progress
So I can turn back honey, come on back darling, come on, come on get back together
Prance around in the nude when I am talking to you so shut up
Turn your self in to mush, you're taking it off
Come on get back together
Waste your time in the new when I am talking to you, shut up
