Somebody is going to love you
Somebody ought to lay you out

Don't give it away
Cause I need you the most when I'm half of what I was
When I was in your room

Don't pick up the phone
Don't answer the door
Cause those villains want your blood
And they are going to get it

Your mother is a vampire
And she sucked your old man's life away

Turn everything off
And just cover your neck cause life is full of your regrets
And I should be one

Try telling me off
Try slamming the door and tell me I'm not worth your time
Or the breath I'm breathing

Don't throw it away
Oh Calico queen
Cause cause now you're merely a machine
And not a person

Try telling me off
Try slamming the door and telling me I'm not worth your time
Or the breath I'm breathing
