Why can't you see what I am going through?
Why are you screaming at me?
What are you talking about?
I can't hear you and I can't understand when you shout
Why can't you see what you have put me through?
NO! Why are you screaming at me?
What are you talking about?
I can't hear you and I can't understand when you shout

There's Something Witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane

I cannot take your mood swings anymore
You're so abusive
You make me miserable
Throwing things and now it's getting critical
I've had enough, I'm heading for the door
You're so abusive
You make me miserable
Throwing things and now it's getting critical

There's Something Witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane
There's Something Witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane

(Gone gone gone...)So sick and tired
(Gone gone gone...)This ain't a home
(Gone gone gone...)Just one desire
(Gone gone gone...)Just leave me alone

I can't believe that I was gonna stay
It's a hell
You're really gonna need it
So good luck I really do mean it
So glad I moved a million miles away
It's a hell
You're really gonna need it
So good luck I really do mean it

There's Something Witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane
There's Something Witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane
