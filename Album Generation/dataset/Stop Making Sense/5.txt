[Verse 1]
Ah
Watch out
You might get what you're after
Cool, babies!
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

[Verse 2]
Hold tight
Wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight
We're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

[Chorus 1]
Here's your ticket, pack your bag
It's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire
Ah

[Verse 3]
All wet
Here, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown
Dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

[Chorus 2]
It was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work
Say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame
Ah

[Synthesizer Solo]
Burning down the house

[Verse 4]
My house
'S out of the ordinary
That’s right
Don't want to hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

[Chorus 3]
No visible means of support
And you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect
Staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire
Ah

[Instrumental]
