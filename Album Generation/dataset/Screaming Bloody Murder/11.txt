[Verse 1]
Got my back against the wall
Try to scream, there's no sound at all
I'm stuck with nowhere to turn
But I'm trying
Trying hard not to be the one
Left behind to become undone
You can't stop what's already begun
Hear the down and out

[Chorus]
I'm not giving up, I won't let go
Cause' I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough, I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong

[Verse 2]
You stand closer but you're far away
Seems like it's farther everyday
The feelings never go away
But I'm trying
At the end of a losing race
Time passes me without a trace
Trying hard just to find a place
Now that I'm onto you

[Chorus]
I'm not giving up, I won't let go
Cause' I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough, I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong

[Bridge]
Memories, they hold a place
Just in time to go to waste
And they all become replaced

I'm not giving up, I won't let go
Cause' I am back where I belong

[Chorus]
I'm not giving up, I won't let go
Cause' I am here till I'm gone
This time I've had enough, I'm on my own
But I am back where I belong
