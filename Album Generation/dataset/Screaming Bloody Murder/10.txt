[Verse 1]
I don't know what you want and I don't want to know
I got you where I want and I won't let go
So get your kicks out quick while you still got time
That's fine
I know just what you've done, I need no alibis
I hope you've had your fun, you sure know how to lie
Because your just a drag and you just ran out of time
Well, that's quite alright, well

[Chorus 1]
Well, do what you want but don't be proud
Because baby, you don't want to know
What I'm going to do when you're not around
No baby, you don't want to know

[Chorus 2]
I got you right where I want
And I bet you going to set you off
And I tell you anything you want
But baby, you don't want to know[x2]

[Verse 2]
It beats me black and blue but I can't resist
I'm dragging myself through this kind of masochist
But I'll be fine like this till the end of time
That's quite alright

[Chorus 1]
Well, do what you want but don't be proud
Because baby, you don't want to know
What I'm going to do when you're not around
No baby, you don't want to know

[Chorus 2]
I got you right where I want
And I bet you going to set you off
And I tell you anything you want
But baby, you don't want to know[x2]

Baby, you don't want to know[x2]

[Bridge]
It's alright, I don't mind
Cause' you just might be out of time

[Chorus 1]
Well, do what you want but don't be proud
Because baby, you don't want to know
What I'm going to do when you're not around
No baby, you don't want to know

[Chorus 2]
I got you right where I want
And I bet you going to set you off
And I tell you anything you want to hear
Baby, you don't want to know[x2]

But baby, you don't want to know
Baby, you don't want to know
No, no, baby, you don't want to know
