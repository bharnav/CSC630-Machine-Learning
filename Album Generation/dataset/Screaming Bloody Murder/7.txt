[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Take my breath away, I don't need it anyway
Cause I'm fine here in my old forgotten world
Where I can be myself, left with the hand I'm dealt
And it's hard to get a grip when you're holding onto something
You just let slip away

[Chorus]
All these thoughts stuck in my mind
Spinning round like endless time
For once in my life I do wanna feel
Something you call real
I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

[Verse 2]
Here with my old friend, the silence in the end
And it rings so loud that I cannot pretend
If I just close my eyes and ask a thousand whys
Will it change or stay the same? Will it ever go away?
The question still remains

[Chorus]
All these thoughts stuck in my mind
Spinning round like endless time
For once in my life I do wanna feel
Something you call real
I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

[Bridge]
Warning signs read desolation
On the road of desperation
Happiness machines, I'm coming clean
What can you do for me?

[Chorus]
I do wanna feel
Something you call real
I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

Oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
So here now I stand at the end
Of a dark road out of hell
It's not so hard as I depart
What a way to become a man
