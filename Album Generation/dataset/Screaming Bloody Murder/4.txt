[Verse 1]
What am I to say? I'm all wrapped up in apathy
And I don't want to stay this way
There's nothing left to do, now that I am onto you
All I want to know is the truth
And I don't want to go but I feel like I should
Because I'm falling apart and I might and I, and I

[Chorus]
How could you be the better part of me
When we're only half of what we used to be today?
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

[Verse 2]
What am I to say? I still remember everyday
And memories don't fade away
And it all falls apart in the shadows of the past
It can seem to be so hard but it's time the feelings pass

[Chorus]
How could you be the better part of me
When we're only half of what we used to be today?
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
To pull your trigger is now, what you're waiting for?
I stand accused myself, sometimes I'm wrong
God help me and hear beneath my lie, what am I praying for?
I don't believe in hell but I just might be there tonight

[Chorus]
How could you be the better part of me
When we're only half of what we used to be today?
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell
Goodbye, farewell
