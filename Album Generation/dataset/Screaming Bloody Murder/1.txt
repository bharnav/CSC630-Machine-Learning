[Intro]
I'm not quite myself these days
Guess we all come undone time to time in different ways, well
I have myself to blame
Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways

[Verse 1]
God's got a plan for me
Well I'm going to tell you one thing
I don't got the patience, or the time
What can I say
I'm no angel
I'm not forsaken
But I can bleed

[Chorus]
Tear me open I believe
God will send you all to bleed
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!"
We will scream

[Verse 2]
Well I guess it's time for me
Tell me what I'm left to believe in
Cause I don't know the concept of the pain
I don't want the faith, I'll just lose it
I can prove it
Watch me bleed!

[Chorus]
Tear me open I believe
God will send you all to bleed
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!"
We will scream
God will set you up to
Tear me open!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm (Hey!) not giving up (Hey!)
No self-control
Suffocated to the plough
I'm my (Hey!) worst enemy (Hey!)
Who can't be saved
I'm just his disgrace

[Chorus]
Tear me open I believe
God will send you all to bleed
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!"
We will scream
God will set you up to
Tear me open

[Outro]
These days are strange, it's true
There's not a thing that I would change
No mistakes that I'd undo
