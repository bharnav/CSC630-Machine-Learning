[Verse]
There's nothing left to say, yeah
Because you don't want to try
And I don't want the pain
There's nothing left to do, yeah
I don't want the lies
And you don't feel the same
It's time to let you go
And bow out of the game
And maybe we will find
The answers through the blame

[Outro]
It's time for me to go
It's time for me to go, oh
