[Verse 1]
While looking for the answers
Only questions come to mind
Cause' I've been lost in circles
Which seems now for quite some time
And I don't know how I came here
Even how I got this far
All I can tell you is my fate
Is written in the black stars
Well, what am I supposed to do?

[Verse 2]
Bless myself, this perfect hell of my own
Is the best I've ever known
Tell me something I don't want to know
Cause' I can't believe it's so
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
I've become sick of everyone now
And I don't feel remorse for the forgotten
And I don't care at all
I've become sick of everyone now
And I'm the patron voice of all the problems
And I don't care at all

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, take me away
I'm sick of everyone today
I'm not okay, but I'm fine this way
Need no change to take me away
I'm coming down, I fell apart
It's hard to keep together
When you don't know where to start

[Chorus]
I've become sick of everyone now
And I don't feel remorse for the forgotten
And I don't care at all
I've become sick of everyone now
And I'm the patron voice of all the problems
But sick of everyone
