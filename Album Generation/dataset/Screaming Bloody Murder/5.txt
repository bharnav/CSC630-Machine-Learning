[Verse 1]
I don’t believe I think I’m falling asleep
Is this beginning or ending am I stuck in a dream?
I don’t want to know what I think I suppose
Out of the light and into this time of demise
And there’s a cross on the hill the holy image of lies
I’ve opened my mind but this dream is still real

You don’t need to worry I’m just fine, I’ve just lost my mind
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell me it’s over cause I don’t feel a thing at all
No conscience that’s no more, senses all have disappeared
Am I alright, alive tonight?
Paranoid am I too late?
Am I alright alive tonight?
Crash and fall into this light with me

[Verse 3]
Look in my eyes tell me I’m alright
I don’t know if I’m still alive
If this is goodbye
Forever’s just a lie
Big enough to make you wanna try

In just one life how can we live enough to rest in peace
In just one life (just one life)
How can we live enough to rest in peace now

Oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
Here as I stand head in hand and one hand on my heart
As I depart it’s not so hard one day should become a man
You had your scars but I never thought you would give me mine
