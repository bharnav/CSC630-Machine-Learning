[Verse 1]
I don't believe in the secrets you keep
But I do wanna know
How do you sleep at night
And I'm over you, congratulations
Thank you for all the pain
Cause' it made it be so much more fun

[Chorus]
There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (they're dead)
And I don't believe theres a way now
All that is said has been said (has been said)
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes

[Verse 2]
Seen through the lines, while believing the lies
For too long a time
And I still don't know how I did
And now war's declared, drawing the battle lines
And I can't see straight anymore
With all of this blood in my eyes

[Chorus]
There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (they're dead)
And I don't believe theres a way now
All that is said has been said (has been said)
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (they're dead)
And I don't believe theres a way now
All that is said has been said (has been said)
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes
