[Verse 1]
Hold me now cause' I couldn't even if I tried
It's over now, I guess it really is my time
I don't want to go but it's time I got to say goodbye
So hold me now because this will be our last time

[Verse 2]
I'm slowing down and I don't think that I can fight
I know somehow you'll find a way to live your life
Remember just to live everyday like it's your last
And hold me now because I think it's time for me to pass

[Chorus]
I don't want to die, I don't know why
This kind of fate was meant for me
You've got to be strong, got to move on
It's not the way it was supposed to be
What do I say?
It was never supposed to end up this way
What do I have to do?
I was supposed to grow old with you

[Post-Chorus]
But that ain't not going to happen, mmhhmm
No, that ain't going to happen

[Verse 3]
Hold me now because the time I've got is running out
No tears allowed, even though we've become without
I just want to feel your head laying on my chest
So hold me now as I take my last breath

[Chorus]
I don't want to die, I don't know why
This kind of fate was meant for me
You've got to be strong, got to move on
It's not the way it was supposed to be
What do I say?
It was never supposed to end up this way
What do I have to do?
I was supposed to grow old with you

[Post-Chorus]
But that ain't not going to happen, mmhhmm
No, that ain't going to happen
