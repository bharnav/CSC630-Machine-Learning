[Verse 1]
Oh, my love how do I explain
How I've come to feel this way
I'm addicted to the pain
Even more than words can say
Every hit hurts like your kiss
Like a needle to a vein
My last words of this begin
I want you

[Chorus]
She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just want to feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just pain me
Take it very slow
Cause' I'm in love tonight

[Verse 2]
So now that it has come to this
I'll be your dirty little thrill
For the world I wouldn't miss
Cause' I just want to feel your kill
Self-inflicted masochist
How could anyone resist
My last words of this begin
I want you

[Chorus]
She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just want to feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just pain me
Take it very slow
Cause' I'm in love tonight

[Bridge]
Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath
Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath
And all of this comes to an end
But I cannot resist your death

[Chorus]
She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just want to feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just pain me
Take it very slow
Cause' I'm in love tonight

[Chorus]
She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just want to feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just pain me
Take it very slow
Cause' I'm in love tonight
