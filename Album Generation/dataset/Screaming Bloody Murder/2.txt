[Verse 1]
Going in alone, did my time and now I'm done it's so, easy
All the faces that I see don't mean anything at all to me
But you got me going now
Out of my mind and it's, a hell of a time

[Chorus]
I don't want to say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause' it's true
I'd give you all I got but there's nothing there that you could use
But you've got me going now
Out of my mind and it's a hell of a time with you now, yeah

[Chorus] [x2]
I don't want to say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I'll tell you anything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause' it's true
I'd give you all I've got but I'm the only thing you use
So you got me going now

[Chorus] [x2]
I don't want to say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl it's time for you to go
