Down from the mountain
Running wild through the trees
A crystal glimmer
Rolling along so effortlessly

Trickled down from the country
But the city sucked it in and spit it out
Now the gravity pulls you
To the curbside now as it's getting light

And it's too soon too fast
And that ain't ever gonna last

Standing water
Standing to close to the sun
With your rainbow runoff
You're like a sitting duck waiting for the summer rain to come

I was at low-life in the highlands
I was barely living up to the standard and demands
I had run out of reasons to let myself believe in anything
I wanted to phone home so many times but I'm never giving in
You know dreams never die
Woke up in a cold sweat
I was breathing still my heart wasn't open yet
Dried out by the hot sun there's never anywhere to run

Standing water
Standing too close to the sun
With your rainbow runoff
You're like a sitting duck waiting for the summer rain to come

There once was a country
With champagne rivers running wide
There was free land flying
Out the door in the middle of the night

And they were pushing every button
They were paving the way to the blight
They were breaking laws that they made themselves
Dictating what's wrong and what's right

So proud so strong
But that don't mean you're never wrong

It's like standing water
Standing too close to the sun
With your rainbow runoff
You're like a sitting duck waiting for the summer rain to come
