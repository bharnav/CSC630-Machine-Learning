Can we not talk about this
I don't wanna talk about that
So maybe put on some records
And kick back

Cause I'll blow it way out of proportion
Make it loud beyond distortion
Don't ask me now
And please don't ask me later

Cause I am the great exaggerator
Please don't argue
With the great exaggerator

We're so misunderstood
Every little thing's taboo
Sometimes I'm so hard
To talk to

Cause I'll blow it way out of proportion
Make it loud beyond distortion
My mind is bubblin'
Like a percolator

Cause I am the great exaggerator
Please don't disagree
With the great exaggerator

So can we not talk about this
I don't wanna talk about that
Maybe turn on the tv
And kick back

Cause I am the great exaggerator
Don't ask me now
And please don't ask me later

Cause I'll blow it way out of proportion
Make it loud beyond distortion
Please don't argue
With the great exaggerator

Please don't argue
With the great exaggerator
