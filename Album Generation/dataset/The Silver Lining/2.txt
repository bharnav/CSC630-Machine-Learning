Now that you're old enough
And all grown now, tryin' to act so tough
Here comes a slap right in the face

Branding irons and cattle prods
Cowboys everywhere, ropes flyin through the air
Leaves some kind of funny aftertaste

And when the room gets small
And the streets are filled with fighting
You'll find a way to escape
You'll find a better place

Cause it's a crazy mixed up world out there
Someones always got a gun and it's all about money
You live with loneliness or you live with somebody
Who's crazy - It's just a crazy mixed up world

Jet fighters streak the air
And where they're going nobody seems to care
I guess we'll just wait and watch 'em fade

I don't think much about
The things I thought I just couldn't live without
I live without them everyday

And when you just can't handle
One more panhandler
It leaves you wishing for change
A fast car to take you away

It's a crazy mixed up world out there
Someones always got a gun and it's all about money
You live with loneliness or you live with somebody
Who's crazy - It's just a crazy mixed up world

So take your shattered faith
And make it just like new with crazy glue and tape
You're gonna need it again someday
You're gonna need it again
You're gonna need it today

Cause it's a crazy mixed up world out there
Someones always got a gun and it's all about money
You live with loneliness or you live with somebody
Who's crazy - It's just a crazy mixed up world
