Calling you from inside the wire
I'm payin' my dues underneath your tires

Standing out in the middle of traffic
Photographing the crash
Waitin' in line with little old ladies
With a bug up my ass

I wanna live in your car
I'm never going too far

Calling you from inside the wire
I'm payin' my dues underneath your tires

I got a hostage situation
Someone's crackin' the whip
Some are puttin' up a fierce resistance
Some are getting their kicks
Out of the blue and into the fire
I've got no use for being tired

Calling you from inside the wire
I'm payin' my dues underneath your tires
A bus named desire

Now I'm all alone here wainting like I'm buried alive
Gotta crawl my way out maybe if I plan to survive
Born in a zoo, raised in a cage
What's it to you if I break through anyway?

Calling you from inside the wire
I'm payin' my dues underneath your tires
Calling you from inside the wire
I'm payin' my dues underneath your tires
A bus named desire
A bus named desire
A bus named desire
A bus named desire
A bus named desire
