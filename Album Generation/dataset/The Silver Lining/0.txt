You might be right, you might be wrong
You might just think your life has gone on for too long
Your knees get weak and your heart grows cold
And you're tired of doing everthing you're told
And nothing can take away from you
What you take, what you've been through
Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
It won't take long, you can't go wrong
Stand up and be strong

You might have to fight
You might have to cry
You might have to cry
You might have to fight
Stand up und be strong

If you live in the hills, you take too many pills
If you've lost the thrill against your own will
Stand up and be strong

And nothing can take away from you
What you take, well you know what you've got to do

Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
It won't take long, you can't go wrong
Stand up and be strong

If you get all depressed when you get undressed
If youre life's a mess, remember you're blessed
Stand up and be, stand up and be
Stand up and be strong

Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
It won't take long, you can't go wrong
Stand up and be strong

Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
You can't go wrong, it won't take long
Stand up and be strong
