It brings me peace
When you're asleep
Alone together in a moment that lasts forever

And when you smile
It brings me peace
It's like everything I ever wanted
And I want so bad to be good for you

I could be good for you
I think I'd be good for you
Yes I think I'd be good for you

Just like orange juice
Or a walk around the lake
Like putting to good use
Something you thought was fake

And the afterlife
Well who really cares
This one's good enough just as long as you're there
And I want so bad to be good for you

I could be good for you
I think I'd be good for you
Yes I could be for you

And what is sacred
This I know
It's just me and you
On a train moving slow
To Heaven

It's just like momma
She used to say
When I told her that everything's ok
She'd just say "Good for you
That's so good for you
That's good for you
I think it'd be good for you"

Yeah I think I'd be good for you
I could be good for you
I could be good for you
I think I could...
