[Verse 1]
Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide

[Verse 2]
I have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack

[Verse 3]
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Till there’s nothing left to see, ’tell the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed

[Verse 4]
I been looking at my shadow, I have been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

[Verse 5]
Gone walk on down that dirt road ’till I’m right beside the sun
Gone walk on down until I’m right beside the sun
I’m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone
