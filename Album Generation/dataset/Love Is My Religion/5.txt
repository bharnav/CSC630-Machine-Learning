On the beach in Hawaii

I wish you were here with me
Walking on the beach in Hawaii
Playing on the golden sand
Looking at the ocean now I understand
Love is like the open sea
And I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii

Since you've been gone away
I think about you everyday
Don't you know I miss you much
And you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff
Oh I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me

A little pakalolo
And I say mahalo
Ujjayi breathing
To get a real feeling
Yogi gonna let you know
That I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me
In Hawaii

I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
Oh I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
Oh I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
