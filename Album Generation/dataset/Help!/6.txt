[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
