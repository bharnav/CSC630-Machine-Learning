[Verse 1]
Well, don't you worry
About what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry
I can take my time
I'm going red
And my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 2]
I feel so strong
That I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around
And around

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Bridge]
Oh, you know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever [x3]

[Verse 4]
Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love
Was no fun
But our love
Comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
