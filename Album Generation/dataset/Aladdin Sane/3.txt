[Verse 1]
He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

[Verse 2]
He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

[Verse 3]
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher
Crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

{Bridge}
Having scored a trillion dollars
Made a run back home

Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust."
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Panic in Detroit

{Outro}
