[Verse 1]
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (dead roses)
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

[Verse 2]
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for aladdin sane (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

...will love Aladdin Sane
...will love Aladdin Sane

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
They say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway
