[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, Boy

[Verse 2]
Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, Boy

[Verse 3]
Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think
"Oh God! I'm still alive."

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You - Are not a victim
You - Just scream with boredom!
You! - Are not evicting time...

[Bowie Breathing Heavily]

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

[Outro Chorus]
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Yes, Time!
