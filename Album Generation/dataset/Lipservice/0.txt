I've been locked inside my anxious mind
For way too long now
People telling me, i need conformity
Just leave your thoughts behind
Deaf and blind

Now i showed them all
I crashed the wall of indecision
I'll finish when i'm done, i won't let anyone
Take control of me
Now i'm free

All we are, is more than in the mirror
All we are, is more then what you see
All we are, i what we got together
Is all we need, cause life belongs to me n' you
And things we do right now
Right now

How 'bout trying to live a life
No definition matters
How 'bout trying to understand the things you can't
Step outside the line
Instead of wasting time

All we are, is more than in the mirror
All we are, is more then what you see
All we are, i what we got together
Is all we need, cause life belongs to me n' you
And things we do right now, right now

All we are, is more than in the mirror
All we are, is more then what you see
All we are, i what we got together
Is all we need, cause life belongs to me n' you
And things we do right now, right now
