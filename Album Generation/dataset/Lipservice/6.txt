(Music: Steve Lee, Leo Leoni & Freddy Scherer)

Take a jump into the sweetest marmalade
Flavors of which life is made
Realize , don’t wanna deal no compromise
I’ll leave my past, my dues are paid

I’m alive, and I feel so good
I’m alive, right now
Gonna rise
‘Cuz the best is jet to come
When I feel the heat is on
And I’m on fire
That’s when I come alive

I’m going to do the things I always wanted to
Look at me, I walk on air
I can fly and I don’t even need no wings
Do it all , I’ll take the dare

I’m alive, and I feel so good
I’m alive, right now
Gonna rise
‘Cuz the best is jet to come
When I feel my body tremble with desire
That’s when I come alive

I’m alive, and I feel so good
I’m alive, right now
Gonna rise
‘Cuz the best is jet to come
When I feel the heat is on
And I’m on fire
That’s when I come alive
