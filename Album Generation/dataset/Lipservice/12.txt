(Music: Steve Lee, Leo Leoni & Freddy Scherer)

Hey man, the story's getting old
Big lies, they always have been told
But right now you face another man

This time I turn the page around
No rhyme, no reason to be found
Why should I play the fool again

I keep on running in circles
In a crazy human race that never ends

I was never taking more than I needed
Always standing at the end of the line
Waiting for my turn to succeed it
But it's hard to keep playing the part
When there's nothing left at all

How come we always run for more
The rich is stealing from the poor
How come we're never satisfied

Don't know what I'm afraid to loose
Somehow I'm not allowed to choose
God knows I've never really tried

And still we're running in circles
In a crazy human race that never ends

Oh, I was never taking more than I needed
Always standing at the end of the line
Waiting for my turn to succeed it
But it's hard to keep playing the part
When there's nothing left at all

Hey man, the story's getting old
Big lies, they always have been told
And right now you face another man

I was never taking more than I needed
Always standing at the end of the line
Waiting for my turn to succeed it
But it's hard to keep playing the part
It's so hard to keep playing the part
It's so hard to keep playing the part
When there's nothing left at all
