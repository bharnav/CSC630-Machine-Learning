So this is it, we've got it all
Somehow I forgot to see
That the essence of my life
Is what she means to me

I've seen an angel cry tonight
And she was standing by my side
Hiding her tears behind a smile
Sometimes it takes a fool a while

'cause when I've seen my angel cry
All my life just passes by
Oh tell me lord what can I do
'cause I don't want my angel blue
What can I do

Looking back, to all the things I've done
Guess I was raised that way
So now I know what I did wrong
And I wanna try and change

'cause when I've seen my angel cry
And all my life just passes by
Sometimes the answer drives me mad
Never thought it hurt so bad

And still I see my angel cry
I try so hard, I wonder why
Here comes the rain to wash away
Our precious dreams made down to lay
Are they all gone

Don't wanna see my angel cry
I never learn, I don't know why
She hiding her tears behind a smile
Sometimes it takes a fool a while

'cause when I've seen my angel cry
All my life just passes by
Oh tell me lord what can I do
'cause I don't want my angel blue
What can I do
