Oh, you better be aware
There's nothing you can do
'Cause right from this moment
I can't take my eyes off of you

Yeah, I really gotta know
I want to make this real
Why should I pay just for something
I know, I can steal
But don't you worry

Why don't you stay for the night
It's the same old story
I'll love you till the morning light
But tomorrow you'll find your way home

And here I go again
I'll take it on the run
Dressed up n' ready for action
It won't take too long

If you wanna play the game
You gotta feel no shame
I'm burning with passions desires
Do you feel the same?
You better hurry

Why don't you stay for the night
It's the same old story
I'll love you till the morning light
But tomorrow you'll find your way home
Way home, way home

I can't think of no other but you in my lonely nights
I'm beggin' you honey, don't leave me this way
But don't you worry

Why don't you stay for the night
It's the same old story
I'll love you till the morning light
And you know, I'll make you feel alright

Don't ask yourself what's wrong or right
It's the same old story
Don't let us waste one more night
But tomorrow you'll find your way home
Way home, way home
