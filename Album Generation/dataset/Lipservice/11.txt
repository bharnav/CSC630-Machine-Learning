Alright, I'm in a tricky situation
Somehow I gotta try to unwind
You see I'm not alone, I know it shows
Ya' know I saw it comin' around
Cuz there's a part of me
That sleeps and creeps, deep in my mind

I can show you my charms
I can be Mr. nice or let you see
My dual personality
The one I "Hyde", I can show you my charms
But you know that we might have company
I think the name is lunacy
Really want to try
The other side of me

So tight, you know I'm stuck inside relations
Sometimes, I just don't know who Il find
You see I'm not alone, I know it shows
Ya' know I saw it comin' around
Cuz there's a part of me
That sleeps and creeps, deep in my mind

I can show you my charms
I can be Mr. nice or let you see
My dual personality
The one I "Hyde", I can show you my charms
But you know that we might have company
I think the name is lunacy
Really want to try
The other side of me

I can show you my charms
I can be Mr. nice or let you see
My dual personality
The one I "Hyde", I can show you my charms
But you know that we might have company
I think the name is lunacy
Really want to try
The other side of me
I can show you my charms
I can be Mr. nice or let you see
My dual personality
The one I "Hyde", I can show you my charms
But you know that we might have company
I think the name is lunacy
Really want to try
The other side of me
