There are things that should be easy to say
When you know you love someone
While waiting for the moment to come
Another day has gone

The stupid fears I keep inside
That only heaven knows
They scare me every time I have to
Face those simple words

And then goodbyes are round the corner
And then goodbyes don't last one day
So I'm scared the time is running out
And I see you walk away
There are goodbyes that no one cares about
N' others so hard to face
So I'm trying to sing this song for you
For the words I need to say...

I learned my lesson once
I thought I learned my lesson twice
And I know how bad it feels inside
When I can't make up my mind

Senseless words and sleepless nights
And my life's just falling apart
Oh tell me Lord why's it take so long
To let my heart speak out

'cause then goodbyes are round the corner
And then goodbyes don't last one day
So I'm scared the time is running out
And I'll see you fade away
There are goodbyes that no one cares about
And others so hard to face
So I'm trying to sing this song to you
'Cause it's time for me to say
I love you
