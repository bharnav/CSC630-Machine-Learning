Got this everlasting feeling deep inside
Try to convince myself it's fine but I can't hide
It isn't really hard to see
We're all getting hate for free
While this sinking world
Is drowning it's own destiny
Dream on, dream on
I don't wanna loose my faith and come undone, no
Dream on, dream on
I really hope that I'm not fighting on my own
So the road of suffering seems to never end
Oh, it's so unfair, I just don't understand
And to reach the higher ground
That we've lost and never found
We gotta learn how to love
Learn how to live to be free, it's up to you n' me
Dream on dream on
All I know is, I won't make it on my own
Dream on, dream on
Gotta hold on to my dreams before they're gone
So dream on
Dream on, dream on
I don't wanna loose my faith and come undone, no
Dream on, dream on
I really hope that I'm not fighting on my own
Dream on, dream onâ€¦.on and on and onâ€¦
