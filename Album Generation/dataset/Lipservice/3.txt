The nights are growing longer now

And I can't think of anything but you

Do you feel the same way too

Outside the windows, leafs are brown

Like words of passion falling down, it's true

The one's I've never heard from you

Remember, love was such an easy game to play

Those days are flown a million miles away

Now everything I want

Everything I do

Is trying to find myself again

'cause life can be so cruel

For anything I've done

And things that I did wrong

I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious

I'm guilty of loving you

I'll take the chance, this is my life

I'm gonna make the best of what I am

I really need to understand

And should I fail or recognize

The mirror's not reflecting what I want to see

Someone else inside me

I'm stepping out the edge, I'm on the borderline

Ain't gonna make the same mistakes this time

Now everything I want

Everything I do

Is trying to find myself again

'cause life can be so cruel

For anything I've done

And things that I did wrong

I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious

I'm guilty of loving you

Guilty of loving you

Now everything I want

Everything I do

Is trying to find myself again

'cause life can be so cruel

For anything I've done

And things that I did wrong

I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious

It's clear that I was guilty of loving you
