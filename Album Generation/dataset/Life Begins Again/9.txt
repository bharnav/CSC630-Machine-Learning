You are my only
Little one
Sweet love
For you a lullaby
Little one
My love

Close your eyes
Sleep tight tonight
And dream my dear

Rest your head
The sun will rise
And I'll be here

You are my only
Little one
Sweet love
For you a lullaby
Little one
My love

Close your eyes
Sleep tight tonight
And dream my dear

Rest your head
The sun will rise
And I'll be here

Close your eyes
Sleep tight tonight
And dream my dear

Rest your head
The sun will rise
And I'll be here
