When things are spinning down
And people put you out again
The darkness sets you up
The world's no place for love it seems

New waves are coming
New waves are coming

When despair takes your hand
All you do is worry
Clocks are ticking faster and faster
There's no other plan

New waves are coming
New waves are coming
New waves are coming
New waves are coming 'round

Soon a place called yesterday
Will be gone forever
And a new love of today will come and you will (fly)
