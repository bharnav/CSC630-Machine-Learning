[Verse 1]
A life comes our way
A death comes our way
Which is the safer place
I'll tell you

Who are we to complain
When God takes things away
Is it enough to confess
Some sadness

I gaze into the sun
My green eyes burning

[Chorus]
I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

[Bridge]
You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway
You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway

[Chorus]
I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels
I found myself

[Verse 2]
Simple cares they escape me
If I walk away don't hate me
I got to see where the pain will take me

[Chorus]
I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels
I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels
