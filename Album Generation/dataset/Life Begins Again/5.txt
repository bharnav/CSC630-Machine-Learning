Never in my life
Have I felt so right
All I do
Is the truth

An' I feel
An' I feel
An' I feel

As I walk outside tonight
With the stars as my guide
Knowing where to go
It's my heart that tells me so

An' I feel
An' I feel
An' I feel

Love is real
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real

And in time I found myself
With some stories and some wealth
A place for us to meet
It's the music that completes

Love is real
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real

Love is real
Love is real
Love is real
