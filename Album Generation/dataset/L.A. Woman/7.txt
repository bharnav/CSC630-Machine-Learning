[Chorus]
Well, I'm the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
I'm the Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess around with my mate
Going to use her for myself

[Verse 1]
Caught me crawling, baby, window
Grass is very high
Keep on crawling until the day I die
Crawling King Snake
And I rule my den
You better give me what I want
Going to crawl no more
Caught me crawling, baby
Crawling around your door
Seeing everything I want
I'm going to crawl on your floor
Let's crawl
And I rule my den
Come on, give me what I want
I'm not going to crawl no more
Come on crawl [x2]
Get on out there on your hands and knees, baby
Crawl all over me
Just like the spider on the wall
Ooo, we are going to crawl, one more

[Chorus]
