[Intro]
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I took a trip down to L'America
To trade some beads for a pint of gold
I took a trip down to L'America
To trade some beads for a pint of gold
L'America, L'America, L'America
L'America, L'America, L'America

Come on people, don't you look so down
You know the rain man's coming to town
Change the weather, change your luck
And then he'll teach you how to find yourself
L'America
Friendly strangers came to town
All the people put them down
But, the women loved their ways
Come again some other day
Like the gentle rain
Like the gentle rain that falls

[Chorus]
I took a trip down to L'America
To trade some beads for a pint of gold
I took a trip down to L'America
To trade some beads for a pint of gold
L'America, L'America, L'America
L'America, L'America, L'America
L'America
