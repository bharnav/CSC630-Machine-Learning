Up out of bed, all again
Make up and mirrors, all again
Coffee and toast, all again
You're by your self, slipping away
Take two a day, all again
Get out of my way, all again
You're late for work, all again
Feels like this life's slipping away

Try to catch up, all again
Pray to your god, all again
Nobody's home, all again
Now off to war, slipping away
Six 'till I'm off, all again
Pay off your debts, all again
Smash up you car, all again
Take things too far, slipping away

Slipping away our lives

Pick up the phone, all again
Set your alarm, all again
Switch on the box, all again
A show about cops, all again
The bread and the circus, all again
Again and again, all again
Come up for air, feels like this life slipping away

Slipping away our lives, all again

Much bigger than me, much bigger then you
There's only so much we can do
Slipping away, I can

So long, I've been waiting
