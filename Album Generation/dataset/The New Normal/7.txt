Got a little motivation
Got a little hesitation
Got all the trains at stations, it not what you say
Charades
Taking covert trips down to Adelaide
Making homemade glasses of lemonade
She thought I wasn't
Got' a little motivation
Got a little hesitation
Got all the trains at stations
It's not what you say. Charades
The pressure around me
I'm starting to lose control
This game we are playing
Pretending that we don't know
Confusion surrounds me
I know that I must let go
Charades
