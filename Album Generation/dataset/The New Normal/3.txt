"And it was the new music and it was timid, humble and stern. It was brown and light brown and sepia. It was almost forgotten, it lays in a ditch on the side of the road, you and I drove along once, and it was happy to lie there daydreaming. It stretched into the distance further than you ever thought possible,and it didn't give a fuck about you and I either way."

We're into all of those and it's into overload
We're into all of those, our time and it's into overload
Overload

Shot down in the road, let's see your number
Wake up shoppers from your slumber
Jackpot lottery, got bonanza
Sayonara propaganda
Zeitgeist eye sore, got the price right
Cut to ad break, urban fist fight
Insurrection on the free way
Turn around and go the wrong way
The wrong way, the wrong way
I can't hear you!

Overload
Forgot to mention, chain reaction in detention
September-sylum contradiction
Lifestyle, litmus causing friction
Insurrection on the free way
Turn around and go the wrong way
I'm a servant in this palace
So corrupt and out of balance
I can't hear you
The wrong way, the wrong way
