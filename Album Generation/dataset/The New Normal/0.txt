Underrated, overstated real life
Integrated, that's all right, just realise
Exploited, ain't so jaded real life
Dressed as conscience, masquerading

I hope you noticed when I said it's not OK
And I know you're ready
Into the rip, I'm heading out again
Over my head, I can't get out of it

Dial'n up, you know this story
Turn your head the other way
Into the rip, I'm heading out again
Over my head, I can't get out of it

Underrated, overstated real life
Integrated, that's all right, just realise
Exploited, ain't so jaded real life
Dressed as conscience, masquerading

All those backward thoughts you're having
Got the low down sussed, evacuate
The golden bus is running late
Into the rip, I'm heading out again
Over my head, I can't get out of it

Firing line, firing line, firing line
I realise real life

And I hope you notice when I said it's not OK
Those backward thoughts you're having
With the low down sussed, evacuate. Into the rip
