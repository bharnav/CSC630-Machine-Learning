Every day, feeling so ordinary
Every day, I get on with it
Stuck in a loop, feeling so ordinary
Every day I get out of it

I'm my enemy, I'm not going to be
All this stuff's so ordinary (Time just passed you by)
And my memory
It keeps telling me all this stuff's just ordinary

I wake in the morning
In hope that something's going to change
And late in the evening
I'm reassured it's all the same

I'm my enemy, I'm not going to be
All this stuff's just ordinary (Time just passed you by)
And my memory
It keeps telling me all this stuff's just ordinary
My enemy
