It's elevating us
Bowing and shaping us
It's elevating us
It's resonating

Caught in headlights I'm all right
Coming over to your side

It's elevating us
Bowing and shaping us
It's elevating us
It's resonating

No more blindfolds, open eyes
Shaking the frequency
Stand by soldiers, run by night
Shaping the frequency

It's elevating us
Bowing and shaping us
It's elevating us
It's resonating
It's resonating

Caught in headlights, I won't do it
Caught in headlights, I won't lose it
I won't do it, i won't lose it
Breath shaking the frequency
Breath shaping the frequency

It's elevating us
Bowing and shaping us
It's elevating us
It's resonating
Resonating!
