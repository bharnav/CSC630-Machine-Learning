(I want you)
I gotta run, gotta run, gotta run today
I gotta run, gotta run, gotta head along

I want you
I want you
It's not like it's easy
It weighs heavy on a heart today
I'm over these feelings
Adrift, sinking as I sail away
Who cares about meanings?
This thing, you and me in every day
I'm over these feelings
So I am adrift, carrying my heart away

I want you
I want you
I gotta run, gotta run, gotta run today
I gotta run, gotta run, gotta head along
Sinking as I sail away
Carrying my heart away, sinking as I sail away
