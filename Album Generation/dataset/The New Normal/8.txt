In time I will change

I'm waiting around the door
Trapped in a replay of yesterday
You, you aren't around at all
Feels like it's sending me out of my mind

I'm waiting around the door
Waiting for something more
Trapped in a replay of yesterday
You, you ain't around at all
But deny it all
Trapped in a replay

Shot down, no warning
Remix in the morning

Stuttering, get it out, try to say something
Sending me out of my mind
Stuttering, get it out, try to say something
Sending me out of my mind

Shot down, no warning
Remix in the morning
Over again and again
It's just sending me out of my mind

In time I will change
