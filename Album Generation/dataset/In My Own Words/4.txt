[Verse 1]
Damn it's been
Something
Like three years since we came to amends
Goodness I
Didn't realize
It's been that long
But anyways
So good to
Hear that you've
Moved on and found somebody new
So have I
But still baby
Something is wrong

[Bridge]
(You don't have)
(To answer this)
(If it's too personal)
Don't worry 'bout it
(Do your thoughts)
(Of me ever)
(Become sexual)
Do I ever cross your mind?
(Ever reminisce on us)
(On the bathroom floor)
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink
'Cause lately whats been happening

[Chorus]
Is when I'm with my girl (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
That I'll be sexin' her and I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same 'cause I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right

[Verse 2]
Needless to
Say to you
Me and my girl are almost through
Seems that she
Thinks that I'm not over us
(That's crazy ain't it)
But anyway
Just called to see
(If you was experiencin') the same as me
'Cause if so
We got some things to discuss

[Bridge]
(You don't have)
(To answer this)
(If it's too personal)
Don't worry bout it
(Do your thoughts)
(Of me ever)
(Become sexual)
Do I ever cross your mind
(Ever reminisce on us)
(On the bathroom floor)
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink
'Cause lately whats been happening

[Chorus]
Is when I'm with my girl (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
That I'll be sexin' her and I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same 'cause I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right

[Verse 3]
Tell me the truth
Could we still be in love... (Could we be in love)
Think of you
Though that I know it ain't right
Said do you think of me
When you lay with him at night
It's not that I'm lonely baby
But I just can't help myself...
I don't know if I'm still in love with you girl
But when I'm laying with her, girl I call your name

[Chorus]
When I'm with my girl (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
That I'll be sexin her and I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)
And it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same (I call your name)
And it just ain't right

[Outro]
Ooooh (I call your name) And it just ain't right (8x)
(I call your name) And it just ain't right
