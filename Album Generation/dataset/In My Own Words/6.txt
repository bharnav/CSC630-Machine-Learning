[Intro]
Oh
Compound, we got one now baby, woo!
Neff-U, I see you boy
Ne-Yo! Let's go!
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh!

[Verse 1]
Girl what you want
Big chips is it?
Nice whips?
A nice boot with jeans that just fit into perfection
How they stick to 'em hips?
She's so serious
Oh, your walk is vicious, delicious
Millionaire's wife so above mistress
And lookin' at me like "Come get this"
This one is a superstar
Can I be the sky that you shine in?
Dedicated, I put the time in
Shorty, that's the frame of mind I'm in
Let me show you who you are
Can you be my present and future?
Can I show ya things ya not used to?
Baby, where's the contract?

[Chorus]
Sign me up
Won't you put me down?
I just wanna rock wit you, rock wit you baby
You lookin' for a real love, this is real love
Sign me up, sign me up, sign me up baby

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'll be worth your time
Cause you got my attention
I wanna make this connection
Not now, but right now girl
Show me the dotted line
Cause I'm sold on your sugar
I wanna be everything to ya
Just tell me what I got to do girl
This one is a superstar
Can I be the sky that you shine in?
Dedicated I put the time in
Shorty that's the frame of mind I'm in
Let me show you who you are
Can you be my present and future?
Can I show ya things ya not used to?
Shorty where's the contract? (Hey hey!)

[Chorus]
Sign me up
Won't you put me down?
I just wanna rock wit you, rock wit you baby
You lookin' for a real love, this is real love
Sign me up, sign me up, sign me up baby

[Verse 3]
You make the room stop
Sit back and just watch
'Cause you bad than a mother
Can we make this thing for real? (hey)
Girl, cause I got more than enough
Just sign me up
I wanna be down with this program
Tell me what the deal (oh yeah!)

[Chorus]
Sign me up
Won't you put me down?
I just wanna rock wit you, rock wit you baby
You lookin' for a real love, this is real love
Sign me up, sign me up, sign me up baby

[Outro]
Huh, Ne-Yo! Compound! Yea!
Sign me up lil' mama real love
This is real love
