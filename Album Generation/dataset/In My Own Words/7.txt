[Verse 1]
The way (Hold up, Ne-Yo, ya)
The way you switch
Little mama so thick
I’m so sick
Body like a shotgun (Bang)
She’s a hot one
Clock go click
And she know it
Measurements 36’24, 4’6
And everywhere you have a problem
Probably tired of hearing it

[Bridge]
Yeah
Shorty, I don’t wanna waste your time
It ain’t a secret baby girl, you fine
You could have anybody here that you want, that’s right
Including this fella
Cause you’re a diamond and I dig your shine

[Hook]
But I don’t gotta tell you that
You know you look good
(Girl, you know you fine)
So I don’t gotta tell you that (no)
Cause I know you hear it all the time

[Verse 2]
Don’t wanna gas you up
But it ain’t like I can just pass you up
Show me your strut
You make a dude wanna cash you up (whoa)
But that I ain’t how I do
You look good but I ain’t gon’ buy you
Said I just wanna try you
Hit up my cell if it’s cool to slide through

[Bridge]
Yeah
Shorty, I don’t wanna waste your time
It ain’t a secret baby girl, you fine
You could have anybody here that you want, that’s right
Including this fella
Cause you’re a diamond and I dig your shine

[Hook]
But I don’t gotta tell you that
You know you look good
(Girl, you know you fine)
So I don’t gotta tell you that (no)
Cause I know you hear it all the time

[Verse 3]
Shorty I don’t got no game
Ain’t got no falsie playa wit for me to say
That girl you are off the chain (so off the chain)
But I’m sure baby
Sure you knew that anyway

[Hook]
But I don’t gotta tell you that
You know you look good
(Girl, you know you fine)
So I don’t gotta tell you that (no)
Cause I know you hear it all the time

[Breakdown]
I don't got to tell you that

[Outro]
You know you fine
So wassup?
You rolling?
Let's go
