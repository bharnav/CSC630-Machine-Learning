Hurts to see
My incapacity
Shame
Idle mind
No
You have changed me

My mouth is shut
Stupidity have shut my mouth
Shame
Idle mind
No
You have changed me

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard
My knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets
And kill the lights

See the line
Border to freedom
The words
Underlined
My name
You have changed it

Your tone changed to cool
This how you tell me once again
How I have nothing on you
How everything is supposed to end

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard
My knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets
And kill the lights

Father
I won't make it
It's the journey of a life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done

Father
I won't make it
It's the journey of a life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard
My knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets
And kill the lights
