The neck
Then the chain
The head
Is hung in shame
The neck
Then the chain
The head
Is hung in shame

I thought
That you had grown
That you would carry on
But now
That I am gone
What else been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you
Above us all

I think
Of love
I let
It pass
It feels like
Fire
But it won't last

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him
The one who's placed you
Above us all

What is it
Coming to?
I'm unwilling to go on
You have lost
No one has won

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you
Above us all
You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you
Above us all
