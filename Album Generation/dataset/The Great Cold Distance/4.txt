Wave back at me
Back is turned
If I fail once
Circuit burn

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be
Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be

Consternation
Internal source
Overthrowing
Stray from course

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be
Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be
Until
I get there
Hidden
I will be
