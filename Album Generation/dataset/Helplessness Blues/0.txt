[Verse 1]
So now I am older
Than my mother and father
When they had their daughter
Now what does that say about me?
Oh, how could I dream of
Such a selfless and true love
Could I wash my hands of
Just looking out for me

[Chorus]
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me

[Verse 2]
In dearth or in excess
Both the slave and the empress
Will return to the dirt, I guess
Naked as when they came
I wonder if I'll see
Any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling
Nobody else to blame

[Chorus]
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me

[Verse 3]
Gold teeth and gold jewelry
Every piece of your dowry
Throw them into the tomb with me
Bury them with my name
Unless I have someday
Ran my wandering mind away

[Chorus]
Oh man what I used to be
Montezuma to Tripoli
Oh man, oh my, oh me
