[Verse 1]
If to borrow is to take and not return
I have borrowed all my lonesome life
And I can't, no, I can't get through
The borrower's debt is the only regret of my youth

[Verse 2]
And believe me it's not easy when I look back
Everything I took I'd soon return
Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern
Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern

[Refrain]
One day at Innisfree
One day that's mine there

[Verse 3]
In the street one day I saw you among the crowd
In a geometric patterned dress
Gleaming white just as I recalled
Old as I get I would never forget it at all
Gleaming white just as I recalled
Old as I get I could never forget it at all

[Refrain]
One day at Innisfree
One day that's mine there
