[Verse 1]
So guess I got old
I was like trash on the sidewalk
I guess I knew why
Often it's hard to just sweet talk

[Chorus]
I was old news to you then
Old news, old news to you then

[Verse 2]
You, you were like glue
Holding each of us together
I slept through July
While you made lines in the heather

[Chorus]
I was old news to you then
Old news, old news to you then

[Post-Chorus]
Fell for the ruse with you then
Old news, old news to you then

[Bridge]
And I still see you when I try to sleep
I see the garden, the tower, the street
Call out to nobody, call out to me
Chip on the shoulder, the diamond, the teeth

[Verse 3]
Now I can see how
We were like dust on the window
Not much, not a lot
Everything's stolen or borrowed

[Chorus]
I was old news to you then
Old news, old news to you then
