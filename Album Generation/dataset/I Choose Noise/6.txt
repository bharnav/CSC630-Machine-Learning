Choke
You choke it but you know
It comes back when you're sleeping
Cuts you in the dark

Burn
The city is too bright
I'll stay here with my secrets
Until it fades to dust

I'll stay here with my secrets

Sink
Into the storm again
Cold and disconnected
We've opened every door

Burn
The city is too bright
I'll stay here with my secrets
Until it fades to dust

I'll stay here with my secrets

I'll stay here with my secrets
