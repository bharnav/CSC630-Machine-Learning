You drink your health
And remember to forget yourself
Sat on a roof
In the everlasting moments of your youth
You looked surprised
As it all went up in smoke before your eyes
Beneath the glow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning

Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning

Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning

No need for words
Your heartbeats and the breeze was all I heard
Your hopes and fears
How trivial it seemed from up here
I breathe you in
As the sunlight breaks the haze to touch your skin
Beneath the glow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning

Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning

Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Of a different kind of Sunday morning
