Open my eyes
But I can't see where you are
Hold up my hands
But I can't reach that far

Breathing you in
Your taste is still on my lips
I need to feel close
Touch fingertips

Like rivers
We all run into the sea
I can hear now
The waves are crashing on me

Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling
(There's no place to stop)

Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling
(Who will be my rock?)

Tumbling, tumbling
(There's no place to stop)
Tumbling, tumbling
(Who will be my rock?)

I'm falling down
Falling through oceans of clouds
Only fallen angels sing this loud

Lines on my face
I write only for you
Please understand the words
I need you to

An open book
To read my secrets inside
It all starts here
With no end in sight

If only you'd catch me
Safe in your arms
Your love would wash over
Guiding me down

Tumbling, tumbling
(There's no place to stop)
Tumbling, tumbling
(Who will be my rock?)

I'm falling down
Falling through oceans of clouds
Only fallen angels sing this loud

Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling

Tumbling, tumbling
(There's no place to stop)
Tumbling, tumbling
(Who will be my rock?)

I'm falling down
Falling through oceans of clouds
Only fallen angels sing this loud

Falling down
Over and over
Falling down
