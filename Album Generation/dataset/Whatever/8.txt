[Intro]
'Sup girl?
Ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's a weekend beauty queen
Of the black light clubs wearing out the scene
You know her type
Out all night
Starry eyed for the dirty dream
Always looking for the prince where the cash is king
On the boulevard
In a big black car
She's everywhere you are

[Chorus]
I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
A downtown, downtown girl, girl
A downtown, downtown girl, girl, oh

[Verse 2]
Living like a celebrity
All the guys line up and the drinks are free
She knows she's hot
But that's all she's got
Everybody knows she's on the move
With her six inch heels and an attitude
To seal the deal
She shoots to kill
But I'm not going down

[Chorus]
I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
A downtown, downtown girl, girl
A downtown, downtown girl, girl (ooh)

[Bridge]
Likes the attention
And gets the attention
Her name is on the bathroom wall
(Her name is on the bathroom wall)
The party's never over
She's always coming over
Even when the music stops

[Chorus]
I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room (downtown)
'Cause she's a downtown girl (yeah, yeah)
A downtown girl
Her lips are red (her lips are red)
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl

[Post Chorus]
And all the boys staring at the girls staring at the boys
Staring at the downtown girl, downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads (downtown)
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl

[Outro]
A downtown, downtown girl, girl (downtown)
A downtown, downtown girl, girl, oh
A downtown, downtown girl, girl (ooh-ooh, ooh)
A downtown, downtown girl, girl, oh
A downtown, downtown girl, girl (downtown, ooh-ooh, ooh)
A downtown, downtown girl, girl (ooh-ooh, ooh)
