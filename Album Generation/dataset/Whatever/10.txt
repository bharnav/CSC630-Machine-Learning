[Verse 1]
It's like technicolor in black and white
I felt like a boxer without a fight
A night in Vegas without all the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
(Before you)
I could only see as deep as the skin
(Before you)
I never thought I could let anyone in
(Before you)
I was waiting for my life to begin

[Chorus]
You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

[Verse 2]
My walls are falling and my white flag is high
I've surrendered to the feeling inside
I look into your eyes and rewind

[Pre-Chorus]
(Before you)
I could only see as deep as the skin
(Before you)
I never thought I could let anyone in
(Before you)
I was waiting for my life to begin

[Chorus]
You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

[Bridge]
Hand on my heart
Feel how my heart beats, heart beats
Hand on my heart
Feel how my heart beats, heart beats (you are)
Hand on my heart
Feel how my heart beats, heart beats (you are)
Hand on my heart
Feel how my heart beats, heart beats (you are)

[Chorus]
You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful (that love is beautiful)
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire (my fire)
You're burning like the sun (my fire)
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

[Chorus]
You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful (you are)
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire (my fire)
You're burning like the sun (my fire)
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one
