[Verse 1]
Oh, you never ever not please me
You warm me up when I'm freezin'
Are you the one for me
You fixed my broken machine
You're always making me blush
I'm waist deep in a school girl crush
You tied and taped up my tiny ticker
A flicker sparked inside my heart
I love the way that you tease me
You're making life so breezy
I think you're the one for me
You fixed my broken machine
You make me shy inside
My insides feel like butterflies
I like you, you're the one for me
You fixed my broken machine

[Chorus]
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine

[Verse 2]
My heart, it skipped a b-b-beat
Looks like you fixed it, what a tr-tr-tr-treat
My heart, it skipped a b-b-beat
Now I see you fixed my machine
I like the way that you see me
You're sweet like Lemon Squeezy
You turn the key inside of me
And made me see why we can't be
I had a broken machine
'Til you came along to see
It wasn't boom-boom-booming
The way it should've been
You make me shy inside
My insides feel like butterflies
I like you, you're the one for me
You fix my broken machine

[Chorus]
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine

[Bridge]
Oh, L-O-V-E, V-E, you feel it all over me
Oh, L-O-V-E, V-E, say c'mon please, say c'mon please
Oh, L-O-V-E, V-E, you feel it all over me
Oh, L-O-V-E, V-E, say c'mon please, say c'mon please

[Chorus]
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
My heart had fallen apart
You made it feel brand new
And you knew just what to do
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
I had a half-broken heartbeat
I had a broken machine
