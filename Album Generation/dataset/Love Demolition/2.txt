[Verse 1]
I want you to break
Want you to say my name
What is it gonna take?
(I-I-I wanna, wanna)
Tonight I'll tear you apart
I'll take you off the chart
My foot is off the brake
(I-I-I wanna, wanna)

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash it, bash it
Captain fantastic
Hit it, unzip it
I wanna whip it

[Chorus]
I'ma love to get you down
Are you with it?
I'ma love to beat you out
Of my system
Overdrive, all the time
Hit you up until you're mine
I'ma love to get you down
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash
I wanna smash it

[Verse 2]
I'm just a big bully
I wanna make you scream
Or something more obscene
(I-I-I wanna, wanna)
I wanna play you loud
And blow your ear drums out
Then knock you about
(I-I-I wanna, wanna)

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash it, bash it
Captain fantastic
Hit it, unzip it
I wanna whip it

[Chorus]
I'ma love to get you down
Are you with it?
I'ma love to beat you out
Of my system
Overdrive, all the time
Hit you up until you're mine
I'ma love to get you down
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash
I wanna smash it
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash
I wanna smash it

[Bridge]
I'll stitch you up, I'll take your pulse
Am I making the right conversation?
I'll check you out, I'll take you home
Am I making the right conversation?

[Chorus]
I'ma love to get you down
Are you with it?
I'ma love to beat you out
Of my system
Overdrive, all the time
Hit you up until you're mine
I'ma love to get you down
I'ma love to get you down
Are you with it?
I'ma love to beat you out
Of my system
Overdrive, all the time
Hit you up until you're mine
I'ma love to get you down
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash
I wanna smash it
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash, smash, smash, sma- sm-
Smash
I wanna smash it
I'ma love to get you down
I'ma love to get you down
I'ma love to get you down
I'ma love to get you down
