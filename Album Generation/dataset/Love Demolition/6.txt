Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore

[Verse 1]
You've got me on the edge of my seat
I can feel my heat skippin' a beat, beat, beat, hey, hey, hey
So come on, please don't be this way
I must be mishearing every single word you say, say, say

You must be kidding me, you can't be doing this
I don't understand

[Chorus]
You are the king of only one thing
Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
You are the king of only one thing
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore

[Chorus]
You are the king of only one thing
Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
You are the king of only one thing
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore

[Verse 2]
Okay, great, how long did you wait to tell me this
Yeah, I don't have time for any of this sh*t
So don't even bother, I think I'll just get my things
And please don't call me, I don't care now you see

You must be kidding me, you can't be doing this
I don't understand

[Chorus]
You are the king of only one thing
Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
You are the king of only one thing
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore

[Bridge]
You must be kidding me, you can't be doing this
You must be kidding me, you can't be doing this
I don't understand

[Chorus]
You are the king of only one thing
Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
You are the king of only one thing
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore

[Chorus]
You are the king of only one thing
Can you feel my heartbeat anymore
You are the king of only one thing
I can't feel my heartbeat anymore
