[Intro]
My calculator
I’ll see you later
On my calculator
I said see you later

[Verse 1]
It’s time for me to go oh
I just can’t think now no no
Read the numbers on there
Add and substract that now here

[Pre-Chorus]
Read my calculator
I want to see you later
Read my calculator
Nothin’ seems to add up here

[Chorus]
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
That is not my number on your screen!
Say what what?
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
Don’t you remember me?

[Verse 2]
This is such a shame for you
You were only off just a few
It could be a digital mistake
And such a big one to make

[Pre-Chorus]
Read my calculator
I want to see you later
Read my calculator
Nothin’ seems to add up here

[Chorus]
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
That is not my number on your screen!
Say what what?
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
Don’t you remember me?
Try me

[Chorus]
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
That is not my number on your screen!
Say what what?
111 and 666 and a 222 and a 333 and
Don’t you remember me?
Kill the lights please
I’ll catch you later see
Try me
