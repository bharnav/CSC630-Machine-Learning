I said, uh

[Verse 1]
Plug me in, I'll play it right
Shake up this room big tonight
Rattle you up and shake you up
Like nothing you ever felt up
The roof told me quietly
To hold on extremely tightly
Notch this up and keep it up
Like something that you cannot stop, huh

I said, uh

[Chorus]
Once you're here tonight
It will be like nothing else
I said, uh
What you'll see tonight
It will feel like nothing else
I said, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2]
Now you've got your left from right
Let's get to it, make the night
Hit the lights and reach new heights
Like nothing ever felt so right
I like the way you listen
I like the way you spin this
I like it how we seem to glisten
When we're getting ready for this

[Chorus]
What you'll hear tonight
It will be like nothing else
I said, uh
Once you're here tonight
It will be like nothing else
I said, uh
What you'll see tonight
It will feel like nothing else
I said, uh
I want you here tonight
I don't want nobody else
I said, uh

(Uh, uh, uh) I said, uh
(Uh, uh, uh) I said, uh

[Bridge]
The roof told me quietly
To hold on extremely tightly
Notch this up and keep it up
Like something that you

I said, uh
I said, uh
I said, uh

[Chorus]
What you'll hear tonight
It will be like nothing else
I said, uh
Once you're here tonight
It will be like nothing else
I said, uh
What you'll see tonight
It will feel like nothing else
I said, uh
I want you here tonight
I don't want nobody else
I said, uh
