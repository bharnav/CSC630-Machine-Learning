[Verse 1]
You take big steps, are you kidding or what
You know you're talkin' quite a lot and I think you should stop
And get your eyes up off my there
You, you, you really shouldn't look right there
Do you want me to be sat here and listen all night
No, no, not hearing what I said, you ain't doin' this right
I think the ink ran out of your pen, hey
And you just made it to my fun top ten

Now where's your big sweet head at

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get your hands on my ping ping ping
Get-get-get your hands on my ping ping ping
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get my hands on your ding ding ding
Get-get-get my hands on your ding ding ding
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that

[Verse 2]
Your eyes got big, do they fit in your head
Keep staring and you're dead, did you hear what I said
Now get your eyes up off my there
You, you, you really shouldn't look right there
Finger to your mouth, can I fit in a word
No, your mind won't compute, I'm a little disturbed
Now could you stop your pointless chat
'Cause I never met someone so whack

Now where's your big sweet head at

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get your hands on my ping ping ping
Get-get-get your hands on my ping ping ping
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get my hands on your ding ding ding
Get-get-get my hands on your ding ding ding
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that

[Bridge]
I got news for you and this might pinch
But this ain't tingling a thing
So don't think this is happening

Now where's your big sweet head at

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get your hands on my ping ping ping
Get-get-get your hands on my ping ping ping
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get your hands on my ping ping ping
Get-get-get your hands on my ping ping ping
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get my hands on your ding ding ding
Get-get-get my hands on your ding ding ding
Uh, you can't have that, no, you can't have that
Uh-huh, what you wouldn't do
Just to get my hands on your ding ding ding
Get-get-get my hands on your ding ding ding
You can't have that, no, you can't have that
