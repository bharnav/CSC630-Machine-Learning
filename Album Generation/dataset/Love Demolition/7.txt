[Verse 1]
Give us a break
And tell us what it'll take
It's time for you to wake up
Hear our heart drum break over you
The more banana splits you fake
Oh, with a cherry on top
That's a lot, oh, you never ever
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever gon' stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Screaming from our lungs
And banging on your toms
And feeling like you're yum
Feel this neat beat
I wanna show you one

[Chorus]
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out

Zip it up!

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck in a rut
I'd lose the strut
Okay now look, is that the time
Oh right, it's b-split time
Shut your mouth up, lock it tight
It's done, it's the end of the night
Yeah, you never, can you not, not, never ever, huh
Be clever and just help yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Screaming from our lungs
And banging on your toms
And feeling like you're yum
Feel this neat beat
I wanna show you one

[Chorus]
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out

[Bridge]
Zip, zip, zip it up
Zip, zip, zip that up, huh, huh
Zip, zip, zip it up
Oh, is your zipper stuck
Zip, zip, zip it up
I said, zip, zip, zip it up
Oh, is your zipper stuck
Zip, zip, zip that up, huh, huh
Zip, zip, zip it up
Oh, is your zipper stuck
Zip, oh
Oh, is your zipper stuck

[Chorus]
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out

[Chorus]
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out
Take this away
You're winding us up today
Zip, zip, zip it up
Is your zipper stuck
And with any luck
Ah, nothing will slip out
