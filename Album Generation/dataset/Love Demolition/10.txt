Okay
N-n-n-n-n-nasty

What do you consider fun
What do you consider fun

[Verse 1]
It just takes a minute to make some fun
You don't need so many things to have some fun, oh, oh
I'mma teach you how to have some fun (N-n-n-n-n-nasty)
It will be like, fun natural fun, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Step this to it, get onto it
'Til you f-f-feel it, use it
Into fun and nasty gear
Let's do this everywhere
Oh, hey, hey
Oh, it will be like, fun natural fun, hey

[Chorus]
What do you consider fun
Fun natural fun
And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)
What do you consider fun
Fun natural fun
And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)

What do you consider fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Hey!
What do you consider fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Get to it now and let me show you how
Flow with it like you know, don't raise a brow, whoa, oh
There's just one thing stuck in my mind right now
Oh, it will be like, fun natural fun, hey

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
Move right through it, jump up to it
See you l-l-love it, do it
Into fun and nasty gear
We do it anywhere
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, it will be like, fun natural fun, hey

[Chorus]
What do you consider fun
Fun natural fun
And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)
What do you consider fun
Fun natural fun
And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)

What do you consider fun (Hey)
What do you consider fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
What do you consider fun (Hey)

And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)
What do you consider fun

And what do I consider fun
Fun nasty fun (Hey)
