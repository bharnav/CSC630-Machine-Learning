You treat me like (It's so sick)

[Verse 1]
Why don't you shut up, get out my face
Before I'm gonna kick you out into space
Then I can read the paper, what would I see
I see your stupid face looking back at me

You're really pushing me, why can't you see
'Cause I'm 'bout to blow, get your things and go, go, go
I've pressed escape so you've run out of time
Stick your attitude where the sun don't shine

[Chorus]
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
(It's so sick)

[Verse 2]
The things you do just don't impress me
So I clicked stop on you, pretty sure what we had is through
Ain't gonna work but it doesn't bother me
And when you gonna learn you gotta crash on me

[Chorus]
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care

[Bridge]
Quick, click, turn off the switch
It's so sick, this glitch (It's so sick)
Down with me, down with me, down with
Down with me, down, down, down
Quick, click, turn off the switch
It's so sick, this glitch (It's so sick)
Quick, click, turn off the switch
It's so sick, this glitch (It's so sick)

You treat me like (It's so sick)
You treat me like

[Chorus]
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
You treat me like I am software (It's so sick)
You treat me like you don't even care
