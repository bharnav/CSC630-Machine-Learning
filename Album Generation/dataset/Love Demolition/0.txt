5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling destructive again
But I'm loving the complication
Detonate to self-destruct
It's time to crush, we love the rush

I'm over conversation
But I'm loving the complication
It's about to get loud
I wanna destroy you with sound

[Chorus]
We love demolition
We're here on a mission
We love demolition
(Detonate to self-destruct)
We're here on a mission
(It's time to crush, we love the rush)

[Verse 2]
Feeling under pressure
Don't underestimate her
They do this for the pleasure
'Cause destruction's what they live for

[Chorus]
We love demolition
We're here on a mission
We love demolition
(Detonate to self-destruct)
We're here on a mission

[Bridge]
Automatic, so dramatic
Open doors to slam them again
Press the button, self-destruct
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Chorus]
We love demolition
We're here on a mission
We love demolition
(Detonate to self-destruct)
We're here on a mission
(It's time to crush, we love the rush)

[Chorus]
We love demolition
(Detonate to self-destruct)
We're here on a mission
(It's time to crush, we love the rush)
We love demolition
(Detonate to self-destruct)
We're here on a mission
(It's time to crush, we love the rush)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1
