[Verse 1]
Why is your mouth a constant bag of empty talk, oh
You've lost me again
I am bored of hearing 'bout your, listening to your
Constant bickering

Why do you keep ignoring me now
Why do you weep when no one's doing no wrong
Why, how
No matter how hard I try, I'm the bad guy
But if I don't then you'll ask everyone but me
Whoa, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you idiotize yourself
Just to sound like you're tough
Thinking that you'd blow me around
Why did you idiotize yourself
Thinking that you'll blow me around

[Chorus]
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too

[Verse 2]
Don't know what is runnin' your head
Such a blow that you could turn out this way
Breaks my beat to think that you're just not the same one
I use to drop it all for

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you idiotize yourself
Just to sound like you're tough
Thinking that you'd blow me around
Why did you idiotize yourself
Thinking that you'll blow me around

[Chorus]
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too

[Chorus]
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too
Whatever, I never would hurt you like you do
I never would do it just to say I don't care too
