[Verse 1]
Don't feel like dancing
Oh, can't you see my eyes
They are screaming for you
Your love is anodyne
I'm gonna need a little more tonight

[Chorus]
Why don't you take this somewhere
It's like our beats are off here
Turn up or kill your silence
Something to let me know
If I should walk or wait
Walk or wait
Walk or wait

[Verse 2]
Where's your reaction
No need to read my mind
Something's frozen in you
Your love is anodyne
Oh, are you gonna wake me up in time

[Chorus]
Why don't you take this somewhere
It's like our beats are off here
Turn up or kill your silence
Something to let me know
If I should walk or wait
Walk or wait
Walk or wait

[Bridge]
Let me know or let me go, oh, oh
I don't deal with inbetween, with inbetween
Let me know or let me go, oh, oh
Why can't we take this to extremes, to extremes

[Chorus]
Why don't you take this somewhere
It's like our beats are off here
Turn up or kill your silence
Something to let me know
If I should walk or wait
Walk or wait
Walk or wait
