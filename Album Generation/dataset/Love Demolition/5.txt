[Intro]
I play the bang, bang, bang, bang, bangs

[Verse 1]
All the eruptions go out at night
Tonight they'll come out and ignite my sight
All the distractions make it so right
The sound they play makes us all jump with fright
The disruptions, I'll find it, hold tight
Running 'round the place, I'm hidden from light
I think I found what I want, I can't wait
Can't control my heart rate 'cause

[Chorus]
Play the bang bangs, here we go
On marching drums and beating out songs
We play what we want you to know
So here we go

[Verse 2]
I know I found what I'm looking for
Bones of steel spinning sticks are so hardcore
Seeing what's made and how they'll parade
Quick hits and special tricks are never delayed
I start to move and one stares straight up at me
Oh, what came next, I can hardly believe

[Chorus]
Come and join us, here we go
On marching drums and beating out songs
We play what we want you to know
So here we go

[Chorus]
Play the bang bangs, here we go
On marching drums and beating out songs
We play what we want you to know
So here we go, go, go

[Bridge]
We play down on it
The way we want it
Come and join it
We play down on it
The way we want it
Come and join it

[Chorus]
Come and join us, here we go
On marching drums and beating out songs
We play what we want you to know
So here we go

[Chorus]
Play the bang bangs, here we go
On marching drums and beating out songs
We play what we want you to know
So here we go

We play down on it
The way we want it
Come and join it
We play down on it
The way we want it
Come and join it
