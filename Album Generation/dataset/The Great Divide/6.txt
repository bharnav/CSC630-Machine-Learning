My daddy died upon this mountain
Spent his life working with his hands
Made his pay fair by hole and flat rock
From up here on the back side of his land
When I was 10 he took me to the quarry
Taught me things I never will forget
He showed no fear when he walked along the high side
Far above that rocky river bead
It's umpteen miles boy can you climb it
It's umpteen miles to the ...time
When you're umpteen miles high you can't back down in
It's umpteen miles down the bottom rock
Times may have changed but not this mountain
All these years it stood there all alone
I passed the torch... now it's up to you son
To make your mark upon this stone mass stone
It's umpteen miles boy can you climb it
It's umpteen miles to the ...time
When you're umpteen miles high you can't back down in
It's umpteen miles down the bottom rock
It's umpteen miles boy can you climb it
It's umpteen miles to the ...time
When you're umpteen miles high you can't back down in
It's umpteen miles down the bottom rock
It's umpteen miles down the bottom rock
