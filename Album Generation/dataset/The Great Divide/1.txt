Well you had me from the start, you are so good looking
And then you stole my heart with your down home cooking
Fried chickens and greens, … roast on Sundays
Fried … beefs corn bread on Mondays
Well I hadn't have that sweet … feeling since I don't know when
Tell me what can I do to get back in your kitchen again
I never would have dreamed that … so much loving
And the simple things that come out of your oven
The smell of those … and home made pies
Well if this is a dream I won't open my eyes
It's a symphony of recipes and I don't want that music to end
Tell what can I do to get back in your kitchen again
I want some more
Now, mama always said you'll find that girl someday
And you'll taste something special and you'll know that's when you wanna stay
Since I've been gone I've been loosing ...getting too thin, yeah
Tell me what can I do to get back in your kitchen again
What can I do to get back your kitchen
Tell me what can I do to get back in your kitchen again
What can I do to get back your kitchen
What can I do to get back your kitchen come on baby, I'm hungry
What can I do to get back your kitchen, put on that nice table clothes
And take of everything else, wuhu
