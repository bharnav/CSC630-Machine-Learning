She was raised in Kentucky in a good christian home
They had plans for her future that to them were carved in stone
He came from West Virginia to work down at the mill
From his tiny window he could see her house op on the hill
The first time that he saw her she was in her Sunday dress
He came to church in his working clothes trying to look his best
Somewhere between the … and the congregation's rise
They caught a crystal vision of their future
In each other's eyes
Across that big city river, what's done has been done
No one knows who we are, no one knows where we're from
We'll raise off a family, we'll build us a home
But tonight, we're just shadows in the moonlight
The father heard a line of land against the bathroom wall
Came outside waving a pistol yelling “leave my child alone!”
She ran for the wagon while they struggled for the gun
It went off, like a cannon, someone cried
My God, what have I done
Across that big city river, what's done has been done
No one knows who we are, no one knows where we're from
We'll raise off a family, we'll build us a home
But tonight, we're just shadows in the moonlight
Across that big city river, what's done has been done
No one knows who we are, no one knows where we're from
And I hope it will be forgiveness in the days yet to come
But tonight, we're just shadows in the moonlight
Yeas tonight, we're just shadows in the moonlight
