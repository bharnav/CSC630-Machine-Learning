Some men may be … when it comes time to do their hard
Call my name and I will say the cavalry is on it's way
Rewinding on the true romance leave so many things to chance
You need someone to same the day, the cavalry is on it's way
For the lady in distress, I'm John Wayne and nothing less
I'm the good guy coming to your rescue
I'm a strong ...guy, just say the word and you will find me
In the saddle on my way to love you
If you need someone by your side, I don't care how long you ride
… that's ok, the cavalry is on it's way
For the lady in distress, I'm John Wayne and nothing less
I'm the good guy coming to your rescue
I'm a strong ...guy, just say the word and you will find me
In the saddle on my way to love you
You will not have to cry in vain
I ...the dust to ride in rain
Like a man from Monterrey, the cavalry is on it's way
The cavalry is on it's way
