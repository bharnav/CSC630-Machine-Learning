They say hope is romantics, slow down like the Titanic
But my love is gigantic and I don't wanna make it quit
Love is like a fine wine, doesn't have a time line
I've been climbing up that great … till I found where man fits
I've tried to ...and juice, sometimes I win, sometimes I loose
But I can't go wrong, doing the next right thing
I tangled with some titans, done my share of fighting
But I ain't been enlightened learned a few facts of life
I don't swear this small stuff, don't use a driver in the rough
I don't make my marks … to the wife
I've tried to ...and juice, sometimes I win, sometimes I loose
But I can't go wrong, doing the next right thing
Doing the next right thing, yeah, yeah
I may stumble I may fall, but no more … head against the wall
I go around it, I dig myself a hole
Think I'll turn out to the middle of my soul
I try and try to … and juice sometimes I win, sometimes I loose
I'll never go wrong, doing the next right thing
