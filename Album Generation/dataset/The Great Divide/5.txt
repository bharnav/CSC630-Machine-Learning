Lost and lonely at the station
Wanting to be anywhere but here
Taking names and looking some
These all have a destination
And if you listen you can hear
Then get on the one that calls your name
Get one the one that likes your fame
Get one the one that goes all night
The one that makes you feel alright
Get on the one that makes you smile
Ride that train for a thousand miles
Get on the one that stays on the track
Then you never ever gonna look back
Sun was shining on the outside
It was raining in my soul
Girl that taking me for what I love a ride
I won't be going back no more, no more
Then get on the one that calls my name
Get one the one that likes my fame
Get one the one that goes all night
The one that makes me feel alright
Get on the one that makes me smile
Ride that train for a thousand miles
Get on the one that stays on the track
Then I never ever gonna look back
Yeah, gonna get on the one that calls my name
Get one the one that likes my fame
Get one the one that goes all night
The one that makes me feel alright
Get on the one that makes me smile
Ride that train for a thousand miles
Get on the one that stays on the track
Then I never ever gonna look back
