Yeah

Woke up this morning
My baby was gone
Woke up this morning
My baby was gone
I feel so bad I was all alone

Ain't got nobody
To stay at home with me
Ain't got nobody
To stay at home with me
My baby she's gone I'm in misery

Well baby don't you want a man like me
Yes baby don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than you used to be

Well baby I'm all alone
Yeah now baby yes I'm so alone
I ain't had me no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone

Well baby don't you want a man around?
You better come on home baby

Don't you want a man around
I can love you baby
Better than any man in town

Well baby don't you want a man like me
Yes now baby don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than you used to be
