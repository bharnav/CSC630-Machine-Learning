I was born up on the North side
Where the Lagan River flows
When I came across the border
I was following my nose
Dublin city '69
There could have been no better place
There was no better time
Through the thunder and the rain
The deepest blood of emeralds
Was running through my veins

Blood of emeralds

I was down and out on Skid Row
But I held on to my pride
The darkest son of Ireland
He was standin' by my side
We would sail the stormy seas
Never looking back
We were afraid of what we'd see
Through the thunder and the rain
The deepest blood of emeralds
Was running through our veins

Some of us will win and some of us will lose
The strong will survive
Some of us will fall
Some of us won't get out of here alive

Blood of emeralds
Blood of emeralds

I was angry, I was sad
Just thinking about the times we had
I felt so lost and lonely too
What could I say, what could I do?
And after all, the time goes by
No one knows the reasons why
You lived each day like there was no tomorrow
You spent those years living on time you borrowed
And in your eyes, all I could see was sorrow

Some of us will win, some of us will lose
The strong will survive
Some of us will fall
Some of us won't get out of here alive

Blood of emeralds
Blood of emeralds
Blood of emeralds

(Blood of emeralds.)
The deepest blood of emeralds
Blood of emeralds

The deepest blood of emeralds
The deepest, deepest blood of emeralds
