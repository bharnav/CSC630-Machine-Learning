Ooh, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah

It's five o'clock in the mornin'
But I'm not going to bed
I just wanna stay up all night, yeah
And make my eyes turn red

Now, let me tell you what I'm gonna do
I'll keep on moving till the night is through
And I'll be rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'

About a week ago on Monday
I met this chick called Sue
She said "Come over to my place
I'll show you what to do."

I ended up stayin' the night
She did some things that made me feel allright
We were rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'

I can't wait for the weekend
There's a new girl in town
I got me plenty of money
I'm gonna spread it around

Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I tell you what I'll do
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
That's when I'm on the move

I'll go struttin' with my friends
I'll keep on movin' till the party ends
We'll be rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Aah

Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin', rockin' and rollin'

Rockin', rockin' and rollin'
Wow
