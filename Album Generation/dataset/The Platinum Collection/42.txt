Sun don't shine 'round here no more
Since my baby walked on out that door
She broke my heart, make no mistake
All I did was give
All she did was take
But don't you know
Where she goes
The cold wind blows

Well, my baby told so many lies
I couldn't see through my blinded eyes
She choked me up with her bad, bad seed
Took the flowers I gave her
And strangled them with weeds
But don't you know
Where she goes
The cold wind blows

I ain't gonna cry no more
I ain't gonna cry no more
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cry no more

Sun don't shine 'round here no more
Since my baby walked on out that door
She broke my heart, make no mistake
All I did was give
And all she did was take
But don't you know
Where she goes
The cold wind blows
The cold wind blows

I ain't gonna cry no more
I ain't gonna cry no more
I ain't gonna cry no more
I ain't gonna cry no more
Ain't gonna cry no more
Cry no more
Gonna cry no more
Ain't gonna cry no more
