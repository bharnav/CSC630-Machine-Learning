In every heart a story is told
There's a way you can believe in forever
In every life the story unfolds
Like a mystery for you to see
And tear away the mask

Hold on to your dreams
Learn how to fly like angels
Hold on to your dreams
Soaring above, wings of love

In every tear a lesson to learn
There's a way you can believe in forever
Time never hears the reasons we give
It just marches on until it's gone
Forever and a day

Hold on to your dreams
Learn how to fly like angels
Hold on to your dreams
Soaring above, wings of love

Hold on to your dreams
Learn how to fly like angels
Hold on to your dreams
Soaring above, wings of love

Hold on to your dreams
Learn how to fly like angels
Soaring high above
Wings made from love
