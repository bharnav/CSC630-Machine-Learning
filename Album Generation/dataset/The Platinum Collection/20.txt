What is it that you want from me
I really wish I knew
I try so hard to do my best
But it's not good enough for you
Over and over again
We will make the same mistakes
Over and over again
There's a feelin' I can't shake

Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?

You know I need your love so bad
Can't you see what you do to me?
I try so hard to understand
But the truth's never plain to see

Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?

Time after time we will try to understand
I don't know where we went wrong
But there's no use in holding on

Over and over again
We will make the same mistakes
Over and over again
And it's more than a man can take

Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
