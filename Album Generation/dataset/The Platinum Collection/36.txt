Listen to me woman
I just think it's a sin
I know you hear me knockin'
But you won't let me in
Might be fine for you
Just to keep me hangin' round
But if you don't open up this door
I'm gonna kick it down

Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes I feel like
There's nowhere to go
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again

Listen
You've been towing me to shore
For much too long
But now I'm gonna pull you back
To where you belong
Might be fine for you
Just to keep me hangin' round
But if you don't open up this door
I'm gonna kick it down

Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes I feel like
There's nowhere to go
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes it's the only place that I know
That I know

Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes I feel like
There's no place to go
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes it's the only place that I know

Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes I feel like
There's no place to go
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again
Sometimes it's the only place that I know

Only place that I know, yeah
