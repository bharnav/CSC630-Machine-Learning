So many times
You tried to take the best of me
So many times
Now you're gonna take the rest of me
Better look at what you're doin'
Before it's too late
It's a fine line you're treadin'
Between love and hate
There'll be a cold day in hell
Before I'm comin' back to you

So many times
You tried to play a dead end game
I tried to tell you
But you'd never want to take the blame
Now you've pushed me to the limit
And I can't take no more
Better take one last look
Before I'm outa the door
There'll be a cold day in hell
Before I'm comin' back to you

You never listened when I told you
That you were way out of line
Too busy talkin' to listen
Accusin' me of tellin' lies

So many times
You tried to get the best of me
So many times
But now you're gonna take the rest of me
Well it's too late for sorrow
And it's too late for tears
You better take one last look
Before I disappear
There'll be a cold day in hell
Before I'm comin' back to you

There'll be a cold day in hell
Before I'm comin' back to you
There'll be a cold day in hell
Before I'm comin' back to you
