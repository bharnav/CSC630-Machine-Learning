I used to wake up in the morning
With an aching head
I couldn't remember anything I'd said
My friends told me I was gettin' way out of line
If it wasn't for you baby, I'd be doin' time

Since I met you baby
You've made a new man out of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
I used to think that I was better than the rest
Ain't no doubt about it I was no second best
Didn't seem to matter
If I was right or I was wrong
I did some crazy things
Before you came along

Since I met you baby
You've made a new man out of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
Since I met you baby
I'm happy as a man could be
(You tell 'em Gary!)
