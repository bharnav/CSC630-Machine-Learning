Want you to hear me when I say
That the blues is back
And it's here to stay

I wanna tell you a story
A story all about the blues
I want you to listen to me baby
While I sing it to you
Want you to hear me when I say
That the blues is back
And it's here to stay

I used to have me somebody
She meant the whole world to me
But she left me for someone else
Left my heart in misery
But I knew on the day she left me
The blues was gonna be a part of me

She left me with the blues
It was the last thing I thought I could use
But I'm glad that she left me
Left me with the blues
If she hadn't given me the blues
I wouldn't have found someone so sweet as you

I say hey hey the blues is alright
Hey hey the blues is alright
I say hey hey the blues is alright
Hey hey the blues is alright
Alright alright, every day and night
