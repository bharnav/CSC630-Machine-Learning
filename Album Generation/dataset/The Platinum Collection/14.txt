Take me out of here
This place is gettin' much to small
Make me disappear
Vanish through the nearest wall

Give me one good reason why I should stay
Give me one good reason to go on this way
Give me one good reason why I should stay with you
With you

Take me out of here
This place is closing in on me
Make it disappear
Somewhere else I wanna be

Give me one good reason why I should stay
Give me one good reason to go on this way
Give me one good reason why I should stay with you
With you
How, yeah

Give me one good reason why I should stay
Give me one good reason to go on this way
Give me one good reason why I should stay with you
With you, with you

Take me out of here
