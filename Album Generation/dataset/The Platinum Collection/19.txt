My baby she left me
My baby she's gone
My sweet little angel
Spread her wings and flown
Can't think of a reason for goin' on
From this day I will play the blues

She said it was over
This time it's the end
Now bad luck and trouble's
Gonna be my only friend
I still can't believe it
After all we've been through
Everyday I will play the blues

Everybody knows what the blues is all about
It's a pain you can't live with
It's a woman you can't live without
She came from Chicago
She read me the news
In the headlines was
A story of the blues

They say a broken heart can always mend
That time is the healer
The sadness will end
But I've done so much crying
When will I laugh again
Till that day I will play the blues

Everybody knows what the blues is all about
It's a pain you can't live with
It's a woman you can't live without
Could have cried me a river
When they told me the news
On that day
Was a story of the blues
