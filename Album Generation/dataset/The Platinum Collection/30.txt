Need someone's hand
To lead me through the night
Need someone's arms
To hold and squeeze me tight
'Cause when the night begins
I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

Need some lips
To feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up
And tell me when I'm lyin'
When the lights are low
And it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

Why don't you give it up
Bring it on home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, darlin'
So it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me
And stop driving me mad
Because I, I need your love so bad

Need your soft voice
Talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry baby
'cause I know we can make everything allright
Listen to my plea baby
Bring it home to me
Because I need your love so bad
