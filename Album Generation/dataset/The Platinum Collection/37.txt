Oh baby, please stop messin' around
You're messin' around with my heart
Baby, please stop messin' around
You're messin' around with my heart
And if you don't stop messin'
Pretty soon we're gonna part

Oh baby, please stop messin' around
You're messin' around all the time
Baby, please stop messin' around
You're messin' around all the time
And if you don't stop messin' baby
You're gonna be someone elses baby, not mine

Squeeze me baby
'Til my face turn cherry red
Roll me so hard
I'll fall right out of bed
Please stop messin' around
You're messin' around all the time
If you don't stop messin' baby
You're gonna be someone else's baby, not mine

Squeeze me baby
'Til my face turn cherry red
Roll me so hard
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Please stop messin' around
You're messin' around all the time
If you don't stop messin' baby
You're gonna be someone else's baby, not mine
Yeah
