Baby, I used to be the kind anyone could burn
But now I've left those days behind
And it's time for the wheel to turn
Baby, I used to be so easy to take for a ride
But now I've learned to play the game
And my eyes are always open wide

I was the one who would listen to you
When you handed me all of your lies (all of your lies)
But those days have gone, and it's time you caught on
'cause this time nothin's gonna get by

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool, baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again

Baby, you used to be the one who could run around
But now my heart is in my head
And nothing you have said can pull me down
One day, I told you everything would come back on you
And now you've had all your chances
And your one night romances are through

I was the one who would listen to you
When you handed me all of your lies (all of your lies)
But those days have gone, and it's time you caught on
'cause this time nothin's gonna get by

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool, baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again

I was the one who would listen to you
When you handed me all of your lies (all of your lies)
But those days have gone, and it's time you caught on
'cause this time nothin's gonna get by

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool, baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool, baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again

Don't take me for a loser
Don't take me for a loser, 'cause I'm gonna win
Don't take me for a fool baby
'Cause it would take a fool to lose you again
