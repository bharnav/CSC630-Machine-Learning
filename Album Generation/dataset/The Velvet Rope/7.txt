[Chorus]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' fine 'cause I'm dyin' to be out tonight
I'm startin' out makin' sure I look fine tonight
Call Rene and Boo, gotta meet them soon
Tell T to call Shawn, I'll be there at 1
When we show up
All the guys at the club tryin' get our backs
We look good in black

[Chorus]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' high 'cause I'm outta control tonight
Feelin' high, don't wanna stop
He's got me movin DJ groovin and I feel way right
Groovin' I don't wanna stop
Ooh, I'm gettin' freaked from behind
I don't even mind 'cause he's lookin' damn fine
I'll make him mine in time, gotta take him home
When I get him all alone
I'll make him scream and moan
He won't wanna stop

[Chorus]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Bridge]
I'm feelin' high tonight
Outta control tonight
I'm feelin' high tonight
I feel high

[Chorus]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light

We go deep
