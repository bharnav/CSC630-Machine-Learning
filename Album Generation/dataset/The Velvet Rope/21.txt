[Verse]
Hey J
It's been a long time since
I've seen you last
A half and twenty six years
(My time is past)
I'm well
Though I've gone through
Some deep changes in my life
It hasn't been easy
Oh no not for me
It's been difficult at times
Sometimes I sit down and cry
Ask God, "Oh why?"
(Fair, what it is?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know how your feelin'
Same thing I did dealin'
Not as alone, as you may feel
You see but oh
It catches up to us fast
We have to deal with the past
I know it's painful but
There you'll find specialness
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special

[Chorus]
We need to remember
That love lies deep within myself
We have to want it so
It starts with us and no one else
We must learn
We're all born with specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special too

[Spoken Interlude]
{You see you can't run away from your pain
Because where ever you run there you will be
You have to learn to water your spiritual garden
Then you will be free}

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know how your feelin')
I know how your feelin'
(Same thing I did dealin')
Same thing I did dealin'
(Not as alone, as you may feel)
Not as alone, as you may feel
You see but oh
(Ooh)
It catches up to us fast
(Na na na na na)
We have to deal with the past
(Na na na na na)
I know it's painful but
There you'll find specialness
(Na na na na na)
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special

[Chorus]
We need to remember
That love lies deep within myself
We have to want it so
It starts with us and no one else
We must learn
We're all born with specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special too
