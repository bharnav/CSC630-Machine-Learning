[Verse 1]
War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground

[Chorus]
Lose control
An increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
In time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Whoaaaa, yeaahhhh
(Aim! Shoot! Kill your leaders!
Aim! Kill them all!)

[Verse 2]
Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy

[Chorus]
Lose control
An increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
In time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah

[Outro]
Go!
