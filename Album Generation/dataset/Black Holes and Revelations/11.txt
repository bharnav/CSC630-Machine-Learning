[Verse 1]
Rose-tinted view
And satellites that compromise the truth
But I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace

[Chorus]
Faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
And we, too, could be glorious

[Verse 2]
I need to believe
But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore

[Chorus]
Yeah and faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
And we, too, could be glorious
