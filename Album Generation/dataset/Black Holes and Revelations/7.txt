[Verse 1]
Open the skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign
As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut
Or free your mind
Or stay hypnotized?

[Chorus 1]
When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why?
And fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

[Refrain]
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign

[Verse 2]
Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up and loaded on my back
Well, it weighs me down

[Chorus 2]
When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

[Refrain]
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah
But I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign
