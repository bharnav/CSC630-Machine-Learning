[Verse 1]
Stay away from me
Build a fortress and shield your beliefs
Touch the divine
As we fall in line

[Verse 2]
Can I believe when I don't trust?
All your theories turn to dust
I choose to hide
From the All-Seeing Eye

[Chorus]
Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood

[Verse 3]
You will not rest or settle for less
Until you guzzle and squander what's left
Do not deny
That you live and let die

[Chorus]
Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood

Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood
