Tin gods hit the city lights
This town seen better nights
Comin' down red on Sunday
Through the heat, the dust the smoke
Wild-eyed and spirits broke
Too much killing for one day
The rain'll finally come
Tears soaked up by the sun
Clear the rust from your gun
Everybody takes a turn
Watch the towers burn
Cold steel and shallow breath
Fly into the face of death
Hearts so heavy with sorrow
Battle cries that shake the land
Rally round for one last stand
Freedom's ringin' tomorrow
Black leather cracked and worn
Long riders in the dawn
Banners ripped and torn
Everybody takes a turn
Watch the towers burn
But rebels never learn
Just melt into the night
Rebels never learn
Won't give up the fight
Still no end in sight

(Bartholomew Domino â€“ J Albert & Sons)
