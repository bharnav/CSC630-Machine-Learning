You look so fine
When you passed me by this morning
And I would feel so proud
If you would just let me
Walk you 'cross town

Say hey, pretty thing
Won't you look my way
Let me know you
If there's a slightest chance
Of us making romance
Let me know how

I felt my heart miss a beat
The sunlight covered the street
Maybe tomorrow
If I can't love you tonight
Maybe tomorrow

And the time was right
So I waited outside for you to answer
And the stars in the sky
They were all on my side in the twilight

I felt my heart miss a beat
The sunlight covered the street
If I can't love tonight
Maybe tomorrow
