You asked me to give up the hand
Of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man
She's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her
Yes, and the Lord, above
You better move on

Well, I know
You can buy her fancy clothes
And diamond rings
But I believe she's a-happy with me
Without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
But my friend, that will never be
You better move on

I can't blame you for lovin' her
But can't you understand, man
She's a-my girl
And I-I-I, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause I-I-I, I-I love her so

You might think you'd better go
Now, I'm gettin' mighty mad
You've asked me to give up
The only love I've ever had
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
Never gonna let her go
You better move on
