Searchin for my Baby

I don't need no burning faith

Or somebody to tell me
What you've been guilty of

Cos Baby in my eyes you could never
Fall from grace

So why did you leave me
Without a trace

When I went down
To the lost and found
And down by the railway tracks

I ask the man
Have you seen my Baby
He said no but she ain't coming back

Cause all I want to do is hold her
OOO OOO OOO
When there's no one left around her

I'll be the last one standing for you

Sometimes its hard
To understand
How a love
Can't stand a little rain

It tears me up
Just thinking about it Baby
I always thought I'd be your man
Still
All I want to do is tell you
OH OH
All I want to do is hold you
OH OH OH

It don't matter how far you run
Don't matter now what you've done
When you lost your faith in everyone
I'll be the last one standing for you

Searching searching for my baby

SOLO

I don't need no burning faith

Or somebody to tell me
What you've been guilty of
Cause Baby in my eyes you could never
Fall from grace
So why did you leave me

Without a trace

I'm standing here by the river
And down by the railway tracks

So please believe me
When I tell you
I'll be the last one standing for you

That don't mean you don't
Belong in my embrace
That is something that I couldn't face
