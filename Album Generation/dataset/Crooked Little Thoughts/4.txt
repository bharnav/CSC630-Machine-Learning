There's a storm wind
Blowin' through this town
It's a long, long way to where I am bound
And my heart beats
Like a ragged drum
To where my lover is waiting
I'll carry this song

Watch the wild birds fly
Into the turning light
Feel the ghost of the past
Turn in me like a knife
If I had my way
I'd be in your arms tonight
But I'm stuck here in Charlestown
See the midnight train pullin'
Out of sight

Oh mamma can you hear me call?
In the distant wind
So keep a candle burnin'
Cause I'll be back again
And I swear to God almighty
This place can burn in hell
So keep the candle burnin'
And ring that freedom bell

As the cold grey snow
Is fallin' all around
So many roads, so many dreams
Are haunting me now
And I would give everything I have
To hold you once again
Well you shelter me
Will you carry me

Oh mamma can you hear me call?
In the distant wind
So keep a candle burnin'
Cause I'll be back again
And I swear to God almighty
This place can burn in hell
So keep the candle burnin'
And ring that freedom bell

There's a storm wind
Blowin' through this town
It's a long, long way to where I am bound
And my heart beats
Like a ragged drum
To where my lover is waiting
I'll carry this song
