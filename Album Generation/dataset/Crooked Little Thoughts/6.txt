Life in the underworld
Sad face, savage girl
Beauty is a crime
Nights on the waterfront
More of what you never want
Love lies lost in time
She's got eyes of diamonds
Heart like a deep sea pearl
She's slippin' through your fingers
Like any wild street girl
Deep in the underground
Sweet talk without a sound
Shadows cross the light
Hearts on a lost crusade
Fool in black parade
Guilty as the night
Laid up in a tumble-down shack
Mad moon of a friend
Same nightmare's comin' back
You won't ever see the end
Drinkin' whisky like water
Stagger round in the dark
Kissed the devil and his daughter
Left a tell-tale mark
