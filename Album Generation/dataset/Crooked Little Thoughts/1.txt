Baby what's the rush
If you go now you'll just get caught up in the crush
Take some time to unwind
Don't have to make your pretty mind

There's a hum in the street
But we'll come dancing to a different beat
Sleep in like a child
Wake up and watch the sky go wild

See I can't get enough
Of what's going down
No I can't get enough of
The biggest little show in town (that's what you are girl)

If you go slippin away
There could be trouble you know what they say
You might just trip on a wire
So come on back this rooms on fire

Don't go running away
You'll just put out the fire

See I can't get enough
Of what's going round
No I can't get enough of
The biggest little show in town (that's what we got child)

We're safe inside our crazy world
I'm never gonna leave you girl
Tell me all those sweet lies
Let me sink into your dark eyes
It's you I idolise
