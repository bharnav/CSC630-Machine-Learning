It's always after midnight
Inside the killin' yard
Hot steam and grime, they're doin' time
I believe they do it hard
They're sinkin' at the gold mine
It's always touch and go
They'll hit the roof, when they see the proof
Out on missionary row
Don't get nervous, pretend you're doin' fine
Don't get nervous, it's not the end of the line
Goin' down heartache road
You really kiss the motherlode
They're swingin' in the death-house
Twistin' in their tombs
Three secret knocks and Satan rocks
Into the powder room
They're makin' big decisions
They won't leave us alone
One last dance, a blind shot chance
Trouble on the phone
