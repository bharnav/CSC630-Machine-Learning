Levi quit the coast
Left the ones he loved the most
Now things won't be the same
Ain't no right or wrong
Do your time we'll get along
He said laughin in the rain
Seems like yesterday
All the cards just fell his way
There was joy across the land
Fate's a steady friend
It'll be there to the very end
Then strike you where you stand
One fine day
When Levi gets what Levi wants
He'll forget the past
Hope and pray
When Levi gets what Levi wants
There'll be peace at last
Pearl was sweet and smart
Just the kid to play her part
In Levi's master plan
How was she to know
Which way the wind would blow
Some girls need a man
I can still hear Levi talking
Sayin just what you'd expect
If you don't like it sister keep on walkin
You gotta play hard to earn that kind of respect
In this cruel and crazy world
Money whispered take the girl
At least that's what I recall
Guess I crossed the line
Pearl just smiled and said pour that wine
Let Levi take the fall
One fine day
When Levi gets what Levi wants
There'll be peace at last
Hope and pray
When Levi gets what Levi wants
He'll forget the past
I can still see Levi screamin
Loud enough to wake the dead
Was it real or am I only dreamin
Who can tell what lies up ahead
