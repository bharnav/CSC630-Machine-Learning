(Julie Miller)

I've been trying for a long long time
But no matter what I do
When I turn to leave
My heart stays behind
'Cause I can't get over you

I keep moving on, running hard and fast
But everywhere that I run to
I'm just standing still living in the past
'Cause I can't get over you

If memories were like the leaves that fall
The wind would have carried them from my mind
The seasons pass but they never change
A broken heart can't keep time

I've watched as colors faded in the sun
The colors of my love stay true
I've been letting go now
I'm not holding on
I just can't get over you
I just can't get over you
