Close your eyes now, little girl
They don't wanna hear you cryin'
You never had a chance
You never had a chance

It's a great big dirty world
If they say it's not, they're lyin'
Sandman's comin' soon
You know he's comin' soon

Close your eyes and dream
A little dream for you and me
Dream yourself a place where we can go
Baby, you'll never know

Close your eyes now, little girl
Go to sleep, my little baby
Sandman's comin' soon
You know he's comin' soon

Sandman's comin' soon
You know he's comin' soon
