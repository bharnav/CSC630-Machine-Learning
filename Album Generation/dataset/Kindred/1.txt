(All right, bye)
[1]
Oooh, woah, oh, oooh...
I want you
I belonged! (to you)
Now!
I used to belong! (to you)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Because
Wish I could hurt you
No, oooh, now, I belong (to you)
[2]
When darkness starts falling
When I hear your name
Ah, hey... oh no... (helping you)
[3]
Turning in the water
I wanna hear my first, first song
I wanna hear my first, first song
Turning underwater
I wanna hear my first, first song
I wanna hear my first, first song
(I don't wanna be)
