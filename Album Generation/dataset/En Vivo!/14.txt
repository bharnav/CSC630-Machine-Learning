[Spoken intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is Six hundred and sixty six

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dream, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

YEAH!

[Verse 2]
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus 1]
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus 2]
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

[Chorus 3]
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

[Verse 5]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course
