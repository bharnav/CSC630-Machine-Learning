[Verse 1]
Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

[Verse 2]
Spent the night in an L. A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Get out of my way

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Right?

[Verse 3]
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
[x3]
