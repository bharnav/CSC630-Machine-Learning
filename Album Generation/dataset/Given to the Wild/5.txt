I'm a child to your voice
To the sound, though it can eat me alive
Ten toes and ten fingers
Any sense that I've had in this life
Won't you stay a while
Kill some time, you know that I'll make it easy, easy

And I know
Know it wouldn't be forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever

Couldn't you still try

I want to see you
It's not good enough to have you here in my head
Want the spray from the sea
Come on, I'll make it easy

And I know
Know it wouldn't be forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever

Couldn't you still try, couldn't you still try
Couldn't you still try, couldn't you still try
Couldn't you still try, couldn't you still try
Couldn't you still try, couldn't you still try
Couldn't you still try

Things I've said in a rage
Can still be unsaid
Took the cold from my bones
Took the cold from my head

And I know
I Know nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever

Couldn't you just lie, couldn't you just lie
Couldn't you just lie, couldn't you just lie
Couldn't you just lie, couldn't you just lie
Couldn't you just lie, I'm a child to your voice

And I know
Know nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever

And I know
Know nothing stays forever
Forever I've known, forever I've known
Forever I've known
