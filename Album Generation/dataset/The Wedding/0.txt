Bedoin tribes ascending
From the egg into the flower
Alpha information sending
State within the heaven shower
From disciples to unending
Subtleties of river power
They slip inside this house as you pass by

If your limbs begin dissolving
In the water that you tread
All surroundings are evolving
In the stream that clears your head
Find yourself a caravan
Like Noah must have led
And slip inside this house as you pass by
Slip inside this house as you pass by

True direction, knowing why
Its even more than meets the eye
Slip inside this house as you pass by

There is no season when you are grown
You are always risen from the seeds you've sown
There is no reason to rise alone
Other stories given have sages of their own

Live where your heart can be given
And your life starts to unfold
Like you've been told

In this dark we call creation
We can be and feel and know
From an effort, comfort station
That's surviving on the go
There's infinite survival in
The high baptismal glow
Slip inside this house as you pass by
