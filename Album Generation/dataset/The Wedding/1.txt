Still again
My thoughts return to wandering
Fields of grass
Soften savage muttering
Backyard dreams
Of meadows find me promising
Lushness that I sold her
Studded, stumped and bouldered
Still the swaying, idle playing
Summer scenes are beckoning

Calm again
Ghosts and angers flickering
Laps and leaves
Cast shadows on the glimmering
Checkerboards
Twist and buckle, shuddering
Flattened gaping grins
Stitched together hymns
Bring dismissals, sighs, denials
At last a reckoning
