Here's something that you never had
It's slid in on an oily rag
The price is right up on the tag
I'll put it in a brand new bag

This thing will let you be yourself
And won't offend nobody else
Nothing like you ever saw
And it's not against the law

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?
People thinking they been took
Just finding out they overlooked

They never found the missing link
Forgot they had a mind to think
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?
Check out your mind, check out your mind
Check out your mind

Trust in me and I in you
No matter what you see me do
I'm doing me for all I'm worth
None do me better on this earth

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time?
Why don't you check out your mind?
Why don't you check out your mind?

Why don't you check out your mind?
Why don't you check out your mind?
