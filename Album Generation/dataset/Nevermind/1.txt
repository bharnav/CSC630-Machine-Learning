[Verse 1]
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say aah

[Verse 2]
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

[Chorus]
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means when I say
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say aah

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say aah
