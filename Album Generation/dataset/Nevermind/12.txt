[Verse 1]
Silence
Here I am
Here I am
Silent
Bright and clear
It's what I am
I have
Died

[Interlude]
Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother

[Verse 2]
Death
And violence
Excitement
Right here
Died
Go to hell
Here I am
Right here
Ow!

[Interlude]
Mother, no más
No más, mama

[Verse 3]
Death
Is what I am
Go to hell
Go to jail
In back of that
Crime
Here I am
Take a chance
Dead

Die
