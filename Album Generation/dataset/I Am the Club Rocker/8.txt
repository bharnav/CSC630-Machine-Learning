[Verse]
Hey, I am tired to be losed
Actions speak louder than words
If you feel me
Run away where you will be
Have no limit to be free
You release me

[Chorus]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

[Verse]
Hey, I am tired to be losed
Actions speak louder than words
If you feel me
Run away where you will be
Have no limit to be free
You release me

[Chorus]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
