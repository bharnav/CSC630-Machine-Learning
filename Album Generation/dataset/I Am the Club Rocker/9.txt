[Intro]
Sometimes in your life
You gotta do what you gotta do
Or you're got to stand by
'Cause all around the world
Don't forget, sky is the limit

[Verse 1]
I got moves, I got love
I got everything you want
I can dream, I can fly
Come with me for a ride
I love brown, I love blues
Don't you stare at my shoes
If you think I'm just cool
Come with me for a ride

[Chorus]
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it

[Interlude]
But I like it

[Interlude]
But I like it

[Verse 2]
Capture me in the frame
'Cause my love is a game
I would treat you the same
And everything's alright
I just want you to know
'Cause I wanna do slow
If you won't let it go
And everything's alright

[Interlude]
And everything's alright

[Interlude]
Everything's alright

[Chorus]
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it

[Interlude]
But I like it

[Chorus]
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it

[Interlude]
But I like it

[Interlude]
But I like it

[Chorus]
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
Freak, freak, you're freaking me
But I like it
