[Interlude]
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

[Verse]
I wanna tell you that tonight I'm gonna rip the show
I wanna take you really high and drop you low, low
I listen to my music when I'm walking down the street
I'm turnin' up the volume just to make you fell my beat

[Interlude]
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

[Chorus]
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
The house is going on

[Interlude]
The house is going on

[Chorus]
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
The house is going on
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

[Interlude]
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

[Interlude]
The house is going on

[Bridge]
Don't stop don't give it up
That feeling that I have inside now
I will not give it up
I wanna feel I'm livin' right now
Don't stop don't give it up
That feeling that I have inside now
I will not give it up
I wanna feel I'm livin' right now

[Interlude]
The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

[Chorus]
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
The house is going on
Sound for the people now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

[Interlude]
The house is going on
