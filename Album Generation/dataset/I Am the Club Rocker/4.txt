[Chorus]
All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high

[Verse]
Sun is up, move your body
I got moves and all the night I will not sit, yeah
I came up for this party
I will stop when Mr. DJ stops the beat, yeah

[Post-Verse]
Sun is up
Sun is up
Sun is up
Sun is up

[Chorus]
All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high

[Chorus]
All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high

[Verse]
Sun is up, move your body
I got moves and all the night I will not sit, yeah
I came up for this party
I will stop when Mr. DJ stops the beat, yeah

[Post-Verse]
Sun is up
Sun is up
Sun is up
Sun is up

[Chorus]
All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high

[Chorus]
All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
