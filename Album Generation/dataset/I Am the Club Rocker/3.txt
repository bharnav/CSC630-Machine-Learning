[Verse 1]
As I'm going, going down
I have dreamed a better place
As the world turns round and round
Sun is always in my fate

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, Sometimes you go away
Ah, A million miles away
Ah, Sometimes you don't know where
Ah, Don't worry I'll be there

[Chorus]
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life

[Verse 2]
Now I close my eyes again
And I'm thinking to myself
Will I ever love again?
Hope you'll be a better man

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, Sometimes you go away
Ah, A million miles away
Ah, Sometimes you don't know where
Ah, Don't worry I'll be there

[Chorus]
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, Sometimes you go away
Ah, A million miles away
Ah, Sometimes you don't know where
Ah, Don't worry I'll be there

[Chorus]
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life
Can you bring me sunrise
Can you bring me the sunrise
Can you bring the sun in my life

[Outro]
(It's alright, it's alright, it's alright)
(It's alright, it's alright, it's alright)
(It's alright, it's alright, it's alright)
(It's alright, it's alright, it's alright)
