[Interlude]
Put your...
Put your...

[Verse]
True love never dies
I'm falling, when time is passin'
The world is moving too fast
Nothing is made to last, no no
Don't stop now and keep on tryin'
Live like nothing lasts too long
Don't give it up
No, oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your hands up
Dream until the mornin'
Put your hands up
Love is everything you've got

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
And everyday the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
You get the way the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
And everyday the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
You get the way the world will keep on shinin'

[Bridge]
No love is better than yours, better than yours
Look in my eyes
Better than yours, better than yours
Look in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your hands up
Dream until the mornin'
Put your hands up
Love is everything you've got

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
And everyday the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
You get the way the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
And everyday the world will keep on shinin'
'Cause the sun will keep on risin'
You get the way the world will keep on shinin'
