You got me goin'
I got the feeling that tonight we'll catch the mornin'
When I have you by my side, I'm feel with lovin'
You turn me on, you turn me off, you got me goin'

This is a moment of love and tonight is the night
I close my eyes and we're dreaming together
I'm gonna live 'till I die, everyday of my life
I close my eyes and we're dreaming together
