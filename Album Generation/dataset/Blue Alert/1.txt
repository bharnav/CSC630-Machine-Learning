Nowhere to go
Nothing to say
You won't hear my voice
Till it's far, far away
I'm too tired now
To fight anymore
We're saying goodbye
At the innermost door

When I am alone
You'll come back to me
It's happened before
It's called memory

I must go back
To where we began
When I was a woman
And you were a man
If you come with me
I'll never begin
We made us a home
But the roof's fallen in

When I am alone

You'll come back to me
It's happened before
It's called memory

I'm not even sure
If I know where to start
But starting is second
First we must part
I'm too tired now
To fight anymore
We're saying goodbye
At the innermost door
