I danced with a lot of men
Fought in an ugly war
Gave my heart to a mountain
But I never loved before
I'm nervous when you turn away
My heart is always sore
Tuxedo gave me diamonds
But I never loved before

Been on the road forever
I'm always passing through
But you're my first love and my last
There is no one, no one after you

I've lived in many cities
From Paris to LA
I've known rags and riches
I'm a regular cliche
I tremble when you touch me
I want you more and more
I taught the Kama Sutra
But I never loved before

Been on the road forever
I'm always passing through
But you're my first love and my last
There is no one, no one after you

Thought I knew the facts of life
But now I know the score
Been around the block and back
But I never loved before
