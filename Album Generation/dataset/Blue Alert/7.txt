As the mist leaves no scar
On the dark green hill
So my body leaves no scar
On you, nor ever will

When wind and hawk encounter
What remains to keep?
So you and I encounter
Then turn then fall to sleep

As many nights endure
Without a moon or star
So will we endure
When one is gone and far

As the mist leaves no scar
On the dark green hill
So my body leaves no scar
On you, nor ever will

As many nights endure
Without a moon or star
So will we endure
When one is gone and far

So will we endure
When one is gone and far
