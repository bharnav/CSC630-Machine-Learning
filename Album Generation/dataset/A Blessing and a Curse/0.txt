Flowers flying cross the room
Vases smashed against the floor
Said "I'd rather be alone
Take your chocolates and go home"

Be my valentine

They say time makes things easier but only time will tell
You said we'd go the distance but I guess it's just as well
You're blossoming all over while I whither on the line
I just called to tell you that "I hope you're doing fine"

Be my valentine
