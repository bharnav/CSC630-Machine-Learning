Hold me down, lift me up
There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me
I hear my name, turn around
There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see
Around me, hide me

Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes

Something's wrong, awake all night
'Cause I can feel the dark side closing in on me
Do you see me as I see myself
I promise there's a downside, something you can't see
About me, hide me

Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes

Lost in translation, free to fall
One situation and lose it all

Hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen...
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes
