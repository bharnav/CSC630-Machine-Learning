It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
But I just wanna be closer to you

And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
I just wanna be closer to you

Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day my life is through
But I just wanna be closer to you

Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
And we all needed something real we all need proof
But I just wanna be closer to you
I only wanna be closer to you
