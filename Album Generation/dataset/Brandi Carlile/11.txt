Sorry, I'm only
Human, you know me
Grown up, oh no guess again

My days always
Dry up and blow away
Sometimes I could do that too
But make no mistake that

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end

Progress and changing
Growing then giving up
Somehow, I'm never quite prepared
But I understand that

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end

So taking you with me would be like
Taking all your money to the grave
It does no good to anyone especially
The one you're trying to save
It's so hard not to say

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end
