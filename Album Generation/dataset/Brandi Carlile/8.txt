Life is too short to waste all your time
Running too quickly to the finish line
Time is a trap, it's ready and set
And the longer you live, the closer you get to being

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...

There's no guarantee or promise of wealth
And you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but your time when you're

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...

So live in doubt, live in fear
And you might live forever
Or live it up, and watch your back
And you might live for better

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...
