Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack

Hold out I know you feel it getting cold out
Without the blanket for your soul and
Before you know it you'll be frozen
And you have to see this through
There's no one here but you

I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory

Don't go to sleep and cry because
Tomorrow if you let it, it will swallow
You up and none of this will matter
Anymore

I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory...

Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack your shell
