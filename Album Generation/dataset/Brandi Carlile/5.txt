Dear Love, I'll miss you much
I'll miss your smile and I'll miss your touch
But I found a place where I can erase my past
Maybe someday when you're old and gray
When your hair falls out and your tattoos fade
You might see me standing, hand in hand

I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes

You built your rooms, you built your walls
You kept me outside of it all
I got tired of you, what's a girl to do
Maybe someday if we stay this way
And you see my face in a different place
You'll remember when, you're gonna thank me then

I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes
