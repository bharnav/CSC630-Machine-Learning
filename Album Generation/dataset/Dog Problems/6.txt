[Verse 1]
Ah you've got flaws
That you won't admit
Yet you tell me it's a sin
That I don't believe in...
Yet you traded in your cross
For a chance to dance with stars
Now nothing is sacred

[Verse 2]
I've given thought to leaving
F-f-f-for sometime
If only I could read a map
My moat is New Mexico
So it's you I wrote

[Chorus]
I started sending you a note
Oh how I hope that you're happy
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
And how I wish I was an ocean
Maybe then
I'd get to see you again

[Verse 3]
And all my friends
They break and they bend
They take shape and they tend
To get better with time
And I say
"Who am I to work so much less
Yet get more
You all deserve what I am walking towards
If you want you should move away"

[Verse 4]
This has become my weakness
The golden state wins again
Perhaps its time I settle
Say "it's blue
At least that's a plus"
Plus
I miss you so much

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Why am I scared of people in a room?
Why can't they see a good time
Are the people close to you?
Why don't I just give in?
Have a drink and shake some hands
Oh ey oh
Oh ey oh
Why am I scarred from what she did to me?
Why can't I trust anyone?
No, not even me
Why don't I just give in?
Have a drink and shake some hands
Oh ey oh
Oh ey oh

[Verse 6]
I've given thought to leaving
F-f-f-for sometime
Maybe it's time I put a profile up
Of who I want to be
Fool everyone
I could start over clean
I could hide behind a big blue screen
Or you could return to me
Return to me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Why am I scared of people in a room?
Why can't they see a good time
Are the people close to you?
Why don't I just give in?
Have a drink and shake some hands
Oh ey oh
Oh ey oh
