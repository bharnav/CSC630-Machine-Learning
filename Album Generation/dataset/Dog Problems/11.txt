[Verse 1]
So the wind that blows across your room
Carried cheap perfume onto your dresser
It rained for jewellery and for credit cards
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
Oh one day you'll kiss your rabbit's nose
Pick up the phone to find
I've been turned over
And you'll grab that piece of gold
Only to find that the smell has taken over
Now all things you have
They aren't the same
As what you hold

[Verse 2]
I'm now standing in a room
It's filled with older folks
And they're pleading, "Baby listen"
And I scream as loud as anyone
But when asked to make a point
I tend to whisper
Now highways turn to tidal waves
They're asking me to export
All of your insecurities
But that wind that blows across your room
It's gonna set the sails
And send me back to you

[Chorus]
Sometimes when sailors are sailing
They think twice
About where they're anchoring
And I think I could make better use
Of my time on land
I'll drink less cause lord knows
I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home
To tell them:
Hey I
Hey I'm doing alright

[Verse 3]
It's a shame what your father did to your
Brother's head
When he smashed it with a telephone
And your mother got scared
And locked the door
You were only four
But Lord you remember it
So now you're scared of love
I'm here to tell you love just ain't some
Blood on the receiver
Love is speaking in code
It's an inside joke
Love is coming home

[Chorus]
Sometimes when sailors are sailing
They think twice
About where they're anchoring
And I think I could make better use
Of my time on land
I'll drink less cause lord knows
I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home
To tell them:
Hey I
Yeah I'm doing alright

[Outro]
Yeah I'm doing just fine
And if she seems as lonely as me
Let her sink
Yeah I'm doing alright
Yeah I'm doing just fine
And if she seems as lonely as me
Let her sink
You let her sink
You let her
