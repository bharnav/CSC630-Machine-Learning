You could do the laundry
I'll come by on Monday
You give me the money
I'll go buy your ticket

On the local lottery
We could win the lottery
We could go to Vegas
And be very happy

Ohh…

I could be a plumber
We could wait 'til summer
We could save our money
Have a fine vacation

We could buy a trailer
If we bought a trailer
We could go to Vegas
And be very happy

Ohh, if life is just a gamble
Gamble if you want to win
Ohh, life can be so easy
Let the wheel of fortune spin

We could make a record
Sell a lot of copies
We could play Las Vegas
And be very happy

Ohh, if life is just a gamble
Gamble if you want to win
Ohh, life can be so easy
Let the wheel of fortune spin

Ohh…
