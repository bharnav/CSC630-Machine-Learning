All the girls pose for the same four pictures
All the boys got the same girls' hair
And I am bored because I feel much older
Look at me as if I got a reason to stare
But you talk so loud that it calms me down
You're crying, "Let's make a toast!"

[Chorus]
She says she's leaving on a Sunday
Oh, that leaves me one more night
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn
I tried it once, it never caught on
I was the only one who got burned

I've read every word you've said
From a poster of a cat
Four books look across your sofa
I thought your coffee table was more clever than that
It gets worse once we get to her room
She stops and she sings, "Do do do do do do do do"
I claim "New Religion" is my song
She doesn't get it
It's all before she was born

And you lock your door
Like I've been here before
I feel like I've seen a ghost

[Chorus]

Suddenly between sheets and eyelids
I am reminded why I don't do this
I fall in love far too quickly
I never want her to forget me
When you're gone
Will you call, will you write?

[Chorus]

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn
I tried it once, it never caught on
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned
