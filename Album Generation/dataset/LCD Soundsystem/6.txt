I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But my desire
Is going to crush me

But I'm all chills
'Cause you adore me
You adore me

But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills

I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But my desire
Is going to level me
'Cause you're alive

But I'm all chills
'Cause you've been loose-knit
You've been loose-knit

But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills

I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But all of my desire
Is going to crush me
When you expire

But I'm still all kills
But you want me
Because you want me

I need my thrills
