[Verse 1]
I'm wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I want to get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Can fuck you here tonight

[Hook]
But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do

[Verse 2]
If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
We'd run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
Cause I'll never grow

[Hook]
But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
And it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do
But not with you

(I keep on telling myself it's you)
(But not with you)
(Just keep on telling myself its you)
