[Verse 1]
Forgive me, forgive me
If I seem alarmed
I had a motionless moment
But no harm's done
You see I've read through a million
Words that I wrote
Built up mountains of shrapnel

[Pre-Chorus]
I've made my mind up, my mind up
Because the line drawn in the sand's wrong

[Chorus]
When all the pioneers are gone
And all that's left are unresolved
Out of step opinions
And you say the word and I will come
With overbearing clouds of warmth
Out of breath but not alone

[Verse 2]
Forgive me, forgive me
If I'm straightforward
I'm in a poisonous process
That is getting old
I always wind up with botched up
Over-critical
Emotive motives

[Pre-Chorus]
I've made my mind up, my mind up
And I could care less who's turned off

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They always say how great
It is to leave us wanting
But you and I know when
We have been stretched too thin

[Chorus]
