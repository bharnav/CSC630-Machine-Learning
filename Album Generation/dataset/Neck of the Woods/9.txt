[Verse 1]
Faith and praise keep locked away
Sentimental thoughts can stay
I suppose I’ve made mistakes
Carry on so I can lay

[Chorus]
With your gun-shy sunshine
With my headstrong highlights

[Verse 2]
Brace yourself for old remains
Later on I will behave
Made a home for future stakes
Rest assured we’ll be okay

[Chorus]
With your gun-shy sunshine
With my headstrong highlights
With our hands drawn and eyes dried
Hands drawn and eyes dried
What you don’t understand (hands drawn and eyes dried)
I’m a modular man

[Bridge]
Pretend to care to remember
Pretend to care to remember
Remember when to resemble man

[Chorus]
With your gun-shy sunshine
With my headstrong highlights
