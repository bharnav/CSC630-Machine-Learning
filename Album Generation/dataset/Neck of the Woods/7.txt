[Verse 1]
I am marching through the branches in a fit of wanderlust
To see you in a black hole reaching out for something just
Silhouettes of neighbors dancing in disgust

I’m sure you recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that lives within
But it’s much worse where you are
So will you go for it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

If somebody somewhere
Would clean out your wounds
And bury the lie
Bury the lie

[Verse 2]
Now we tumble down a hill to a fire with a crowd
The flicker becomes thicker as we bottom out
The residents don’t even notice the sudden shouts

When your eyes adjust and you see what’s in view
Discolored and distempered smiles that seem new
Do you realize they were all once like you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

[Bridge]
No, no
No one cares
Where no one goes

No, no
No one care
Where no one goes

[Verse 3]
You recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that comes within
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a feeling you might
Bury the lie

Oh, oh
