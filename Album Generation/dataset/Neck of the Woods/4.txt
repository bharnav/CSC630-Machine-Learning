Here we are
Underneath a million leaves
In shadows of
Compromising scenes
When I was young
I dreamed this would be
Steamier

But I've got one chance to move you
One chance to move you
So here we are

I'm running out
Of sounds to let you down
I can't call it off
Or gain higher ground
Luck of the draw
Is all that's allowed

Is it easier
If it's the right time to lose you?
Right time to lose you
So here we are

Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

I've got one chance to move you
One chance to move you
Is it the right time to lose you?
Right time to lose you
