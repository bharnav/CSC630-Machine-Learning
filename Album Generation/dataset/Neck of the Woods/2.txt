[Verse 1]
Drowned you out
And left you with the sounds
Of spoiled goodnights
Replacing lullabies

How could they never notice
What they planted in your spades?
See you laughing in a picture
But I know what's out of frame

You barely cried
But you made it out alive
And I'm so proud
That you're in my hands now

If we grew up together
You would find it's not the same
I wanna jump inside that picture
And show you a new game

[Chorus]
If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay...

[Verse 2]
I'll never let them get closer
Or shower you with any blame
Now we dance in our own picture
Where the rules have changed

[Chorus]
If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay...
