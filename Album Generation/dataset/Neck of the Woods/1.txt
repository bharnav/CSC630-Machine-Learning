[Verse 1]
They took everything you want wrapped it in a box and locked it in a keep
Made of high rise stucco walls with polyester guards moving out of sync
I hunt with curtain rod swords and shields of cardboard on two wheeled steeds
I storm the cul de sac to get things back on track and bring you what you need

[Pre-Chorus]
You would do the same for me but I might’ve lost my mind

[Chorus]
I can never show you what you gave to me
A shape and form of make believe
I wouldn’t want to stay here in my incomplete
Shaken up realities

[Verse 2]
I’ll give everything I’ve got to fill the canyon with useless debris
From plastic foliage collected catalogues and other fakery
I’ll sentence everyone over twenty one to the guillotines
They never understood our neck of the woods and what it all means

[Pre-Chorus]
This is not a game for me but I might’ve lost my mind

[Chorus]
I can never show you what you gave to me
A shape and form of make believe
I wouldn’t want to stay here in my incomplete
Shaken up realities
Shaken up realities

[Pre-Chorus]
You would do the same for me but I might’ve lost my mind

[Chorus]
I can never show you what you gave to me
A shape and form of make believe
I wouldn’t want to stay here in my incomplete
Shaken up realities

[Outro]
I’d really like to be there when you raise for me
A shape and form of make believe
I wish I could just warn you of my incomplete
Shaken up realities
You shake up reality
