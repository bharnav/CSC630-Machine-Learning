[Verse 1]
Where it starts and where it ends
Is here in my bedroom
Chatter from vents
Is the only thing seeping through

I see spiders defend
The same space I'm living in
I should be calmer to mend
The words are mattering

[Chorus]
What am I waiting for
Some army to break in
What am I aiming towards
A fight that never ends
What am I searching for
A light to shine again

[Verse 2]
A siren crept in
Still the world's still grinning
I need a strong arm my friend
To keep me from simmering

[Chorus]
What am I waiting for
Some army to break in
What am I aiming towards
A fight that never ends
What am I searching for
A light to shine again

[Bridge]
Nothing's coming
Nothing's coming
Nothing's coming

If I get up
Out of this den
Where do I begin

[Chorus]
What am I waiting for
Some army to break in
What am I aiming towards
A fight that never ends
What am I searching for
A light to shine again

[Bridge]
Nothing's coming
Nothing's coming
Nothing's coming, nothing's coming
Nothing's coming

[Outro]
That's where it starts, that's where it ends
That's where it starts, that's where it ends
That's where it starts and where it ends
