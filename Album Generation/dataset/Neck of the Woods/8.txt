[Verse 1]
So you wanna mess with me?
Caught me in a silent scream
Heat filling up my cheeks
Not exactly what you think
See you in the room next door
Your feet float above the floor
Dress torn above your knees
Like you've owned it for centuries

[Verse 2]
Dots and dashes on the wall
You tell me about the falls
Of kingdoms and champions
You've seen a thousand times before
I'll show you my private things
Like my scrapbook of fantasies
You say I look a little too green
For saving

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm already bored
I'm already wise
I'm already worn
I'm already wondering, 'What am I?'
I'm already rough
I'm already lean
I'm already wanting to be obscene
I'm already cursed
I'm already dry
I'm already wondering, 'What am I?'
I've already learned a bit of sin
Enough already, let me in

[Chorus]
We signal in a moonbeam
I beg you to follow me
You say that I'll be surprised
At the codes in the sunrise
But if I don't like what I see
And my grip starts loosening
The edge of the big reveal
Could be the end of the story

[Bridge]
I just saw innocence
Spinning around, spinning around
Should I step in?
And blow it all down
Blow it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm already bored
I'm already wise
I'm already worn
I'm already wondering, 'What am I?'
I'm already rough
I'm already lean
I'm already wanting to be obscene
I'm already cursed
I'm already dry
I'm already wondering, 'What am I?'
I've already learned a bit of sin
Enough already, let me in

[Chorus]
We signal in a moonbeam
I beg you to follow me
You say that I'll be surprised
At the codes in the sunrise
But if I don't like what I see
And my grip starts loosening
The edge of the big reveal
Could be the end of the story
