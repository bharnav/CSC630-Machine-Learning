[Verse 1:]
In backyard burnings
I’m easily amused
Their backs start curling
They’re running out of room
Your mouth is sharpened
In a gruesome display
But I’m still waiting
For something nice to say

[Pre-Chorus:]
My spirits are high
Mean spirits high

[Chorus:]
Please go on and on
There’s beauty in your venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along
Too late to decide
My lips are opened wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

[Verse 2:]
You stare at my shoulders
Are you surprised to see?
One more devil
Where angel wings should be

[Pre-Chorus:]
My spirits are high
Mean spirits high

[Chorus:]
Please go on and on
There’s beauty in your venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along
Too late to decide
My lips are opened wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

[Bridge:]
High high high high high high high high

[Chorus 2:]
Please keep going on
Oh that sweet venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along
Too late to decide
My lips are opened wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along
