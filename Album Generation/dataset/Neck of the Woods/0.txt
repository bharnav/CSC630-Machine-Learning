Aaaaah aaaaah aaaah aaah
Oooo ooo ooooooooooh

[Verse 1]
Little lights are overexposed
And they highlight marks on the floor
When aligned right lead to the door
Of a place that seems somewhat explosive
Now I’m back and punching the air
A sneak attack to disrupt and smear
All the laid tracks I left when I broke
Off the pavement I still should be on I suppose

[Verse 2]
In a new skin I’m ready to snare
What I’m never willing to share
I disable my muscles and bones
So they won’t try and walk on their own
Now I stand here with nothing to hide
Like a newborn hungry and wild
But the ground I want to explore doesn’t feel like before

[Pre-Chorus]
All I think about is why
The skin I’m in feels ordinary
And things that you might like don’t grow inside of me

[Chorus]
Your skin is alive and it’s leaving
Your skin is alive and it’s moving
Your skin is alive and it’s leaving
Your skin is alive and it moves me

(Aaaah aaaah aaah aaaaa aaah aaaa aaah aaah)

[Bridge]
I want to be next to you
While your covering is soft
When I try to crawl up next to you
Your covering becomes leather

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all I think about is why
The skin I’m in feels ordinary
And things that you might like don’t grow inside of me

[Chorus]
Your skin is alive and it’s leaving
Your skin is alive and it’s moving
Your skin is alive and it’s leaving
Your skin is alive and it moves me
