[Verse 1]
I heart metal
I heart wine
More so when they’re combined

The wood that scares me
Saved my life
Lesson learned after twice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The trees are blinking bright
I shake in the rhythmic light
I've never felt anything like
The cold of these empty spaces

[Verse 2]
Fog from bottles
End of light
Don’t start making gears grind

The back road findings
Could change my mind
Busy bees don’t really fly

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I could just slow down
And scribble on missing pages
Who would I write it for?
And who would write it for me now?

[Chorus]
Some people wait just for a little bit
Why can’t I wait to find my little bit?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The trees are blinking bright
I shake in the rhythmic light
I've never felt anything like
The cold of these empty spaces

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I could just slow down
And scribble on missing pages
Who would I write it for?
And who would write it for me now?

[Chorus]
Some people wait just for a little bit
Why can’t I wait to find my little bit?

[Outro]
Some people wait just for a little bit
Some people wait just for a little bit
Some people wait just for a little bit
Why can’t I wait to find my little bit?
