Breathing in the same sequence
While trying to make sense of this situation
That we got ourselves in
Two more weeks of one-way conversation
She swears she's losing interest
I swear that we are best friends 'til the end

This could be the plans for revenge
But these words lead to dead ends

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
And kiss me like it's the last time
These lips need medication
These days are dripping poison, girl
Days turn to nights
I wish on the stars in the sky
Be careful of the brightest
Beauty is on the inside

I wish I could, but I know I can't take it back
It's serious, just like heart attacks
On personality, avoid the scenery
I hate playing games with the industry
That builds these dreams and tears them down
When my heart breaks, it makes a sound

This could be the plans for revenge
But these words lead to dead ends

[Chorus]
