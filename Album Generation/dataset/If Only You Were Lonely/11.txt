Let's try to remember these days back in December
Our lives were very different
I was lonely when we first met
A small upstairs apartment
Driving through the darkness
To get back home before they knew you were even gone

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to speak because I can hear your heartbeat
Fluttering like butterflies searching for a drink
You don't have to cover up how you feel when you're in love
Iâ€™ll always know I'm not enough to even make you think

[Chorus]
Please, slow down, girl
We're moving way too fast for their world
We've gotta make this last

I miss you so much, a self-inflicted coma
The days drag on like marathons
I'm running with bare feet
And when I feel the stress, I'm lonely and depressed
I picture you in the dress you wore four weeks ago

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know it hurts to feel so all alone
I'm by myself, more than you could know
If only they were all alone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
