The medicine is blending in
Mixing the blood with oxygen
I needed this right now to figure myself out
Cutting through the ribbons of self doubt
I never thought you'd see me this way
You are the worst and I am to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
Close the door, lock it tight
Then I'll know you're safe tonight
Turn on a song that means the most
Believe I'm there and hold me close

[Chorus]
She is in my bloodstream
Tonight she's draining me
The room is filled with reds and blues
I follow as she leads into the darkness drying up my veins
She's a ghost, a silhouette calling out my name

These lies will fall into the pieces I left you
Of your favorite picture torn in two
I never thought we'd end up this way
You are the worst, I am to blame

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
