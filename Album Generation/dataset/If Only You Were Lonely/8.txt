[Verse 1]
Sleep, sleep, little darling
I swear I'm not trying to wear you out
I'm not trying to drag you down

When you fall asleep tonight
They'll be waiting for you
When you try to close your eyes
They'll try not to hate you
Sleep, sleep the night away
Act like nothing's wrong
You know we're going down

[Chorus]
You are such a light sleeper
Count to ten and you're already out
We fall, we're in deeper
The night's gone as we open up our eyes

Nine, ten, we'll never sleep again
We tried, we know we'll never win
At least, we know we'll make it out alive
At least, we know we'll make it out this time

[Chorus]

We fall, we know that we can make it now
We fall, we know that we can break this down
We can break this down

We hear what you're saying
Not enough so we keep playing
This game is what you make it
One chance, so why not take it?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
