So let us concentrate on all those things you love to hate
It makes this all worth the wait
But causes us to separate
And I don't know how I should feel
These lights make it all seem real

[Chorus]
Can you see this, or wear it on your wrist?
It's everything you wanted
The mark you always missed
Can you feel this?
Cross me off your list
She's everything you wanted
The mark you always missed

With dry eyes and steady hands
I tried so hard to understand why you left us all alone
Three broken hearts with a broken home
And I don't know how I should feel
These lights make it all seem real

[Chorus]

Cross me off
Cross me off your list

[Chorus]
