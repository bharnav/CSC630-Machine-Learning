I never meant to hurt you
Sometimes these thoughts have a way of making sense
Secrets that we keep turn into accidents
If you burn away the bonds with a fire of selfishness
The positive and negative have a way of blending in

[Chorus]
End this now, we've gone too far
Let's take back words that turn to scars
If I could find a way to turn back time
Had to let you know I'm on your side

Took the easy way out, I shut myself down
The only way to ease the pain is to drink until I drown
I'll say it out loud, my voice is the only sound
So listen up, I'll spell it out
I need your help, I need it now

[Chorus]

Am I not everything that you wanted me to be?
Tried my best, took a shot in the dark and I lost

[Chorus]
