I hope this song can tell you how I feel tonight

You are my first dissection spilling my insides

Let's write our names with the blood that's in our cheeks

So it won't wash away if I don't come home for weeks

And I don't come home...
I never said (never said)

This would be easy

I let her go when she said she was leaving

So whisper softly

And don't forget

To tell me how you feel in five words or less
I knew I should have never offered you the world

The nights are full of faces you're the only girl

Turn my world from disaster

Make my heart start beating faster

Ask the question, here's the answer

I need you now and I can't stand this
I never said (never said)

This would be easy

I let her go when she said she was leaving

So whisper softly

And don't forget

To tell me how you feel in five words or less
Just tell me how you feel...

I need your voice tonight...

Just tell me how you feel...

Whoa, whoa...
So whisper softly and don't forget

To tell me how you feel in five words or less
I never said (never said)

This would be easy

I let her go when she said she was leaving

So whisper softly

And don't forget

To tell me how you feel in five words or less
