Step up, it's time to learn the hard way
As so many lives here end, and I've fallen
Bugs crawling up my arms. Eyes so strong
Staring and torturing me for so long
So tell me, about this life filled with guilt, fear, and emptiness
With guilt, fear, and emptiness
Ash for teeth and gums, withered skin. Trash can belief and mouth

The search for truth begins, while you're still sleeping in

The simple life, the simple plan, eden is laid to rest
When this is what you stand for, this is what you get

Is this everything you asked for?
This is all I have!
Is this everything you asked for?
This is all I am!

It's the same thing that gives us something to live for
That gives us something to die for. Ash for teeth and gums, withered skin
Trash can belief and mouth. This is what you owe

The simple life, the simple plan, eden is laid to rest
When this is what you stand for, this is what you get

Is this everything you asked for?
This is all I have!
Is this everything you asked for?
This is all I am!

Ode to the antman, gathered here one last time
This is what you strive for, this is what you get
The precision of an axe as it cuts right through someone
This is what you died for, this is what you know. You know, you know, you know, you never know

Surrounded, yet isolated, see you my friend. Surrounded, yet isolated, see you in hell
