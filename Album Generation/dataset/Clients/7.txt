I remember days like you'd remember years
How'd things get so hard?
Try and get out while you still can
Turn your back and start running
The soldiers with the green vests and the gold caps pulling your strings
They're pulling your strings and telling you things to keep you from running away
I remember when...
Try to understand
How'd things get so hard?
Look out
Clear the way
He's lost his mind again
Look out
Clear the way
He's off the train again
They're pulling your strings and telling you things
Run away
