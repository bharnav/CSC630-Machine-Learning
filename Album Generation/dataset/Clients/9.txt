My name
This is my day
The time to shine
I can see the end
From six stops away
Money buys you beds but it can't buy sleep
I'm almost sorry that I must do this to get my name in lights
But this is my chance and I'm going to take it
Don't forget my name
This is the most important day of your life
How does it feel to know that I'm a part of it
This is the most important day of your life
This is my day in the sun
Don't you forget
My name
This is my day
The time to shine
I hate you all more than you will ever know
How does it feel to know you will be destroyed?
The words rolled off those pretty lips
More at nine
I'm the bastard blue line cretin
I, the destroyer
I, the cripple
The disabled
I am your end
Now we're at the end and it's over now
Money buys you 'friends' but it won't buy you fame
Not like this, anyway
