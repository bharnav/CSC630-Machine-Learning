Dress it up and scent it with disgust
Shit your pants and run for your life
As days turn to weeks and the finger starts to numb
Whose toast is this?
Give it to me
Who fucking cares
Fuck it
It's mine now
A shift in power and class placement
And that noise?
It's just inside your head
You run
Screaming bloodlust
What's that?
It's just inside your head
It tastes great as the words leave your mouth
So try to scream with the cord around your throat
As days turn to weeks and the finger starts to numb
Whose toast is this?
Who fuckin cares?
He was a God
He was a hit man
He was a henchman
A cartoon character
Think of all the silly things that have passed you by
Onto the upper deck as your life has gone away
He was a God
He was a hit man
He was a henchman
A cartoon character
Onto the upper deck it comes
Right on the face
The time has come
Say sorry
It's time to run
It is like the ultimate money shot right on the face
It's funny how job security works in this business
From the top of the ladder to a world of shit
Respected and feared to a babbling mess
I heard you were a serious guy in your day
The guy people saw when they needed things taken care of
And with all your fall from the highest of places, it's the ultimate money shot right on the face
In retrospect, it could have been worse
On the upper deck and the taste of disgust
Think back
Now it's gone
With the snap of a finger, suddenly it was gone
WIth the snip of your finger, wait to get the tip back in the mail
Raper. Killer. Earth-shatterer. Raping. Killing. He's walking. Upper deck
