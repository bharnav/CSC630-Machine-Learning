This is a lesson in what we have and what we get
And what we want
I want it back again
I won't let you destroy what we have
And I know it kills you
This is it
All the pain
From the inside, I can't breathe
But I must never fall
Call forth the insides, I must never fall
I won't let this end
I won't die
I won't let it die
It's getting dark
I've questioned faith
Feel the pain inside
If there is a God, where is he now?
If there is a God, where was he then?
Feel your skin as it crawls
I won't let this end like I let you die
And what we have and what we get
What we get and what we need
And even though you're so much older, it hurts the same every time
