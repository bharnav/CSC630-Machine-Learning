On the piss slab
Spread eagle out back
Nothing lasts forever, but I think this is ridiculous
And so do I, as it is devoured port oral
Nothing lasts forever but this is ridiculous
Like making love on the piss slab
I don't need them
I'm just waiting for my big day
But you'll need me
I'll be there eon that big day
I don't need them
Just waiting for that big score
I will make my way to the top
I will bang my way to the boss
Just wait for that big score
THe boss is coming home with me someday
Take it won't you take it
Anyway you can get it
Take it
Take cover
Oh yeah
With old men
With lone men
Oh yeah
With your man
With lone men
Oh yeah
With drunk men
With dead men
Make love
On the concrete with dead beats
Love on
The concrete
On side streets
