Philly sweets. Two for five. Killing time
Waiting for the final battle. Got the shakes
Wasting Life. Killing time. Waiting for the final battle now

Nose bleeds and psycho babble, I know it all too well
The penis was from heaven and it went to hell
It's past the time to think. It's time to kill
And just know, I've been waiting for this forever

Got the shakes. Wasting Life. Killing time. The final battle is now

This time, it's everything you thought, it'd be
This time it's Antman vs. Black Santa
Like Clash Of The Titans and War Of The Worlds

You stand for the lowest class, take me off your list
I'm, no democrat, I'm a conversationalist
If your aunt had balls, she'd be your uncle
And, you just can't get it off your brain
Give a straight answer, not today not tomorrow
Come sit down. Tell the boss what's on your mind

Shake it like a sickie
