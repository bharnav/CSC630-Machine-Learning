How would you live in a world without pills for everything?
The world is knee deep in vices and everyones got one
Huffing paint and snorting dust. Just to keep life out
Excuses are like assholes and yours stinks
Sifting through the bullshit to see whats going on
We are here to find the answers
Now its time to open up
Now I've seen through the bullshit and know whats going on

Lies. Lies. It's all lies. It's kinda like pulling teeth
Move It. Lay the tarp keep it clean

All busted up. It's like some pornographic image
We are here to find the answers. Now it is time to get them out
Dont make me say it again. KEEP IT CLEAN
