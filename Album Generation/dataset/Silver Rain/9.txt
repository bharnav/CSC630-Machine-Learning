Let me hold you tight, if only for one night
Let me keep you near to ease away your fears
It would be so nice if only for one night

I won't tell a soul, no one has to know
If you want to be totally discreet
I'll be at your side if only for one night
Yeah, yeah, if only for one night

Your eyes say things I never hear from you
And my knees are shaking too
But I'm willin', willin' to go through
I must be crazy standin' in this place
And I'm feelin' no disgrace for askin'

Let me hold you tight if only for one night
Let me keep you near to ease away your fears
It would be so nice if only for one night
Yeah, yeah, if only for one night

I tell you what I need one night, one night
Baby, and that's all I need is one night, one night
Oh, baby one night, yeah
Of your love, of your love, of your loving

I'm asking, let me hold you tight if only for one night
Let me keep you near, ease away your fears
It would be so nice if only for one night
If only for one night, night
