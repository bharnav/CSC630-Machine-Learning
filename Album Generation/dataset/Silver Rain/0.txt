C'était tu très simple
Don't you leave me standing
In this ...
Holding on to ...
Fading memory (memories)
I can hear the laughter
Of who you used to be
Nights of love you left will
Forever be with me
With me
Ohohoho
Closed my eyes and misjudged
Like you're here with me
And I'm realise it's just
Just my fantasy
For you I know it was just
Nights of extasy
Nights of love you left will
Forever be with me
Ohohoh..
Yeahyeah
No no no

[solo]
Oh oh oh
Woah...
Woah.. oh no.. yeah, yeah..
Closed my eyes and misjudged
Like you're here with me
And I'm realise it's just
Just my fantasy
For you I know it was just
Nights of extasy
Nights of love you left will
Forever be with me
Oh oh oh
