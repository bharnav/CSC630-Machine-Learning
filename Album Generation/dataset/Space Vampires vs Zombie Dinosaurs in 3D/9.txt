Going to the dentist
Going to the dentist and it's gonna suck

Sitting in the waiting room
Waiting for my turn to sit on the throne of pain
While filling out various legal documents
All starting to look the same
My insurance information and my medical history
I don't know if they want me to

Excuse me, did you have any questions about the form?

Yes, as a matter of fact I do
Do I fill out this part here too

Oh, don't worry about that, we'll fill that part out. If you're ready the doctor will see you now

Hello, I'm Dr. Taylor. How are you today?

Fine

That's great! What we're gonna do is take a few x-rays then we'll see what we need to take care of, okay?

Sit back regret how it all has come to this
I know that I should have been brushing
All that plaque was having a party
I've been dreading this exact moment
Open wide, the fun begins now she's

Putting a bunch of shit in my mouth
Putting a bunch of shit in my mouth
Putting a bunch of shit in my mouth
Putting a bunch of shit in my mouth
Now I'm feeling

Pain, suck, sucking pain, that sucks
Poking and prodding and pressing and probing and
Pulling all feels utterly violating

Suck, pain, painful suck, that hurts
Drilling and filling and digging and yanking and
Scraping is something I think is unnerving

Smooth jazz adds to my misery
Easy listening while they are raping my poor teeth (teeth)
I lost a fight to tooth decay, tooth extraction
Feels like they're digging out my brains (brains)

This is not the oral care I prefer
I've got a bunch of cavities to fill before another tooth falls out
Lie helpless and let them dig out the nerve
I need another shot of Novocain to numb it while my teeth get plowed

Okay, here's your free toothbrush and I'll see you in six months. Bye
