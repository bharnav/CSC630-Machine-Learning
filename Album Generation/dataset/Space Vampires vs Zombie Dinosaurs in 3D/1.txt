I read the other day that Bob was sad because his girlfriend was talking to
Her ex when she found out that he had sex with his ex wife that ruined his life
By making a post about the time he cheated on her with his old boss
Now he's single and unemployed and he said his life is completely destroyed
And I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!

Sally made a post about eating a chocolate lasagna pizza
Which she eats every time she feels alone
And I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!
Then Sam replied that he's there for her and she can come over to dry her tears
He's probably plotting to get her drunk
And I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!

Hey you, what do you read
Something negative or something bleak
Your digital confessions of depression are an obsession
The lack of your discretion leads to my increased aggression

I just wanna punch you in the face...book

Sadface emoticon
I'm rebooting my social life and you don't belong
You're gone
No more attention for the shit that don't matter
I'm apathetic towards your blubbering blather

John just made a post proclaiming he hasn't eaten since noon today
A burger and fries sound really good
And I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!
And Jack replied like "Dude, next time won't you ASK if you want me to get you something"
Then Lisa said "you shouldn't eat meat"
And I think I'm gonna have to

Hide your post, hide your blog
Hide your post, hide your blog
Hide your post, hide your blog
I don't give a shit, shut up

Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!

Sadface emoticon
I'm formatting my social life and you don't belong
You're gone
No more attention for the shit that don't matter
I'm apathetic towards your blubbering blather

All that I ever wanted
Was to reach out to my friends
Instead I'm drowning in a sea of
Bitching, whining, moaning and
Complaining about the weather (block)
Fighting with your lover (block)
Griping about the government (block)
Preaching about the environment (block)
I hate my parents (block)
I lost my wallet (block)
I'm totally bored (block)
I feel so... (block)
I... (block)
But... (block)
Please... (block)

Aw, did I hurt your feelings? Oh well, I guess I'll never know!

I've put up with the dramathon for way too long
You're gone
I'll do away with all the Jerry Springer
By clicking delete using my middle finger!
