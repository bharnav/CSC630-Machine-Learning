What's up bitches?
We are Psychostick
I like to yell things into the microphone
And say bad words... monkeyfucker
Hey, you guys feel that right there? You feel how the bass tickles your genitals?
You know where you are right now?
Take a wild guess

You're at a concert
You're at a show
This is a concert
This is a show

Live shows are heavy (Fuck yeah, we're at a concert)
Concerts are heavy (Fuck yeah, we're at a live show)

Start up a moshpit
Mosh pits are badass
Start up a moshpit
Go fuck some shit up

Make some fucking noise
Thanks, that helps my self esteem

Let me see those horns
Now you are metal

Show me your middle fingers
You guys are dicks

Now get your keys in the air
Now fucking jingle those keys

Put your keys away
And give your neighbor a hug
Ahh, you guys are sweet

You're at a concert
Concerts are badass
You're at a live show
Live shows are bad, fuckin', ass
