Alright, who did it, who did it, admit
Admit to your transgression a guilty conscience needs confession
Don't dare deny it, don't hide it, don't fight it
Denied abominations will lead to investigations

You gotta take responsibility for your flatulence
You gotta take responsibility for your gas
You gotta be accountable for silent death that you're unleashing
You gotta be accountable for all the products of your ass

Oh God, oh God, oh God

It's the wrath of the burrito
Roll down the window
A methane crescendo
Roll down the window
Roll down the window
Roll down the window

Alright, that does it, that does it, who was it
We'll find the guilty party who's been doing all the farting
Somebody's lying, you're lying, he's lying
We'll beat the truth out of you for the suffering we've gone through

You gotta take responsibility for your flatulence
You gotta take responsibility for your gas
You gotta be accountable for silent death that you're unleashing
You gotta be accountable for all the products of your ass

It's the wrath of the taco
Roll down the window
Or maybe the nachos
Roll down the window
Roll down the window
Roll down the window

The gas is building up, it's reaching lethal doses
We all will soon be found, dead while holding our noses
Oh God, it's smells like death in here
Oh God, The time for truth is near because

He that smelt it dealt it
He that sniffs it gives it (no you did it)
He that smelt it dealt it
He who denied it supplied it (no you did it)

What do you mean
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't
What do you mean
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't

Or maybe it was

Ha ha ha ha
Smell my stench you fuckers
