[Verse 1]
You'll never enjoy your life
Living inside the box
Your so afraid of taking chances
How you gonna reach the top

[Verse 2]
Rules and regulations
Force you to play it safe
Get rid of all the hesitations
It's time for you to seize the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Instead of just sitting around
And looking down on tomorrow
You gotta let your feet off the ground
The time is now

[Chorus]
I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting, I'm waiting
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines

[Verse 3]
Try to have no regrets
Even if it's just tonight
How you gonna walk ahead
If you keep living blind

[Verse 4]
Stuck in the same position
You deserve so much more
There's a whole world around us
Just waiting to be explored

[Pre-Chorus]
Instead of just sitting around
And looking down on tomorrow
Cause I know what's in you
Is out there

[Chorus]
I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting, I'm waiting
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines

[Bridge]
I'm trying to be patient
The first step is the hardest
I know you can make it
Go ahead and take it

[2nd Bridge]
I'm waiting...waiting...just waiting...I'm waiting

[Chorus]
I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting, I'm waiting
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines
(woah)
(woah)
(woah)
Waiting outside the lines

You'll never enjoy your life
Living inside the box
Your so afraid of taking chances
How you gonna reach the top
