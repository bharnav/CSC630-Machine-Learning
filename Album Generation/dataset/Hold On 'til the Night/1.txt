[Verse 1]
I really thought you were the one
It was over before it begun
It's so hard for me to walk away
But I know I can't stay

You're beautiful and crazy too
Maybe that's why I fell into you
Even though you would pretend to be
You were never with me

[Chorus]
So it's over yeah we're through, so I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew, so I'mma unfriend you
Cause I should have known, right from the start
I'm deleting you right from my heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you

[Verse 2]
I thought in time that you could change
And my time and love would heal the pain
And I didn't want this day to come
But now all I feel is numb

[Chorus]
So it's over yeah we're through, so I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew, so I'mma unfriend you
Cause I should have known, right from the start
I'm deleting you right from my heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you

[Bridge]
You come on to everybody
Everybody all the time
You give up to anybody
What I thought was only mine

[Chorus]
So it's over yeah we're through, so I'mma unfriend you
You're the best liar ever knew, so I'mma unfriend you
Cause I should have known, right from the start
That you didn't have a human heart
Yeah it's over, my last move is to unfriend you

[Outro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
So I'm a unfriend you
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
So I'm a unfriend you
