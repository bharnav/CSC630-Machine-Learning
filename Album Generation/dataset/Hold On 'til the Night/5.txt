I shut the door
And I step outside
It's close to midnight
And the fog is in
And the street lights

With the sound of Big Ben
It reminded me
It was only yesterday
When we first met in that cafe
And our worlds entwined

[Chorus]
Ooooh don't you know?
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
I'm ready to go
Ooooh don't you know?
It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
You light my world
My little London girl

[Verse 2]
Sunglasses on
You take me to Camden Town
As you share your headphones
With the Kinks and the Rolling Stones

As you walk around
In your leather boots
All the boys are staring
But you're not caring
'Cuz you're so rock and roll (so rock and roll)
Woahhh...

[Chorus]
Ooooh don't you know?
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
I'm ready to go
Ooooh don't you know?
It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
You light my world
My little London girl

(Yeah) You light my world [x5]
...worlddd
Ooooh don't you know?
We're gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
Are you ready to go?
Ooooh don't you know?
You light my world
My little London...
Girlll don't you know?
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
I'm ready to go
Ooooh don't you know?
It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
You light my world
My little London girl
