Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky

We've been awake all night
Shattered dreams all around
Close your sad, sad eyes
We will be safe and sound

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreamin' lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on the summertrain
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by

Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
As you sigh in my ear: 'Kiss the rain goodbye

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreamin' lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on the summertrain
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by

Come away with me
It's gonna be all right, just breathe
Come away with me
It's gonna be all right, you'll see

And the windows are cryin'
But this train is flyin'
Us all through the rain I feel
And our sky's gettin' brighter
With every mile
It all seems clear

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreamin' lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on the summertrain
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passin' by

Come away with me
It's gonna be all right, just breathe
Come away with me
It's gonna be all right, you'll see
Come away with me
