So long to electric fences
Not much left for me to run from now
Guess I turned myself around
I'm putting down my defenses
These wings are gonna
Take me off the ground
It's freedom's sweet as sound
And I'll admit that I was wrong
And it's obvious that I'm
Finally taking my fists down

Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive
There was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now

Don't know what you get tomorrow
Not sure I wanna go too well
Isn't that what life's about
So long for the fear and worry
Let's go and you won't be sorry
I'll be the one to get you out
Chase the demons out tonight
You can see how fast they run
When you turn the light switch on

Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive
There was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now

And it gets more beautiful
It gets more beautiful
As the sun turns into rain
And the hurt turns into shame
And it gets more wonderful
It gets more wonderful
Can you get this through your brain
That you cannot lose again

Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive
There was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now
