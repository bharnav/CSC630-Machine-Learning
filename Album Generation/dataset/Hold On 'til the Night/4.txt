Late at night I start to think about the things I did wrong
Late at night I start to think about the things I could have done
To save us from him
To save us from her
To save us from the world

Late at night my tears start to melt my heart into gold
Late at night the silver lining turns my heart into stone
To save us from him
To save us from her
To save us from

Suddenly, my heart starts to feel
Yeah my hearts start to feel
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around me silver and gold but my heart never heals
My heart only feels like stone
Ooooh, like stone

Late at night when I'm at partys my gloom fills the room
Late at night when I'm dancing with other girls I pretend it's you
To save me from hurt
To save me from hurt
To save me from

Suddenly, my heart starts to feel
Yeah my hearts start to feel
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around me silver and gold but my heart never heals
My heart only feels like stone
Suddenly my heart starts to feel
Yeah my hearts start to feel
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around me silver and gold but my heart never heals
My heart only feels like stone
Ooooh, like stone

I've tried my hardest
I've tried my best
But you just don't seem
Satisfied
And I'm here all alone tonight
When I think of you I cry

Suddenly, my heart starts to feel
Yeah my hearts start to feel
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around me silver and gold but my heart never heals
My heart only feels like stone
Suddenly, ooooh, like stone
All around me silver and gold but my heart never heals
My heart only feels like stone

Late at night when i'm all alone i think of you..
