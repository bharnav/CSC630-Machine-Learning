It's a little cold outside tonight
But I was too close not to say hi
You know I talked to a friend of yours at school
She gave me the impression that you might be cool
With a guy like me
With a girl like you

Oh could you ever see
A guy like me
With a girl like you
Am I a fool for (fool for)
Falling for you, girl
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Am I a fool for (fool for)
Making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it

'cause all along it's been you on my mind
Something special about you's hard to find
I know every girl's searchin' for romance
And I'm wonderin' if you'd take a chance
On a guy like me with a girl like you

Oh could you ever see
A guy like me with a girl like you
Like you like you hey
Am I a fool for (fool for)
Falling for you, girl
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Am I a fool for (fool for)
Making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break it, please don't break it

I'm a fool for you, Cheyenne
I'm a fool for you, Cheyenne
I'm a fool for you, Cheyenne
I ain't playin'
I'm just sayin'
I can't live without you

Am I a fool for (fool for)
Falling for you, girl
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Am I a fool for (fool for)
Making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart, Cheyenne
Please don't break it, please don't break it
