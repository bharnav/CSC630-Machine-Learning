Once in a while
Will you try to give one little thought to me?
Though someone else may be nearer to your heart

Will you dream of the moments I shared with you
Before we drifted apart?
Once in a while

In love's smouldering embers
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

Oh, I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Oh, knowin' you think of me once in a while

In love's smouldering embers
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you'll think of me once in a while
