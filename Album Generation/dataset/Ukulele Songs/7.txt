I'm falling harder than I've ever fell before
I'm falling fast while hoping I'll land in your arms
'Cause all my time is spent here
Longing to belong to you

I dream of circles, perfect eyes within your face
My heart's an open wound that only you'd replace
And though the moon is rising
Can't put your picture down
Love can be frightening when you fall

And when the time is right, I hope that you'll respond
Like when the wind gets tired, the ocean becomes calm
I may be dreaming
But I'm longing to belong to you
