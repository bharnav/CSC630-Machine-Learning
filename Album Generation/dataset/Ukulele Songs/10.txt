I saw the light today
I saw the light today
I saw the light today
I saw the light today

Silence louder when so long
The quiet building in the dark
Surrender to the game
I saw the light today

The silent scream that we're apart
I dare to dream for there you are
I bleed, but I won't break
I saw the light today

I saw the light today
I saw the light today
Today
Today
