I've got our love to remember
That will never change
I have you in my head
And though I'll never hold you
And I'm still asking why
I guess that this is goodbye

My dreams suddenly seem so empty
I could go it on my own
But I feel like playin' dead
And for what feels like the first time
I don't know where you are tonight
I guess that this is goodbye

We lived half our lives together
A cloud full of tears
It's a lot of weight to bear
And the sun, it may be shining
But there's an ocean in my eyes
Cause I know that this is goodbye
Cause I know that this is goodbye
I know that this is goodbye
