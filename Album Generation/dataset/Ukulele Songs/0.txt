I wanna shake, I wanna wind down
I wanna leave this mind and shout
I've lived all these lives
Like an ocean in disguise

I won't live forever
Oh, you can't keep me here

I wanna race with the sundown
I want a last breath that I don't let out
Forgive every being
The bad feelings, it's just me

I won't wait for answers
Oh, you can't keep me here
Oh
Oh

I wanna rise and say goodnight
I wanna take a look on the other side
I've lived all these lives
It's been wonderful tonight

I won't live forever
Oh, you can't keep me here, oh
Oh
Oh
Ee-hoo
