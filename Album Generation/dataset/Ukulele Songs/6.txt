Its no shame that love's a game
That I can only play with you
What I'm saying
Is I'm here waiting for you

I've seen the light, I'm satisfied that
The brightest star that's you
Satellite I'm holding tight
Beaming back to you

Days turn into night turns into
Days turn into today
Don't think I'm out playin'
Cause I'm inside waiting for you

I've felt the light, I'm satisfied that
The highest high is you
Satellite I'm holding tight
Beaming back to you

Don't you worry
I believe your story
You were put away
For something you didn't do
While I'm waiting
I've been saving my love
