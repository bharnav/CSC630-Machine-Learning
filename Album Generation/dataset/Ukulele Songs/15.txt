Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say "nighty-night" and kiss me
Hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
'Cause I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on
Oh, craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this, oh

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
