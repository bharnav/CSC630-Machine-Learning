Lonely cliffs and waterfalls
If no one sees me, I'm not here at all
You could be the one to liberate me from the sun
So please, give the moon to me

I'd be indebted to ya
Walk the dog and pay rent to ya
If you'd say the word
I'm yours
I'm sure

Nothing ever goes my way
But with you here that only has changed
Suddenly I'm a newborn child
And I'm ready to live awhile with you
There's so much left to do

And so I thank you dearly
For letting me see clearly
"Open up," she said. "Be you
Be true."

Now I'm at home in my own skin
I'm like an ocean whose tide's come in
Yes, you could be the one to hold my hand beneath the full moon
You could be the one, you're true
You're true
You're true
You're true
You're true
