I know (I know) you belong
To somebody new
But tonight
You belong to me

Although (although) we're apart
You're a part of my heart
But tonight
You belong to me

Way down by the stream
How sweet it will seem
Once more just to dream in
The moonlight

My honey I know with the dawn
That you will be gone
But tonight
You belong to me

But tonight
You belong to me
