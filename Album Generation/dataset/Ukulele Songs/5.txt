Don't mind me, just let me be
My eyes so far away
I don't need no sympathy
The word gets overplayed

I'm alright, it's just tonight
I can't play the part
I'm alright, it's alright
It's just a broken heart

Don't have eyes for the world outside
They're closed and turned within
Trying to find the light inside
It's there, yet glowing dim

I'm alright, it's just tonight
I can't play the part
I'm alright, it's alright
It's just one broken heart
