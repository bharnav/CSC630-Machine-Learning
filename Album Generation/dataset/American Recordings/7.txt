[Verse 1]
Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee Stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I got a letter to my Uncle Bud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

[Chorus]
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud

[Verse 2]
Well I rode right down into no man's land
Crossed that river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard foe
Got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and
I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

[Chorus]
