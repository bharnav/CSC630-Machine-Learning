I built this house
With my own hands
And she just came
And heard the plans
She found the safe
And cracked the code
She grabbed the goods
And hit the road

And I'm
Feeling dumb
Oh, oh, girl
You're the one

Who shut off my electricity
Explained we just lack chemistry
And on the walls and on the shelves
She hung up pictures of herself

And I'm keeping one
Oh, oh, girl
You're the one

That makes it hard to
Lock my doors at night
Even my fire alarms won't work right
And as I try to sleep I
Glance next door
And all I see is his lips touching yours
Oh girl

I will dig a hole and label it love
And trick her to fall in from above
Strategically placed at the front door
I'll coax her to come back to get more

Oh, girl
You're the one
Oh, oh girl

That makes it hard to
Lock my doors at night
Even my fire alarms won't work right
And as I try to sleep I
Glance next doors
And all I see is his lips touching yours
Oh girl

That makes it hard to
Lock my doors at night
Even my fire alarms won't work right
And as I try to sleep I
Glance next door
And all I see is his lips touching yours
Oh girl
