There exists a melody
That just might change your mind
Oh if only i knew the key
To sing to make you mine

Then i saw it on your keyboard
And you saw it on my sleeve
I never knew a heart existed
Outside of make believe
Till i read it on your keyboard
I knew at least i might just have a chance
To catch a shooting star

There exists a star above
That always steals my stare
And there exists a star on stage
That never seems to care

And then i saw it on your keyboard
And you saw it in my eyes
I didn't mean to scare you
You just seem really nice
And then i read it on your keyboard
I knew at least i might just have a chance
To catch a shooting star
