Present for a presentation presented presently
Theres no i in team no me in us no you in we
I'll write down letters inside letters but i can't let her see
Pass them forward with a foreword they won't mean a thing

Treasure torn out paper from the corner of a page
Measure worn out epigrams for signs of change with age
Figure out that figuratives mark figure a and b
Images i imagined with pretty imagery (means you and me)

(you and me) we could be made for this
(just wait and see) we might be made for this

Its so far away but i've planned a date
And thats at least a start to get inside your heart
It might be you and me oh we could be a team
It might be you and me oh just wait and see

(you and me) we could be made for this
(just wait and see) we might be made for this
