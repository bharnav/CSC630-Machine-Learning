Oh, it is love
From the first time I set my eyes up on yours
Thinking oh, is it love?

Oh dear
It's been hardly a moment
And you are already missed
There is still a bit of your skin
That I've yet to have kissed
Oh say please do not go
But you know you know that I must
Oh say I love you so
But you know you know you can trust
We'll be holding hands once again
All our broken plans I will mend
I will hold you tight so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my hand into yours
Thinking Oh is it love?

Oh dear, its been hardly three days
And I'm longing to feel your embrace
There are several days
Until I can see your sweet face
Oh say wouldn't you like to be older and married with me
Oh say wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be
Someday holding hands in the end
All our broken plans will have been
I will kiss you soft so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?

Ohhh
Your heart may long for love that is more near
So when I'm gone these words will be here
To ease every fear
And dry up every tear
And make it very clear
I kiss you and I know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?

Oh it is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?

Oh I kiss you and I know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
