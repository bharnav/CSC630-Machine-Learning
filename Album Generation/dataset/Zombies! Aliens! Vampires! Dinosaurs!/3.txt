Holding my breath
For a whole month
If I held your breath
At least we would touch

Keeping from you
Keeps me from sleep
It's just this bad beat
That I just can't keep

Oh girl, it's true
I can never be away from you
It's like you gloss your lips with glue
Oh we kiss and I am stuck to you

My heart's on the floor
My feet feel like lead
I'd quit the tour
But I'm already dead

Our only connection is synthetically
We show our affection electronically

Oh girl, it's true
I can never be away from you
It's like you gloss your lips with glue
Oh we kiss and I am stuck to you

We lock lips and throw the key out
Till it slips that
I must leave town
Our love reaches
Across oceans
To your beaches
Lonely notions

Oh girl, it's true
I can never be away from you
It's like you gloss your lips with glue
Oh we kiss and I am stuck to you
