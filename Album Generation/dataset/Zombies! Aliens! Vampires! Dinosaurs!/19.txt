Every night I see you standing on the corner
Shaking that thang like you're playing pop warner
Touchdown turnaround play by play keep the score
Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for

I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you
Threw so hard

Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and everytime I am yours and you are mine

Little league '93 taught me how to take defeat
Good thing there's no mercy rule in love cause I would long be beat
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
Accept my loss and head back to the mound

I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you
Threw so hard

Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and everytime I am yours and you are mine
Everywhere and everytime I am yours and you are mine

Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and everytime I am yours and you are mine
