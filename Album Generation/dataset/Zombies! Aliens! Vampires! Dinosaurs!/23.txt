You take a seat right next to me
And i take my lit notes nervously
Ive gotta stay calm i just want you to stay
I am always daydreaming
Hoping you've dreamt of the same thing
I've gotta stay calm i don't this to change

I've been assuming everything
Hoping you'll soon mean everything
I've gotta stay calm i want this to be real
I dont think you're into me
And truely that's okay with me
I've gotta stay calm and find out how you feel

So if you wanna say 'i-i-i like you'
I might feel just like you
If you choose-choose not to
I knew you-you would

Sometimes i think i am out of my league
And then sometimes i think i can dream
Sometimes i wish i could be the one fish
That you choose out of all in the sea

We are non existant
But i'll try to be persistant
I've gotta keep on if want to be close to you
I know you're uninterested
I'm probably just some stupid kid
I could give up if you would want me to

So if you wanna say 'i-i-i like you'
I might feel just like you
If you choose-choose not to
I knew you-you would

Sometimes i think i am out of my league
And then sometimes i think i can dream
Sometimes i wish i could be the one fish
That you choose out of all in the sea

Sometimes i think i am out of my league
And then sometimes i think i can dream
Sometimes i wish i could be the one fish
That you choose out of all in the sea
