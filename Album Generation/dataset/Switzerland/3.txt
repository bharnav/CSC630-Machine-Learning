You can come and see me
But I don't glow in the dark
So you're gonna have to learn to use a little night vision

Then you must decide
Who resides in your heart
And baby I know that's not an easy decision

Oh, I went bananas
When I spoke with you on the telephone
I feel you lie telling me you're all alone

'Cause there's demons in you
And there's demons in me
Is it too dark for you to see?

Now you don't want to hear it
But it's time that you realize
That your eyes aren't being properly utilised

You can turn off the television
You can turn off the lights
But you can't hide from the darkness of your lies, woah

There is a lunatic who lives in the center of your mind
He's eating you and leaving this insanity behind

And he's taking over you
And he's taking over me
Is it too dark for you to see?

You can come and see me in the dark
(If you use night vision)
Don't need no fire and no spark
(If you use night vision)
Give this love a kick start
(If you use night vision)

(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)

In the land of the blind
The night vision users are laughing at the king
But you'd be surprised what you can see
When you shine your evil light on me

There we were
Just the two of us
Watching light fade into darkness

I was dying
But then you saved me
Brought me back, just to say to me, woah

There are asteroids in the sky brighter than you ever will
There are humanoids that love money so much that they would kill

And it's taking over you
And it's taking over me
Is it too dark for you to see?

You can come and see me in the dark
(If you use night vision)
Don't need no fire and no spark
(If you use night vision)
Give this love a kick start
(If you use night vision)

(Night vision)
Come and see me in the dark
(Night vision)
Come and see me in the dark
(Night vision)
Come and see me in the dark
(Night vision)

(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)

(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)
(Night vision)
