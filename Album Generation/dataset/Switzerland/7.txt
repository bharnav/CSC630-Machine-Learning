When the time comes to document what we did here
The transcription won't really be that hard
Cause I'm a woman-eating monster with a suitcase full of fire
And pink flamingos decorate my yard
Yeah, pink flamingos decorate my yard

Do you remember that young girl who did all those things with her body?
Yeah, I guess you could say it was me who gave her her start
I hear she's working for President Clinton the way she used to work for me
But my pink flamingos keep pecking at her heart
Yeah, my pink flamingos keep pecking at her heart

[Chorus]
And they never fly away
In my front yard they stay
And baby, I sometimes find it odd
You've got to climb the statue of the demon to get closer to God

Yep

Now there's a crowd outside demanding my resignation
And a policeman about to draw his gun
Seems I've lost this battle, but the war has just begun
Cause my pink flamingos will outlive everyone
Yeah, my pink flamingos will outlive everyone

[Chorus]
