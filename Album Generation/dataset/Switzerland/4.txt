[Verse 1]
I rode a sex wave and washed up on your shore
A twist of fate, I was just what you were looking for
Young rollerskater, trained in CPR
Saying "Boy, you just don't know how lucky you are"

[Pre-Chorus]
It's whipping me, it's whipping you
Turning black, turning blue, hell no
Now I'm just a statue in the garden
Where your evil flowers grow

[Chorus]
Calling unprotected girls
Infected girls do it better
Calling unprotected girls
Infected girls do it better

[Verse 2]
Increase the power (Increase it!) to a higher level
I like you better when you're possessed by the devil
I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul
Now I'm just another number at the Center for Disease Control

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like a fire down below (Feels like a fire down below)
Now I'm just a statue in the garden
Where your evil flowers grow

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's whipping me, it's whipping you
Turning black, turning blue, hell no
Now I'm just a statue in the garden
Where your evil flowers grow

[Chorus 2x]
