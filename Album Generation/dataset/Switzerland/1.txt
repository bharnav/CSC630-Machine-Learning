And I don't mind your rabid doggy
And I don't mind it when it bites
Cause the days and nights and the nights are longer
We're watching days turn into nights

[Chorus]
Yeah
I buy the drugs I light the fire
I am your main supplier
I am your man and I buy the drugs
I can be the jump start for the car parked in your mind
Cause you left the lights on all night long
We can drive for miles and miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles and miles away

Have you ever smelled the clothes, her sexy clothes?
Have you ever got to know her like I do?
Have you ever reversed roles? Gave up control?
Stayed home and let your woman support you?


If you ever find yourself in need
You can submit your request in writing
And this is what you do

Send in a self addressed stamped envelope
To: PO Box 900
Los Angeles, California
90212

And I will fill your perscription with some degree of accuracy
And then I'll send it back to you
And then I'll send it back to you
And then I'll send it back to you

Yeah, I buy the drugs
I buy the drugs
I buy the drugs
I buy the drugs
