Now there was a dancefloor
At the hottest nightclub in town
Politicians and celebrities
Always going to get down, get down

And they won't let me go in
(Because I got no status)
I went there with my friends
And they just laughed at us

One of these days I'm gonna burn the whole thing to the ground

Pulling the plug on the party
Pulling the plug on the party
Pulling the plug on the party
Pulling the plug on the party

Now just because no one likes you
Don't mean they don't want you around
They wanna throw things at you
And for an encore they push you down, push you down

They sent a man to the moon just to watch him die
We dropped turkeys out of planes just to fill up the sky
And they know damn well that they can't fly

Pulling the plug on the party
Pulling the plug on the party
Pulling the plug on the party

Baby now look at what you made me do
Cause I only came here to party with you
Baby now look at what you made me do
Cause I only came here to party with you, with you

Now I C-A-N-T S-T-A-N-D I-T
I can't stand it any more
I'm tired of dancing on this floor
And I've seen all of this before

I've seen all of this before
I've seen all of this before
I've seen all of this before

Baby now look at what you made me do
Cause I only came here to party with you
Baby now look at what you made me do
Cause I only came here to party with you, with you
