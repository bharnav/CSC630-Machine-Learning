Remember when you walked into my life
All dressed up in leather?
Remember when you whispered to me
We should always be together?

But girls like you ruin the future
Girls like you ruin my life
Girls like you make guys like me make love to a computer

Every night's another nightmare
And I can't wake up
I go bananas and every time I see your face
I self destruct

Remember when you told me
That you wanna ride the rubber rocket?
Remember when you told me that you want to
Plug my plug into your socket?

But girls like you turn into witches
Girls like you turn into beasts
Girls like you find guys like me and eat our vital organs

Every night you're the monster
Living underneath my bed
I go bananas and every time I see your face
I'm better off dead

This is what I turn into when I get really hungry
Man become machine and machine becometh monkey
This is what I turn into when I get close to you
When I get close to you

Every night's another nightmare
And I can't wake up
I go bananas and every time I see your face
I self destruct

Yeah, check this out one time
