The band in hell
Plays all night long
It's a sold out show
And there is only one song

There is no rhythm
And there is no rhyme
It goes on forever
Until the end of time

And now the devil he plays guitar
And Hitler plays the drums
I'm the man on the microphone
This is what I've become

I'm sorry that
I'm sorry that I love you
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I am what I am
Another coal on the fire

Now there was once a man
Who walked the Earth with no shoes
He went from town to town
Playing rhythm and blues

And there was love in every note that he played
And there was truth in every word that he sang
He offered those who believed his guarantee
But somehow he missed me

And I'm sorry that
I'm sorry that I love you
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I am what I am
A damnation to you

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
