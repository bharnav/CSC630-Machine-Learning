Policeman watching you
I see everything the policeman sees
City's on fire, it's a billion degrees, oh

The policeman he waves me through
That's the difference between me and you
We're watching hot tits on ice till we freeze, oh

White DJ in Detroit
Black MC in Tokyo
White girl in a black Blockbuster Video, oh

(Aah, something wrong with us)
There's something very wrong with us tonight
(Aah, something wrong with us)
There's something very wrong with us tonight
So let's go out tonight

Subway passenger
I see everything that the passenger sees
One hundred buildings for every five trees, oh

And I will ride till the ride is through
That's what the passenger's expected to do
Looking to pick up a Japanese
Venereal disease

Dutch hip-hop in Atlanta
Tight new R&B in Estonia
And just another sick American at Yoshinoya, oh

(Aah, something wrong with us)
There's something very wrong with us tonight
(Aah, something wrong with us)
There's something very wrong with us tonight
So let's go out tonight
