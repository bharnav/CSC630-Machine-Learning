Government man, important man
Walking around at night
He's got his whiskey, he's got his briefcase
He's gonna be alright

Now when you hear those sirens
Don't you think it's just a drill
'Cause when El Presidente pulls the trigger
He always shoots to kill

There are Germans in Mexico
Germans In Mexico
Taking over tonight
Falling in love with your daughter

There's only so many rabbits
That you can pull out of your hat
There's only so much time now
You know we're running out of that

Ayudame, American fighter jets
For without you we shall not win
They come with the light and take our women
For sale in Berlin

There are Germans in Mexico
Germans In Mexico
Taking over tonight
Falling in love with your daughter
Taking over tonight
Falling in love with your daughter
