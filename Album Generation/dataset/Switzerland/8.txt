[Verse 1]
The need to turn it up is overwhelming
I just can't sit still anymore
I want to break things with my hammer
I want to start a little war
Isn't that what this little red button here is for?

[Chorus]
I wish this song was louder
I wish this song was louder

[Verse 2]
Evil policemen patrol the city
They look for somebody to kill
They've done a little damage
They want to do some more now
And they probably will
And they probably will

[Chorus]
I wish this song was louder
I wish this song was louder

[Verse 3]
One night I had a vision
That the world was taken over
By a race of dirty filthy birds
I dropped to my knees
And I begged for mercy
But they never understood a word
No, I was never heard

[Chorus]
Hey now cheeky monkey
Take a ride on the dirty donkey
I wish this song was louder
I wish this song was louder
