A window left open
And the pillow is soaking wet
Who says love, ever comes without tolls
She sends no kindness
No words of regret
When she put the fork in the road
There's a ring with a diamond missing
It was lost in the backseat of a car
There's a dollar on the floor in the kitchen
Christmas lights blinking on a long dead
Tree in the parlour
Cheaters never prosper
Cheaters never win
Long hair big eyes
And she always needs money
Did I find her?
Or was she the one who chose?
I wanna drown
Like a fly in the honey
And she stole the blush
From the rose
Long hair big eyes and she always needs money
Did i find her
Or was she the one who chose
I wanna drown
Like a fly in the honey
Because she stole the blush
From the rose
