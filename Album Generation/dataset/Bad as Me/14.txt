Why plant a seed deep in the ground
Why put a stone on a grave in town

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me why it's so
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me so I'll know

Why does a wedding ring have the hardest stone
Why does a little dog bury its bone

So the river will not drown it
So the highway won't take it
And the dust will not cover it
And the sun will not blind it
And the wind won't blow it away

Why put a song bird in a cage
Why write i love you on every page

Tell me why it's so
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me so I'll know

Why does a bird build its nest so high
Why hold a baby when a baby cries

So the river will not drown it
So the highway won't take it
And the dust will not cover it
And the sun will not blind it
And the wind won't blow it away
So the river will not drown it
So the highway won't take it
And the dust will not cover it
And the sun will not blind it
And the wind won't blow it away
