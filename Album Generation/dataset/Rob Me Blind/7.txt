Well, that bullet in your mouth
Found the easy way out
Won't be long until you're sorry
The future was lookin' starry
Now your eyes are sweating doubt
You look good in them jeans
Do you know what love means?
They said just do the things you do
And love'll just come to you
They left out all the in betweens

[Chorus:]
I have found effort combined with indifference
Is the formula for success
And the prisoner most craving deliverance
Is the one proffered it less
Why won't you liberate me?
Im a captive refugee
From this myth of happiness
Still a believer i guess
I dont always feel on
In fact im usually turned off
But i am drawn into your grieving
And you're smile's not so deceiving
I can take the faceoff
And he coulda, woulda, wasn't
I am, will, have, did
If tomorrow i died
No one could say i hadn't tried
Even succeeded, god forbid

[Chorus]
You say you don't have love
What if love truly is an action?
Can't learn to walk until you crawl
But why does a building have to fall
For a man to show compassion

[Chorus]
Will you believe with me? Say yes
