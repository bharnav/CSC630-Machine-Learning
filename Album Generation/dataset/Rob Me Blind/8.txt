Coulda been a lawyer, a fireman
Engineer in cairo, ambassador to japan
Instead im stretched here, fire pit underneath
Steel strings bound my body, this metal grill to my teeth
In 20 seconds, can you scream something for us
And in 6 seconds arrive at the chorus?
Cue smoke, flash lights, enter the fountain of youth
You can sell us anything but the truth

[Chorus:]
I am confused about "give peace a chance"
How much was music, how much makeup and dance?
Peace is a product someone plants in your head
Welcome to the state of music, population: spoon-fed
I entered the minefield, armed with something simple i wrote
But one of the three songs on radio exploded down my throat
A little bit queasy from the shrapnel i ate
Would it be too much to ask for a little soul on my plate?
What an adorable artistic dream
Now everybody taste the machine
Industry's changed, it's not our fault
Can i pass you the sensory assualt?

[Chorus]
Thank you dolores for inspiring me
Thank you to lisa for your pure melody
In awe of joni and the words she commands
Breathtaking fingerwork from both ani's hands
Tracy for run- run- run- run- running and hope
The irish goddess whose voice rivaled the pope
So how the hell to fill the asics on me?
If i dont know who i am, everyone will tell me

[Chorus]
