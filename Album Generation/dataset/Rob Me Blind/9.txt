I never believed in love
I never believed in love
But it barreled through, and changed my view
When love took the form of you
We had a good long ride
Yes, we had a damn good time
Rolling along, unrestrained
To our melody, unchained
I was betrayed by love
Something no one warned me of
Love pushed me down on bended knee
Love made a fool of me
So I turned my back on love
Yes, I turned my back on love
Stick nor stone came near my throne
While I spent eight years alone
So now I believe in love
Yes, now I believe in love
I’ll pin love down, make love see
Love better believe in me
I’ll pin love down, make love see
Love better believe in me
