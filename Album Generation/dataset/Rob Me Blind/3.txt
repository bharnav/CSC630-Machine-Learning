Can we clear the air between us?
And can we do it soon?
I've been clawing at the mortar
Your nails are dirty too
When night falls, I crawl
To the window and reach for the pain
I'll fall
But I call you anyway
Someday we'll be eating lobster
And drinking fine champagnes
I'll sell seashells by your seashore
'til you swim through my veins
He who sails is he who discovers
Let's hear anchors aweigh
There's space to claim under these covers
You steer clear of here, anyway
You and me we spark
No I take that back
Like a dancer in the dark
My beauty it's black
Just match your lips up to mine
Come on and steal a kiss or rob me blind
You dont need another player gambling for your charms
Dreaming of a victory wrapped up in your coat of arms
I bid more if you're taking score, and i'm all set to pay
But I'll lose cause you'll choose him, anyway
You and me we spark
No I take that back
Like a dancer in the dark
My beauty it's black
Just match your lips up to mine
Come on and steal a kiss or rob me blind
The greatest thing I ever learned is I dont know a thing
The hardest thing I ever earned is a chance in the ring
"simple boys make better boyfriends"; that just isn't true
And time will tick 'til you can see there's no simple in loving you
Oh oh oh
You and me we spark
No I take that back
Like a dancer in the dark
My beauty it's black
Just match your lips up to mine
Come on and steal a kiss or rob me blind
