Here she comes
Lady luck again
Figure of eight
Six and nine again
I...I...Got my lady with the spinning head
Whatever the deal
She won't let me down
Wherever I go
She's always hanging 'round
I...I...Got my lady with the spinning head
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
She's been gone
But I knew she'd be back
She's got the rent
She put me in the black
I...I...The lady with the spinning head
If I ever let go
She'd cure my blues
She's the one
In Italian shoes
I'm on top
When she's around
She's my ticket
Out of town
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la la la la la la la la la
Lady with the spinning head
Here she comes
Lady luck again
Figure of eight
Six and nine again
