There's a big storm a coming
Of this I've no doubt
That storm's gonna blow your little world inside out
When the wild winds let up
When the violence wanes
You'll think of me then, when you're watching it rain
It ain't the wind, it's the rain

When the rain won't stop falling
When the flood waters rise
When all that you're sure of washes out with the tide
You'll have no crazy lover there to make you look sane
You'll think of me then, when you're knee deep in rain
It ain't the wind, it's the rain

When rain fills the river and dark waters spill
Over the levee and rush down the hill
They'll carry me with them
I won't have to explain
There'll be no confusion
There'll only be rain

I was born lonesome, and I'm lonesome still
Ain't nothing you done ever changed how I feel
When the storm clouds are building, when the deluge takes aim
I know what's coming, I know the rain
I see what's coming, I know the rain
It ain't the wind, it's the rain
It ain't the wind, it's the rain
It ain't the wind, it's the rain
