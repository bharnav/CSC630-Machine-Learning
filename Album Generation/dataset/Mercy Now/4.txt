When they ask about us
As friends always do
Remember the good times
Honey, we had a few
I'll never condemn you
I'll take all the blame
You got a good answer
When they speak my name

Just say she's a rhymer
And rhymers get restless
Just say that she's out there in search of a song
I know I hurt you
But I never meant to
Just say she's a rhymer
Just say she's gone

You know that I loved you
You know that I tried

You know that it hurt me
Each time that you cried
When your crying is over
And your new life begins
I won't be around much
So when you see our friends

Just say she's a rhymer
And rhymers get restless
Just say that she's out there in search of a song
I know I hurt you
But I sure never meant to
Just say she's a rhymer
Just say she's gone
Just say she's a rhymer
Just say she's gone
