Written by Mary Gauthier and Dale Keys

Silly me, what was I thinking
I coulda sworn you still loved me
But I'm a fool born to chase rainbows
I could never hold you to what you said with your eyes

You and me, hey, weren't we something?
You're holding my hand in that picture hanging in the hall
Well, I took it down after you left
Now there's an empty space on the wall

Empty spaces ain't nothing new
Rainbows ain't something that you hold on to
They move out as the storm moves through
Empty spaces ain't nothing new

Every day
I wake up and wonder
How will I make it on my own?
Silly me, what was I thinking
I was on my own all along

Empty spaces ain't nothing new
Rainbows ain't something that you hold on to
They move out as the storm moves through
