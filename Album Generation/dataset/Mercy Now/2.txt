The parade of souls is marching across the sky
Their heat and their light bathed in blue as they march by
The All Stars play "When the Saints Go Marching In"
A second line forms and they wave white hankies in the wind

Satchmo takes a solo, and he flashes his million dollar smile
Marie Laveau promenades with Oscar Wilde
Big Funky Stella twirls her little red umbrella to the beat
As the soul parade winds its way down Eternity Street

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
So, ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Mardi Gras Indians chant in the streets at sundown
Spyboy meets Spyboy, and Big Chief meets Big Chief uptown
They circle and sway in their rainbow colored feathers and beads
They prance like peacocks, children of slavery freed

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
Roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

The Krewe of the Crossbones parades into the midnight sun
They march through the fire and come out beating homemade drums
While the French Quarter Queens in their high-heeled drag disguise
Sing "Over the Rainbow" 'til Judy Garland quivers and sighs

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Flambeau dancers light the walkway to Jean Pierre's
There's a party tonight and all the girls are gonna be there
Sipping wormwood concoctions, drinking absinthe and talking trash
It's a red carpet, black tie, all night, celestial bash

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
I said roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
