Happy Anniversary, baby
It's been a year now since you moved away
Even though I asked you to go
I miss you every day
I miss you in the evenings
Alone in the bed where I lie
I miss you in the morning
Before I open my eyes

I went and sold everything that I could, babe
Then I gave away what didn't sell
I moved south to Nashville
I might like it there, but I can't tell
I been hanging in Austin
Eating Chili's and good Bar-B-Q
Writing songs about losing and heartache
Hey babe, I been writing 'bout you

A year, that ain't nothing
When you lose someone you love
A year is a drop in a bucket
When you lose someone you love

I been traveling hard since September
I won't get back to Nashville till June
I've played my songs all over the world
But I can't find a home without you
I press on like a mad rushing river
I press on with the will to survive
Part of me lives for the wind in my face
While the other part's barely alive

A year, that ain't nothing
When you lose someone you love
A year is a drop in a bucket
When you lose someone you love

So Happy Anniversary, baby
May fortune and fate be your friends
Wherever you go, I want you to know
I don't think my love ever ends
I carry it down the highway
It's a part of my body and soul
And one day it'll be the part of me
That will pull me up out of this hole

A year, that ain't nothing
When you lose someone you love
A year is a drop in a bucket
