Well it's a high afternoon
Looking down at the city
And my ain't it pretty
Just look at them lights

And as the sun sits still
And we spin around it
It's just the way we found it
As we slip into the night

And somebody's baby
She been graced by the sun
But she's pale as the moonlight
And she's having her fun

Fire in the darkness
As the deal goes down
In somebody's bedroom
She's loosing her crown

And there ain't no answer
Ain't it nice so nice
Don't you get so tired of looking
Feel the weight upon your eyes

And there ain't no burden
Except your own damned mind
You got to get high and fly back home
So we can have a good time

I went down to the river
And my body went under
It was cold on the bottom
Where the sun never shines

And I rose to the top
And my skin felt warm
I got a brand new start
A brand new heart
And a brand new mind

And somebody's baby
In a far away town
Is born to a mother
With a little bitty crown

Fire in the darkness
As my thoughts give in
To the place I was born
The place I will die
And the world I live in
