You wanna make it hard make it hard for me
Call me on the phone every time you set me free

You wanna see me fly baby let me be
You know it makes it hard every time I hear your ring

And there ain't no skin on my burning feet
Girl you got me moving like I never been a-moving
This old familiar pain
Is chasing me again

I know it's gonna sting like an angry bee
Running from the pain till it catches up with me

I never shoulda held you in my arms
Cause now I gotta hold you even when you're gone

And there ain't no skin on my burning feet
Girl you got me moving like I never been a-moving
This old familiar pain
Is gonna waste me once again
