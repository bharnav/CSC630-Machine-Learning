Take me off the mantle babe
Put me in a frame of mind
I don't need nobody
I just need a place I can spend my time
I have all I want, and I give all I can
A drink and a smile and the ghost of a man
Take me off the mantle babe
Put me in a frame of mind

Take me off your dresser babe
I'll just make you cry some more
You don't need me sitting there
Staring at you, I don't love you no more
Well I guess that ain't true, but I'm so far away
And I ain't gonna walk through your door
Take me off your dresser babe
I'll just make you cry some more

My image is shattered
I fall all the time
My smile is a memory
Of an ill fated rhyme
And the funny thing is
I laugh all the time
Take me off the mantle babe
Put me in a frame of mind

Take me off the mantle babe
Put me in a frame of mind
I'm tired of looking at the
Same old pain in the depths of your eyes

I've been here too long
And you know that I'm though
As soon as you move me
Your dreams will come true
Take me off the mantle babe
Put me in a frame of mind
