Hanging on a thriller
Waiting on a killer
Grinding on a coozie
Waiting for the doozie
It all makes sense when you lose your head
Lay down your blues and then wait for the news again

Woohoo woohooo
Woohoo woohoo

Chasing love and money
Never leave your honey
Changing all the time
Leaving on a dime
It all comes clear when you lose the years
Don't make the same mistake I made when I was your age

I got wasted
Yes I got wasted

I'd like to leave you but my love it won't go
I keep on living and you keep forgiving
I want you to know
Every time I leave you alone
I get wasted
Yes I get wasted

Dancing in the club
Lounging in the tub
Playing until you drop
The music never stops
Its all I can do just to keep my cool
Laugh at the game as I pull on the rains
Ride on again
Can't hold me down
Never be the same again
Wasted
Yes I get wasted

I'd like to leave you but my love it won't go
I keep on living and you keep forgiving
I want you to Know
Every time I leave you alone
I get wasted
Yes I get wasted
