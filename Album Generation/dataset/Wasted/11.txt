She loaded up the engineer
She spoke in messages unclear
She rides in silence on the rail
And I trail her
I won't fail her

She won't believe a thing I say
She thinks I'm crazy anyway
Her words they hit me like a hail
But I trail her
I won't fail her

She's breathing fire upon the street
Her eyes are ice upon my feet
Her heart is like a rusty nail
But I trail her
Cause I failed her
