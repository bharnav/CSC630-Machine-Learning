A million dollar bills
In heavy wind begin to twirl
And it's a damn sight hotter now
For the money and the girls
And lately I have seen her softly crying
She says your time..
Your time is running faster than mine

The horses on the trail
They walk together head to tail
But I'm a thousand miles alone
And like a whale I sing my song
And lately I have heard her softly sighing
She says your time..
Your time is running faster than mine

Oh who's gonna slow me
And who's gonna know me
Enough to make time turn around

And will I be faithful or leave
When I'm able
Will she bring me back
Will she bring me back to the ground?

A father late in years
Lays next to beauty close to tears
And it's a damn sight colder now
For the children and their fears
And lately I have heard them softly crying
They say your time..
Your time is running faster than mine
Your time is running faster than mine
