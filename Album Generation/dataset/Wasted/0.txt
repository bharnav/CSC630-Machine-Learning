Misery in company
Alone at last
I'm fast and wandering

You talk to me
I try to see
What's ailing you
Your point of view
I'm wondering

And I can hear the wind
Whisper like a kid
I treat you like I
Want to be treated

A lingering and you
Just walked in
A big mistake and you
Should not take the easy way

It's really hard to
Keep your cards
But when you showed
Them all your players
Called you anyway

I've reached the highest ground
And this is what I found
Just treat me like you want to be treated

Doo doo doo

You're trying to find so peace of mind
You're looking for an open door
You're wandering

And as you look you'll never find
A restless soul with endless goals
Is wandering

And I will stay right here
Surfing down the years
And treat you like I want to be treated
