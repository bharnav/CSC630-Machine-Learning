I don't give a damn about money
When push comes to shove
Cause when all it leaves me
It's just you and I who remain
It's a dire situation when all
Of the nation is broken
I'll be thinking of you
When the last of us slide down the drain

And the angels have schedules to keep
So I won't keep them waiting
I'll find every way that I can
To get back to you

I need to stop running away
From people I love
I need to start looking for
People who love me the same
And the love that I live for
Is one I can't let slide away
And I need to remember the love
That you gave me today

One night I woke up
With the stars in my eyes like a headache
I felt all their twinkling
Burning like fire in my brain
Though the night sky was clear
All around me my tears fell like raindrops
I was so high I was looking
Right down at my pain

And the angels have schedules to keep
So I won't keep them waiting
I'll find every way that I can
To get back to you

I need to stop running away
From people I love
I need to start looking for
People who love me the same
And the love that I live for
Is one I can't let slide away
And I need to remember the love
That you gave me today
