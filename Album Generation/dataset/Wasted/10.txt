So I'm not around, but I still surround you
Can you hear the sound of my love around you?
I won't be able to stay but I am glad that I found you
Is my song ok? Can you hear me love you?

Can you hear me love you from miles away?
Can you hear me love you more than I can say?
Can you hear me love you?

So you ran me down so I ran around you
So I rode you down and now I'm always near you
Do you feel better today to know that I can not leave you?
Is my song okay? Can you hear me love you?

Can you hear me love you from miles away?
Can you hear me love you more than I can say?
Can you hear me love you?

My Melody is love from me, my kisses make of harmony
And know I may be far away, my music is there to stay

Can you hear me love you from miles away?
Can you hear me love you more than I can say?
Can you hear me love you?
