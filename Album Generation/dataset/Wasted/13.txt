I would leave you alone
I'd be hard, but I'd find a way
Cause I know that you know
Where my love stays
You stood in the window of my soul
And I played for you

I ain't desperate
But I know what I've found
I know what I've found

I wanna wake up in the morning
And see your face there
And when the world outside is storming
We'll be safe here
But I know that you need space
To keep your mind still
So let me know just when to go
You know I will, I will

I ain't desperate
But I know what I've found
I know what I've found

I want you to want me around
I want you to want me around

And I don't need you for my joy
I've already found mine
I found it in the way I breathe
The way I keep time
I only want you by my side
To share this love
Feel the rhythm ride the tide
And rise above

I want you to want me around
I want you to want me around

I ain't desperate
But I know what I've found
Lord, I ain't desperate
But I know what I've found
I know what I've found
