Finally we start to get to the heart of the matter
Been thinking so long, wondering what's going on all the time
At the end of the line, there's a whole lot of mindless chatter
When heart of the matter is seen
You'll see what's the matter with me

And I know you're a quick one
But I'm still a quicker one
I'm siding right under your game

You might want to catch me
Cause I'm letting everyone know
You're a cruel and unusual dame
Who don't care who she kills
And gets high of the thrill of it

Finally we start to get to the heart of the matter
Been working so long, not knowing what's wrong all the time
At the end of the line, there's a whole lot of mindless chatter
When heart of the matter is seen
You'll see what's the matter with me

And this is my exit
You've broken the neck of it
Look at that blood on the seats

You might want to hide
Cause I'm gonna confide in the first one I see
When I finally break free from this crazy relationship
I'm fucking sick of it

Finally we start to get to the heart of the matter
Been working so long, not knowing what's wrong all the time
At the end of the line, there's a whole lot of mindless chatter
When heart of the matter is seen
You'll see what's the matter with me
