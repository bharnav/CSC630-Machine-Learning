I was sittin' in my daddy's car
With a joint in both of my hands
Smokin' till the smoke wouldn't stop
And the windows roll down
And I'm rolling around in my mind
Waiting for some time to fly

Fork in the road and I know
Where to go but I'm scared to do it
And I'm as stoned as you are
Firing far

I'm a listening fool
And I know just where you are

So don't take me back
To where I came from
I don't want to go back
To where I came from

I'm only sitting and listening
As my baby tries to take me home
I'm only sitting and listening
As my baby tries to take me home

There's calm in your eyes
Like a shadow falling
Taking the piss from mine

You got a way to persuade
But I ain't going nowhere
No I ain't leaving today

I'm just sitting and listening
As my baby tries to take me home
I'm only sitting and listening
As my baby tries to take me home

No I ain't going nowhere
But my baby's trying to take me home

Just stay here baby
Just sit right down
Smoke this joint
Burn it down
Take me with you
Let's get out of here now
I don't want to go home

I'm only sitting and listening
I'm sitting and listening
I'm sitting and listening
As my baby tries to take me home
Here I go baby
