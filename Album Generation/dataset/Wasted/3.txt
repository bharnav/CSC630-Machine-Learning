I feel so alive right now
It's not the first time
I felt this way
So I've started get to thinking about
Another way to occupy my day

I'm going to sit around and smoke my pipe
And make sure I'm still alive
I'm going to smoke my joint all night
And feel alive

Give me something to think about but me
I'm going to come around the bend again
It's taken it's time. It's taken it's toll
So I'm just going to let it roll

Let me smoke my pipe
Make sure I'm still alive
I'm gonna smoke my joint all night
And feel alive

Give me something to think about but me
I'm come around the bend again
It's taken it's time. It's taken it's toll
So, I'm going to just let it roll

Let me smoke my pipe
And make sure I'm still alive
I'm gonna smoke my joint all night
And feel alive

I'm gonna smoke my joint all night
And feel alive
