She said, I can't help who I love
Or who loves me too
When the water rises up
There's a tree that I cling to
And it isn't you
No it isn't you
Oh yeah

He said, it isn't what you're dealt
It's how you're dealin' with it
And my last card was burned
I didn't pick it
But I'm stuck with a point of view
Yeah, I'm stuck with a point of view
Oh yeah

Wasn't that great
I'm sorry, I love you
Don't tell me I know
You can't let me go

Wasn't that nice
Isn't all that good now

I'm sorry, I told you
I can't let you down

Grab all your precious things
This house is done
She's all alone with him
But he's the one
Who will make it all ok
But where are they gonna stay
Oh oh
