[Verse 1]
Ooh my honey
You got me working day and night
Ooh my sugar
You got me working day and night

[Verse 2]
Scratch my shoulder
It's aching, make it feel alright
When this is over
Loving you will be so right

[Verse 3]
I often wonder
If loving you will be tonight
But what is love girl
If I'm always out of sight (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
(That's why)
You got me working day and night
And I'll be working
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me working, working day and night
You got me working, working day and night
You got me working, working day and night
You got me working, working day and night

[Verse 4]
You say that working
Is what a man is supposed to do
But I say ain't right
If I can't give sweet love to you
(Ah)

[Verse 5]
I'm tired of thinking
Of what my life's supposed to be (Well)
Soon enough darling
This love will be reality (Ah Ah)

[Verse 6]
How can you live girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be (Well)
Then you must be seeing (Woo)
Some other guy instead of me (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
(That's why)
You got me working day and night
And I'll be working
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me working, working day and night
(Hold on)
You got me working, working day and night
(I'm so tired, tired now)
You got me working, working day and night
(Hold on)
You got me working, working day and night
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)

[Verse 7]
You say that working
Is what a man's supposed to do
But I say ain't right
If I can't give sweet love to you

[Verse 8]
How can you live girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be (Well)
Then you must be seeing (Woo)
Some other guy instead of me (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
(That's Why)
You got me working day and night (I don't understand it)
And I'll be working
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me working, working day and night
(Hold on)
You got me working, working day and night
(I'm so tired, tired now)
You got me working, working day and night
You got me working, working day and night

You got me working, working day and night
(Girl)
You got me working, working day and night
(I'm so tired, tired now)
You got me working, working day and night
You got me working, working day and night
(How can I get to you?)
