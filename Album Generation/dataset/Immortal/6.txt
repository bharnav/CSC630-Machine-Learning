[1st Verse]
Live in sin
Ten years ago, on this day my heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me, this is scaring me
We walked up the stairs still concealin' gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, said "This is the place
You said, meet you right here at noon"

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

[2nd Verse]
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul, every smile's a trial
Thought in beguile to hurt me, this is scaring me
Then the man next door had told
"She's been here in tears for fifteen years", this is scaring me
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said, "Love is through"

[Chorus 2X]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil, Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
