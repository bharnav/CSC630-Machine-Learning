[Verse 1]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood
I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my Childhood?

[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known

[Verse 3]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

[Outro]
Have you seen my Childhood
