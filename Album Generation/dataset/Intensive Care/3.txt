[Verse 1]
I used to live 'round here
I was the boy with the flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
I saw her at the place
You know she knows you know
How she shakes
When she jacks her body
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones
And Jocelyn Brown, oh

[Chorus]
Spread your wings
Before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is, darlin'
Follow your heart

[Verse 2]
So she walks into this dead end bar
Sticks her handbag on the chair
So she walks into this dead end bar
Puts her handbag on the chair
And she weighs the words we shared
When we were 15 and still cared
Cause she feels I'm the scar from the wound that time can't heal

[Bridge]
And I said
Don't let your dreams out of your head
Stick it to the man instead
Don't fool your heart
Lying about the feelings that you had back then
(They think they know us but they won't ever know)
Did you try to change your life
(They think they know us but they won't ever know)
Did you ever try to change your life
(They think they know us but they won't ever know)
You repeat and repeat and repeat
(They think they know us but they won't ever know)
Now what's up with that

[Verse 3]
Now she loves somebody else
In flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
And now she paid to have one of those
And she weighs the word she says
And she knows you exist
Now she feels I'm the scar from the wound that time can't heal, oh

[Chorus]
Spread your wings
Before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is, darlin'
Follow your heart

Spread your wings
Before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is, darlin'
Follow your heart
Heart, heart
