[Verse 1]
First they ignore you
Then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you, then you win
When the truth dies, very bad things happen
They're being heartless again

[Chorus 1]
I know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you think we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
When a heart is broken, there's nothing to break (Eternally)

[Verse 2]
You've been mixing with some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own and they all love their mothers
But you're out of your depth, son, have a word

[Chorus 2]
I know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you think we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
The heart is broken, there's nothing to break (Eternally)

[Bridge]
All is wonderful in past lives
Dreaming of the sun she warms
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust
When you think we're lost, we're exploring
What you think is worthless I'm adoring
You don't want the truth, truth is boring
I've got this fever, need to
Leave the house, leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
I'll leave a few shells in my gun
And stop me staring at the Sun

[Chorus 3]
I know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you say we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
My heart is broken, there's nothing to break (Eternally)

[Chorus 2]
I know it's coming, there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you think we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
The heart is broken, there's nothing to break (Eternally)
