[Verse 1]
Let me lie down
Please don't wake me
Nothing`s secret
And no one save me
In my black eye
I can feel it
Moving closer
Can't you hear it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Only gift you gave to me
Was self-fullfilling prophecy
I need to change the sounds that shaped my life

[Chorus]
And if you die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around, there's no one here
To love me and hold me

[Verse 2]
Take me dancing
I love music
Keep on singing
We won't lose it
Picture me there
Missing no one
If your heart run free
Why can't we go on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Go on to till they kick us out
We've everything to talk about
I could bring the song into your life

[Chorus]
If you should die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around, there's no one here
To love me and hold me

[Bridge]
Maybe I've been away too long
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong
They say there's nothing I can do
But talk to strangers and wait for you

[Chorus]
If you should die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around, there's no one here
To love me and hold me

And if you die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around, there's no one here
To love me and hold me
Oooh ooh ooh!
