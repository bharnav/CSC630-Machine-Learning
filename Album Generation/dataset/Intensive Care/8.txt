[Verse 1]
For those about to die, we salute you
For those of about to cry, we love you
For those of us who live in fear
Of Happy Christmas and New Year
I raise a toast to you

[Chorus 1]
And if it hurts to be so blind
Why don't you try being kind

[Verse 2]
They've decided to become
A little more pro-active
Creep upon you while you sleep
And make you less attractive

[Chorus 2]
Born without a spine
Why don't you try being kind

[Verse 3]
For those out drinking at their mother's wake
You'll find a way to soldier on
For those whose love evaporates
I pray you'll find where you belong

[Bridge]
Oh, the words I have repressed
Are coming out today I guess
It's justice, not respect I'm after
And that just leaves comtempt
For you all

[Verse 4]
I am just a simple man
With simple expectations
With deep regrets, they're seldom met
God speed my generation

[Chorus 3]
And with Crowley on my mind
I should try being kind

[Outro]
For those about to die
We salute you
For those of about to cry
We love you
For those about to die
We salute you
For those of about to cry
We love you
