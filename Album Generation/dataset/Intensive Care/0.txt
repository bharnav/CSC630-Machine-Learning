[Verse 1]
Here I stand victorious
The only man who made you come
When you cried, you cried for us
And when we died, you died alone
Gravity's calling
Don't go home
Where are we

Did what I could for one of us
I always thought it was for you
And when I lied
Oh I lied for us
Because you never heard the truth
I am lying alone tonight
Don't go home
Where are we

[Chorus]
If we are ghosts
(A long long time ago)
It looks like we could have made it baby
We are ghosts
(A long long time)
Me and you
We are ghosts
(A long long time ago)
We could have made it
We are ghosts
(A long long time)
Me and you
(Ago)

[Verse 2]
Look at the time it's taken me
To get away from what was said
I'll never leave
I'll always love
You know that all those words are dead
Buried at yours tonight
Move aside
I'm taking you home

[Bridge]
On the radio
She was that summer song
Packing them in
Making them dance
A law of her own
Taking the time to sing it
I don't need you
But I'm lost
Lost without you tonight
Have you no heart
Where are we

[Outro]
Hold a love like gold
(We are ghosts)
Then fold
They're taking down our satellite
(We are ghosts)
Josephine, I follow your star tonight
(We are ghosts)
If not tonight then when will she say
We're not ghosts
