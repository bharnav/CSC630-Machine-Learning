[Verse 1]
So I sing a song to reel 'em in
It's a song I've sung before
And a song I'm gonna sing again
I mean every word
I don't mean a single one of them

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, make me pure
But not yet

[Verse 2]
Tell a joke, tell it twice
If no one else is laughing then why am I
I split my sides both times and laugh until I cry

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, please make me pure
But not yet

[Verse 3]
I don't have to try
I just dial it in
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones beneath this skin

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, make me pure
But not yet

[Verse 4]
Smoking kills, sex sells
I've got one hand in my pocket
But the other one looks cool as hell
I know I'm gonna die so my revenge is living well

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, make me pure
But not yet

[Bridge]
I stopped praying so I hope this song will do
I wrote it all for you
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?

[Verse 5]
So I look for love
I like the search
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe
Every president gets the country she deserves

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, make me pure
But not yet

[Verse 6]
And I've been seeing somebody's wife
She said she'd leave him for me and I said that wasn't wise
You can't lie to a liar because of all the lies

[Refrain]
Oh Lord, please make me pure
Not yet
