[Verse 1]
I'm on a mission
To abuse my position
Abuse it with you
Love, I'm a cynical bitch
I'm gonna scratch that itch
With a bitch like you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Modern thinking's made me miserable
Everything is unforgivable
If not for you I wouldn't come at all

[Chorus]
Find a place to crash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Move your boney ass
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Love me like I'm cash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
You can feel the class
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
(Guitar!)

[Verse 2]
If there's a freak in here
Looking for someone like me
I fit their description perfectly
Boom boom boom
I bet they'll resent you
They would if they met you
Met you with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Every move you make is poetry
They all fake what you do naturally
If not for you I wouldn't come at all

[Chorus ]
Find a place to crash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Move your boney ass
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Love me like I'm cash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
You can see the class
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)

[Bridge]
Kiss me with your mouth
Teach me with your brain
All right

[Outro]
They say I say when I say nothing at all
It leaves a taste in my stomach and it's no taste at all
I can't sing, I can't dance, that it don't stop me at all
Its a ball when I'll call , if I call you at all
Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent
I won't be happy till the money's been spent
I forget to forget, oh fuck it, oh fuck it
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
