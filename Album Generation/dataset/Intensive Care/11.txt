[Intro]
What you do speaks so loud
I cannot hear what you say
Except for the occasional word
So fate`s a sentimental sight
It bothers me
No longer king of bloke and bird

[Bridge]
All of my life
Searching hard
Down in the wilds
Of love

[Chorus]
Summon me now
Summon my life away
Summon me on to another day

[Verse 1]
A hand through the clouds
Keeps knocking me down
It’s no less than I deserve
They build museums
I don’t visit them
I’ve made enough trouble of my own

[Bridge]
Into the night
Searching hard
Look for the lights
Of love

[Chorus]
Summon me now
Summon my life away
Summon me on to another day

Summon the evening, winter waves
I am falling down again
I sing from the chaos in my heart
My heart

[Outro]
Then comes the evening
That makes life worth living
Shoving the shoes out in the light
She walks in
I can hear her
