[Verse 1]
Don't let your eyes tell the brain
You should feel ashamed
Everyone needs it, baby
And I feel the same
Didn't quite catch your name
Hush, hush, hush
Don't say a thing
Let's see what the night will bring
It might be everything

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, it hurts
When you're too blind to see
Please don't read my mind
I tell the truth to me

[Chorus]
Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin, not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer of love and life
Deep inside

[Verse 2]
Hush hush hush
To speak is a sin
And neither of us need rescuing
Just relax
It's what Jesus would do
We're made in his image, baby
Let's ride this thing through

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, it hurts
When you're to blind to see
What about us?
Well, it was just for me

[Chorus]
Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin, not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer of love and life
Deep inside

[Bridge]
I won't sing of amore
It don't sound sincere
Love is a clich√©
But it it's not here
I'll disappear

[Chorus]
Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin, not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer of love and life
Deep inside
Deep inside

[Outro]
It's love
Clean sex joy
I love you
You love my hate
And it feels inside
Feels inside
Feels inside
