[Intro]
Woohoo!

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, here comes no one
Another friend to have a go on
And she asks me, do I miss her when she's gone?
And I reply "as much as I miss anyone"

[Chorus 1]
Oh! woohoo
And I'll be your gay friend
Cause your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
There's a space between us
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a face between us

[Verse 2]
Hey Lord, forgive us if we're wrong
Make sure that he never hears this song
And she says that I'm the opposite of a Hallmark card
She asked me how I'm feeling
When I don't want to think that hard

[Chorus 1]
Oh! woohoo!
And I'll be your gay friend
Cause your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
Theres a space between us
Jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a face between us

[Bridge]
It's the late show now
How does the late show end
Well, if god is in the details
Thank God that you're my friend
I have a friend again
You're my friend again
My gay friend

[Chorus 2]
Oh! woohoo! erhh
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us
And I'll be your gay friend
As your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
There's a space between us
Oh! woohoo!
