[Verse 1]
There's no earthly way of knowing
What was in your heart
When it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you
Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Saying something

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting over
Everything you left

[Chorus]
I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space
No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

[Verse 2]
Through your eyes the world was burning
Please be gentle, I'm still learning
You seemed to say as you kept turning up
They poisoned you with compromise
At what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Did you think the CIA did

[Chorus]
I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space
No one learned from your mistake
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

[Outro]
I've seen your daughter
Man, she's cute
I was scared but I wanted to
Boy, she looks a lot like you
