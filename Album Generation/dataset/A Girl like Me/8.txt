[Verse 1]
Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you
And not to mention good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share you
You might think I'm greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

[Verse 2]
I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
Wut what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share you
You might think I'm greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

[Bridge]
Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (crazy)
So amazing (so amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share you
You might think I'm greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

[Outro]
Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (crazy)
So amazing (so amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding
