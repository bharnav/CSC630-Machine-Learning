[Intro: Rihanna]
Ooh Yeah
Yeah yea

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

[Hook: Rihanna]
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(Woah! Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise
But it's written on my face

[Hook: Rihanna]
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(Woah! Yeah!)

[Verse 3: J-Status]
Girl, it's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay
If you wanna
Come on my bajun baby
Let me take to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby you're my number 1, not number 2
So if its lovin' that you want
Baby, you should make me your boo

[Hook: Rihanna]
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(Woah! Yeah!)

[Hook 2: Rihanna]
Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy baby
I try my best not to show
But you know its so crazy baby
Crazy little thing called love

(A crazy little thing called love)
