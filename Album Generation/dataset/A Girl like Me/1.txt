[Intro]
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie

[Verse 1]
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lusting

[Pre-Chorus]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'

[Chorus]
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missinn
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie

[Verse 2]
You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'

[Chorus]
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'

[Chorus]
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie

[Outro]
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kissses don't lie
