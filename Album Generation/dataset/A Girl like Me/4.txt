[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh, yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think it's so sad

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle haters
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Verse 2: Dwane Husbands]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
They're gonna try to take your life

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
