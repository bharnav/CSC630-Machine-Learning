[Chorus]
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 1]
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

[Verse 2]
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

[Bridge]
I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh

[Chorus]
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 3]
Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
