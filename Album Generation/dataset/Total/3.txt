Hi I’m Sebastian
I’m an addict
I’m addicted to frantic
Spastic language

Now with a chastity
Grown back after ages
Of manic masturbating
Lacked the panache
As of lately
I have
A crass habit of
Having laughs
And dating
A relaxing
Callous lady
Validated
By an affidavit
When I’m exasperated
I amass amazing
Paragraphs’ saturation

A rose is a rose is a rose arisen
The rubescent glow
Arose when
My prose
Approach them
In this prism
Like Chopin’s
Cataclysm
Thumb on a black note
I wrote this rhythm
A blue oeuvre
A hue is soothing
To translucent humans
Like my time as a youth spent
School bench doodling
I pulled my blue pen
Through the movements
Manoeuvred cerulean loops
Drew crude dudes and exuberant
Protruding boobs
For the youths amusement

Freud’s lament meant that
A pen is a penis
I comment that the tittles of i’s
Are eyes at the highest zenith
And with these i see things
Like an asterisk as an ass
And as that i see it
Should I obey the opaque?
Beg for the raise
Never second-guess
My place?
And get there to stay?
Nay, the grey will wane
I don’t believe the
Seemingly easy way
These people say
Their cognizance fade
Before they sleep
They count each sheep’s
Escape
Explained by a sheep’s
Esteemed need to play
To leave the constraining gates
Even when it’s late
I’m Feeling great
These days
In a sleepy daze
I have sleepless nights
Because I’m sheep deprived
I Concoct rhymes
Combine lines
Contrive concubines
My childish mind
Finds kind
