[Verse 1]
Do not get me wrong, I cannot wait for you to come home
For now, you're not here and I'm not there
It's like we're on our own
To figure it out, consider how to find a place to stand
Instead of walking away and instead of nowhere to land

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is gonna break me clean in two
This is gonna bring me close to you

[Chorus]
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

[Verse 2]
It's all up in the air and we stand still to see what comes down
I don't know where it is, I don't know when, but I want you around
When it falls in place with you and I, we go from if to when
Your side and mine are both behind its indication

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is gonna bring me clarity
This'll take the heart right out of me

[Chorus]
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

[Pre-Chorus 3]
This is gonna bring me to my knees
I just wanna hold you close to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

[Outro]
She is everything (I needed)
She is everything
