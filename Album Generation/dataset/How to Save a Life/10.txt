[Verse 1]
She doesn't look, she doesn't see
Opens up for nobody
Figures out, she figures out
Narrow line, she can't decide
Everything short of suicide
Never hurts, nearly works

[Chorus]
Something is scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about

[Verse 2]
A part of you that'll never show
You're the only one that'll ever know
Take it back when it all began
Take your time, would you understand
What it's all about?
What it's all about?

[Chorus]
Something is scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about
No one expects you to get up
All on your own with no one around

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Something is scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about
No one expects you to get up
All on your own with no one around
