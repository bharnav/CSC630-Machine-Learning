[Verse 1]
The how I can't recall
But I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight

[Chorus]
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

[Verse 2]
It's hard I must confess
I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of I love you

[Chorus]
You, right where you are, from right where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

[Bridge]
And who's to say it's wrong?
And who's to say that it's not right?
Where we should be for now?

[Chorus]
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
And this is where I've been
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
