[Verse 1]
Twenty years, it's breaking you down
Now that you understand there's no one around
Take a breath, just take a seat
You're falling apart and tearing at the seams

[Chorus]
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

[Verse 2]
It's on your face, is it on your mind?
Would you care to build a house of your own?
How much longer, how long can you wait?
It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away

[Chorus]
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

[Bridge]
It feels good (Is that reason enough for you?)
It feels good (Is that reason enough for you?)
It feels good (Is that reason enough for you?)
It feels good (Is that reason enough for you?)

[Chorus]
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

[Outro]
Out of this one
I don't know how to get you out of this one
I don't know how to get you out of this one
I don't know how to get you out of this one
I don't know how to get you out of this one
