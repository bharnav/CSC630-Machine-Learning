[Verse 1]
If only I knew what I know
I'd make it a point to say so
To everyone that got me here
And everyone that made it

[Chorus]
Clear I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way
When I was astray

[Verse 2]
I'm doing the best that I could
Trying my best to be understood
Maybe I'm changing slowly
I'd get out, turn around if only I

[Chorus]
Knew I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way
When I was dead wrong all along

[Bridge]
Mine is not a new story
Mine is not a new story
Mine is nothing new
But it is for me

[Chorus]
So I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
You thought I'd lost my way
When I was dead wrong all along
You said it for my sake
That I would not lose my way

[Outro]
Did I really lose my way?
Or are you afraid?
