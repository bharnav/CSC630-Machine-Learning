[Verse 1]
Well this job I've got is just a little too hard
Running out of money, lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning lord, gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line, going down the line
Going down the line, going down the line
Going down the line, going down the line
Beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes I'll be waiting at the station lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I belong
I'm going back to that same old used-to-be
Down in joe brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine [x3]
Down in joe brown's coal mine

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across that railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home [x3]
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home
