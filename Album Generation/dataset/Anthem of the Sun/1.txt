[Verse 1]
Seems like i've been here before
Fuzzy then and still so obscure, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And i don't want to see anybody cry

[Chorus]
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by

[Verse 2]
Song coming on
So pleasing to see, come and gone, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You don't have to tell me why

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It ain't cause i'm the only one left darling
Bout the time the sun rises west
Feeling groovy, looking fine
Think i'll come back here again
Every now and then from time to time
My how lovely you are, my dear
The ball game has gone much too far my dear
Sing to me, do your thing to me

[Outro]
I'll meet you some morning, meet you some morning
In the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by
