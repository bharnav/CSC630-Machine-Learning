1, 2, 3, play

You left on the water running
When you left me behind, baby now
You left all the water running
It's running from these eyes of mine

Baby now that
You turned out the light of love
You left with another guy, honey that me
You turned off all your love for me
But you forgot to turn off the cry
Ooh, forgot to turn off the cry

Baby now that
You pull the shades way down low
And disconnect the telephone
But baby these tears are running from my eyes
I can't turn 'em off and on

Now baby now that
You left on the water running
When you left me behind, let me tell you

That you left all that water running
It's running from these eyes of mine

And now you go
You locked the door
And then you throw the key away, baby now that
You'll regret, baby, you'll be upset, now
When you get your water bill to pay, ooh
When you get that water bill to pay

Honey now that
You left all the water running
When you left me behind, let me tell you
That you left, ooh, the water running
It's running from these eyes of mine

Baby now that
You left, ooh, the water running
Running from these eyes of mine, baby now that
You left all the water running
When you left me behind...
