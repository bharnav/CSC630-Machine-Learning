Standin' outside, y'all
It's raining, children
Gettin' soaking wet
And it's raining, y'all
Been put out, y'all
Nowhere to go, children

People all ask me
"Tell me what's wrong with you"
Tell 'em I've been sick, y'all, yeah
Yes, I've been sick, children, yeah

My baby got me in a terrible shape
Lord, she got me sufferin'
With a headache, yeah

Lord, pain in my heart workin'
Dragging my feet, y'all
Twelve long days, children
Had a bite to eat now

Y'all wanna know, yeah
Tell me what's wrong with me
Said I've been sick, y'all, yeah
Tell you I'm sick, y'all, yeah

Now no doctor's medicine
Will do me no good
Lord have mercy, children
I wished it would, yeah

Somebody, sick, bad shape
Pain, children, tremblin', y'all
Legs are tremblin', Lord
Hands are tied

Feel like I got a headache
Right here in my side
Heart's turning over
Beating like a drum, y'all
Tom tom tom, yeah
Heart's keep a beating, baby

Now what's wrong with me
Tell y'all I'm sick, y'all
Said I'm sick, y'all
Got me in a terrible shape
But nobody's got to
Get me off this shape

Yeah honey, oh y'all
Sufferin', children
Lord, I'm tired of it, honey
Rain is cold, children
Burnin' my side, y'all
Standing on the outside
Water in my shoes, children

She got me suffering, baby
Oh that's bad news, man
She got me moaning, y'all
Troubles out calm, yeah

She got me startin' to think
Where did I come from, y'all
Tell you I've been sick, y'all
Yeah, I've been sick, y'all
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm a wreck, y'all
