You can rock me, baby
Baby, rock me all night long
Rock me, baby, rock me, baby, rock me, babe
You girl, you can't rock me all night long now
Just keep on rockin' me, little girl, girl
Honey, 'til my back ain't got no bone, yeah
Roll me, baby
Roll me like a wagon wheel, now
Keep on rollin', rollin', rollin' me, baby
Just like they roll a wagon wheel now, oh my, now, oh my
Because when you thought you roll, little girl
Baby, you just don't know how good you make me feel now, oh
Yeah, play the blues, Steve
Oh, hey, have mercy
Too much soul, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't do it to me
Don't do it
Don't do it
Don't do
Don't do that
Roll it, baby, yeah
Keep on rocking me, baby, good rockin'
Baby, rock me, rock me so
Keep on rockin' me, baby
Keep rockin' me, keep rockin' me
Baby, you know how to rock me so now, oh my
I want you to just keep on rockin' me, babe
Rock me, babe, rock me
Till I just can't take it no more, oh my
I want you to rock, rock, rock, rock me, babe
Rock me, babe, rock me, babe
I want you to keep rockin' me
You don't know what I want
I want you to keep rocking me
Everything I love
I want you to keep rocking
Give it, give it, give it to me, baby
Keep on rocking me
