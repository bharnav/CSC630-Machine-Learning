[Verse 1]
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

[Chorus]
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Bridge]
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
