[Verse 1]
One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
They don't want to say hello like I want to say hello
Well, the heartbeat's at its peak when you're coming up to speak
And oh, I'm so tense, never tenser, could all go a bit Frank Spencer
And I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh, it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark, you'd see how red my face has gone Yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off
Are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me, say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book
And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads, doing our best tricks, yeah

[Verse 3]
Never again, well, never again, no
Will there be another one quite as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
