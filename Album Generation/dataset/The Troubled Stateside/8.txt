Dusk hits and the whole world gets to be
"Knock three times, tell them who sent you
And who you came to see"
I could find you in any dive
In any one of these dark streets
In a vinyl booth with a stranger
Dripping insincerities

And all those promises to me you mumbled
I guess you'll keep them eventually
To someone else
Hey, "what the hell?", I said

Now we're all former friends treated like guests
In our very own home
As we stare and wonder how someone young
Could get dumber than you

But hey that's what they say about the divorce rate
The kids grow up not trusting anything
But I won't forget the day when you came to me backstage
Just to see what I would say about your newest mistake

Duck hits and the whole world gets to see
You hide out in some Green Point diner
With all the indie rockers and the graphic designers
Diving through the alleys of these dark streets
With a vinyl smile dripping with insincerity

Hell you sure fooled me

But hey that's they say
About two products of the divorce rate
And if this fate is ours to embrace
You can come find me backstage
But I won't be anyone's mistake
