Home: Embrace the concept, can't afford the place
As the long knives of the night were keeping you awake
I called you up just to learn the rain stretched across the states
Drowning the soft features of your face, for heaven's sake

It just goes to show
You can't hang out and just go to shows
From your studio apartment hiding from
The student loans department all alone

It just goes to show
When we're on the road just going to shows
I feel the long chains of space around our throats
I'm coming home
