Vanished in fury of smoke
Before she left she spoke
About a problem and a plan

She said "I plan to make my escape
Gonna check out the United States
Can't take this island wasteland"

How can I be who I want when they know me as who I am?
Besides, people work their whole lives hoping to get here
I figure they could use the room
A great place to get rich, have kids and die
I probably won't be coming back so soon
How can I be who I want if I stay here with you?

So goodnight, Dark Island
It's the weight of life spent peeking out
From beneath the trees
The way the front lawns wander on endlessly

And it's not a bad life, working 9-5
Weekend gardening and cheating on your wife
But if you find yourself broken in the slow mercury of days
And have the courage for the traffic
I know a secret to escape
Just be who it is they want. It's easy to find your way

I can't help feeling like there's never enough
Never enough room for any love
Between the tanning bed marquees
And roadside church displays
I feel like there's never enough
Friends or any friendly faces
Just a bunch of clever ways to say, "Jesus Saves"
