So I wanted goals
I saw all I needed was a home
With a view of something beautiful
A woman that I trusted
The friends that I grew up with
But it was asking too much for just us

To pray things stay in exactly the same way

And so we drift together
Saying "Every mirror shows the same ugly shell
We've shared forever"
We drift together, yet apart and alone
The only role for these lonely souls

And you can see
By the lonely numbers on my bank receipts
And you can see
The lonely space between these sheets
And you can see
By the ravenous company I keep
Comforts are few and far between

So pray things stay in exactly the same way

But just this once I'll have you know, this is not a lonely soul

This world has other sorrows than love
