Hey, I know it's getting pretty late
But I was wondering
How are things around the office these days?
Did your boss ever give you that raise?
Does that guy still work next door
The one with two bands that are great?

Anyway, I guess I'm just calling to say
I was thinking back to when we went to school upstate
With a full week before classes in September
You got the best seat in the house
Sprawled out on the couch "for the night"
And stayed there the whole semester

Hey, I know it's getting pretty late
But I was thinking I could swing by
Your office tomorrow on your break
You could tell your roommate to cover us while we're away

Do you think that it would be a shame
If I wished that we were back in school again?
If only so I could walk you home
Before you got your own place
With your own bills to pay
But I know it's getting late
And tomorrow morning you've got work

I know you don't like calling
Putting yourself out there to get hurt
But just say the word and
I'll be outside in the parking lot
With the engine running by the curb

I'll even let you pick the records we play
All I want to do is waste some time with you
And drive the night away
So if you get this message
Call me back whenever
I'll be around all day
