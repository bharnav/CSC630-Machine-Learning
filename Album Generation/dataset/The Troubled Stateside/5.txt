It's safe to say
There are darker things in the streets these days
Than kids with guns and moms on drugs
Things that we don't let on
And if you're "free"
Then take to the city streets with your God-given speech, Screaming, "Fuck the police!"

You can see the state getting armed for the new class war
Perpetuate divide and say that it's the law
There are blacker things living deep in all our hearts
There are darker things in our hearts than we let on

And it's safe to say
There are darker things in the streets these days
Than dirty skies and getting high
Things that control our lives
And the priests were all demoted and released
Check the property value
The neighbors didn't even mind

Doesn't anyone want to start again?
Create a new aesthetic for the new American
Not state traitors taking, day trading
And date raping to their hearts' content
As the work day ends, I laid down so tired...
I woke up awakening
