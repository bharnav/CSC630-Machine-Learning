I must make a choice
A tough decision
Listen to my voice
Should I give in
To temptation admiration
One leads to myself
The other some one else
Just an empty shell
Just an empty shell

It's harder than it seems
When you're told that
All your hopes and dreams
Are yours to hold if
You just give them
What's expected
Something they can sell
Put upon a shelf
But I am not for sale
I am not for sale

I here a voice inside
It's grown into a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'Cause I can't live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me

If I can't refuse
The price they offer
I am sure to lose
And I will suffer
Sell my soul to make a profit
All I have to do
Is make believe it's true
That something I can't do
That something I can't do

I here a voice inside
It's grown into a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'Cause I can't live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
I am the first of me
I am the first of me

So when the waiting's gone
It's time to face the truth
You know your good enough
Deep down inside of you

You're finally woken up
If only just to prove
You are born to lead the way
Then be the first of you
