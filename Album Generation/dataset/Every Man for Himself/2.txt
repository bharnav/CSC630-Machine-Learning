At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward

I stand before a road that will lead
Into the unknown
At least unknown to me
I want to go but I'm paralyzed with fear
Fear of a choice where the outcome isn't clear

No but still I go

And I take the first step of a million more
And I'll make mistakes I've never made before
But at least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward

I wonder if the journey will be
Short as I hope or much longer than it seems
But either way I've made up my mind
I'm through feeling scared
I'm leaving that behind

So now it's time to go

And I take, the first step of a million more
And I'll make mistakes I've never made before
But at least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward

All the while I'll be singing

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

And I take, the first step of a million more
And I'll make mistakes I've never made before
But at least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward

And I take the first step of a million more
And I'll make mistakes I've never made before
But at least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward
At least I'm moving forward

Moving forward
Moving forward
Moving forward
Moving forward

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
