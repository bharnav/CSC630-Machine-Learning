I've become tired
Of wasting my time
Thinking about choices
That I've made
'Cause I can't move forward
While looking behind
The only thing I can do now is change the way
That I used to be
'Cause now it's seems
Crystal clear to me

'Cause you're so much more
Than a memory
Yes you're so much more
Than a memory

It wasn't fair
For me just to go
And act like I knew what you've been though
'Cause I wasn't there
And I'll never know
Couldn't see from
Your point of view
But I'm doing all I can
For you to see
That I understand
That I understand

You're so much more
Than a memory
Yes you're so much more
Than a memory
So don't close the door
On what still can be
'Cause you're so much more
Than a memory

Please don't go
'Cause I finally know
That the past is gone
I know that I was wrong
I was wrong

You're so much more
Than a memory
Yes you're so much more
Than a memory
So don't close the door
On what still can be
'Cause you're so much more
Than a memory

Please don't go
'Cause I finally know
That the past is gone
I know that I was wrong

Please don't go
'Cause I finally know
That the past is gone
I know that I was wrong
I was wrong
