[VERSE 1]
Wake up our life is calling
We're smoking but not on fire
Give us a sign that we're alive

Snap out of indecision
Have we been hypnotized
To think that everything's all right?

[HOOK]
(The clock is counting down,)
The clock is counting down
(Seconds tick away,)
Seconds tick away!

[Chorus]
This is our time
Without a doubt
Time to ignite
We're not going down
(Without a fight!)

This is our time
Get up off the ground
Take what is mine
We're not going down
Without a fight!

[VERSE 2]
Let's go - the curtain's open
Get this show on the road
I want to feel my heart explode!

No more procrastination
Dragging my feet below
Now I want everyone to know!

[HOOK]
(The clock is counting down,)
The clock is counting down
(Seconds tick away,)
Seconds tick away!

[Chorus]
This is our time
Without a doubt
Time to ignite
We're not going down
(Without a fight)

This is our time
Get up off the ground
Take what is mine
We're not going down
Without a fight!

Yeah!
Come on! (x6)

[MIDDLE-EIGHT]
We must pick up the pace
No time to play it safe
Before you know it's much too late

[Chorus]
This is our time
Without a doubt
Time to ignite
We're not going down
(Without a fight)

This is our time
Get up off the ground
Take what is mine
We're not going down
Without a fight

Fight (16x)
