Don't tell me that you are ready to change
Don't tell me that from now it won't be the same
It doesn't matter 'cause at the end of the day
It isn't what you say it's what you do

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever

Don't tell me you'll make things better for us
Don't tell me that you're some one I can trust
It doesn't mean a thing to me just because
It isn't what you say it's what you do
Your actions will speak louder than you

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever
What you keep will last forever

So show me that you really figured it out
And show me everything that you are about
But if you can't then you should just shut your mouth

'Cause I don't care what you say or what you do
You can't take back what you've put me through
Your actions will speak louder than you

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever (3x)
