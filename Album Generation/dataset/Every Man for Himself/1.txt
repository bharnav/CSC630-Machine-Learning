Left, right, left, right... etc

With eyes closed tightly
I march so blindly
Pretending everything's fine
'Cause you're there to keep me in line
I don't want your guidance
I'll break my silence
So sick of asking and being denied and now I realise

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were Born To Lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were Born To Lead
We were Born To Lead

You can't ignore me (you can't ignore me)
You can't think for me (you can't think for me)
Your world will come crashing down to the ground
'Cause I figured you out

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were Born To Lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were Born To Lead
We were Born To Lead

I don't think so! Not in my outfit, ladies! I don't think so!

We were Born To Lead

I use to think I'm ALL alone
But now I see our numbers grow
I'm not afraid to break away
Think on my own

Y'all better not be afraid to break my will! I will break your will! You people are a mess!

With eyes wide open
My new life begins
Without you there to tell me, when, where and how
And you can't stop me now

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were Born To Lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were Born To Lead
We were Born To Lead

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny
We were Born To Lead
We're finally free, no longer following
We were Born To Lead

Not today ladies, not today! Not yesterday, not today, and not tomorrow! Not in my outfit! It doesn't happen that way! It happens the way I say it happens! You may think you're born to lead! I've got news for you, girl scouts! You have to learn to follow!
