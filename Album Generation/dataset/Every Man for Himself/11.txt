I thought it wasn't wrong
To hide from you
Simple truth

I was scared
I felt it all along
But it hurt too much for me to share

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
If only I could change your mind
If only I had known
If only I had you

Finally understand
Why things have happened
And how it all could go so wrong

Will this pain ever end
'Cause I don't think I can carry on

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
If only I could change your mind
If only I had known
If only I had you (3x)

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
If only I could have spoke my mind
If only it were true
(We could start brand-new)
I know I'll make it through
If only I had you (3x)
