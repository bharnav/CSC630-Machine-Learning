I still remember the time
When this all felt like a dream
So completely out of reach
Frustrating

We kept our nose to the grind
Make the days turn into weeks
Hoping time will heal the pain
Of waiting

Now it seems so long ago

Just look back on
How far we've come
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

All we've done
Our battles won
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

I used to wonder if I
Would ever have the chance to be
Something more than what you see
I doubt it

We learned to open our eyes
Now I both think we'd agree
That we're better off than when we started

There's still so much left to go

Just look back on
How far we've come
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

All we've done
Our battles won
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

And the best is yet to come
'cause our story isn't done
No! No! No! No! No!

Just look back on
How far we've come
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

All we've done
Our battles won
We've made it somehow
Look where we are now

Look where we are now
No! No! No! No! No!
Look where we are now

Look where we are now
No! No! No! No! No!
