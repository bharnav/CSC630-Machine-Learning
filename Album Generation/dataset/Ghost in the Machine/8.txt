[Verse 1]
The night came down, jungle sounds were in my ears
City screams are all I've heard in twenty years
The razor's edge of night it cuts into my sleep
I sit upon the edge now shall I make that leap?

[Chorus]
I'm the Omega man[x2]

[Verse 2]
The sky's alive with turned on television sets
I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
The edge of time closes down as I disappear

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Always talking to myself

[Verse 3]
The time that's best is when surroundings fade away
The presence of another world comes close to me
It's time for me to throw away this paper knife
I'm not alone in reaching for a perfect life

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I'm so tired
Of the Omega man
