[Verse 1]
Tied to the tracks and the train's fast coming
Strapped to the wing with the engine running

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that this wasn't in your plan
And don't mess around with the demolition man

[Verse 2]
Tied to a chair, and the bomb is ticking
This situation was not of your picking

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I'm a walking nightmare, an arsenal of doom
I kill conversation as I walk into the room
I'm a three line whip, I'm the sort of thing they ban
I'm a walking disaster, I'm a demolition man

[Bridge]
You come to me like a moth to the flame
It's love you need but I don't play that game
Because you could be my greatest fan
But I'm nobody's friend, I'm a demolition man

[Chorus]
