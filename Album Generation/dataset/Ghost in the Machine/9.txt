[Verse 1]
Upon a secret journey
I met a holy man
His blindness was his wisdom
I'm such a lonely man

And as the world was turning
It rolled itself in pain
This does not seem to touch you
He pointed to the rain

[Chorus]
You will see light in the darkness
You will make some sense of this
And when you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

[Verse 2]
And on the days that followed
I listened to his words
I strained to understand him
I chased his thoughts like birds

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
And when you've made your secret journey
You will be a holy man
