Well I'm at home a workin' and a slavin' this way
You're out of misbehavin' spendin' all of your pay on wine women and song
Well I'm a makin' bed you're out a makin' time
You robbed my piggy bank and spent my last thin dime on wine woman and song
Well one of these nights you gonna come home you find it's comin' home to you
You see what you've done and what's good for one it's also good for two
When you in the doghouse with the mingy ole pup
You may start to thinkin' and a givin' up your wine women and song

Well one of these nights...
