Somebody, somewhere don't know what he's missing tonight

[Verse]
It must have all started with that darn'd old Late Show
It made me so lonely and sad
And to make it all better, I kept getting bluer
With each little drink that I had
So I tuned in a DJ
Who played every sad song he owned
Lord, I need someone so, but everyone I know
Is away being needed at home

[Chorus]
Somebody, somewhere
Don't know what he's missing tonight
Lord, here sits a woman
Just lonesome enough to be right
For love 'em or leave 'em
How I need someone to hold tight
Somebody, somewhere
Don't Know what he's missing tonight

[Chorus]
