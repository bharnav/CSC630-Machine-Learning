Sometimes at night while you're fast asleep
I lie there alone in the darkness and weep
So sorry and sad but that's part of the deal when the tingle becomes a chill
I never wanted to stop loving you I'll swear by the breath in my body that's true
Ah but a woman can't help the way that she feels when the tingle becomes a chill

You're so contented but for me it's all gone
And though I pretend you just don't turn me on
The body performs but the soul has no will when the tingle becomes a chill
I never wanted to stop loving you...
