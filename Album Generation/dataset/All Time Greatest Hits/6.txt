[Verse 1]
You came from the city streets
To my little country town
Your spell is on my baby
And you've got me sorrow bound
You don't really love him
You're playing 'round for fun
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

[Chorus]
You're the devil's woman
That's what my man don't know
Why I wear more in swimming
Than you wear to parties where you go
There's a place I know where you should go
For that's where you belong
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

[Verse 2]
I don't know about the things
The bright lights taught to you
My country boy don't know them
Any better than I do
I'll have to watch him hurting
After you are gone
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

[Chorus]
You're the devil's woman
That's what my man don't know
Why I wear more in swimming
Than you wear to parties where you go
There's a place I know where you should go
For that's where you belong
Woman of the world, leave my world alone
