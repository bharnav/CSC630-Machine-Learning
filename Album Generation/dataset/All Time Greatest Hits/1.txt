[Verse 1]
Well I know where you're going
And who's gonna meet you there
I know how late you'll be coming home
But guess who doesn't care
Tonight I'll step out too
And since I won't be here
Happy birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

[Chorus]
My best wishes may be early
But I'm not sticking around
To bake a cake for your birthday
While you're out turning around
She can help you celebrate
May she bring you lots of cheer
Happy birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

[Verse 2]
Now I've made my mind up
Played second's long enough
You think I don't mean it
So you're gonna call my buff
But I'll be busy packing
While you're holding her near
Happy birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

[Chorus]
My best wishes may be early
But I'm not sticking around
To bake a cake for your birthday
While you're out turning around
She can help you celebrate
May she bring you lots of cheer
Happy birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
Happy birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
