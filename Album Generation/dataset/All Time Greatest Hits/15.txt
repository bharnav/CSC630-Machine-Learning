There's trouble in paradise I can sit and I know the sign so well
I know he's out there and 'round her everyday
There's trouble but there won't be long 'cause in the mornin' it'll all be gone long gone
'cause Lord I'm gonna love him 'till the devil goes away
Now I know about those devil women, they'll set your lovers head to spinnin' and she's a demon she wants control
But she ain't takin my man's soul, she ain't takin my man's soul...

There's trouble in paradise I can sit and I know the sign so well
I know he's out there and 'round her everyday
There's trouble but there won't be long 'cause in the mornin it'll all be gone, long gone
'cause Lord I'm gonna love him 'till the devil goes away

There's trouble in paradise, Lord I'm gonna love him 'till the devil goes away
