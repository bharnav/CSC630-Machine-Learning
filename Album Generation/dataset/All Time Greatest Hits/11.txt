Well if you've been a married woman
And things didn't seem to work out
Divorce is the key to being loose and free
So you're gonna be talked about
Everybody knows that you've loved once
So they think you'll love again
You can't have a male friend when you're a has-been or woman, you're rated X

And if you're rated X you're some kind of goal
Every man might try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You should've known he would
And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X

Well nobody knows where you're going
But they sure know where you've been
All they're thinking of is your experience of love
Their minds eat up with sin
The women all look at you like you're bad and the men all hope you are
But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar of a woman rated X
