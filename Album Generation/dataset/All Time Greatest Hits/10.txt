They say to have her hair done Liz flies all the way to France
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque doing a brand new dance
And the White House social season should be glittering and gay

But here in Topeka the rain is a-falling
The faucet is a dripping
And the kids are a-bawling
One of them is toddling
And one is a-crawling
And one's on the way

I'm glad that Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact
And Debbie's out in Vegas, working up a brand new act
While the TV's showing Newlyweds a real fun game to play

But here in Topeka the screen door's a-banging
The coffee's boiling over
And the wash needs a hanging
One wants a cookie
And one wants a changing
And one's on the way

Now what was I doing?
Jimmy get away from there
Darn there goes the phone
(Spoken)
Hello honey
What's that you say?
You're bringing a few ole Army buddies home?
You're calling from a bar?
Get away from there!
No not you honey I was talkin' to the baby wait a minute honey the door bell
Honey could you stop at the market and hello hello well I'll be

The girls in New York City, they all march for women's lib
And Better Homes and Gardens shows the modern way to live
And the pill may change the world tomorrow
But meanwhile today
Here in Topeka the flies are a-buzzing
The dog is a-barking and the floor needs a scrubbing
One needs a spanking and one needs a hugging Lord
One's on the way

Oh gee I hope it ain't twins again
