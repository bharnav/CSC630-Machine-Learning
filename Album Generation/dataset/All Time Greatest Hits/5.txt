You've just stepped in from stepping out on me
And break that you've been on another spree
If you don't settle down and change your way
I'll wind up stepping out on you someday

I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should

You've just stepped in from stepping out on me
You're not the faithful man I thought you'd be
Many nights I've wondered what you'd do
If you caught me a stepping out on you

I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should

You've just stepped in from stepping out on me
I'll bet your conscience hurts you constantly
Oh time and time again you've been untrue
So I'll just step in from stepping out on you
