[Verse 1]
Lying alone in this big old bed
I got you on my mind
I said when you left
I could make it by myself
But it gets harder all the time
And I can't take it no more
I see your face
Every time I close my eyes
So I'm going out now
And I'm looking for you
Some winter night

[Chorus]
I want you out of my head
And back in my bed
Before the morning sun comes up
I can't stand another night
Without holding me tight
How I miss your loving touch
I'm going searching
Everywhere that you might be
When I find you I'm a bringing you home with me
I want you out of my head
And back in my bed
Before the morning comes

[Verse 2]
Well I might find somebody new
To share my misery
But no other man
Can do what you can
When it comes to loving me
I don't want nobody to say that I was a fool
For being cool
I won't be satisfied till you're back in my arms
And I'm loving you

[Chorus]
