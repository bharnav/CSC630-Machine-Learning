[Intro]
There's some kind of light at the end
When touching the edge of her skin

[Verse 1]
Once so hard to speak
Now so easy to play around
Catching your eye, you know
That eye that slapped you in your face
Calls you a puppy
Well, how do you say I was hypnotized?
Hypnotized

[Pre-Chorus]
My words, they pour
Like children to the playground
Children to the playground
You make me smile

[Chorus]
There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

[Verse 2]
And could you be the one that's not afraid
To look me in the eye?
I swear I would collapse
If I would tell how I think you fell
From the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
My words, they pour
Like children to the playground
Children to the playground
You make me smile

[Chorus x2]
There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

[Bridge x2]
It's the feeling I get, my palms with sweat
Like some kind of daydream I'll never forget
I'm stuck in this spin, why does it begin?
By touching the edge of her skin

[Chorus x2]
There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

[Outro]
(You make me smile)
Woah, woah, woah, ah
Woah, woah, woah, ah
