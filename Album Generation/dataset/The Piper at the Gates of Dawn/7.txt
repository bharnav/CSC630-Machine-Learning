[Verse 1]
I want to tell you a story
Bout' a little man
If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes
Stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

[Verse 2]
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue green hood
It looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last
Wining, dining, biding his time

[Chorus]
And then one day
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Oooooooooomray

[Verse 3]
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Winding, finding places to go

[Chorus]
And then one day – hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Oooooooooomray
Ooooooooooooooomray
