[Verse 1]
Doctor, doctor!
I’m in bed (Doctor, doctor)
Achin’ head (Doctor, doctor)
Gold is lead (Doctor, doctor)
Choke on bread (Doctor, doctor)
Underfed (Doctor, doctor)
Gold is lead (Doctor, doctor)
Jesus bled (Doctor, doctor)
Pain is red (Doctor, doctor)
Dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spoon, June bloom

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I’m alive
Flowers thrive
Realise
Realise
Realise
