[Verse 1]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

[Refrain]
Yippee! You can’t see me
But I can you

[Verse 2]
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn

[Refrain]
No fair, you can’t hear me
But I can you

[Verse 3]
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion

[Refrain]
Too much, I won’t touch you
But then I might

[Verse 4]
Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone

[Refrain]
Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high

[Verse 1]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

[Refrain]
Yippee! You can’t see me
But I can you
