[Chorus - James Otto]
I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction
Step aside 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done 'stead of talkin' 'bout it

[Verse 1 - Cowboy Troy]
Early in the mornin I'm up and I'm at 'em
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin that mic so viciously, deliciously, not maliciously
When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bassline drops

[Repeat Chorus]

[Cowboy Troy - Japanese Tag]
Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi amerikajin yoru

[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
The last of the brohicans is speakin'
The one that you turn to each and every weekend
Risin', peakin', while the bump is beatin'
Don't turn back, no retreatin'
You can see my vision, you can feel my force
Time to hit the trail boy, the mic is my horse
I tantalize and tickle your tympanic with my English
Smile as you listen to the ruckus as I bring this

[Repeat Chorus]

[Cowboy Troy - Japanese Tag]
Ichi-nichi-ju, Ichi-nichi-ju
Kuroi amerikajin yoru

All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song
All day long, all day long
Cowboy Troy bringin' you this song

[Verse 3 - Cowboy Troy]
I'm comin' with the best and fresh from out west
Bus driver takin' you to school to pass the test
See I'm lyrically hypnotic, at times even psychotic
Erotic, bionic and it may leave you catatonic

[Repeat Chorus x 2]
