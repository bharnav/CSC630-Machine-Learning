[Verse 1]
Flesh wound, flesh wound
With medication, it will fade
Should I assume
That someone hears me when I pray?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Love, full of hate
Don't you love
How I break?

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Keep me and I'll be okay!
(Aah-ha)
Skipping a beat, but it plays!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!

[Verse 2]
Screwed up, used up
Crumble lying on the floor
Fucked up, shut up
All you did back then was score

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling weak
Missing parts
Incomplete!

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Keep me and I'll be okay!
(Aah-ha)
Skipping a beat, but it plays!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!

[Bridge]
Hold me up into the light
Fix the cracks and fix them right
Keep the pieces in the drawer
Keep them there forever more
Wake a million thoughts someday
Recycle this shit in someway
And all that I have to say
Don't let them throw me away

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Keep me and I'll be okay!
(Aah-ha)
Skipping a beat, but it plays!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!
(Aah-ha)
Don't let them throw me away!
