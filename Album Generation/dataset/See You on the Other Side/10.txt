[Verse 1]
My brother, you love her
But don't give up your instincts
Hang onto you know what
They'll be gone fast as you blink
They're trained to seduce you
Suck you dry quickly as they can
They bite down, reduce you
Now you're barely a man

[Chorus]
Oh my God
How could you deny the flood
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that
She's all that you desire, liar
Hey you, you think you can
Throw water on this fire, liar

[Verse 2]
It's not wrong to let go
And let the woman ride you
For fuck sake, don't lose touch
With the dog that's inside you
She wanted what you had
You bet she smelt the spore
Don't wimp up, fuck her up
One more time, slam that door

[Chorus]
Oh my God
How could you deny the flood
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that
She's all that you desire, liar
Hey you, you think you can
Throw water on this fire, liar
Oh my God
How could you deny the flood
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that
She's all that you desire, liar
Hey you, you think you can
Throw water on this fire, liar

[Brige]
Liar!
Liar!
Liar!
Liar!

[Outro]
Oh my God
How could you deny the flood
That's flowing through you?
