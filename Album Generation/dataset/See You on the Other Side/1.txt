[Verse 1]
Everyone's corrupt
You should just shut up
Lay down, back off
The demon you've disrupted

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna talk about politics!
Don't preach or talk about politics!
Don't let me talk about politics!
Don't give a shit about politics!

[Chorus]
You want to sleep with him
To get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go, don't you? (Don't you)
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do insane
I look the other way, won't you? (Won't you?)

[Verse 2]
Everybody's late
Lying to your face
Kiss 'em and got to go, slit you
Here all messed up

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna talk about politics!
Don't preach or talk about politics!
Don't let me talk about politics!
Don't give a shit about politics!

[Chorus]
You want to sleep with him
To get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go, don't you? (Don't you)
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do insane
I look the other way, won't you? (Won't you?)

[Bridge]
Tiny spirits are in your soul
And they remain there
Time is like in the deepest hole
You sit and pray there
All the guilt from the things you've done
You wonder what for
What you thought was so much fun
You have to pay for

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna talk about politics!
Don't preach or talk about politics!
Don't let me talk about politics!
Don't give a shit about politics!

[Chorus]
You want to sleep with him
To get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go, don't you? (Don't you)
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do insane
I look the other way, won't you? (Won't you?)

[Outro]
Don't wanna talk about politics!
Don't preach or talk about politics!
Don't let me talk about politics!
Don't give a shit about politics!
Don't wanna talk about politics!
Don't preach or talk about politics!
Don't let me talk about politics!
Don't give a shit about politics!
