[Verse 1]
I'm getting out, I'm leaving here
I'm kicking right through this door
I stole your girl who was my girl
I always said she's a whore
Bust through, accelerate
From everything I hate
Now this is my kind of disaster
Break in and take what we want
And then burn down the liquor store
Pick up our friends tell them
"Let's all get in don't ask what it's for."
Sub woofer kicking it
Porn on the TV screen
These spinning rims don't go no faster

[Chorus]
We can ride all night
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
Just follow the light
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

[Verse 2]
We're flipping off the people
Who dissed on us that's just our game
We're throwing bricks right through their windows
And then we drive away
Let's break this, spin around
New things are better found
We keep on changing our direction
Go past the school, the church
The places that caused us hurt, we're done
If we keep moving forward
Maybe we'll forget where we're from
We're gonna shake things up
We're gonna break you down
We'll fuel this car with our rejection

[Chorus]
We can ride all night
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
Just follow the light
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

[Verse 3]
You can never go back not even
If you wanted to know where, you're in deep now
You've been fucking up real good lately
One minute you come from zero, go now

[Chorus]
We can ride all night
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
Just follow the light
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
We can ride all night
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
Just follow the light
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
