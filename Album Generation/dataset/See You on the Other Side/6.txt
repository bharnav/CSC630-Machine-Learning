[Verse 1]
Mother!
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker!
They left me broken, bleeding
Son of...
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch!
Who tried to show me death's door
Everything's eliminated
Everything is dedicated
Tried to leave this life I hated
Living it was overrated

[Chorus]
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here, I'm dying here

[Verse 2]
Ash and
Obituaries rain down
And suddenly
We're lying naked face down
What's it like decapitated?
Can't you see me fascinated?
You're the only thing I've damaged
Only death can be mismanaged

[Chorus]
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here, I'm dying here

[Verse 3]
Don't bring me Daffodils
Bring a bouquet of pills
Seeds of Geranium
Cracked to the cranium
Protect me when you can
Respect me when I am dying

[Chorus]
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here, I'm dying here
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here, I'm dying here
