[Verse 1]
I'm an animal, I'm a victim
I'm the answer to your prayers
I'm a witness, on a witch hunt
I'm the monster up the stairs
I'm ghost that's in the mirror
I'm everything that you fear
I'm the ripped heart, I'm the soul shot
I'm the voice that's in your head

[Chorus 1]
I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

[Verse 2]
I'm the hunted, I'm a predator
I'm the answer to the riddle
I'm the up beat, I'm the hurt fuck
I'm the window smashed in the middle
I'm the player, I'm the naive
I'm the one who's not addicted
I'm the logic to the fuck up
I'm the broken one who fixed it

[Chorus 2]
I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane
I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

[Bridge]
I'm just a child with tears in its eyes
I am holding this gift that is broken
What do I have left now?

[Chorus 2]
I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane
I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane
