It comes from all we're giving, in seemingly endless supply
As signals cross defiantly into this volatile mix we charge
And the stubborn mind repeats, the errors to challenge our grounds
Either soar above or the detour takes you right
Back down, now, to where no one wants to see
Misgivings in this starry nightlight, fill in the blanks
That one will fall to the haunts and horrors, to the haunts and horrors

There is nothing left, a mere shadow, when adrenaline runs dry
There is nothing there, an empty prop, when adrenaline runs dry

It gets you deep down low, now, as they told you of the blazing heights
The stage from which the world is viewed is the mirror to shatter the image
The crypt he kept for hiding, retreat from another attack
Painlessly forgiving, a refuge in deceptive black

It works within the system and they won't understand
A lesser known deceiver will fool you even more

Now, now, now, now taunt the wasted, it's all about nothing
What to squeeze within the span of attention, brought to ground, let the chaos pass
That one will fail by the screams and terrors, by the screams and terrors

There is nothing left, a mere shadow, when adrenaline runs dry
There is nothing there, an empty prop, when adrenaline runs dry
