You try to hide the fact hidden from yourself
Your own favorite entertainer
Is none other than the one we call you
And you need the others to fortify your disgust
For the worst of us, to the rest of us

Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed
Oblivious by design, not susceptible to any mind

I can take what's being given
I can down whatever comes
I will do what you deem necessary
My fear compels me

No more fictitious needs
I will not be made a mockery
No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see

Without a sense of danger everything is lost
In the name of entertainment we are doomed
