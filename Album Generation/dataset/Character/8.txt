I grant to you no privilege of person, no sense of self, a denial of choice
It wants out, so from all the little bits and pieces
A simple case of lost and found, a wicked new beginning, I don't ever want to see
It's the oldest trick in the book, just like everything you always knew
Turned upon its very end, there's nothing left to be

I've got, half a mind to say all the things that bother me today
You better check if it's me, in that coffin of yours or just the one, the one you thought you knew

I am one, who am I?
No character to be lost inside

A mind is hard to please, so wander aimlessly

Hands clenched in fists of rage, concealed in frustration
There's a part of me that cannot deal with the character I am forced to be
A thinly veiled plan to lay your world afoot
Lost in community, blind in belonging
Is there really nothing more than this?
The emptiness remains, so put on your brave face and take the plunge again

I am one, who am I?
No character to be lost inside
