A human force stronger than logic
Beyond the focus and the grander ideas
One microcosmos in this wretched piece of hell
Distant memories of what empathy we felt
No revolution in what they must overthrow
In on a secret we all know
The need that is our enemy

I don't even want to see you
Doing all the same things as me
Don't ever let this be you
Knowing what it is that drives me

It's all in the future
Said with one foot in the grave
All in the plan of what we never could achieve
No satisfaction
We excuse ourselves from progress by post-altering our motives
Stories set to match whatever beat that drives the impulse

Whatever tune that carries through
What's in a soul that rattles empty
In this one reality, too few

Our reach is never wider than the depth of what we grasp
A vicious curse on all that we partake in/side the conflict
Where no one is the wiser
A space invaded
A face evaded
My space invaded
Selfish dosn't begin to cover the sense
In this utopia of one to escape the argument
To put another filter on
