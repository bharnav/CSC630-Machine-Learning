Riddled by the trappings of words that makes the edges blur
Here on the outskirts of sincerity and pride
Stretched as far as words can reach, by the lure of higher meaning
There's something out there, lost behind the power lines
It's all the same to me, it's all the same to me
Lost all faith in promises, and deadlines closing in
Tired of deciphering the wayward stands of truth

I don't care, 'cause I can't feel
I don't know anymore

Sure, we've had a good run with vowels, nouns and letters
But within its very nature, the ability to distort
There's nothing in the words I hear that makes me want to take a stand
It has gone on for far too long, I chose to disengage
It's all the same to me, it's all the same to me
The ends of our conditioning to swallow, take and like it
Rather keep me in the dark than look me in the eye

I don't care, 'cause I can't feel
I don't know anymore

It's all these same things pulling us down to senses gone I cheer
It's all these same things making us blind
There's nothing here for me

Hear it coming, heading for you now

I can't even stand the tone of arrogance and denial on display
Here you are listless, left for deaf
Thinking about what standards we set in times of weary tongues
And ears that hear no end to it, unwilling or unable
The difference left for times, judgement
It's all the same to me, it's all the same to me
It passes on from wicked mouths as victim takes on another role
New bold oppressor, our teacher's product now stands tall

I don't care, 'cause I can't feel
I don't know anymore

It's all these same things pulling us down to senses gone I cheer
It's all these same things making us blind
There's nothing here for me

Hear it coming, heading for you now
Hear
