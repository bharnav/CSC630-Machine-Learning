It's all this reeking ego craves, the sun to never set
Why do threads of anger never linger?
Why does the ember turn to stone?
To where the longing goes, in with the sins of old
A face of nothing to never see, as blind as free

Everything I want is in at the end of this
Everything I need will be at the end of me

My negation, how will you know my name and sense the danger coming?
My negation, how can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

The art of reduction, stripped down through what seems defendable
Scaled to bare revisions, to stop making sense
Levelling pillars of towering fear, rational instincts and insight to spare
End of falseness, end of grace

Everything I fear is in this failing
Nothing of what I am is in this end

My negation, how will you know my name and sense the danger coming?
My negation, how can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

How will you know my name?
