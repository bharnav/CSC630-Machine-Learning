Insufficient facts make up for a frail foundation
Breeding the obscene, for the opinion customized
Is the insight null and substance void upon these wheels?
Our world will roll
Let it be decided, let it be decided who will take the blame
Another soul to drain
What is it that we see? What is it that we see?

One thought bringing it down, original sinners
One thought bringing it down, switch it off

Has it come to this?
Enjoying things by proxy
Live through others, die just like the rest
We all end up screaming a little louder
To cover up another piece of silence
Just scream a little louder, punch another hole through media
Turn it off

One thought bringing it down, original sinners
One thought bringing it down, switch it off

Brace for impact to once a greater vision
Our lives now stand to fall

Tyranny of fear, a stranglehold on us
Stronger day by day, it's time to turn it off

One thought bringing it down, original sinners
One thought bringing it down, switch it off

Switch it off
