Sometimes I don?t know if should even talk at all
Words just fall to pieces banging up against the wall
They don?t ever come out right now matter how much I try
Then inside I?m screaming cuz I can?t seem to find a way
I can say what I feel inside
I don?t want to hide the things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I guess you?ll never know

If I could I?d plant a seed and make a blossom grow
Lets colors flow around you and maybe they would show you the way
To my world and what I feel inside

I don?t want to hide and the things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I guess you?ll never know

What I feel inside
I don?t want to hide
The things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I?ll guess you?ll never know
