If the light in your sky fades and darkness falls upon your face
When it seems you've lost your way and you can't take another day
I will calm all your fears
I will dry all your tears
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are

There's no wall that I can't climb
No road that I won't walk to find
Where you wander in the cold I'll get to you and take you home
I'll be right by your side just forget space and time

You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are

I'll be right by your side just forget time and space
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are
