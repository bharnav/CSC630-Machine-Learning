Hat face, that face, that wonderful face!
It shines, it glows all over the place
And how I love to watch it change expressions
Each look becomes the pride of my possessions
I love that face, that face, it just isn't fair
You must forgive the way that I stare
But never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face
I love those eyes, those lips, that fabulous smile
She laughs and spring goes right out of style
Oh never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face, that face
That face, that face, that face
