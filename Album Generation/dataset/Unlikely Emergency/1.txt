I ran outside, right into you, and instantly you said you knew
That you were the only one, I'd ever need to know
You said you knew the answers
And you said, that it's just another day
I came here with a voice, a chance to make a choice
An island of a mind, with bridges built with time
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
It's just another day, it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
I'm not saving grace, use it all the time
Sometimes it gets misplaced, denies that it is mine
And then I just can't see, I get lost in misery
But it's just another day
It's just another day, it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
It's just another day, it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
Come with me, come with me, come with me, it's just another day
It's just another day, it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
And now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
