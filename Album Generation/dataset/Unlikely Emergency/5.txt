You're living in a hospital
Everyone else is belly's full
Your eyes are open windows for the truth
I'm scared you're gonna leave us here
Sweet baby you've made so much clear
To me your songs are written on the roof
Maybe you're just a daydream
Taken out of my window panes
Making sure everything is just alright
Maybe you're just a make believe
A story that I like to read
Torn from all the pages of my life
I'm heavy weighing down it's true
But someone's got to try and prove
The truth I think that maybe someone's you
You're one of a kind, stuck on my mind
Trying so hard just to be fine
Heaven help us if you fade away
Maybe you're just a daydream
Taken out of my window panes
Making sure everything is just alright
Maybe you're just a make believe
A story that I like to read
Torn from all the pages of my life
I wanna give you mine
I wanna give you something
I wanna give you mine
I wanna give you something
Baby you're just a daydream
Taken out of my window panes
Making sure everything is just alright
Maybe you're just a make believe
Story that I like to read
Torn from all the pages of my life
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
