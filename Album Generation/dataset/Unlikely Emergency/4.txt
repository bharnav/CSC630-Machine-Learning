You make my skin crawl further than ever before
My bones may be naked
Now but at least you're not passed out on my floor
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
Don't you know there's no such thing as people anymore?
One rolled over and one fell out
Ones passed out on my floor
Don't care what they eat cause everything tastes the same
We've all memorized their own set of rules to the same stupid fucking game
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched finish where i began
Finish where i began
Finish where i began
Finish where i ......
You make my skin crawl further than ever before
My bones maybe naked now but at least you're not passed out on my floor
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
I watched you sneak away under my skin
I watched you finish where i began
