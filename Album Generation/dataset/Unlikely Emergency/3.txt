Take a bite from my rotten apple
He said as he left his castle
With miniscule apendage
And he was such an asshole
Only over loved his mother
Never would he love another
Never really loved his father
Because he was
Saving the world
And some money too
What else in the world
Would you have a man to do
He's breaking his back
He's tried and true
He saving the world and some money too
Stuck Stuck
In this contradiction
Walking a tpye rope
Thats theres no fixing
Making sure everythings a daydream
