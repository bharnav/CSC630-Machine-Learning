Its the beginning of the end
And no one needs to say it again
No one needs to say what's meant
I'm forgetting everything
I'm saying what I felt I should
Have said before and now I start again
You can stay for an hour and make me forget everything
You can stay for an hour and make up the rest in your dreams
Haven't you always been amazed
At everything you thought you saw
And then it disappeared like all your daydreams, that you dreamed
That you would miss you're one-way train
Your one-way runway claim to fame
You can stay for an hour and make me forget everything
You can stay for an hour and make up the rest in your dreams
But its not too late, its not too late, its not too late, too late, ohhh
Ohhh, ooooh
You can stay for an hour and make me forget everything
You can stay for an hour and make up the rest in your dreams
You can stay for an hour and make me forget everything
You can stay for an hour and make up the rest in your dreams
In your dreams
