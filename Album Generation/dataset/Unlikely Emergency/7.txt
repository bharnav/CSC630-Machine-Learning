You grew like a smile, a reaction on my face
And I felt I was coming home
Knew all the while
I'd misplaced something important
But I was no longer alone
I wouldn't have minded if you said that there's no chance
So pack up and head on home
But you just smiled and you said that
You could dance with me forever
If you could, you could
In an unlikely emergency over water
You stole my heart
But no one was killed
And our chairs caught on fire
A sunday desire to last the rest of this life
All the babies in wedding dress
And once the pride of existence in this life
Didn't falter to pass the test
Youuu
In an unlikely emergency
Over water
You stole my heart, but no one was killed
And our chairs caught on fire
In an unlikely emergency
Over water
You stole my heart, but no one was killed
And our cherished caught on fire
In an unlikely emergency
Over water
You stole my heart
But no one was killed
And our chairs caught on fire
You grew like a smile, a reaction on my face
And I felt I was coming home
