Hang me up to dry with your clothes
Drink away the fear in my bones
Save me from this ugly landfill
Sun will scare away this winter chill

We love before we hate
And bend before we break
We talk before were mum
And walk before we'll run
Find our way home again

Lead me to your watering hole
Wash me clean and fix what I got broke
Leave me like a drifter out at sea
Tangled like my father's rosary
