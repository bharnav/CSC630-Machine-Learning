Fire in the hen house
Protests in the deep south
It's Shangri-La in reverse
Time to call the wet nurse
Markets on the rebound
Riots in the ghost towns
Dirty little secrets
Always change and change and change

[Chorus]
Accelerate, must accelerate
Hesitate, mustn't hesitate
Calculate, must recalculate what we've got wrong
Happens deep inside our bones

Riders on the dust clouds
Working for the rebound
The casual acquaintance
The dirty leaky basements
They're calling on the reserves
The famous
The crafty shape-shifters
Always change and change and change

[Chorus]
I see you change, see you change

Accelerate, must accelerate
Hesitate, mustn't hesitate
Calculate, must recalculate

[Chorus]
