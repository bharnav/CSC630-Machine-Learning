Skies like angels turn to rust
We hide inside our pickup trucks
Thoughts heavy like aeroplanes
Come crashing down and burst in flames
Memories, I'd cash them in for peace of mind and some discipline

No turning back
I'm starting to mend
A fortunate man I've always been
I tear at my heart
If I don't concede I'm only as good as you allow me to be

Friends will come and friends will go
You, my friend, own my soul
Raindrops plummet from the sky
Inside my lungs a battle cry
