You say that love is a disease
Restless in its company
Like a river to the sea is where you run
You say that all the birds have flown
The heart an antique turned to stone
There is comfort in this great unknown

All that you've known
All that you say
All that you've known will someday change

You say forgiveness don't last long
You hear the ticking of the bomb
Leaves you wondering where it all went wrong

Light lead us all like harmless spirits traveling
