I can feel the knives in my back, in my sides
As my body slowly fades
Can you reach into time?
Bring me back here alive?
Set the ocean's tides straight

One by one we fall asleep like passengers in window seats
I know I should go but I stay
One by one we float away like accidents and castaways
I know I should go but I stay, I stay

I can hear the sounds as the wheels hit the ground
My bones begin to break
