[Verse 1]
Late into the night
Comes a glow like ice
Numbers on my phone
I don't recognise
There in black and white
All your twisted thoughts

[Verse 2]
Brutal starry eyes
Stuck inside your head
Fallen from the sky
Risen from the dead
Views from all the past
Taken to new heights

[Chorus 1]
Melancholy sky
You made me blue
Still hanging on
There's nothing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
Not this time

[Verse 3]
There you are again
Calling from the hills
Haunted and the damned
From imagined worlds
It's too late, my friend
I don't love you anymore

[Chorus 1]
Melancholy sky
You made me blue
Still hanging on
There's nothing I can do

[Chorus 2]
Melancholy sky
Still hanging on
You're crazy now
I didn't do you wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Not this time
