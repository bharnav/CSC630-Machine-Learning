[Verse 1]
Now take me dancing at the disco
Where you buy your Winniebago
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

[Verse 2]
When the light turns into darkness
Will he turn up to explain us?
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

[Chorus]
Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!

[Verse 3]
In the whirlpool, we'll go deeper
In this world that's getting cheaper
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

[Verse 4]
I like dancing at the disco
I want blisters, you're my leader
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

[Chorus]
Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like real leather
