Sitting in today
Watching traffic passing by
And faces nosing in
A victim of regret
It glitters then it fades away
Like silver turning grey
Washed it all away
Waiting for this dream to end
Before it sucks me in
I'm climbing high
Up above the streets and rows of neon lights
I'm holding out my hand but I'm alone

Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday

Crashing on the ground
The silence seems to suffocate
And bury me again
Waiting for a taste
Of happiness to lift me free
And carry me away
I'm climbing high
Up above the streets and rows of neon lights
I know it's just a dream but I'm alive

Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday
I'm still missing yesterday

Lost another week
Feeling like a leper in
A world of vanity
It's killing me today
Addiction pulls you down you know
And she's the drug I need

Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday
Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday
