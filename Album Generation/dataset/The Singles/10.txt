[Verse 1]
A cupid on the go
No arrow and no bow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I thought you'd gone for good
I hadn't understood
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Rushing like the sea
You've come back to me

[Chorus 1]
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now

[Verse 2]
The maker of a dream
The lead in every scene
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need it to survive
Without you I would die
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Rushing like the sea
You've come back to me
Now I'm saying

[Chorus 1]
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now

[Bridge]
Dreaming
I'm dreaming of the now
Hold me now
Don't leave now

[Chorus 2]
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
