[Verse 1]
I get high on a buzz
Then a rush when I'm plugged in you
I connect when I'm flush
You get love when told what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Cover me in you

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine

[Verse 2]
When you send me a pulse
Feel a wave of new love through me
I'm dressed in white noise
You know just what I want, so please

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Cover me in you

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine

[Bridge]
I'm in love

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
