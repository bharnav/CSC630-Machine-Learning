[Verse 1]
One thing you said
You wanted to fly a silk red kite
Or an arrow to the moon
Wearing all white

[Verse 2]
Bouquets blazing
They steal the air, then disappear
Sunlight ripples through
All your photographs
Looking at photographs

[Chorus 1]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Yellow halo
For a queen

[Post-Chorus]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Yellow halo

[Verse 3]
One day, one year
The seasons come, the moon's still here
Dawn breaks endlessly
Wake up tell me...
What are you dreaming?

[Chorus 1]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Yellow halo
For a queen

[Chorus 2]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Bequeathed
Yellow halo

[Bridge]
Yellow halo
Yellow halo
Yellow halo
Yellow halo

[Chorus 2]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Bequeathed
Yellow halo
For a queen

[Outro]
Yellow halo
All your colours
Yellow halo
