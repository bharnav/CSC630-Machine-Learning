[Verse 1]
Started something
Thought it could be fun
Started something
Couldn't go on

[Verse 2]
Danger, heartache
I always knew
There's no winner
In this game you lose

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still wanna know
How she got in the door
Uninvited

[Chorus]
Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

[Verse 3]
Cliches, secrets
Stories unfold
Fooled by passion
Losing control

[Verse 4]
Danger, heartache
Something has died
No good pretending
I'm leaving this time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still wanna know
How she got in the door
Uninvited

[Chorus]
Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

[Chorus]
Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

[Bridge]
You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, no, no
You're going out on your own
You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, oh no
You're going out on your own

[Chorus]
Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

[Chorus]
Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back
You're never coming back

[Outro]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have to lift off
