[Verse 1]
Join our group and you will find harmony and peace of mind
Make it better, we're here to welcome you
We're all on a journey to finding the real inner you
Make it better (make it better), we're here to welcome you

[Pre-Chorus]
Time stops still when you've lost love, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Floating in the magic world, donate all your money
We'll make it better (make it better), we're here to welcome you
We can see your troubled soul, give us all your money
We'll make it better (make it better), we're here to welcome you

[Pre-Chorus]
Time stops still when you've lost love, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

[Bridge]
We'll be swimming in the sea of wisdom and serenity
Make it better...

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love

[Chorus]
Happiness, how'd you get to be
Happiness, how'd you get to find love, real love
Love, love, love
