[Verse 1]
Plastic brain scar, I want laser
I'm your chauffeur with high gloss highs
Take you where you want

[Chorus 1]
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh

[Verse 2]
Wolf lady sucks my brain
Apricot sunrise came
L.A. nights, just roll in

[Chorus 2]
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

[Verse 3]
Nasal douche, poolside line
Softlit tan, what's your sign?
Hold my hand, just roll in

[Chorus 2]
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

[Chorus 2]
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
