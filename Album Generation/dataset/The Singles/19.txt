Show it to me one way I've got to see it all scientific radar
Reaching through the storm there's got to be hope
As people move on we've got to keep on believing

It's the time to give it everything a world unite let us in
Hear me hear me cry suffocate let them die
A better life say goodbye hear me hear me cry

I see everything silver and gold way up I'm reaching out clouds white as snow
There's got to be hope as people move on and on and on

It's the time to give it everything aworld unite let us in
Hear me hear me cry suffocate let them die
A better life say goodbye hear me hear me cry

Hear me cry why don't you hear me why don't they hear me
Suffocate let them die abetter life say goodbye
Give give enough I care
