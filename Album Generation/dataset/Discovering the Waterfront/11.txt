[Verse 1]
Return it to you, that i kept it for a year
All these times i figured you'd be here. (hey!)

[Chorus]
The last time i saw you, i tried to move right through the crowd
And i was calling your name, but the band played too loud
The last time i saw you, i tried to move right through the crowd
Was calling your name but the band played loud!

[Verse 2]
Note that i kept it for a year
All these times i figured you'd be here (go!)

[Chorus]
The last time i saw you, i tried to move right through the crowd
And i was calling your name, but the band played too loud
The last time i saw you, i tried to move right through the crowd
Was calling your name but the band played loud!

[Outro]
Rodeo clown
Rodeo clown
Did you know?
Rodeo clown
Rodeo clown!
