[Verse 1]
You won't find me here
The place that you expected me to be
In my bed on the second floor
I'm outside your house
I'm closing in on you
And all the times you smiled
You said hello and thought I was ok
I was planning your final struggle

[Chorus]
When you wake up, I'll be there
When you see me, you'll be on your back again
When you, when you, when you, when you
Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too

[Verse 2]
You will find me here
The place you least expected me to be
Breaking through your basement window
I'm outside your room
I can hear you breathe
And all the times you laughed
You shook my hand and thought I was your friend
I was planning your tragic ending

[Chorus]
When you wake up, I'll be there
When you see me, you'll be on your back again
When you, when you, when you, when you
Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too

[Bridge]
You'll look down on me
With eyes of endless tragedy
Try and stop the pain
But there's never closure
Find your solace in what you could have been
When they look for me
The evidence is buried deep
Try to guide the way into the darkness

[Chorus]
When you wake up, I'll be there
When you see me, you'll be on your back again
When you, when you, when you, when you
Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too

[Outro]
Looking down on me
Through eyes that never stop crying
Looking down on me
Will you ever look away?
