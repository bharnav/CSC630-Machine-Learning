[Intro]
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Indifference grows
Indifference feeds on me
A sickness fills the pathways where I breathe
Miles away from where I want to be
Want to be

[Pre-Chorus]
One day you will see
Nothing is this simple
This simple
One day you will see
It takes its toll on me
Toll on me

[Chorus]
Hey, lie awake and wait out all those
Days until I finally come home
Changed and jaded
Everything that I hate
I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Trading in my youth
For broken wings
As I slowly watch you walk away
So walk away
Will you stay
Will you stay
Or will you walk away?

[Bridge]
Fall asleep to flashing screens and paper cuts, yeah
Waking up with vacant eyes and broken hearts again

[Pre-Chorus]
One day you will see
Nothing is this simple
This simple
One day you will see
It takes its toll on me
Toll on me

[Chorus]
Hey, lie awake and wait out all those
Days until I finally come home
Changed and jaded
Everything that I hate
I'll be there
