[Verse 1]
Blame it on the weather, but I'm a mess
And this February darkness has me hating everyone
And I know I need your comfort
But this drama makes me sick
And the longer I lay here
I know it's harder to get up without you

[Chorus]
Lose another day here
Lose another year here, I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Finally, something out there that's making sense
And it's just another trend carefully hidden in your dress
And this cycle’s neverending and this fashion’s overdone
And the further that I run away, the further I'll come back to shelter

[Chorus]
Lose another day here
Lose another year here, I'm with you
You are the fire on my apartment floor
Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall
It isn't fate that took us all by storm
It's just the turn of a card
Lose another day here
Lose another year here, I'm with you
You are the fire on my apartment floor
Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall
It isn't fate that took us all by storm
It's just the turn of a card

[Outro]
Goodbye, old friend
Goodbye, good night
I'll move on
You'll call it fate, I'll call it karma
We had our time, it was fun while it lasted
I'll look back with honour and no regrets
I won't be mad, won't feel bad
These memories will never leave me
Don't be sad ‘cause life goes on, life goes on
'Cause life goes on, life goes on
It's getting too late, tomorrow is here
