[Verse 1]
Tie me up with sheets
And hang me from your tree
I'll stay out here all night
It doesn't even matter
As long as I can see
Into your room and feel
Like I'm inside your life
I'll follow you forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down just yet
I'll make things right again
Don't close your blinds on me, on me

[Chorus]
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started

[Verse 2]
The snow won't go away, my nose runs down my face
No one sees me here, it doesn't even matter
And every step I take, I stay in the same place
I can't begin to start again, why can't I just be perfect?

[Chorus]
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started

[Verse 3]
You see my ghost and you'll never forget it
My face is as white as the snow that haunts me
Your window's my door and nothing can stop me
Sometimes betrayal can make you happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down just yet
I'll make things right again
Don't close your blinds on me, on me

[Chorus]
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
