Come on

[Verse 1]
Finish me off, follow the plan
Break all the bonds, sever the ties
And now your mission is complete
Find and destroy me
Torturing me, with words from your lips
Filleting my skin, pulling my teeth
Please, forgive me for not being good enough

[Chorus]
Drown your sorrows in my pain
And it's something you can't explain
When I'm choking on words you'll never say
And you'll never feel the same

[Verse 2]
Bound and gagged
I cannot move or speak these things I want to say
I can't explain them anyway
So if I had it all again
If I could start from the first words I ever said
I would do it all the same

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Drown your sorrows in my pain
And it's something you can't explain
When I'm choking on words you'll never say
And you'll never feel the same

[Verse 3]
Your joy is my pain
My fingers are yours to cut off
And my bones are yours to shatter in pieces
My teeth are yours to pull out
And my soul is yours to slowly rip apart

[Outro]
I can't trust anyone I meet
From now on, my chest feels more like
A fist wrapped in blood
