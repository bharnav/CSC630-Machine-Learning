[Verse 1]
I'm lying down
And you can't see
Why I've gone to sleep
Try to relate
Can't give in to your temptations
All your hopes and dreams
Washing away silently
Forget everything you taught me
When I looked up to you
Fall to your knees
And give up your aspirations
Falling to your knees

[Chorus]
So how can you expect me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes?
Defending you is getting harder everyday, day

[Verse 2]
I'm breaking down
The ending's near
The final call to make it through
You'll choose
Try to relate
Forget everything you taught me
When I looked up to you

[Chorus]
So how can you expect me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes?
Defending you is getting harder everyday, day

[Verse 3]
I'll look inside myself for strength
Like a million times before
You'll never let it in because
I know you said
I know you said
I know, I know, I know, I know
Fall, how can you let it go?
How can you be this way?
I'll never forget
Where I come from, where I've been
I'll never become you

[Chorus]
So how can you expect me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes?
Defending you is getting harder everyday, day
So how can you expect me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes?
Defending you is getting harder everyday, day

[Outro]
You've lost it all
