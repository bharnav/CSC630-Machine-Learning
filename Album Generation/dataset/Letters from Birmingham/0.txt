I see you thinking if I'm thinking what you're thinking
I just moving where the mood inside takes me
Looks like faith means to lead us into nowhere
Touching every layer of matter from beginning to latter
It's the laws of attractions that's in action here
Not the voices of the conscious programmed with so much nonsense
Trying to fear us from what's natural
We were all born supernatural
And right now I just wanna get closer to you

If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me

Sometimes I get carried away by the
To be with you night and day
I love the way we miss behave
In that earthly way it means
I get to feel you with all senses
Burning all incenses
These, how could I forget it?
I'm not the good girl nor the bad girl
I'm a woman
Hear me roar while you adore me
And employ me to explore, free admission
I'm on a mission to find you
Will you let me?

If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me

I suppose now it's the time
That we imply body soul and min
Do you mind
I'll just love it
If you will let me find myself in you
Let me introduce you to a seduction
That will guide you into another groove
I see future in you
I read pages of you
And never get tired
You get me higher
Lets float away to another space another place
I hope you'll retry what you've ever lost

If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
If you let me
I'd love to
Baby tell me will you let me
