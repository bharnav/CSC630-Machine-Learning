Yeah, I got to do it to you
Come on, baby, come with me
Sit on the stoop

Girl, I see you across the road
You're looking fly
And I feel like coming through and saying hi
Gotta check my swagger, get my pimping tight
Gotta get you on that patron and get you feeling right

Girl, the way I feel it's your lucky day
If you want you can push my whip to my place
You're so inviting, I'm so excited
To see what you got for me
I'm gonna like it

You say you don't like to rush in
You say you won't but I know you will
Baby, don't front, you can let me in
I won't be more than you can deal with

So, let's go, baby, step into my rangerover
Push it to the crib, let's cut until we hangover
You got the body, I got the do it do it juice
Let's hit it and sip it
Until it starts to get you loose

Now I know you're checking me
It's in your eyes
All the things you heard about me
The other men don't lie
Girl, if I'm coming off
But girl, the way that you throw it
Gave me an appetite

But it feels like I've been saving you for days
Can't wait to take you out and meet you off my plain
Your so inviting, I'm so excited to see what you got for me
I know I'll like it

You say you don't like to rush in
You say you won't but I know you will
Baby, don't front, you can let me in
I won't be more than you can deal with

So let's go, baby, step into my rangerover
Push it to the crib, let's cut until we hangover
You got the body, I got the do it do it juice
Let's hit it and sip it until it starts to get you loose

I know you're willing to do whatever
Let me get you loose
Keep on sipping and giving in
Girl, go head get loose
Don't trick yourself, girl
Just treat yourself, girl
I wanna hear you calling my name

Say

All you, your body my body gonna be friends
I wanna you, wanna your body my body gonna be friends
Girl, stop acting so confused, you know just what you wanna do

So, let's go baby, step into my rangerover
Push it to the crib, let's cut until we hangover
You got the body, I got the do it do it juice
Let's hit it and sip it until it starts to get you loose

If your man don't know what to do
Then let me help you get loose
I got the do it do it juice
This goes out to all the girls in your crew
I got the do it do it juice
This goes out to all the girls in your crew
Come with me sip on this juice
Until it starts to get you loose
