The bridge is ready out the corner of my eyes
I see brides maids
The church is packed hallelujah
What a day, for a wedding
Our Father in Heaven is looking down on us smiling
The angels sing Hallelujah
What a day for a wedding
This moment was born before I knew your name
And it's finally here, it was worth everything
I'll say I do, you'll say I do
This moment was born before I knew your name
And it's finally here and it was worth everything
The angels sing hallelujah
What a day for a wedding
Today (what a day)
To see a wedding
Today, will last forever and ever
And ever (I do)
