Mmmm... Hold you breath
Make a wish and count to three
And then I want you to do something for me

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

Girl, if you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want I'll do it
Wanna fall in love
There's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there you'll be free if you truly wish to be
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What you see will defy explanation

Girl, if you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want I'll do it
Wanna fall in love
There's nothing to it

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
