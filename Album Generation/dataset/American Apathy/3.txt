[Verse1: Dopedout Lino]
Im Finna' started it off by saying im getting older
My lyrics are starting to become more bolder
My Dreams are bigger but much more colder
I ain't stone cold but
I would proudly carry my team and my family on my shoulders
Ruthless youngin'. a gun holder no need for a holster
All my kissing others asses it's over
My game is getting much swoller
A young soldier!
I'm building more strength. I just bought an eight
Let's spit and get blowed away
Throughout life I was closed to giving up on my rapping dreams
Im surprised I stayed
I still got million dollar fantasies
Nobody can take it away from me
Let's spend and make this cheese
My expectations are very creased
Me making it is indeed. This is Loyalty Bleed
Fuck with us and get buried down 6 feet
This is a real nigga talking from the Melrose streets

[Hook] x2
Step Back mothafuckas you don't want it with me
Im feening for million dollar dreams
Me and my mothafucking team
Nobody can take it from mee !

[Verse2: Dopedout Lino]
Aparting from my homies
Bitches pour their hearts out for me
A boyz from the hood type related story
It's dangerous but convenient . death.shine.Fall
I seen it
Niggas talk so loud. I just sit
And just let them look like shit
Is very hard where im from and how I spit
Growing up as a minority kid
Not the racial shit
Sitting as a big six
It ain't sick G' but for some reason it still gets to me
The only fixing is weed
Once I shine all these niggas act so friendly but I know it's part of envy
My feelings for them are empty
Roll it up for the five
Im feeling so fucking alive
But to all these people it seems like I died
Naw. and fuck them hoes too
It's better if I just roll two
I want whatever I can buy. no lie and just live high
But live right. Is that Right?

[Hook]
