[Verse 1: Dope boy Mari]
Got damn I just seen the baddest bitch
Fuck once to the guys she go I Let Them Taste It
I wouldn't kiss her cuz she swallow kids
I break her heart and come back every now and then
We just friends in my opinion but she wanna be more
Martin Lawerence I Kick Her Out The Door
Come back with your friends I like titties galore
I keep loud and lean as if I get it out the store
Got A lot OF shit on my mental put it on a instrumental
I only Call Her When She On Her Mistral
Then She Got To Slop Me Down Like A Porno
I kill shit and beat the case like Orange Juice Simpson
Bullets look like shark tooth do the same as sharks do
I'm dope boy mari If you wondering who shot you
I be high as a kite i got a bitch on bitch on bitch call me a super dike
Thot I will never wife but no one nights
Fuck once and pass her to the guys they copy as if they idolize
Analysis how one day Ima be world wide
Niggas with me God with me family with me
It ain't a mystery I'm not wealthy but niggas envy
Trust issues for all my enemies but i don't know which is one
So i trust nun city like Afghanistan only weight i lift is guns
I be stone of four blunts I wanna do some shit spectacular
Be the first black like Obama i am with the bands no drum
Hop out the van with a drum remorse shown for none
Make you pussies Forest Gump
Im just another nigga trying to make it
With more talent than these other niggas trying to make it
So they be hating dope smoke my fragrance more rich than famous your money looking famish
I think it about to vanish
Rap got a problem I'm thinking I'm the answer
When we band up we turn good girls to dancers
My quad ain't taking no L's any more bitches busting down my door like ain't no knob on the door
Don't need one bitch i need two I'm getting money x 2
Got 2 guns on my waist talk shit I'll point both of them at you
You fake like cartoons always dope smoke in my room
Every nigga that i fuck with will ride with me like wheels
X mark the spot forehead red dot point 22 seconds
I hope these bitch niggas get the message
We reckless like bad kids always dope smoke so i don't stress shit
Asian whore my eyes low and I mix the lean and I move slow
Million rappers in the world What my odds to that?
They Wash like laundromat so I know these labels gone roger back
It Mari World you just a squirrel trying to get a nut 
They like Mari get yours but could you leave the scrapes to us? (Grind Gang)
