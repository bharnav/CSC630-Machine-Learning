[Verse One; dopeRock]

Sometimes I have the darkest thoughts
Scared of church and fuck your god
False idols with a fucked facade
Corrupt your kids, corrupt us all
Can't even imagine if I lost reason for passion
I just need to move right past it, I know my life's a disaster
I tell the voices "stop", but they just keep speakin' faster
I think this demon that's in me finally needs to see a pastor
Need the chemical reaction
Need a fifth and a fuckin' matchstick
She left me with fuckin' scratches
Dead, but i'm back in action
I'm far from well natured
And I sat there while she burned, and said "See you in hell later"
And you trust that fuckin' bitch
Don't listen to the voice inside, that told you, she would lie
Any moment we could die
And they wonder why I drink, because I need this fuckin' high
I stare at blank fuckin' screens and then I let my fingers type
Because I need to fuckin' write
Otherwise there is no reason why I let it eat out my insides
And indeed it is a lie when I say that I feel just fine
I don't
Tell me that I need to change
I won't
Hangin' on to every note
Laughin' all the way to hell because I missed the boat
So far beneath the surface but down here we all float

[Bridge; dopeRock]

These are the confessions of an unimpressive, less than messed-up kid with an urge to go and fuckin' write
And yes theses are the messages of an impression less aggressiveness who turns away from the motherfuckin' light

[Chorus; Martin Iverson]

I wanna watch the world burn
I'll fade away...
And if I keep runnin' from myself...
Will I be okay?

I wanna watch the world burn
I'll drift away...
And if one day I wind up dead...
I wonder what you'd say
I wonder what you'd say
I wonder what you'd say
I'll fade away...
I'll fade away...
I'll fade away...

[Verse Two; dopeRock]

Maybe I'm just scared of all these faces in the mirror
Every day I just debate, if I am really here
And if I ever get better is really what I fear
Can't remember who I was, lose my grip on the steer
Why are you a fuckin' ghost? You used to be so near
I don't even know you now because my memories not clear
I'm just tryin' to be honest
Pour myself out in these sonic's
Til I lose my fuckin' conscience
Til I lose my fuckin' nerve
Til I lose my fuckin' everything, and everywhere, and her
Until everything I'm left with is just nothing but a burn
Blessed with the most energy?
Who would've fuckin' guessed I'd throw a party for my enemies

[Bridge; dopeRock]

These are the confessions of an unimpressive, less than messed-up kid with an urge to go and fuckin' write
And yes theses are the messages of an impression less aggressiveness who turns away from the motherfuckin' light

[Chorus; Martin Iverson]

I wanna watch the world burn
I'll fade away...
And if I keep runnin' from myself...
Will I be okay?

I wanna watch the world burn
I'll drift away...
And if one day I wind up dead...
I wonder what you'd say
I wonder what you'd say
I wonder what you'd say
I'll fade away...
I'll fade away...
I'll fade away...
