F*ck the world
She gon have my baby
Eyes real low
Like Tracy McGrady
L.A. Confidential
Shouts out Big Baby
Smoking on the loud
To keep from going crazy
Life hard like a hammer
Cracker tried to nail me
To smart for that shit
But they steady trying to fail me
Take the detour in the maze
Trying to faze me
How I got through that shit!?
Shit! It amazed me
Rolling with the G.O.D
Devil you can't take me
Free my mind
You can't chain me like slavery
Fly mode take the leap
Never scary
Life on the edge safety off
Necessary
Been breaking laws
Since Trouble said "f*ck Kevin Beary"
Make you wanna change your life
Like DMX on Belly
Watching Belly while we thugged out
In the telly
Talking to myself
But ain't much I can tell me

I got some real sh*t on my mind
I'm bout to take flight, ride through the city lights
I got some pressure built up inside
I'm bout to let it go, you don't even know

Keep it G all the way around
No 180
My dawg say play it smart
Don't let your mind be lazy
Watch out for the fakes
Most these snakes be fugazy
Say they love you but they heart
Colder than the A.C
Been looking out
But what have you done for me lately?
N.i.g.g.a.z knocking each other off
On the daily
Over b*tches or the money man
This shit here crazy
F*ck the world
The b*tch ain't even my lady
But she driving me crazy
Like Kim did to Shady
It's hell on earth
You haven't watched the news lately?
I'm sinning to
But I'm still asking God to save me
You down bad
Rise up like Jesus did on day three
I ain't preaching just giving you game
They gave me
My O.G's, my G's
My big homies
1 time for them boys
Up in the county
For my dawgs up the road
I wish that you was outtie

I got some real sh*t on my mind
I'm bout to take flight, ride through the city lights
I got some pressure built up inside
I'm bout to let it go, you don't even know

Trying to dodge
A million rain drops
Walking through the storm
No shirt on and I'm thuggin

No shirt on and I'm thuggin
No shirt on and I'm thuggin
