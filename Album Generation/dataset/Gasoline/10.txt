Well I work all day and fight all night
With my girl who I treat right
Maybe just one day she'll go on and marry me
Well the meals' ain't made and the dishes ain't done
Just a whole lot of hurtin' for everyone
Well hell just ain't the same without you babe
Well hell just ain't the same without you babe
Well hell just ain't the same without you babe
