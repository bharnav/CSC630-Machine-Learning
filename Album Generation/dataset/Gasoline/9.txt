[Verse 1:]
It seems that nothing ever goes my way
Since you broke my heart when you left that day
There's nowhere to go so just stay with me
Cuz since you've been gone, I've been beggin' you please

[Chorus:]
To tell me you're not alright
And you needed to come home
(Since you've been gone)
To tell me you're not okay
And you needed me all along
Since you've been gone
I need to hear from you
Since you've been gone

[Verse 2:]
It seems that every time you swear to God that you're leaving
I'm down on my knees beggin' you to stay
There's nowhere to go so just stay with me
Cuz since you've been gone, I've been beggin' you please

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Please don't leave me here alone
Just stay awhile
Make me smile
Please don't leave me here alone
Just stay awhile
And, baby, smile
Since you've been gone
I need to hear from you
Since you've been gone
I need to hear you say

[Chorus:]

[Outro:]
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
I need to hear you say
