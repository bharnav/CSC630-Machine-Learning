My memories well they refuse to fade
Of those honey days drinking Lynchburg lemonade
This is the place where my heart will always be
Well southern girl why don't you spent some time with me

Well everytime I try to leave...
Well I say...
Please don't take me away
Please don't take me away
Please don't take me away
From those southern days

Now I'm miles away out on the road again
Another show is let out oh will this ever end
I missed the place where my heart will always be
Cause I'm a simple man with a not so simple life to lead

Well everytime I try to leave...
Well I say...
Please don't take me away
Please don't take me away
Please don't take me away
From those southern days

Well everytime I try to leave...
Well I say...
Please don't take me away
Please don't take me away
Well I said oh no don't you make me leave this place
Please don't take me away from those southern days

From those southern days
