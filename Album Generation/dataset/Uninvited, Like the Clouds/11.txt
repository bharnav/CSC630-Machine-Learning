I said he-hi
I said hello
I said a-where'd you want this little
Song to go....

I started singing
Made up some words
I sang it like a sonnet
I sang it for the birds
I sang about the distance
I sang about the time
I introduced some chaos
And tried to make it rhyme

I hope somebody listened
And heard another world
Pure haze on the better words, they were
Catching a song
A song about the fountain
A song about a day
About a song about a modern day
With a little delay

I said goodbye
I said hold on
Where did you want that little
Song to go....
