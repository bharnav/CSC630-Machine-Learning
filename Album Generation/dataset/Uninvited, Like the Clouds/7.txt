The streets are paved with money
Where nothing's ever sold
Rain falls while it's sunny
And sights worth more than gold
The fires alive are burning
To warm those in the fold

Like never before
Like never before
Like never before

With a portal left to be tried
And find you're not denied
Even filmed in grey at a matinee
It's like never before

Daybreak's a sign for many
Whose work is not in vain
Worth less without any
But measured not by gain
A game that all are winning
As they're guided down destiny lane

Like never before
Like never before
Like never before

With a portal left to be tried
And find you're not denied
Even filmed in grey at a matinee
It's like never before

A night pierced with stars
Like never before (never before)
And time wears the scars
Like never before (never before)
The song's sad melody
Like never before (never before)
And pain's just a memory
Like never before (never before)
