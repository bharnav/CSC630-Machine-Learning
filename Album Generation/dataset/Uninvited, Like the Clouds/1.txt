You're money is so pretty
It's too beautiful to spend
The evening is too magical
Too elaborate to end
The air here is so sweet
Much too pure to breath
It's already over
I don't wanna leave

Unified field
No one here is gonna leave
No one here you've seen before
Magnetic strip
Pull me further in its grip
No one here you can adore

Your scenery is unusual
It's illusive for me to view
The food is just delicious but I can't eat it like you do
The darkness all around us
It's the only thing I see
The music is so scared
It can never get me free

Unified field
No one here is gonna leave
No one here you've seen before
Magnetic strip
Pull me further in its grip
No one here you can adore

Your energy exhausts me
It drives you like a lash(?)
Your enthusiasm is contagious
It covers me like a rash
Your gravity is ...(?) supports me
It guides me through the crash

Unified field
No one here is gonna leave
No one here you've seen before
Magnetic strip
Pull me further in its grip
No one here you can adore
