[Hook]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Hook]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Bridge]
Why'd you go right?
Some might go alone
What you want in life?
Someone here'll gonna get past by

[Hook]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Hook]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out
