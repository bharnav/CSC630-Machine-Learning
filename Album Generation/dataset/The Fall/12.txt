[Hook]
Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way of helping you to breathe a little better

[Verse 1]
The storm and rain
If you need to escape
Oh, you wonder why

[Hook]
Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way of helping you to breathe a little better

[Verse 2]
I can slowly see
My life fading away
In my mind and my heart, I have no doubt
Oh, you wonder why
