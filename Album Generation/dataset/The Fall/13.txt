[Intro]
If you have any checked bags, they will be brought to the front of the station
To get to the front, walk down to the south end of the platform and cross at the crosswalk
That'll put you right in front of the depot
Look for a sign that says "baggage claim"
You should have your bag check handy to show the clerk
Give them a few minutes to get your bags to the front
If anyone is in need of a ride to the front of the station
Red Cap service will be provided on the platform
We do have one group that is going to go first
If you do need Red Cap service to arrive at the front
They will come back and pick you up on the platform and take you to the front of the station
Taxi cabs are located on the center boulevard in front of the depot

[Verse 1]
California
Oh, ocean now, I come again before you
Rode along with you
In the slipping of the sun

[Verse 2]
Sun on dreamers
Repeat the faithful once again
Like water on the mountains, that
It's the slipping of the sun

[Interlude]
Money is blowing
Three days to go
This autumn begins to focus
North claims the imperial throne totem
Fantastic
Dreams, lakes
Mountains
Fantastic
