[Verse 1]
Revolving doors, what have I done?
Someone on the TV, a tepid loss
Revolving doors, what will I become?
A redneck song

[Chorus 1]
Paid up for seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong in here
On a foggy day
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I sit in a diner and the Beatles play
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

[Chorus 2]
I'm paid up for a seven
But I only got S.O. eight, oh, now
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I seem to run out here
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

[Verse 2]
Revolving doors
It's stormy on the eastern sea board
He got silver up his night

[Chorus 3]
He paid up for three
But got only two
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Then he said
Seems I was born for this
Seems I was born to this
Revolving doors
Revolving doors
