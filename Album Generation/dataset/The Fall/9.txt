[Verse 1]
The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come
I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

[Verse 2]
Oh, Lord, send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul

[Outro]
Well, don't you know why I need her loving you
It's no desire
