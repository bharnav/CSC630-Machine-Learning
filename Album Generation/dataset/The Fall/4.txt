[Intro]
Friday, Chicago

[Verse 1]
The pride needs to cool, little rain didn't do it
Never got it back from you (drive away)
And you can be a fool, remember
You can ride away
Never gonna get back there

[Verse 2]
There's a red light in the moonlight
That's all, I'm moving on from you
You can try to leave me or doubt me
Oh, I'm the coolest still, right now

[Outro]
I'd never say good bye, little baby
Never again
