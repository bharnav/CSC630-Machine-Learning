I told myself
That I was wise
That I was strong
But realized
That I was much closer to wrong

Do you believe in a future you can change
Imagine everybody living for today

Don't lose hope!
Even though you can't see it I know
Things are getting better
Don't let go!
We are here with you; you're not alone!
Everyone needs time
So don't lose hope

You tell yourself
That you are weak
That you are so ugly
And you cry yourself to sleep each night
You're incomplete
But do you believe in a future you can change
(Lift up your eyes)
Lift up your eyes
And see that choice is linked to destiny

Don't lose hope!
Even though you can't see it I know
Things are getting better
Don't let go!
We are here with you; you're not alone!
Everyone needs time
So don't lose hope

In the darkness I feel blind
(In the darkness I feel blind)
Lead me back into the light
(Lead me back into the light)
In the darkness I feel blind
(In the darkness I feel blind)
Lead me back into the light
Ohh woahh oh

Don't lose hope!
Even though you can't see it I know
Things are getting better
Don't let go!
We are here with you; you're not alone!
Everyone needs time
So don't lose hope
