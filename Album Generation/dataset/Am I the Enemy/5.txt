The clock at the table
Seems to enable me
To see the time that I have spend alone
Selfish is easy it's also completely free
But it's nothing if no one is there to share
All the good times all the bad times
Let me know

If I dive too deep
You'll pull me out
If I try to speak you'll hear me out
If I get to weak you'll hold me close
And tell me I'm fine

You know the worst lines come at the best times
And I know that I can be so difficult
But that's why I love you
There's nothing that I could do
Without you I am only miserable
All the good times all the bad times
Let me know

If I dive to deep
You'll pull me out
If I try to speak you'll hear me out
If I get to weak you'll hold me close
And tell me I'm fine

If I dive to deep
You'll pull me out
If I try to speak you'll hear me out
If I get to weak you'll hold me close
And tell me I'm fine
Tell me I'm fine

I'm your strength
We achieve
I know that your the sun that's looking down
With all my heart I believe

If I dive to deep
You'll pull me out
If I try to speak you'll hear me out
If I get to weak you'll hold me close
And tell me I'm fine

If I dive to deep
You'll pull me out
If I try to speak you'll hear me out
If I get to weak you'll hold me close
And tell me I'm fine
