Where are the heroes!

It's dark out
The water falls to the ground
I shift gears
No one cares if I make it out
Brake light glare my blank stare tells what I'm about
Quitting is easy when no one's around

Late it's too late to get it right
Whenever I try
Red lights pass
My life flashes before my eyes
Late it's too late to get it right
When all I find are villains and zeros
Where are the heroes

I know you've been here before in your life
I came through
And now you're nowhere left in sight
Leaving is easy when no one's around

Late it's too late to get it right
Whenever I try
Red lights pass
My life flashes before my eyes
Late it's too late to get it right
When all I find are villains and zeros
Where are the heroes
Where are the heroes

Where are the
Where are the
Where are the heroes
Where are the
Where are the
Where are the heroes

Where are the heroes
Where are the heroes
Where are the heroes

Late it's too late to get it right
Whenever I try
Red lights pass
My life flashes before my eyes
Late it's too late to get it right
When all I find are villains and zeros
Where are the heroes
Where are the heroes

Where are the heroes
Villains and zeros
Where are the heroes
