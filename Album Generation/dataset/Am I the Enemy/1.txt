No one said that this would be easy
I think we're past the point of achieving
Any common ground in believing
We can work this out
I used to look to you for direction
That was before I saw the deception
That was hidden behind your eyes
That was just your empty pride
If you gain the world by trading your soul
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
Remember you'll reap just what you sow
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
There's no one left to save you now
You'll get what you deserve your own place in hell
Lost your way it made you change
It made you dark
But once upon a time you spoke from the heart
If you gain the world by trading your soul
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
Remember you'll reap just what you sow
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
There's no one left to save you now
You'll get what you deserve your own place in hell
Blinded by big city lights
I'm not saving you tonight
I know that's what you live for
You'd rather die than end a fight
Rather suffer than be right
I know that's what you live for
I know that's what you live for
What you live for
What you live for
If you gain the world by trading your soul
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
Remember you'll reap just what you sow
If you gain the world
If you gain the world
There's no one left to save you now
You'll get what you deserve your own place in hell
Your own place in hell
