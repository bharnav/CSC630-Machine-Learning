One, two
I don't know if I can take this back
Dug this hole way too deep (Wa-oh)
Feel like I'm heading towards a heart attack
I pray my soul to keep (Wah-Oh)

I feel like I am the only one out here who cares
Please prove me wrong

Come on, come on
Send a message of hope
It seems, we're going no where
Come on come on
I can't carry this love (load?) alone
Will you prove me wrong?

Cause in my dreams it's you I see
I can't do this alone

So many times we're told to hold our tongues
Nobody wants the truth (Wa-oh)
This fire's burning out of our control
But we didn't light the fuse (Noooo)

I feel like I am the only one out here who cares
Please prove me wrong

Come on, come on
Send a message of hope
It seems, we're going no where
Come on come on
I can't carry this love (load?) alone
Will you prove me wrong?

Cause in my dreams, it's you I see
I can't do this alone

I'm not perfect, that I know
But I still fight, Not giving up
I'm not giving up (I can't do this on my own)
Maybe I'll find someone who knows
How to stand and fight
Not giving up
(I can't do this on my own)
I'm Not Giving up
(I can't do this on my own)

Come on, come on
Send a message of hope
It seems, we're going no where
Come on come on
I can't carry this love (load?) alone
Will you prove me wrong?

Cause in my dreams it's you I see
In my dreams, it's you I see
I can't do this alone

I can't do this alone
I can't do this alone
I can't do this alone
