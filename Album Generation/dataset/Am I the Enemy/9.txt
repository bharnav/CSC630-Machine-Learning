You gonna fall! flat on your face!

You've taken everything away
I never matter any way
Just step aside and I will go
Before I do I wanna say

You gonna fall, flat on your face
You gonna fall, fall from grace
You were the only one who ever held me back
Self esteem was the only thing I left
What's done is done and it's not wrong for me to say
I hope you enjoy your fall from grace

You make my life a living hell
But even so I wish you well (I wish you well)
Cause I was raised better then that
This decency is what you lack

You gonna fall flat on your face
You gonna fall, fall from grace
You were the only one who ever held me back
Self esteem was the only thing I left
What's done is done and it's not wrong for me to say
I hope you enjoy your fall from grace

You were the only thing
You were the only thing
You were the only thing
You were the only thing

You were the only one who ever held me back
Self esteem was the only thing I left
What's done is done and it's not wrong for me to say
I hope you enjoy your fall from grace

You gonna fall! flat on your face!
You gonna fall! fall from grace
