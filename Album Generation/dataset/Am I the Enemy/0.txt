They say that life would be it's hardest in your teenage years
Well, some of what they say is really true
They say that life will come and find you when your heart is new
I don't believe it from the mouth of fools

So hang on, hang on

We got a million different ways to see our emotions
We got a million different ways to trick our heads to bring us down
We got a million different colors to see in the ocean
But every time I analyze it plays a trick upon my eyes I'm lost
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)

Living in a world that only takes from you
Makes you want to give in and give up (Don't give up)
But soon you realize that you are not alone
Innocence disguises what you love
So do what you love

We got a million different ways to see our emotions
We got a million different ways to trick our heads to bring us down
We got a million different colors to see in the ocean
But every time I analyze it plays a trick upon my eyes I'm lost
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)

Hold on to the things that keep you young
Nothin lasts forever, gone is gone ('Til we find our way)
Don't be so hard on yourself
There will always be a chance to make it better
Things will get better

We got a million different ways to see our emotions
We got a million different ways to trick our heads to bring us down
We got a million different colors to see in the ocean
But every time I analyze it plays a trick upon my eyes I'm lost
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)
I'm finding my way back to my dreams (whoa)

I'm finding my way back to my dreams
Back to my dreams
