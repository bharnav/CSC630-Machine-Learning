Time is in our heads and it is in our minds
Everything that has a start has a finish line
Do you ever sit and marvel at the stars in the sky?

When you dive into the ocean do you still feel small?
Do you dream that you were running at the pace of a crawl
Are you feeling like you might be getting sick of it all?

Wake me up
I don't wanna live without your love
Lift me up
Take me to a place up far above

Every second, every minute, every hour of life
Should be treated with the wonder in the eyes of a child
Anything can happen when you have to lie to survive

Gravity is bugging
I can't stop
So lift me up

Wake me up
I don't wanna live without your love
Lift me up
Take me to a place up far above

And nothing ever changes
(Nothing ever changes)
Its shape unless you change it
(Its shape unless you change it)
And there's no shame in trying
Because we're all already dying

Wake me up
I don't wanna live without your love

Wake me up
I don't wanna live without your love
Lift me up
Take me to a place up far above

Wake me up
(Everything that has a start has a finish line)
Wake me up
(Do you ever sit and marvel at the stars in the sky)
Lift me up
(Everything that has a start has a finish line)
Lift me up
