Well I've been up and down this road
For a million million miles
I feel like I'm chasing the sun
I want to slow down for just a little while
So come on home
You are all I know
You're in my soul I'll never let go
So please take my hand
Show me once what you need
Put all your worries behind
Cause right beside you is where I'll be
So Come on home you are all I know
You are in my soul I'll never let go yeah
Over and over again
Through the falling rains
I try to wipe away wipe away this pain
Solo
So come on home you are all I know
You are in my soul I'll never let go
Come on home you are all I know
In my soul all I know all I know
