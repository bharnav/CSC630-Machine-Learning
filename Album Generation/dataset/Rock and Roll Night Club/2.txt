[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
Standing on the corner, trying to keep it clean
A fine looking woman in a pair of Lee's
Take her back to my place, lay her down in bed
Now she starts to strip down, I say leave 'em on instead

[Chorus]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Later in the evening, dipping in the tub
Washing, wearing Wranglers, I think that I'm in love
Straight leg or a bootcut, legging, darling, please
Stay with me forever, don't take off those jeans

[Chorus]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

[Solo]

[Outro]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
