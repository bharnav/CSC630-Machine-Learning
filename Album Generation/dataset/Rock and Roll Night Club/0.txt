[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
Cruising in the Moonlight
Heading downtown
Looking for some fast love
Gotta get down
Boogie Woogie Woman
Looking my way
So if you want a good time
You know just where I stay

[Chorus]
At the Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Meet me on the dance floor
Let me shake my thing
We are all just players
In the rock and roll game
Boogie Woogie woman
Join me for a dance
So if you want a good time
Girl you know my plans

[Chorus]
At the Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club

[Solo]

[Outro]
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
