[Verse 1]
Sweetheart
Wipe those tears away
And let me love you, baby
Oh darling
Come out of your cave
And let me love you, baby
Oh

[Chorus]
It's just me and Jon
We're hanging on
Trying it out
Singing our song
It's just Jon and me
And all that we've seen
Trying it out
Plain as can be

[Verse 2]
Sweetheart
Wipe those tears away
And let me love you, baby
Oh darling
Come out of your cave
And let me love you, baby
Oh

[Chorus]
It's just me and Jon
We're hanging on
Trying it out
Singing our song
It's just Jon and me
And all that we've seen
Trying it out
Plain as can be

[Guitar Solo]
