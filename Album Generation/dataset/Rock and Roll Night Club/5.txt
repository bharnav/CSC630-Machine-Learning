Welcome back to the pipe...

(Intermittent noise, voices and clips of songs appear as the user of the radio flicks through stations
Twice some French is heard until finally a station is settled upon)

Oh, hello, thank you for tuning in
You're listening to 106.2, Breeze FM
Where we shoot the breeze, all day long
Up next we have a little treat for you
A few new songs from newcomer Mac DeMarco
So sit back and enjoy, ladies and gentlemen
And once again, thank you for tuning in
Ciao
