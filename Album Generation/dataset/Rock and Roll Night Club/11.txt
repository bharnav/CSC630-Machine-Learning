[Verse 1]
Ah
Me and Mine we'll be alright
Long as she's standing at my side
Long as she's loving me
Mine and me we'll be unified

[Chorus]
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine

[Verse 2]
Mine and me, you and me oh
Looks like the echo's running low
Hosono hope you weren't home
Too many lost but not alone

[Chorus]
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
