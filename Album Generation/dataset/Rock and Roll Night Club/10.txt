[Verse 1]
Only you, only you
Only you can treat me like you do
And only she, only she
Only she chose me when I'm blue
So sorry, boo, we're through

[Chorus]
Casue I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt
I think I'll go lay down
Since I'm done crying over her

[Verse 2]
Here I am, brand new day
Now this you, let me show you, boo
That only she, only she
Only she chose me when I'm green
So sorry, boo, we're through

[Chorus]
Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt
I think I'll go lay down

[Outro]
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
