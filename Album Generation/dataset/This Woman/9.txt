[Verse 1]
God only knows how I've needed a friend
Who can see through the boldness and pride
Someone strong enough I can put my faith in
Someone willing to let me inside
So be a man
And be my man

[Chorus]
I dare you to need me
Like nobody else
I dare you to feel me
Like you've never felt
I dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me

[Verse 2]
Baby you've got your reasons
Dangling from kite strings
But you can open your hands, let them fly
Oh I know you won't always say and do the right things
Oh but some things are worth a try
So if you can
Be my man

[Chorus]
I dare you to know me
Like I've never known
I dare you to show me
That I can be shown
Dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me

[Bridge]
Tell me I
Tell me I'm the one who deserves you
Oh and every time
Every time you know that you want to
I dare you

[Chorus]
I dare you to hold me
Like you never will again
Kiss me and leave the world standing still
Dare you to want to want
Oh
Dare you to need me
Like nobody else
Dare you to feel me
Like you've never felt
Dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me
Dare you to want to want
To wanna be good to me
