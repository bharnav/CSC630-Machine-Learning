[Verse 1]
Jenny's got a job
A cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year
Thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
But it still ain't here
(Hey!)
She's been lookin' for Mr. Right so long
But all she's found is Mr. Wrong
That's the pits

[Pre-Chorus]
She's drawn a line that she won't cross
Her and time are facing off
She says something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give

[Verse 2]
Friday night she had a date
Cell phone junky
A half hour late
That's the biz, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
She's riding out the twists of fate
She's had all that she can take
She says something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give

[Bridge]
I swear
There's got to be a meant to be for me out there
Somewhere someday
I'm gonna find someone, somehow, someway
Jenny's got a job
A cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year

[Outro]
She thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
She says something's got
Something's got
Something's gotta
