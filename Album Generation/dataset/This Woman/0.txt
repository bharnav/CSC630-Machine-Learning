[Verse 1]
Love is a lot like a garden
You throw your whole heart into
Once I was easily started
The hard thing to do
Was following through

[Chorus]
But I want to with you
Make a love that will last forever
I want to with you
Make a life we can live together
Baby I promise you
Every time I laugh
Every tear I cry
Every long night I live through
I want to with you

[Verse 2]
Life is a lot like a battle
When love is under attack
Once I was easily rattled
I'd run just like that
I wouldn't fight back

[Chorus]
But I want to with you
Make a love that will last forever
I want to with you
Make a life we can live together
Baby I promise you
Every time I laugh
Every tear I cry
Every long night I live through
I want to with you

[Bridge]
Once upon a lonely time
I didn't want to share my life
But now I find in everything that I do
I want to oh with you

[Chorus]
Baby I promise you
Every time I laugh
Every tear I cry
Every long night I live through
I want to, I want to, oh with you
Oh I want to with you baby
Oh yeah
I want to with you
I want to with you
I want to with you
