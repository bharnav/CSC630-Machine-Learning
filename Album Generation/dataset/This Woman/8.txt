[Verse 1]
Six AM came way too early
But Friday means it's over soon
Life gets boring in a hurry
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'
And I'm already gone

[Chorus]
I got it bad
Feel that rumble
Tough and tumble under my feet
I got it bad
Round and round, we've all gone mad
Scream it - I got it bad

[Verse 2]
I'm addicted to the fast life
I cut my teeth on concrete dreams
The rush of no control gets me high
You know what I think
Too much of a bad thing
Is exactly what I need

[Chorus]
I got it bad
Feel that rumble
Tough and tumble under my feet
I got it bad
Round and round, we've all gone mad
Scream it - I got it bad

[Bridge]
Bad for speed and burnin' candles
At both ends till I'm unraveled
Bad for jumpin' off the edge without a care
Because I can

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'
And I'm already gone, no

[Chorus]
I got it bad
Feel that rumble
Tough and tumble under my feet
I got it bad
Round and round, we've all gone mad
Scream it
Round and round, Round and round, Round and round
We've all gone mad
I got it bad

[Outro]
I got it bad (got it bad)
I got it bad (I got it bad)
I got it bad
I got it bad
