[Verse 1]
Leave me lonely
Just don't keep me hangin' on
These sleepless nights might kill me
But what don't break me will make me strong
Enough to get past, the past in front of me
I'll have to pass some memories
I'll be alright, get by just fine
Say goodbye and

[Chorus]
Bring on, he's long gone, done me wrong
Tears I'm gonna cry, when you say goodbye
Baby, I won't be lonely long
I won't be lonely long

[Verse 2]
Go on and go on with your life
Just don't waste one more minute of mine
Save your precious breath
The one that took mine away
Once upon a time you had me hangin' on every word
Believin' everything I heard
You're leaving sooner or later
Baby, why keep me waitin'?

[Chorus]
Bring on, he's long gone, done me wrong
Tears I'm gonna cry, when you say goodbye
Baby, I won't be lonely long
I won't be lonely long

[Bridge]
I'd be lying, sayin' I ain't afraid
But fear of leavin'
Ain't no reason to stay, hey, hey

[Chorus]
So baby bring on, oh no, he's long gone, done me wrong
Tears I'm gonna cry, when you say goodbye
Baby, I, when you say goodbye
Baby, I won't be lonely long
Won't be lonely long
Yeah, I won't be lonely long
