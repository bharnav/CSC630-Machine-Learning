The waves are breaking on the wall
The queen of roses
Spreads her arms to fly, shed falls
If I had wings I'd cut them down
Live without these dreams
So I could learn to love the ground

'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my home

The future's like a ringing bell
The road to good intentions
Wanders all the way through hell
The note that hangs in the gilded hall
The clanging of my empty rooms
Yeah, I could learn to love them all

'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my home

The waves are breaking like they do
The spiral of churches
Are the last place to enjoy the view
If I had wings I'd use them now
I could follow you
Then hope someone would pull me down

'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my
Dreams are not my
Dreams are not my home
(Dreams are not my home)
