You can't wake up if you don't dream. (I am blind here, stitching my skin.)
I was falling out of trees. I was pulling back on everything. One more for the others sake
(I just want to fix it. I can feel the air, and know it will never heal.)
One more for my body. It only hurts if you want it to, I won't show anybody
Run from me. (Way too safe)
Run from me. You can't wake up if you don't dream of anyone or anything
(I am blind here, stitching my skin.) You can't get up if you're not falling down
(I just want to hold it. To feel the air, and know it will never heal.)
And I am finally feeling like I could die again, and it wouldn't mean a thing in the end
(If you open up your eyes.) In the end, it won't matter much if you just open your eyes
Don't fall now, into the light that's growing from the ground
If anything, just pray again
(Emulate what you thought you had. Immolate what you thought you knew.)
Turn around, and look me in the eyes and swear to me you'll never be a dream to me
Don't fall now, into the light that's growing from the ground
(Between the skin, the air, and that which you thought you'd never heal.)
Turn around (I'm threading, ) and look me in the eyes and swear to me
Between the skin, the air, and that which you thought you'd never heal
