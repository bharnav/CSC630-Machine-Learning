Well I hope that you know
That you died in my dream
We were both in the grass
When the wind took you and put you in my past
So just breathe
Hold it in and think of me
Just don't fall back
So carelessly
When everything is forced to fall in place
I'll find my own - you'll find your own - embrace
And the worst thing of all
Was that I couldn't fall
When I jumped off those cliffs
Hoping I wouldn't live
And can I hold on? Can I hold on to you?
And can we both die if the wind is passing through?
So just hold it in, breathe and just think of me
Don't fall back so carelessly
When everything is forced in place
I'll find my own - you'll find your own own
And the worst part of it all
Was I could not seem to fall
When I jumped straight off those cliffs
Hoping that I wouldn't live
