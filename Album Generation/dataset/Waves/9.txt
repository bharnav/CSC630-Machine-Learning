We have a lot to learn, someday we'll find
Love is nature
These lines that stitch my hand tell of my life
My own version
I'll hold my breath if you hold me under
I won't feel it
So don't let me ride along these waves
Don't let me
These lines that stitch my hand tell of my life
My own version
I'll hold my breath if you hold me under
I can't feel it
So don't let me ride along these waves
And don't let me
When in silence
It doesn't hurt to raise your voice
Just open it up
And explode your heart into a thousand words
Or leave it alone
And expect the same from everyone else
Just tear it apart
It doesn't hurt to raise your voice
Please take me home
Don't let me die alone
Oh god it's true
I can't rely on you
Oh
I can't rely on you
