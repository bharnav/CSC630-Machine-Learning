You said it first. We'll all end up in different places
When we wake up, you'll be falling
I'll be singing, "I won't fall back and think of this
You won't remember my hands, my face, my tongue and lips
I'm just a pretender."
This house is burning down. The waves are flooding out
Your house is burning down. The waves are flooding it
So don't move; raptured in a moment. (I can't scream from my throat.)
Well in your breathe, I tried to stall
I never thought that anyone would fall
In your breath, I tried to hear, I never thought that anyone would fall
I never thought that you could save them all
So don't look down. Just know I found a better place to rest my head
Don't look at the light from the ground
