When you don't see the fall, you'll know by now just how it feels
"Well you've got more to learn from this." I heard you say
You laid your hands upon my face. Don't forget me here. I won't forget you
Parked cars and night fall - places that remember you
We walk along the path, we've walked a thousand times in our past
Well you've got more to learn from this. So hold my hand, and hold your breath
Because you mean everything to me. So just let go of everything between
I am scared of dying so bad, but aren't we all scared?
Someday we'll find our hearts will align and burn all the way
Burn with time
