Don't you wait for me
Things aren't meant to be
When you don't feel the air
You can't feel it
My dear you're so worn down
I can hear it in your voice
I can see it in your veins
Pumping poison through your heart
You can't feel it anymore
Or anything at all
Stop your breathing
Start believing
I will always wait for you
Through everything you've been through
When you can't feel the air
You can't feel it
My dear you're so worn down
I can hear it in your voice
I can see it in your veins
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see it, I can feel it (no more)
