I knew someone this time, she was dying as I bit my tongue
I knew little from my youth, but I knew too soon to save her
Well it's like they all say. So take my breathe, I'll die today
And I can't repent. And I can't regret
(And there's something I felt and it won't escape me
And there's something I knew, and it won't escape me.)
Well I'm running through my dreams, wishing you could see
How fast it takes me to fall in open valleys
My son you're all choked up
Just open your heart and make believe
The sun could make and cast the biggest shadows over me
Over the places I hold in my thoughts
In my thoughts is where you'll be
