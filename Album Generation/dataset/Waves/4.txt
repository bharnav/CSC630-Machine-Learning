With every summers end
You lose a dearest friend to the wind
And I cannot remember
The voice that sang inside her
I'll try my best to stay 14
And tucked away, like it was
And I cannot remember a face to paint a picture
And I will never forget you, someway - somehow
A place I feel I never knew
And I will never forget this
I'd trade my soul for another chance to see it through
