I sought salvation but I found insanity
Lost in a mess I returned to profanity

I've been reaching for the sky
But I got stuck with my feet down in concrete

Don't you run away now - Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning - woah
Don't you run away now - Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle - Take a rocket ride

Suffered my way with divine aspiration
I failed to resist the sweetest temptation
Been stuck to religion till I've clung to the pie
You never really miss it until you really try

Tried to jump but held down by concrete
The venery surrounding my feet

Don't you run away now - Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning - woah
Don't you run away now - Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle - Take a rocket ride

Oh I've tried to reach higher
On and on but my flesh is too weak
Been searching for answers - I've been led to the fire
There must be a reason for us to be down here
Oh I'm drifting - temptation
Carried out to sea - I'm drifting - I'm drifting away
I'm drifting away - I'm drifting away

I'm a piledriver - piledriver...

I've been reaching for the sky
But I got stuck with my feet down in concrete

Don't you run away now - Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning - woah
Don't you run away now - Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle - Take a rocket ride
