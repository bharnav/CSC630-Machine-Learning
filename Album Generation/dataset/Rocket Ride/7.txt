You do not know, and you don't care
And you may never learn
I made approaches, you gave me teeth
And got my hope inurned

Unpreposessing, that's what you say
Don't get the essential point
What it came down to was - you ain't got nothing
Here's to the wicked and here's to the odd

You got your chance going down the drain, you're dumping
The catch of the century
You've had your chance, but you're much too vain to take it
The catch of the century

Nobody's waiting, cause all the world is already spoken for
A host of rivals, I'm out of vogue and I'll be forever more
You strut around, sneer from on high, I'm on the road again
I'm going down with flying colors, before I go down on somebody else

You got your chance going down the drain, you're dumping
The catch of the century
And lady luck's got her ass in pain, you're wasting
The catch of the century

"I tell you, one day you will regret it
I will sell millions of records
And I'm gonna have hundreds of women
And seven, seven Ferraris!
A private jet!
Uh... A helicopter license!
And I'm gonna be the Formula One world champion!
I'm gonna have a big house! ?
And you will be nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
You will be nothing but nothing!
Waah! Yeah! You, nothing! Nothing you're nothing!
Helicopter!"

"Tobi, es ist gut jetzt"

"Gut?"
