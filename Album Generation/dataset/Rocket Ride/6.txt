Waiting for a little sign
Seems like to no avail
Strolling down the pavement aimlessly
She is praying for someone
To snatch her bag of memories
How come you call it destiny
When the cross you bear is
Your only company?

Never seen you
I don't even know your name
But still I believe

That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection
On this cold and windy road
Save me from a state of unemotion
Just a little affection
On this windy road

Why is it all so confusing?
Why does growing up hurt so bad?
We seek and we get lost
We get found and go again
And I don't know what's gonna be
I won't make any promise but I believe

Never seen you
I don't even know your name
But still I believe

That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection
On this cold and windy road
Save me from a state of unemotion
Just a little affection
On this windy road

I don't know if I can
I don't know if I should
I don't know what is right
And what's to come if you would
Here I stand in the rain
Here I stand in the cold
I'm reluctant to get another shot in my soul...
I'm afraid of that hole.....

Save me, save me...

..lonesome road..
