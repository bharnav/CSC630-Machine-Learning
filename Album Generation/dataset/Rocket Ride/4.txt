Road lies ahead
And a long road lies behind me
I see lights passing by
And I know it's the time of our lives
A million miles
Lightyears I've been travelling
To watch and enjoy this world
And I've seen ass galore

I'm musing over it all
Closing my eyes to remember it all
Embracing the past and the future to come
Kiss the road that leads to my tribe..

I've found my way home
I'll return to where I belong
Back to where I stem from
Back to Paradise
Time to return to the tribe!

The other side - always close to the edge
Been walking a thin line
Always knew someone watched my step
A mistery to make it out alive and sane
The battle is over
And I know who's been with me

Now I'm musing over it all
On top of this world I remember it all
Awaiting that sunrise and sunset at home
Kiss the way that leads me to my tribe

I've found my way home
I'll return to where I belong
Back to where I stem from
Back to Paradise
Time to return to the tribe!

I've seen battlefields, drunk drummers
Japanese hotel toilets
Piesel tuning guitar
And A.C. being my personal slave
