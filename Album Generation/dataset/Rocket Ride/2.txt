The dream is over - no one is to take the blame
We believed in roses but only thorns remained

And I look into the rear view mirror
We create and we destroy
Put our blood into a street with a dead end
Walk up that stairway to jump off into the black

Here we go!
We go all the way - Do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all wasted again?
We go all the way - Do we need the pain
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all just wasted time?

Maybe I am different, maybe I'm a fool
And I wonder if it's worth it
Trying to find another you

And I look into the rear view mirror
Just to see how fucked I look
While I drive along that street with a dead end
Like a moth to the flame it's gonna suck me into pain

Still we go!
We go all the way - Do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all wasted again?
We go all the way - Do we need the pain
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all just wasted time?

What are we heading for, why do I dare again?
Once bitten twice shy and still we never learn

So here I'm lying - A leisure-poet in pain
Involuntary loner, I know that life is just a game
Where nobody gets out alive - A sedative shot for me
No happy man gets out alive - Neither of us you will see

Here we go!
We go all the way - Do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all wasted again?
We go all the way - Do we need the pain
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before - Was it all just wasted time?
