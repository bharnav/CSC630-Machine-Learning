I saw her coming in high-heels
Moving like a queen
A little sweet angel but deep underneath
A mean machine

You're lying in wait to make me a fool
You want me to bite
I'm gonna take the bait
And the hunter for afters
I'll take you for a ride

And I don't wanna play no games
'Cause I'm a bad, bad boy all around
Let me be your Titanic
Before you know what's going on
I may go down

Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've begun
With the hair force one

Don't make no mistakes
Don't you miss out
On the hell of a time
I'm a real go-getter
And there's no doubt
That down the line

I know what you want
And I know what you need
Your secret desire
Got the gloves of a man
The hands of a beast
And my pants on fire

And I don't wanna play no games
'Cause I'm a nasty, bad boy
All around, around
Let me be your Titanic
Before you know what's going on
I'm going down. Now...

...Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've begun with the hair force one

Honey you know what?
You know what I am...

...Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've begun...

...Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've begun with the hair force one
