[Verse 1]
Big on the underground, what's the point of knocking me down?
Everybody knows, I'm already good on the ground
Most of us stay strong, shit don't really bound us
Then I go on my own, making bombs with rubber bands

[Chorus 1]
I have my heart down so I need a man for romance
Streets are making 'em hard so they selfish little roamers
Jumpin' girl to girl,Make us meat like burgers
When I get fat I'll pop me out some leaders

[Verse 2]
Protocol to be a Rocawear model?
It didn't really drop that way, my legs hit the hurdle
Protocol to be a rocker on a label?
It didn't really drop that way, my beats were too evil

[Chorus 2]
Now I put away paper for later so I'm stable
A better something better come, gotta get cable
Ghetto pops, food drops, stored up in my stable
Pop 'em up, pop 'em down, eat 'em off the table

[Verse 3]
The village got on the phone, said the street is comin' to town
They wanna check my papers, see what I carry around
Credentials are boring, I burnt them at the burial ground
Don't order me about, I'm an outlaw from the badlands

[Chorus 3]
Put away shots for later, so I'm stable
Live in trees, chew on feet, watch Lost on cable
Bird flu gonna get you, made it in my stable
From the crap you drop, on my crop when they pay you
