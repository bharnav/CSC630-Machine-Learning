[Verse 1]
I don't read, yeah, I just guess
As the world turns
Don't bring me with your mess

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to do my best
Get my head up out the stress
When the money turns the world
Your loving turns to less

[Verse 3]
I learn by mistakes
Most of it is yours and
I'm done living life as a criminal
And I thought I'd die young just to please the old
Now I teach the young, I'm vitriol

[Hook x2]
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down

[Verse 4]
The war in me makes a warrior
Like a pitbull getting with a terrier
I'm better off in North Korea
Yeah, dropping from a barrel of a carrier

[Verse 5 x2]
Coz I got enough to be more
It's hard enough to get more
I shut the door on everything
Just to let my head blow

[Hook x2]
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down

[Verse 6]
Picture this, a dull grey street in the way
Neon signs gonna shine though
Shorty, you gonna shine though
Come up on ya treasure trove
Like the sun explode
Check up in the paper
In the mirror for ya horoscope

[Verse 7]
Walking on a tightrope
Go for something I don't even know
Where to get it from
Sending out a signal
Smoke from a gun blow
As I knock off, knock off
Things that I don't want

[Chant]
