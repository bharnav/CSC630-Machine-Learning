[Intro: The Wilcannia Mob]
Hoy, hoy, hoy
Testing one
Go, one, two, three, four
Wilcannia Mob
M.I.A
Morganics

[Hook: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'

[Verse 1: Wally Ebsworth]
They call me Wally, this is where I'm at
I wear my NRL baseball cap
Parramatta's my team if you know what I mean
To be the captain, that's my dream

[Verse 2: Keith Dutton]
My name is Keith from Wilcannia Street
I walk on stilts to read the beat
When it crawls out, I shake a leg
This is my rhyme and that's what I said

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
First of all I wanna say
I don't really know why you act that way
My name is Maya and people always say
I act kinda strange like a dooba weh
I like fish and mango pickle
When I climb trees, them feet, them tickle
I'm broke this month, didn't pay rent
I had to jump town and my money's all spent (all spent)
I had to jump town and my money's all spent

[Hook: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'

[Interlude: The Wilcannia Mob]
We-we-we play some didge'
We-we-we play some didge'
We-we-we play some didge'

[Verse 4: Colin "Colroy" Johnson]
Well Colroy's here, have no fear
All you old pigs better watch out for this bit
And I'm here at the game and I'm almost ten
I wanna be an actor like Jackie Chan

[Verse 5: Lendal King]
Lendal is my name; I like to do back flips
Listen to the words that come from my lips
Jump off the bridge and I'll play the didge
And when I catch a fish, I put it in the fridge

[Verse 6: Buddy Blair]
My name is Buddy, I can't stand still
Wilcannia to Dubbo to Broken Hill
I've been movin' around from town-to-town
And this is how I get down!

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
Rode the BMX when we walked through the bush
The boys fight to ride it, but I just let 'em push
Keith stole an egg from a lil' cuckoo
Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced jookoo jookoo

[Verse 7: M.I.A.]
There's only one ocean that got fish left
One day we'll have to be a really good chef
And I don't mean us in the bush making meth
Boys if you catch meth you catch your death
When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick
Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits

[Hook: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
