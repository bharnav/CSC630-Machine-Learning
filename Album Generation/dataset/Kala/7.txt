[Verse 1]
Sick of all the shit that's keeping me down
If you're dead from the waist down
It's easy staying down
I never thought about it twice
But you do pay the price
It ain't your weekly cash
That feeds my mum the rice

[Verse 2]
Yo, don't be calling me desperate
When I'm knocking on the door
Every wall you build
I'll knock it down to the floor

[Pre-Hook]
See me, see me bubbling quietly
See me, see me acting like you ain't met me
See me, see me bubbling quietly
See me, see me acting like you ain't met me

[Hook x2]
Hands up! (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
Guns out! (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
Represent (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
The world town (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)

[Chant x2]
Hands up!
Guns out!
Represent
The world town!

[Chant 2 x2]
Represent the World Town

[Verse 3]
Look at what you did, you done it before
Every little dollar just keeps me down more
I never had you on my side, bubbling on my side
Why they tell me different when they make me explodified

[Verse 2]
Yo, don't be calling me desperate
When I'm knocking on the door
Every wall you build
I'll knock it down to the floor

[Pre-Hook]
See me, see me bubbling quietly
See me, see me acting like you ain't met me
See me, see me bubbling quietly
See me, see me acting like you ain't met me

[Hook x2]
Hands up! (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
Guns out! (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
Represent (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)
The world town (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)

[Chant x2]
Hands up!
Guns out!
Represent

[Hook x2]
Hands up! (a-ni-ni-ni-ni)

[Chant x2]
Hands up!
Guns out!
Represent
The world town!
