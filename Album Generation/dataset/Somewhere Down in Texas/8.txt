[Verse 1]
I know the end is near
I've seen the warning signs
Been preparing myself
Laying in supplies
I bought a case of Jack
A boxed-set of Merle
I'm getting ready
Ready for the end of the world

[Chorus]
I'm getting ready for the end to come
That final hour it all comes undone
An she drops the bomb
A says he ain't my girl
I'm getting' ready
Ready for the end of the world

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My neon shelter waits
Where I can go to hide
While the memories burn
I'll be safe inside
With the honky-tonk few
Bracing for the worst
I'm getting ready
Ready for the end of the world

[Chorus]


[Outro]
Yeah, I'll be ready
Ready for the end of the world
