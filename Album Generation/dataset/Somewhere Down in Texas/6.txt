[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
Peaked out my door
It was raining, cold an' grey
It's my one day off, I was gonna play golf
There goes the plans that I made
Oh, but you won't hear me complain

[Verse 2]
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine
An' the sky's always blue
Couldn't ask for better weather
To do what I do
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
So let's go grab a blanket
An' a hot cup of coffee
And sit out on the front porch and swing
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind
We don't have to say anything
Let's just listen to that old tin roof sing

[Verse 4]
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine
An' the sky's always blue
Couldn't ask for better weather
To do what I do
Oh, what a perfect day for loving you
Oh, what a perfect day for loving you
For loving you
