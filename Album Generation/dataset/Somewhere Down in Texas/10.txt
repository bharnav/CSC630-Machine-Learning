[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been stumbling through the darkness
Trying to feel the ground beneath my feet
Afraid of Moving much in any direction
Stuck where the past and the future meet

[Chorus]
But I finally got my first good look
A little fire was all it too
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burning' bridge

[Verse 2]
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of
Things that I'd do different now from then
But when I really make myself get honest
It's over and I can't go back again

[Verse 3]
'Cause I finally got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burning bridge

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind

[Chorus]
