[Verse 1]
I been on the road now dang near all my life
An' I do love to sing a song
I can say I've worked hard, put in my time
Now it's time to go home
And catch up on my chores
Watch the sunset from my porch

[Verse]
I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're looking for me
Drinking in that great wide-open, soaking up the summer breeze
Kicking back an settled in with my family
I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're looking for me

[Verse 2]
That's where I got started, where I was born an' bred
It's the fire inside of me
I couldn't have imagined this Texas highway led
Far beyond my wildest dreams
But I'll turn out the lights tonight
An say Goodnight, but not goodbye

[Chorus]
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I made so many friends
Hope we meet someday again
Till then

[Chorus]
