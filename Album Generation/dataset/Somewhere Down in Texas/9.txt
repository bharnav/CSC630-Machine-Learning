[Verse 1]
He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
Thought she might do some crying lose some sleep at night
But he had no idea, when he hit the road
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go

[Chorus]
Let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more
She let herself go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She poured her heart a soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go

[Verse 3]
Let herself go on her first blind-date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go, buy a brand new car
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes


[Chorus]

[Outro]
To Vegas once, Honolulu, New York City
Came back knocked-out pretty

[To Fade]
