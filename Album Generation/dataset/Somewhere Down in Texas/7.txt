[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And therefor I reside in Tennessee

[Bridge]
Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
