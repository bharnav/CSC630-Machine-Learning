[Verse 1]
I have been watching you watching her watching herself in the mirror
In her tailor-made dress an' her long blonde hair
An' her big diamond rings, her custom-made shoes
And I can by the look on your face that you're making' your move
But she hasn't got time for a man who's tongue-tied
An' she doesn't like cowboys an' thinks less of fools

[Verse 2]
So, boy, don't you saddle yourself to a high-tone woman
She'll cut up your heart like an' old credit card
When the fun and the money runs out
I've never seen an uptown, well-read thoroughbred
High-tone woman sink as low as you


[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Hey, I'm on your side; don't go getting' me wrong, now
You're not a bad fellow at all
But you're out of her league so stay in the bleachers
Son, you couldn't please her if you had it all

[Bridge]
So, boy, don't you saddle yourself to a high-tone woman
She'll cut up your heart like an' old credit card
When the fun and the money runs out

[Verse 4]
You're a fool if you saddle yourself to a high-tone woman (I seen her.)
I've seen her cut up a heart like an' old credit card
When the fun and the money runs out
I've never seen an uptown, well-read thoroughbred
High-tone woman sink as low as you

[Outro]
Oh no, I've never seen an uptown, well-read thoroughbred
High-tone woman sink as low as you
