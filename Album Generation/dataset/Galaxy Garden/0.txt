If paradise is such a fragile affair
Then why have we the lion's share
As if we walk the earth alone
Like infants breaking the cradle
There isn't anything we fail to corrupt
The flip-side of the midas touch
We're walking in a world of glass
With iron footsteps
We do the raindance every night
And i hope the gods will treat us right
And if the sky should tumble down
Will it quench out thirst or crush us to the ground
Have you a ticket to the greatest event
The world inside a circus tent
Where clowns debate disarmament
And wildlife live within cages
The parody is never far from the truth
And mankind is the living proof
A dying planet in our arms
We walk the tightrope
The answer's very simple
A world without it's people
Has got to be better than this
