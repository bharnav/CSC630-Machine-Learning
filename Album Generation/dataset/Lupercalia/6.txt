From the east to the south
I tongue the roof of my mouth
To new days of doubt without you
First gear, I face the trouble ahead
Final word has been said
Long distance spread between us
I tell myself to

Hold on, won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up, find my soul

Happy without you oh (x5)

Not called for weeks now
Six days without sleep means
I am a slave to my early grave
If I do not be brave, behave
Seize myself out of this mess
I have created of myself yet again
Yet again I say

Hold on, it won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up, find my soul

Happy without you oh (x5)

We go on
Heart be strong
Stay whole
Unbroken
As we divide
Our love goodbye
Thanks for, the time
Time of my life

Happy without you oh (x4)

Time, time of my life
Time, time of my life
(So happy without you)
Time, time of my life
Time, time of my life

Thanks for the time of my life
(Happy without you)
Happy without you oh
Happy without you
