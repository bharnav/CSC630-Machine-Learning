Coat of black
Coat of black
Weary waiting
Weary waiting

I turn out the light
We kiss goodnight
Been weary waiting
Weary waiting
To come closer
Closer to where we belong

Outside the city
Children brandish
Sharp their knives
Sharpened knives
And come closer
Closer to where we belong

If you be weak
Then I'll be strong
When the night is long

Trust
Over years you'll wake to find
This man who's loved you
Your whole life
So come closer
Closer to where we belong

Just close your eyes
Let those foxes fight
The children of this city sharp their knives
Come closer
Closer to where we belong

If I be weak
Won't you be strong
When the night is long?

If I be weak
Comreedhoo, comreedhoo
When the night is long

Close your eyes
Let the foxes fight
Close your eyes
Come closer to where we belong
Where we belong
When the night is long
When the night is long
