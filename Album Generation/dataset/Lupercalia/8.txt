Before you I was living
In my silver fish kitchen
Fruit fly clouds breathing
No hope, no religion
A nightmare on Hazlitt Road

I was too young
Too weak from the road
Too proud for help
Too scared to grow old
Out of my depth and out of control
I was so lonely then
Living in slow motion
Breathless corrosion
Waiting for the kiss of life

Slow motion
Breathless corrosion
Waiting for the kiss of life

City rumours spreading
Deep water wolf treading
Yes, I was too young
Too weak from the road
And too proud for help
Too scared to grow
Out of my depth and out of control

Then strangers meet in slow motion
Breathless devotion
That night you gave me
The kiss of life
Slow motion
Breathless
Breathless
That night you gave me
The kiss of life

That night you saved me
With the kiss of life

Wake me out of that deep sleep, darling
Wake me out of that deep sleep, darling
Wake me out of that deep sleep, darling
Wake me out of that deep sleep, darling
With your kiss

Wake me out of that deep sleep
Deep sleep, darling
Deep sleep, darling
