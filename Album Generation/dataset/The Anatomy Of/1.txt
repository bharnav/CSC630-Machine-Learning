When I get high
I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's
A drug for me

My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Always got the cops
Coming after me
Custom built bike
Doing 103

My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Ooh, are you ready girls ?
Ooh, are you ready now ?

Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeh, baby
Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
Ooh, yeh, baby

Skydive naked
From an aeroplane
Or a lady with a body
From outerspace

My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Say I got trouble
Trouble in my eyes
I'm just looking
For another good time

My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Yeh, are you ready girls ?
Yeh, are you ready now ?

Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeh, baby
Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
Ooh, yeh, baby

Ooh
Kickstart my heart

When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by...
I'd say we've kicked some ass

When I'm enraged
Or hittin' the stage
Adrenalin rushing
Through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass

Ooh, ahh, it kickstarts my heart
I hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this... to rock

Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
Ooh, yeh, baby
Ooh, yeh
Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeh, baby

Kickstart my heart
