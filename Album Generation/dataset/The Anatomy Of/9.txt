I don't feel the suns comin' out today
It's staying in, it's gonna find another way
As I sit here in this misery
I don't think I'll ever (no Lord) see the sun from here
And oh as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way
But that's okay, they're just afraid to change
And when you feel life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you look up way to the sky
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die
And as we all play parts of tomorrow
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So I want to write my words on the face of today
And then they'll paint it
And oh as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say, they'll say
Hey look at him and where he is these days
When life is hard, you have to change
