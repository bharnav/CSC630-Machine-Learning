[Intro]
Ooh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I loved you and loved you with all that's in my power
I was used and abused 'til I was sweet and sour
I kissed you and kissed you and gave you all my sugar
You knew that I'd be useless if I let you know what you were to me
I thought it would be okay and we shared everything, no way
And I told you, I told you how I was such a sad case
You said you could save me, I'm doing the saving

[Pre-Chorus]
Went to sleep a superhero
And he woke up a villain
Killin' and killin' my love
Oh, what happened?
Oh no, what happened?
You got me fighting like Wonder Woman, Woman, but

[Chorus]
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (oh, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know what happened
Don't know what happened
Don't know what happened

[Verse 2]
I keep trying and trying to wrap my head around it
Crying so, can't let nobody see how I'm acting
You hurt me, you hurt me and, no, not physically
Ain't got no bumps and bruises
To show people what you're doing to me
I thought it would be okay, but you see
I heard everything you said and I knew it
I knew that you'd turn out to be a sad case
You said you could save me, I'm doing the saving

[Chorus]
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
You got me using all my Kung Fu tricks, tricks
Hit â€˜em with the round house kick to the tempo
One, two, three, four, hung hi ho, T.K.O, Tae Kwon Do
You know, when you see that hand go chop
Everything stops, the flow so hot
Like steam from a coffee pot (ha ha ha)
Rush hour, no traffic
No Jet Li, just Jackie
You acting like you stay behind
Go read up on your classics
You ol' fake-o wanna be Superman
Give Clark Kent back his glasses, man
I hit you with a judo kick so fast
You look back like, "What happened?"

[Chorus]
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I-I-I don't wanna fi-i-ight
Don't wear no ti-i-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no, superhero-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no, what happened?
