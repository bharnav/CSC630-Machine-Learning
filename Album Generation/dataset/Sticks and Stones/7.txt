[Intro]
No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of

[Verse 1]
Them boys always acting so mean
Hands down in the dirt, don't come clean
Like a hole and a three letter donkey (Donkey)
Ring the bell, let me teach you something
'Cause your mama never taught you nothing
Call Pharrell 'cause you keep on frontin' (Frontin')

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen up, turn it up
Listen up, turn it up

[Chorus]
No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
He gotta lean in a gangsta stance
He needa rock all the sickest brands
And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you mess with me

[Verse 2]
Can't touch me, liar, I'm fire
You and all your tricks expired
Your ride really needs new tires
Vroom-v-vroom-v-vroom-vroom, tire!
You like my kicks? Lemme kick ya
Like a Twilight fan, I'mma bite ya
Turn around, lemme CeeLo "Forget Ya"

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen up, turn it up
Listen up, turn it up

[Chorus]
No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
He gotta lean in a gangsta stance
He needa rock all the sickest brands
And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you mess with me

[Bridge]
(If you want me looking your way)
Baby, gotta get real
(If you want me ready to play)
I'mma have to feel
(If you want me looking your way)
Baby, gotta get real
Yeah, go and get real

[Chorus]
No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
He gotta lean in a gangsta stance
He needa rock all the sickest brands
And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
No playa boi can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
He gotta lean in a gangsta stance
He needa rock all the sickest brands
And give me love, not a bad romance
I'll make a move, nothing left to chance
So don't you mess with me
