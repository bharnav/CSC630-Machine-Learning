[Verse 1]
Boy, I was watching you move, sorta checking you out
Loving what you do, boy, we oughta paint the town
You can watch me get to it double roll and lean
Make up your mind if you're liking what you see
Don't want no flowers, don't buy me no gifts
I need somebody who can take care of this
I'm loving what you do 'cause I know you do it well
You got your game tight, real smart, I can tell

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't play that usual game (Usual game)
The type to put out your flame (Out that flame)

[Chorus]
I, oh, I, I don't wanna shed a tear
And I, oh, I, I didn't want to end up here
Could you gimme that dust that you throw right 'round?
Give me that stuff, make you wanna get down
I, oh, I didn't wanna end up here

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I went through your phone, I didn't like what I've seen
You promised you'd be true, you made a fool out of me
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time
I saw your true colours, almost lost my mind
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls
Except you bought her flowers and you bought me pearls
When you're going out tonight, I know you're seeing her again
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, please don't play that usual game (The usual game)
The type to put out your flame (Put out that flame)

[Chorus]
I, oh, I, I don't wanna shed a tear
And I, oh, I, I didn't want to end up here
Could you gimme that dust that you throw right 'round?
Give me that stuff, make you wanna get down
I, oh, I didn't wanna end up here

[Bridge]
If I don't leave right now
Will my wounds still open?
Slipped right through your hands
Now my heart is broken

[Interlude]
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah
I'm moving on, yeah, yeah
I'm moving on, on, on, on

[Chorus]
I, oh, I, I don't wanna shed a tear (I don't wanna shed a tear)
And I, oh, I didn't wanna end up here (Didn't wanna end up here)
Could you gimme that dust that you throw right 'round?
Give me that stuff, make you wanna get down
I, oh, I didn't wanna end up here
