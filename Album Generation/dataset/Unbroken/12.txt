[Verse 1]
The space in between us starts to feel like we're worlds apart
Like I'm going crazy, and you say it's raining in your heart
You're telling me nobody's there to dry up the flood
Oh, but that's just crazy
Because baby, I told you I'm here for good

[Chorus]
My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me, but you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine, and remember I'm always near
If you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone

[Verse 2]
I try to build the walls to keep you safe when I'm not around
But as soon as I'm away from you, you say they come tumbling down
But it's not about the time that we don't get to spend together
Oh, it's about how strong our love is
When I'm gone and it feels like forever

[Chorus]
My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me, but you know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine, and remember I'm always near
If you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone

[Bridge]
You say the time away makes your heart grow numb
But I can't stay just to prove you wrong
Oh, look at how far we've come
Don't you know, don't you know that you're the one?
Oh, you're not alone
You're not alone, oh
You're not alone, oh
You're not alone, oh
Know that you're not alone
You're not

[Chorus]
My love's like a star, yeah
You can't always see me, but you know that I'm always there
Know that I'm always there
When you see one shining
Take it as mine, and remember I'm always near, yeah
If you see a comet, baby, I'm on it
Making my way back home
Making my way back to you
Just follow the glow, yeah
It won't be long just know that you're not alone
Yeah-yeah, yeah, oh, oh
