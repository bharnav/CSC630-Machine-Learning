[Verse 1]
It's probably what's best for you
I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best, then you're stuck
I tried to sever ties and I ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts

[Chorus 1]
And I just ran out of bandaids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

[Verse 2]
Even now I know what's wrong
How could I be so sure if you never say what you feel, feel?
I must have held you hand so tight
You didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I just ran out of bandaids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

[Bridge]
You must be a miracle worker
Swearing up and down you can fix what's been broken, yeah
Please don't get my hopes up
No, no
Baby, tell me, how could you be so cruel?
It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I just ran out of bandaids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Baby, I just ran out of bandaids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

[Outro]
Oh, no no no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh, no no no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh, ooh
Oh, yeah oh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You never really can fix my heart
