[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
Remember love
Remember you and me
Remember everything we shared on this planet when we cared
Remember hearts
Remember unity
Remember loving neighbors without expecting favors

[Pre-Chorus 1: Demi Lovato]
Why be afraid to make an honest mistake?
If you acknowledge the pain
And you wanna change
You can get through anything

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Do you remember at all?
People walking hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
Look at me
Now look at you
Now look at me again
See, we're not so different
Look around, what do you see?
We're throwing things outside our window
We don't care to keep it clean

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jason Derulo]
I had a dream beauty was only skin deep
And if we all just believe
Love is all we need
Nothing else can set you free, yeah

[Chorus: Demi Lovato & Jason Derulo]
Do you remember at all?
People walking hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Singing, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh yeah

[Verse 3: Demi Lovato & Jason Derulo]
If we could throw away the hate
And make love last another day
Don't give up just for today
Life would be so simple
And they may talk about us
But they will never stop us
We'll keep singing

[Breakdown: Demi Lovato & Jason Derulo]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on, we'll keep singing
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-yeah, whoa yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Demi Lovato & Jason Derulo]
Do you remember at all?
People walking hand-in-hand
Can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Demi Lovato & Jason Derulo]
Oh, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah
Hold your hand with your neighbors
Together, together
No, da, da-da-da
Oh, yeah, oh
Come and sing it with
Looking at you, baby
Oh, oh-oh
