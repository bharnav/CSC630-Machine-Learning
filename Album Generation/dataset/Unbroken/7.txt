[Intro]
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

[Verse 1]
It's a hold up
Broke in out of nowhere, showed up
I'm in love
This heist got me skipping a heartbeat
I'm giving up

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna run, run, runaway
In your getaway car, make a gateway

[Chorus]
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up
This is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

[Verse 2]
Hey, stranger
I'm addicted to the danger of your touch
Now you're wanted
Better keep me as your hostage
Tie me up

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna run, run, runaway
In your getaway car, make a gateway

[Chorus]
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up
This is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

[Bridge]
Everybody get down
Get down on the floor, floor
Everybody get down
Nobody gets hurt, hurt

[Chorus]
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up
This is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just don't leave me alone
This is a hold up
This is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

[Outro]
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
