[Intro]
You're just playing with me
Bankrupt emotionally

[Verse 1]
So you sent me cold hearts and dead flowers
Can I send it back?
You splash out on some fancy perfume
In a beautiful, but a rented room
And it takes bitter grapes to make it
Our finest wine
And your far out, far-flung philosophies
Could not be further from my mind

[Chorus]
In actuality
Bankrupt emotionally

[Verse 2]
You promised me you'd fly me to the moon
You are late, I'm still waiting
All of one we need to
But seriously, that drift with me
Get off my cloud
It's reserved for an angel with darker wings
If it's so important to you, Can't you wait
Can't you just give in

[Chorus]
In actuality
You're just playing with me
The facts are there to see
Bankrupt emotionally
In actuality
You're just playing with me
The facts are there to see
Bankrupt emotionally
In actuality
You're just playing with me
The facts are there to see
Bankrupt emotionally

[Outro]
You're just playing with me
Bankrupt emotionally
