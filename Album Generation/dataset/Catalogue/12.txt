[Verse 1]
So goodnight my dear
Hope you're feeling well
Hope you're feeling very clear
In this song and rhyme
Thoughts of changes that
Keep ourselves intact

And yes, it's hard to fake
But I'm faltering
In the steps I'm about to take
I am sure it's true
What is all for me
Is much the same to you

[Chorus]
If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me?
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

[Verse 2]
So we wait and see
How this backward chapter reads
In verse inadvertently
And it feels like fading light
But that's all that's left
Only what's left is right

[Chorus]
If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me?
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

[Bridge]
Jumping from a balloon
Carried aloft by a parachute in June
Twisting round and round
Well I hope the ground is what you find
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la

[Chorus]
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free
