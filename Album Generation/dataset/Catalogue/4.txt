[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta get me some, gotta get me
Instant gratification
Gimme new kicks, won't you show me new tricks
Without the ramifications
Give it a try, don't be shy
Well, you know you might like it
Never been too keen a timekeeper
But I'm a pure new pleasure seeker

All the way from Venus
Invading from Mars
Don't let that come between us
It's written in the stars
Save me from fading afraid
The tears of a fool on parade
Quietly turn into stone
Make me flesh and bone

[Chorus]
Well, come on, oh
You know that you want it now
Well, come on, yeah
You know that you want it and how

[Verse 2]
Stimulation in body and cell
For the good and misguided
Desperation, I'm under your spell
Misunderstood and derided
Speculation, they kiss and they tell
Misjudged and misquoted
Fell into the abyss, I must have wanted this
Another myth exploded

Take a weight off your mind
Trust the voice of experience
I tell you little white lies
Viva indifference
Stoke up the fire
I'm all you require
They won't set you alight
Come and live your desire

[Bridge]
Come make me whole
Body and soul
Come make me whole
Body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul

[Chorus]
Well, come on, oh, oh
You know that you want it now
Well, come on, oh
You know that you want it and how
Come on, yeah
You know that you want it now
Well, come on, yeah
You know that you want it now

[Post-Chorus]
Gimme new kicks, I wanna go deeper
Never been too keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks, you can get me on the beeper
I'm a pure new pleasure seeker
Gimme new kicks, I wanna go deeper
Never been too keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks, you can get me on the beeper
(Give me [?])
I'm a pure new pleasure seeker

[Verse 3]
Would be a crime against passion
Not to itch that itch
Oh, don't ask how it happened
This is it, this is it
All we have ever wanted
All we will ever need
Nothing can take its place
It's written all over your face

[Chorus]
Yeah
You know that you want it now
Come on, oh, oh
You know that you want it and how
Come on, yeah
You know that you want it now
Come on, oh, oh
You know that you want it and how

[Post-Chorus]
Gimme new kicks, I wanna go deeper
Never been too keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks, you can get me on the beeper
I'm a pure new pleasure seeker
([?] what you left behind)

[Outro]
Never been too keen a timekeeper
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul
Come on!
