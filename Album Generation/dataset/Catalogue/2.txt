[Intro]
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la

[Verse 1]
I dreamt that I was dreaming
I was wired to a clock
I tickled by the minute hand
Tick tock, tick tick tock
I dream I'm on a train
And it is making music
I don't remember getting on
Clickity click, clickity click
I dreamt that I was very tall
I was bigger than King Kong
I heard the bells, the bells
Are ringing, a ding dong, a ding dong
I dream that I am sitting
In the devil's company
He gave a solemn promise
Fe fi fo, fun for me

[Verse 2]
I dreamt that I was chasing
The monster out of me
I caught him in the corner
Ha ha, hee hee hee hee
I dream I'm in a tunnel
Between here and now
Scooby Doobie, a-where would you be?
Bow wow wow wow
I dream I'm at a crossroads
No place left to go
I look in each direction
Eenie meanie miny mo
I dream that I am spying
It's you I'm looking at
There's a knocking at the window
A rat tat tat tat, a rat tat tat
I dream I am an ostrich
Head deep in the sand
There is a rhythm that's a-playing
Fantastic elastic band

[Interlude]
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la

[Bridge 1]
I dreamt that the bogeyman went down on Mr. Spock
Sugar was a flowing, sock it to 'em sock
I dreamt I saw a moo cow jump across the moon
Just a flight of fantasy, zoom zoom zoom
I dreamt I met a spaceman, he took me to his ship
You know he cut my hair off, snip snip snip
I dreamt that I was sleeping, asleep for heaven's sake
The dream that I was dreaming, it caused me to awake

[Chorus]
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me

[Bridge 2]
I dreamt I was way up, I was standing on the top
With the feeling I was falling, bop beep bop
I dreamt that I was jumping in a circus through a hoop
Someone shut the lights off, shoo-be-doop
I dreamt that I was fast, I was never shutting up
I was going in a hurry, I was giddy-up giddy-up
I dream I'm in the park, I'm standing in the nudey
I'm getting what I wanted, tutti frutti, tutti frutti

[Chorus]
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me

[Bridge 3]
I dreamt that I was dreaming, I was wired to a clock
Tickled by the minute hand, tock tick tock
I dream I'm on a train and it is making music
Don't remember getting on, clickity click
I dreamt that I was very tall, bigger than King Kong
I heard the bells are ringing, a ring ding dong
I dream I am an ostrich, deep in the sand
Rhythm is a playing, elastic band
Elastic band

[Interlude]
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la

[Outro]
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
