[Intro]
Day for night
Day for night
Day for night
(Day for night)
Day for night
(Into the night I go, day for night)

[Verse 1]
I know what you talk about
In your sleep, wrap yourself around me
Not just a passer by
I'm gonna stay awhile
I like your peep show
Magnetized, I saw you in the window
I've been watching you
Don't know what else to do
Trust me, I'm sensitive
Intensitive, I'll never let you go
No need to be afraid
Release yourself to me, I got that heart-ache

[Pre-Chorus]
Hubble bubble
You know my trouble
I saw you on your own
No need to be alone
Let me levitate
Relax, resonate
Turn off the lights

[Chorus]
(Day for night)
Day for night
(Day for night)
Day for night
(Day for night)
(Into the night I go, day for night)

[Verse 2]
I saw your eyes on fire
The desire won't release you
I go where you go to
I have to follow you
So put your honey where your mouth is
Look behind you
Relax and let me hypnotize
I'd like to touch, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the shadows
I've had my fill of it
Too close to the light
Just for the thrill of it
Hubble bubble
You know my trouble
Turn out the lights

[Chorus]
(Day for night)
Day for night
(Day for night)
Day for night
(Day for night)
Day for night
Day for night
(Day for night)
(Day for night)
(Day for night)
