[Verse 1]
When you are ready
I will surrender
Take me and do as you wish
Have what you want
Your way's always the best way
I have succumbed to
This passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie
Your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

[Verse 2]
Can I control
This empty delusion
Lost in the fire below?
And you come running
Your eyes will be open
And when you come back
I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will
Keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

[Chorus]
Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me

[Verse 3]
Now you can't help it
If you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless
Don't care what the truth is
You will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me?
Don't try to come near me
So tired, I sleep through the light
If you desire to
Lay here beside me
Come to my sweet melody

[Outro]
Sing it back to me (Sing it back)
Bring it back (Sing it)
Sing it back (Sing it)
Bring it back (Sing it)
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
(Sing it) Bring it back
(Sing it) Sing it back
(Sing it) Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it
Sing it
Sing it
Sing it back to me
Sing it
Sing it
Sing it
Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me
Sing it
Sing it
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
(Sing it) Bring it back
(Sing it) Sing it back
(Sing it) Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
(Sing it) Bring it back
(Sing it) Sing it back
(Sing it) Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
(Sing it) Bring it back
(Sing it) Sing it back
(Sing it) Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me (Sing it back to me)
