[Verse 1]
Don't put yourself down, don't be hard on yourself
You didn't do wrong baby, don't blame yourself
I know how you feel I've been there myself
It's what the devil may fare what do you care
Can you control yourself?

I won't stick around to watch you get colder
I know I couldn't be told, don't suppose, now I'm a little older
The fault was all mine, I don't blame you if you blame me
I know I was wrong, I just cannot contain this

[Chorus]
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this

[Chorus]
And if it's a crime then can you explain to me
Where do I belong? I just cannot contain this

[Bridge]
Can-Not Con-Tain This
Just Can-Not Con-Tain-This
I just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this

[Chorus]
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this

[Outro]
Just cannot contain this
