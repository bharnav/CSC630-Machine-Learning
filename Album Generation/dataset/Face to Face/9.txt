Hey, girl, it's all over town
So how come I'm the last to find out
That you're leaving, with some other guy
Help me understand, why oh why?
Tell me, what he does for you
Is there something that I didn't do?
All those late nights, I left you alone
I was working on our happy home
And then I come to find out
That you're about to walk out
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time
I know he said he loves you more than I, that's a lie
Let me change your mind, ooh oh
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake
Stop before you turn and walk away, give me time
Let me change your mind, oh
I know, if you ever leave
Baby someday, you'll look back and see
That it's right here, that you should've been
But you can't run back to me
And don't make me look for someone new
When all I wanted is you
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time
I know he said he loves you more than I, that's a lie
Let me change your mind, ooh oh
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake
Stop before you turn and walk away, give me time
Let me change your mind, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't make me look for someone new
When all I wanted is you
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time
I know he said he loves you more than I, that's a lie
Let me change your mind, ooh oh
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake
Stop before you turn and walk away, give me time
Let me change your mind, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
