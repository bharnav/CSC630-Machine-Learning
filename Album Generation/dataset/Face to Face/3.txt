Took some time to heal
To get my heartbeat back
Just when I'm ahead returning from the dead
She's back again
She knows just what to say
She always gets her way
Just when I was free she's back inside of me
She's back again
So tell me why the hell I hear the music
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby, ohh just when I moved on believed that she was gone
She's back again, she's back
She's back again, she's back
Like predator and prey
She'll tear my heart away
She'll chew me to the bone, leave me rotting here alone
'Til she's back again
So tell me why the hell I hear the music
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby, ohh just when I moved on believed that she was gone
She's back again, she's back
She's back, she's back
She's back, she's back
She's back, she's back
So tell me why the hell I hear music
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby, ohh just when I moved on believed that she was gone
She's back, oh yeah
Every time she calls I hear music
Is it just the way she loves to confuse me
Oh baby, ohh just when I moved on, believed that she was gone
She's back again, she's back
She's back, she's back
She's back, she's back
She's back, she's back, she's back
