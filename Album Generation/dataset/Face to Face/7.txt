Girl I love to watch you
You're like candy to my eyes
Like a movie that you've seen
But you gotta watch just one more time
But that smile you're wearin'
It's a beautiful disguise
It's just somethin' you put on to
Hide the emptiness inside
And you seem so lonely
But you don't have to anymore
If you're a heart without a home
Rebel without a cause
If you feel as though
You're always stranded on the shore
Like a thief in the night
Let me steal your heart away
Baby if for reasons, what you're lookin' for
I'll be yours, I'll be yours
You need a new sensation
One you never had before
I got a feelin' if I gave you some
You'd probably want some more
Did you know that Baby?
You're the bluebird in my sky
I only wanna make you happy 'cause
I love to see you fly
And if you feel lonely
You don't have to anymore
If you're a heart without a home
Rebel without a cause
If you feel as though
You're always stranded on the shore
Like a thief in the night
Let me steal your heart away
Baby if for reasons, what you're lookin' for
I'll be yours, I'll be yours
I'll be yours, I'll be the raft in the tide
I'll be yours, I'll be the truth in the lie
And what's more when no one opens the door
I'll be the hope that you're lookin' for
If you're a heart without a home
Rebel without a cause
If you feel as though
You're always stranded on the shore
Like a thief in the night
Let me steal your heart away
Baby if for reasons
What you're lookin' for
If you're a heart without a home
Rebel without a cause
If you feel as though
You're always stranded on the shore
Like a thief in the night
Let me steal your heart away
Baby if for reasons, what you're lookin' for
I'll be yours, I'll be yours
