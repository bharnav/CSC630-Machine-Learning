[Verse 1]
When I am down and oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit a while with me

[Chorus]
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be

[Chorus 2: Westlife & Choir]
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains (stand on mountains)
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas (stormy seas)
I am strong (I am strong), when I am on your shoulders (I am strong)
You raise me up, to more than I can be
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains (stand on mountains)
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas (stormy seas)
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be
You raise me up, to more than I can be

[Outro (fade)]
You raise me up... To more than I can be
