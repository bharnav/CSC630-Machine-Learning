Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
So put a little bit of love in my life today
Everybody needs some shelter
Spend a little time together
Come into my arms, let them tell you what I want to say
Colour my world, draw on my heart
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you've ever heard to colour my world
I've had enough of not believing
Living life without a meaning
I want something real and I feel it when I'm next to you
Let's build a house full of love and devotion
A window to my heart's emotion
Until the very end it's the place I'm gonna keep you in
Baby please just
Colour my world, draw on my heart
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you've ever heard to colour my world
Let's make a world for you and me, yeah
That we're never gonna leave
Won't you do it, won't you colour my world?
Colour my world, draw on my heart
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you've ever heard to colour my world
I said
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination
Use every word you've ever heard to colour my world
Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
So colour my world
