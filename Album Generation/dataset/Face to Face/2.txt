In your eyes, I found the greatest prize
You and I could not be closer
And in your arms is everything I want
Now, I know my search is over
And I don't know where you take me
But it's exactly where I wanna be
It's where the stars line up
It's where the oceans touch
It's in a place you've never been
That feels like home
It's in the air right now
It's when you give your all and give a little more
I've never been so sure
That's where you find love
People pass and listen to us laugh
Wishing that they had the same thing
And our friends they ask, how we made it last
I just smile and say the same thing
I'm not sure how we got here
Baby, I'm just glad that we got here
It's where the stars line up
It's where the oceans touch
It's in a place you've never been
That feels like home
It's in the air right now
It's where you give your all
And give a little more, I've never been so sure
That's where you find love
That's where you find love
It's where the stars line up
It's where the oceans touch
It's in a place you've never been
That feels like home
It's in the air right now
It's where you give your all
And give a little more, I've never been this sure
That's where you find love
Find love, that's where you find love
