You’re the fighter
You’ve got the fire
The spirit of a warrior
The champion’s heart
You fight for your life
Because the fighter never quits
You make the most of the hand you’re dealt
Because the quitter never wins
No!

You were born to box in a city that’s seen their share
Mello, Ryan, Carney
Among them your photo proudly hangs there
Above the bar in the Gaelic Club
They tell the story of a throwback
With the heart of a lion
They salute your glory

It’s another murderous night
Another left hook from hell
A bloody war on the boardwalk
And the kid from Lowell rises to the bell

[Chorus]
Micky!
It’s a warrior’s code
Micky!
He’s got the warrior’s soul

[Chorus]
Micky!
It’s a warrior’s code
Micky!
He’s got the warrior’s soul
