I'll have
A Blue Christmas
Without you
I'll be so blue
Thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same
If you're not here with me

And when those
Blue snowflakes start fallin'
And when those
Blue melodies start callin'
You'll be doin' all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same
If you're not here with me
I'll have a Blue Christmas
That's certain
And when that blue heartache
Starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue
Blue Christmas
