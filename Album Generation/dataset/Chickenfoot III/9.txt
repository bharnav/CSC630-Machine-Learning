Summer gonna bring big fire
Summer gonna bring big fire
Water gonna bring big rain
Water gonna bring big rain

Oh, I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' on
I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' wrong
Something's goin' wrong

Something's in the air
My baby can't breathe the air
Ground gonna tremble and shake
Kobe gonna bring big quake

Oh, I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' on
I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' wrong

I'm gonna buy myself an ark
A big, old, seven, seven, seven
And with wind and solar power
I'm gonna fly my way to heaven

Somebody got a-left behind
Who will be the next in line?

Oh, I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' on
I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' wrong

I, I got a feelin', yeah
Something's goin' on
Oh, I, I got a feelin'
Something's goin' wrong
Something's goin' wrong

(I got a feelin')
(I got a feelin')
(I got a feelin')
(I got a feelin')
