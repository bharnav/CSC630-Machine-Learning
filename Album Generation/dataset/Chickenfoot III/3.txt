When I arrive at the Pearly Gates
Gonna have my swimsuit on
My flip flops and a pair of shades
And ask the choir if I can sing along
Yeah, wooh, yeah, yeah

I’ll bow down and kiss the ring
I’ll show respect, the best I can
I’ll be myself, gotta show the man
Just exactly who I am
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m in the sun, I might be the one
Maybe I’m, oh no, in the front of the line
Up next
Who’s next?

Well, when I arrive at the Pearly Gates
Gonna sing at the top of my lungs
Everything I ever did
It will be heard, it will be sung
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m in the sun, I might be the one
Maybe I’m, oh no, in the front of the line
Up next

When I arrive at the Pearly Gates
Gonna have my best foot on
A big ol’ smile on my face
I’ll check no bags, I got no carry-on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m in the sun, I might be the one
Maybe I’m, oh no, in the front of the line
I’m in the sun, I might be the one
Maybe I’m, oh no, in the front of the line

Up next, wooh
Who’s next?
C’mon, up next, step right up
Who’s next? Yeah
