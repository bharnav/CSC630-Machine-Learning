There's a wise old tale
'Bout the same old Hell
Only the devil is changed
With two brand new lovers
Rolling in the covers
Everybody wants some strange

We all know somebody
Gonna tell you just what to do
But it don't mean nothin'
'Less it's got something for me and you

Walk away
If you think there's someone better, yeah
Run away
To the arms of something new

You can stay
If you think he'll treat you better than I do
Turn around, babe
I'll be right there waiting for you

Yeah, we're both getting older
We should've known better
Some things stay the same
Yeah, but you want your freedom
And I'm so jealous
No one's gonna change

We all know somebody
Gonna tell you what's right to do
Hey, I'm sitting here listenin'
Baby, I'm missing you

Walk away
If you think there's someone better, yeah
Run away
To the arms of something new

You can stay
If you think he'll treat you better than I do
Turn around, babe
I'll be right here waiting for you

There's a sweet dark angel on my shoulder
Singing in my ear
From the backside of Heaven with all her glory
Salvation's here

And we all know somebody's
Gonna tell you just what to do
But it don't mean nothin'
'Less it means something for me and you, babe

Walk away
If you think there's someone better, yeah
Run away
To the arms of something new

You can stay
If you think he'll treat you better than I do
Turn around, baby
I'll be right here waiting for you

I'm right here waiting for you
Come on, turn around babe
I'm right here waiting for you
Oh yeah, come on girl
I'm right here waiting for you
Turn around, girl
