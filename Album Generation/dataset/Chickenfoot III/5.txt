Sidewalk blind, an old tin cup
Looking down I can't look up
Long gone ain't coming back

It's later than I want it to be
And long, cold nights without much sleep
Miss you baby
Come closer

You gotta run downtown
Gotta jump online
Got something goin' all the time
Where you goin', baby?

Kids bringin' in problems
We got problems of our own
I'm worried, babe
'Bout going the distance

Just come closer
Come closer to me
Come closer
Baby, come closer to me

A guitar, a song and a sleeping bag
The moon, the stars, that's all we had
I sure miss that, babe

You got your space, I got mine
Got nothing to say most all the time
Feel you slippin' away

Come closer
Now come closer to me
Baby, come closer
I need you (come closer)

Oh, all my life I wanted someone like you
To stand by me
Oh baby, I want you to come closer
Yeah

Everyday I wake up, I tell myself
I need you by my side
So badly
Now come closer

Oh, when I think about you leavin'
Oh, I fall down on my knees, baby, and beg you
I beg you
To come closer, yeah

Come closer
I want you
Come closer to me

Come closer
Come closer
Baby, come closer to me
(Come closer)

Stand by me (come closer) baby
(Come closer) Right there by my side
(Come closer) Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
(Come closer) I need you, I want you
To come closer
