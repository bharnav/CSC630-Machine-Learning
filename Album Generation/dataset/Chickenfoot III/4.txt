Why you workin' so hard, baby
You could be makin' it easy
You know it pisses me of sometimes
When you, you start acting sleazy

I'm under so much pressure
You know there's not much blowin' up
Feelin' under the gun sometimes
Makes me feel like throwin' up, wooh

I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You say, lighten up, uh

Well, don't ask me no questions
And I will tell you no lies
We've been down that road before
And it's me, not that other guy

And I never wanted to hurt you
I didn't mean to make you cry, yeah
You always get what you want from me, don't you
With a tear drop in your eye

I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You got to lighten up

You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' on me
You're pushin' too hard, baby
Lighten up

I like it when you want it
Especially when you take it
When you really, really need it
That's why I know you're not faking it, wooh

Hey, gonna call in a doctor
Maybe get you on some pills
But then I started to worry about you, baby
Could be the pill that kills

I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You got to lighten up

Oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
Lighten up

I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard

Oh baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Lighten up, yeah

Oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
Oh baby
Baby, lighten up

Pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard, oh you got me

I say, oh baby
Pushin' too hard
Oh baby, come on

Pushin' too hard
Baby, lighten up
Oh baby
