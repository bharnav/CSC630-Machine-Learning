Hey, alright

Wake up in the morning, in the middle of the night
Pass by the mirror, make sure I'm lookin' right, uh
Tattoo it on my arm, on the back of your neck
In between your legs baby, so you won't forget me, uh

Don't you worry, it's gonna be alright
I'm in a hurry, I'm gonna drive all night
Be there in the morning, you can bet your ass
I got both hands on the wheel and my big foot on the gas

Ha
Wooh

Well, got Houses Of The Holy on the box
I got it all cranked up 'cause, yeah that shit rocks, huh
Gottta roll down the window, things are getting all hot
I'm runnin' out of gas, baby, I gottta stop, well

Don't you worry, it's gonna be alright
I'm in a hurry, I'm gonna drive all night, yeah
Be there in the morning, you can bet your ass
I got both hands on the wheel and my big foot on the gas, yeah

Don't you worry, baby
I got my big foot on the gas
Uh huh
Wow, huh, c'mon baby

Well, got my imagination runnin' wild
Things I been thinkin' 'bout, ooh child
I'm all by myself, ha, crackin' up
Better get some rest girl, I'm all pumped up

Don't you worry, I'm gonna be alright
Baby I'm in a hurry, I'm gonna drive all night, yeah
Be there in the morning and you can bet your ass
I got both hands on the wheel and my big foot on the gas, yeah

Right there, uh huh
I got my big foot on the gas
Are you ready baby?
My big foot on the gas

Yeah, oh
Baby, yeah
