Freak
There's a hole in me that's ten feet wide
There's a window come and look inside
Tell me everything you see
Because some very strange things have been happening to me
To he rhythm of the rain I'm exploring the pain
I slip and slide my own way through
Now I feel like I'm having a ball
But I've got a head full of nothing at all
I'm a ... Freak
The people come and people say
Another day just thrown away
Freak
You listen up to what's been said
Shake those dreams from your sleep head
Freak
It's getting harder to be me
I feel like I'm a refugee
Freak
You're looking for someone to blame
That freak of nature's here again

I'm thrilled to discover there is a lot to forget
I've done so many things I'll never regret
The time has come to hesitate
I've got to make a move so I think I'll wait
I know I'm not stupid but I just can't see
Why everybody thinks there's something wrong with me
There's nothing in this world can alter my direction
I need to be a freak for my own protection

Freak
The people come and people say
Another day just thrown away
Freak
You listen up to what's been said
Shake those dreams from your sleep head
Freak
It's getting harder to be me
I feel like I'm a refugee
Freak
You're looking for someone to blame
That freak of nature's here again

Listen now and listen to me
This is more or less the way it will be
You're an X and I'm a Y
Just take a look up to the sky...
Around this planet shining bright
I'm just a lonely satellite
I'm as far away as far can be
I'm scared of the 21st century

Freak

The people come and people say
Another day just thrown away
Freak
You listen up to what's been said
Shake those dreams from your sleep head
Freak
It's getting harder to be me
I feel like I'm a refugee
Freak
You're looking for someone to blame
That freak of nature's here again
