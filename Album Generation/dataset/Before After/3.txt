It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(ooooooh)
(repeat paragraph)

I know for sometime
One day I would see you
(? ) what you say
Did I get it right
Is it you and me tonight ?
And you looked at me
And I knew we'd be together
(be together)
You feel it too
What can we do
(feel, what can you do)
Come on, move up to me
I wanna whisper in your ear now
(do you want me)
When I get you home
We're gonna be alone
Disconnect the phone
When we wake up
You know the room is full of sunshine
We close our eyes and make a wish

It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(listen to what I say)
(ooooooh)
It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(it's true)
(ooooooh)

Hey ! you call me back
'cause I'm not there when you want me
(do you want me)
The job on the phone
Every night and day

I've got to get away
And on that we kiss
But I never said I loved you
(I love you)
Let's take it slow
You've got to, got to let it go

It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(ooooooh)
(repeat paragraph)

(want you back, I need you back)
(ooooooh)
(repeat paragraph 5 times)

(want you back)
(I know I do)
(I need you back)
(I feel you do)
(want you back)
(I see you do)
(I need you back)
(I know you do)
(repeat paragraph)

What do you see
When you're looking straight at me
When I look at you
I tell you what I see
You don't belong to me
Sometimes it's true
You're gonna leave it when it's over
(it's over)
I close my eyes and make a wish

It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(ooooooh)
(repeat paragraph 5 times until fade)
