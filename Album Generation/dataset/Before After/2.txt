I wish I'd never heard the news
(Never had a good day)
Baby wants a pair of shoes
(How'm I gonna repay?)
A thousand fingers touch my heart

I need so much
Blue Force is tearing me apart

No time for might have been
You're on the winning team
No time to choose
It's time to light the fuse

I know there's nothing I can do
(Don't let it freeze you)
The age of miracles is through
(They're never gonna please you)

The iceman's back, he treats the crowds

And ice is free
Blue force is pouring from the clouds

Tonight could be the night
We'll walk into the cool light
Though I'll not see you again

Light the fuse now!

They say the best's too good for you
Your head's on fire)
That golden letdown can't be true
(Push push a little higher)
But when they say that we can't win

And you agree
Blue force will never fight for sin

I heard a voice tonight

Calling by satellite
'Thousands are right
And some will light the fuse"

No time for might have been
You're on the winning team

No time to choose
It's time to light the fuse

I heard a voice tonight

Calling by satellite
'Thousands are right
And some will light the fuse"

No time for might have been
You're on the winning team

No time to choose
It's time to light the fuse
