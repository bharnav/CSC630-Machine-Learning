Tell me
Should I be surprised
By the thought of something new
Slowly
As I realise
Start a fire in my mind
Through earthly desire
To find a better place
Trying to find a way
To heaven and higher
A long way from my world
No tears of emotion for my own devotion

Just like an illusion
It seems so real
This is how I'm going to feel
Maybe forever
I'm stronger
This time
Than I've been before
Tomorrow...Maybe forever

The power of suggestion
Deceiver and deceived
My senses slide away
It's such a distraction
I wish I had no memory
Waiting for someone just like you to find me

Just like an illusion
It seems so real
This is how I'm going to feel
Maybe forever
I'm stronger
This time
Than I've been before
Tomorrow...Maybe forever

The sea of change
Pulls me in
Almost naked
Perfect
Angel
Your voice
Saves me
Dislocate your mind

I'm waiting for someone just like you to find me

Just like an illusion
It seems so real
This is how I'm going to feel
Maybe forever
I'm stronger
This time
Than I've been before
Tomorrow...Maybe forever

In silence
In darkness
Together now at least until
Tomorrow...Maybe forever
The distance between us
Will fade away
People come and stay
Sometimes forever and ever

Maybe forever
Forever and ever and ever ...
