Look left, here she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with other guys way outta my class
That can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
Boy that girl's fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Looky there, across the street
There's a car named just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas

A brand new convertible is outta my class
That can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
Boy that car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Lookout, wait and see
Work hard and savin' dough
I'll get the girl that I've been wantin' so
We'll get that girl, we go ridin' around
Look real cute with the white top down
So keep right on a dreamin', thinkin' to myself
When it all comes true man
That's somethin' else
