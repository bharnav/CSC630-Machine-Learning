Don't talk crazy now, take it easy
Ya’ just can't hold out forever
Don't you lie to me, you say me you love
Don’t say you don't remember
'Cause you told me
Yeah, you did
And I'm not gonna let you forget
Well, I'm down on my knees
And I'm beggin' again
You tell me why did you have to pretend?
I know you want me, why don't you give in?

Surrender

Don’t let me down
I just can’t hang around
Feeling this way forever
On your balcony
You made love to me
Don't say you don’t remember
'Cause you told me
Yeah, you did
And I'm not gonna let you forget
Well, I'm down on my knees
And I’m begging again
You tell me why did you have to pretend
I don't like the way you're looking at him

Surrender
Surrender to me
Baby, surrender, surrender
(x2)
