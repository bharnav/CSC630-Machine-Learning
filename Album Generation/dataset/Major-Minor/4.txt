[verse]
A coin tossed into the air will come down
It will come down somewhere

Your life is a coin in the air
It will come down, it will come down somewhere

Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it out

[verse]
A coin in the air, it will come down
It will come down somewhere

Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it... in the air

[Chorus]
You have to choose
And what you stand to lose, you've been putting up all of your life
Call it in my hand
Only one way to see what the outcome will be
Call it out before we lose the light

[verse]
No more stalling, no delay
You must call it out by light of day

Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it... in the air

[Chorus]
You have to choose
And what you stand to lose, you've been putting up all of your life
Call it in my hand
Only one way to see what the outcome will be
Call it out before we lose the light

[bridge]
So heads or tails?
There's nothing for it
So put an end to your sidestepping
Is it heads or tails?
You can't ignore it
You stand to win or lose everything

Heads or tails?
There's nothing for it
So put an end to your sidestepping
Heads or tails?
You can't ignore it
You stand to win or lose everything
