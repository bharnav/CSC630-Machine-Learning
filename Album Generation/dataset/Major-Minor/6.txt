[verse]
The shutter opens but never closes
I am lost, waylaid, in light trails
Endless moments, overlaid and burned across
A melee of scattered braille

[pre-Chorus]
This image is a night-terror transforming
Without the hope of morning
My nemesis, I feel it coming for me, and it means to destroy me

[Chorus]
Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on, black and white blur into one

[verse]
Hieroglyphic, indecipherable, opaque; the meaning escapes me
Dry and lidless are my eyes
Asleep, awake - reading the slurred debris

[pre-Chorus]
This image is a night-terror transforming
Without the hope of morning
My nemesis, I feel it coming for me, and it means to destroy me

[Chorus]
Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on, black and white blur into...

Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on, black and white blur into one
