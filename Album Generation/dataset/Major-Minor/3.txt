[verse]
Cut these thorns and kick these stones, and keep those birds at bay
Plant deep and dark, and help my heart receive the words you say
The words you say, receive the words you say...

See, the words you say are somehow lost on me, they die on deafened ears;
When you open up your mouth to speak, I hear but I can't hear...

The words you say, hear the words you say, hear the words you say
Can't hear the words you say, hear the words you say

[bridge]
Pin me down, and take away this heart of stone
Wind and sound, awake my old dry bones

[verse]
Cut these thorns and kick these stones, and keep those birds at bay
Plant deep and dark, and help my heart perceive the light of day
I stumble through a darkened vale, with a veil cast over me
And cataracts, all is black. Oh, I see but I can't see...

The light of day, see the light of day, see the light of day
Can't see the light of day, see the light of day

[bridge 2]
I'll fight or run to keep from going under the knife;
Don't let me slip away
Cause though the blade is sharp, I know you're saving my life;
Don't let me slip away

[bridge]
Pin me down, and take away this heart of stone
Wind and sound, awake my old dry bones
