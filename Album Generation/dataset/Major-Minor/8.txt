[Verse 1]
See these ragged shoes?
The soles have worn straight through
While I've proclaimed
The king who sang the blues
If you've got better news
Then make it plain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He laid aside his crown
All our crimes he carried
Was lifted from the ground
And with our burdens buried

[Chorus]
Listen to me, though I speak of sober things
Listen through me, though a man of lips unclean
I speak truly what you only think you've heard
Everything hangs on a word

[Verse 2]
Sparing no expense
He made recompense
For all the earth
This story's an offense
So get down from that fence
And bless or curse

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He laid aside his crown
All our crimes he carried
Was lifted from the ground
And with our burdens buried
When shadows all had clung
And the light diminished
He emptied out his lungs
Crying "It is finished!"

[Chorus]
Listen to me, though I speak of sober things
Listen through me, though a man of lips unclean
I speak truly what you only think you've heard
Everything hangs on a word
