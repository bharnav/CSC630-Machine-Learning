[verse]
We were sons of insurrection
Doomed to face the dark alone
Till vicarious perfection
Dearly won, was made our own

[Chorus]
So where's your landslide, where's your victory?
Tell me now, where's your sting?

[verse]
Unassailable you waited, the great enemy of man
Till your awful jaws were sated
And we were ransomed from your hand

[Chorus]
So where's your landslide, where's your victory?
Tell me now, where's your sting?

[tag]
Now that you have been disarmed
We will cross over unharmed
