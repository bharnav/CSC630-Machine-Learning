[Verse 1]
I was always one of the righteous, never lived outside of the lines
Kept a close watch on the whitewash, disguising the dead bones inside

[Verse 2]
I was always one of the good ones, keeping tabs on everyone else; sure that I was -
One of the chosen, but I was a child of hell

[Pre-Chorus]
But you buried me in the bright light. Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun 'til I could see -

[Chorus]
That I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow, I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
Because of you

[Verse 3]
I was always one of the blameless, or at least that's what I believed
I never thought I could have been blinded, until I could no longer see

[Pre-Chorus]
But you buried me in the bright light. Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun 'til I could see -

[Chorus]
That I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow, I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
You had shown me -
I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow, I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
Because of you
