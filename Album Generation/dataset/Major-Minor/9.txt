[Verse 1]
Our life's built of tin cans and string
But the cornerstone laid is a wondrous and beautiful thing
Sure in the ground
And while the north wind has taken its toll
You have helped me to find my way back and to anchor my soul
Safe in the sound

[Chorus]
O, you know me
O, and I know you
And I know that we can see this through

[Verse 2]
I bragged of baring my bones
Said if we heard the howling I'd run out to face it alone
To meet it halfway
But I've still got badges to earn
So keep sifting my soul cause I think that I'm starting to learn
To love you that way

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And it's true that you could snap my neck
But I trust you'll save my life instead

[Verse 3]
Cause our love is a loyalty sworn
If we hold to our hope then I know we can weather the storm
Whatever they say
Come what may

[Chorus]
