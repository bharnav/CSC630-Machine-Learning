My monitor is frozen
In late-for-something sun
That cuts through icy patterns
Another day's begun

Recalling all my losses
While trying to ignore
The theme that keeps repeating
From Call of Duty 4

I tap-tap off the volume
And stare out at the road
Where cars and snowplows scroll by
A broken line of code

From some embedded program
That executes our town
The river and the Co-Op
This house that's falling down

So tape over my window
With dark green garbage bags
Enclose my name in brackets
Make HTML tags

To start and end forever
Above the wheezy breath
Of cooling fans and hard drives
Beyond the screens of death
