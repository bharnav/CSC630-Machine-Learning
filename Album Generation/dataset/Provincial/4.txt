Oh, the streets of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas fill with smoke
Doorbell rings
I put my controller down and pick it up
Shoot some things

Later, the darkness hits reboot and the loneliness increases
She said she'd come back home when I write my master's thesis

Oh, the hours I spent in the archives wearing cotton gloves
Shuffling photos from the Ninette Sanatorium Halloween parties
Emaciated ghosts hiding in those curtains' creases
I'll let you haunt the world when I write my master's thesis

No more marking first-year papers
No more citing sources

So I left home, cried the bumpy ride to Highway 23
Started west
They'll be there to say that I don't need to take their stupid test

Greet me with banners and balloons and my hard drive smashed to pieces
Nothing left for me to save when I write my master's thesis
It's all gonna change when I write my master's thesis
