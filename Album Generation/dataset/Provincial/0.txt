Oh, wait for me, I fell behind three signs for services ago
And some sarcastic satellite says I'm not anywhere
Spent every cent of your goodwill on fossil fuels and magazines
So let this field of flax forclose on everything I own
And scratch Saskatchewan away
Make Manitoba paper dolls
Lift up a line from Highway 1
To tie Ontario
Oh, wait for me
