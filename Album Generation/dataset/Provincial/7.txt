(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas Reggie Leach was born and played
Minor hockey back in my hometown
The Rifle fired his first 500 here
And slapped his way into the NHL

(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas some of us weren't always fair
To the Native kid on borrowed skates
Chippy Goolies and Ukranians
In the corners with our elbows up

(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas Reggie on a playoff run
Could make a deck or buy the new TV
Put his youngest by the window, place
The split antenna in her tiny hands

(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas photos from the old Tribune
Of Reggie smiling with the Stanley Cup
Curled their corners, dropped off bedroom walls
Left a square of where they used to be

We, the undersigned, put forth his name
To the Hockey Hall of Fame
We, the undersigned, put forth his name
To the Hockey Hall of Fame
Therefore, we, the undersigned put forth his name
To the Hockey Hall of Fame
