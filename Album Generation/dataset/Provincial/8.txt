So I'm the first one in again
With the quiet and the window growing snow
When I hear the furnace rouse itself
From its slumber, somehow suddenly I know
As my eye stops on one curled up in my lesson plan
That I'm just your little ampersand
When your voice springs from the intercom
With announcements and reminders and prayer
I remember how you made me feel
I was funny, I was thoughtful, I was rare
But like the jokes about my figure
Kids think I don't understand
I know I'm just your little ampersand
After Christmas holiday you never asked to drive me home again
Sometimes in the staff room I'd catch your eye with "why'd it have to end"
But I know from how you worry at your wedding band
That I'm just your little ampersand
The last conjunction after every other and
I was just your little ampersand
