Too far to walk to anywhere from here
Too far to walk to anywhere from here
Too far to walk to anywhere from here
Too far to walk to anywhere from here

And it didn't take long for the words to slow
Roll over the gravel shoulder
Thump into the ditch
Engine cut, battery dying
The station metastasizing
Tumours of evangelists and ads for vinyl siding
The city, some cheap EQ with the mids pushed up
In the one long note of wheat

Too far to walk to anywhere from here
Too far to walk to anywhere from here
Too far
