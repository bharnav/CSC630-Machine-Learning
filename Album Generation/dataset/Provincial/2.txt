I know it's annoying borrowing your brother's car
But mine won't start and it's Sunday
Soon a line of headlights peering down the avenue
Could find you there in a lawn chair
Next to our old El Camino with the racing stripes
On cruise night, on cruise night, on cruise night

Dude just make it happen, I can't take another week
Of feeling lame with the same old same old
Kick-can on my ten-speed, circling the Dairy Queen
While jacked-up rides idle at me
I wanna rock the RPM between the reds and greens
On cruise night, on cruise night, on cruise night

Drive awhile in one direction and we'll turn around
On cruise night
