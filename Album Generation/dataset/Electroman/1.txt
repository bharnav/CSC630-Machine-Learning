You've been to every spot in this town
And there's no other place you rather be!

Turn up the lights, to show me
Lit up like a star
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!

So come on, dance!
You, you ride it, it's a party
So come on, dance!
After midnight, we're excited!
So, come on!
Get your drinks down, spend your money
Put your hands all over somebody!
So find the highest point
And don't you ever come on down
You're where everybody wants to be
They all wanna go!

Turn up the lights, to show me
Lit up like a star
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!

Feel the moment, everything it's worth
You're the last surviving star on Earth
So swell up the rhythm, feel the pulse beating inside of you
So everyone in here feel free
What do you have to lose?

Turn up the lights, to show me
Lit up like a star
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!
There's no other place you rather be!

Turn up the lights, to show me
Lit up like a star
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world

Turn up the lights, to show me
Lit up like a star
Shining all over the world!
Turn up the lights to feel me
Where you wanna be, standing at the edge of the world
