Have me set me free
You don't know what you're doing to me
Why can't you see it?
I'm not hiding anything
It's written all over me

I been waiting patiently
This isn't how I want it to be
So why you acting like a player
I don't like games
It's time that you get closer to me

'Cause we got to show pain the door
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone

True love can't take the heat
I'm dying for our eyes to meet
I wanna lay down like a page in your diary
So you can lay your feelings on me

We got to show pain the door
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone

Want all of the bad things to stay outside
The dance floor is only for the good times
All of my demons can leave this club alone

When music is magic I disappear
Memories vanish like you were never here
The devils and demons can leave this club alone

'Cause we got to show pain the door
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone

You could be my wavelength
My frequency
Don't you want to tune it with me?
Our bodies have a future a destiny
All you got to do is believe

'Cause we got to show pain the door
And I never leave this love alone
And I never leave this club alone
And I never leave this club alone
