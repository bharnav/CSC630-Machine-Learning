[Verse 1: Richard Judge]
Tell me when you feel like you know what I'm thinking
Your eyes are blinking
Mine are shrinking
Tell me when you feel like you know what you're drinking
No [?], with getting straight to the point of no return
We're all intoxicated
I'm captivated, so sedated
Tell me when you feel like you [?]
It's so beneath ya
God insists for it

[Chorus: Richard Judge]
Over and over and over and over again
You'll go over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
We'll go over and over and over and over again
Than stay inside of this hole
Than stay inside of this hole

[Verse 2: Richard Judge]
Tell me when you feel like you know what I'm saying
My eyes are caving
So elated
Tell me when you want me to go down and naked
So words don't wait
I am getting straight to the point of no return
We're all intoxicated
I'm captivated
You're amazing
So tell me when when you [?]
It's so beneath ya
God insists for it

[Bridge: Richard Judge]
I'm scared of getting wasted
Tear my heart in pieces
Burn my soul, get crazy
I'm so captivated

[Chorus: Richard Judge]
Over and over and over and over again
You'll go over and over and over and over again
Than stay inside of this hole
Than stay inside of this hole
