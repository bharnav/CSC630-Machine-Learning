[Verse 1]
I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favourite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's coming
Forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop running
To me cause I'll always be waiting

[Hook]
You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema

[Verse 2]
Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing
Forever my wonderful
Hope you start undressing
All my dreams and take me under

[Hook]
You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema

[Bridge]
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know, never know, never know

[Hook]
You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
Action thriller
I could watch you forever
You are my cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema
