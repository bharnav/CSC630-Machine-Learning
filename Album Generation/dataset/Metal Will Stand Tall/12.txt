My heart is screaming out your name

Night falls, my mind recalls the sound of your heart breathing
Thoughts of your thousand kisses burning on my skin

I feel your desire as the moonlight lingers in the sky
I'm walking trough fire, can't you hear me when I cry

Chorus
One night of passion, one night of hunger
And my attraction is getting stronger
I need to feel you, I need to hold you
I can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name

My heart is screaming out your name

Tonight I won't be alone, doesn't mean that I'm not lonely
One minute is like an hour until you calm my pain

I feel your desire as the moonlight lingers in the sky
I walking trough fire, can't you hear me when I cry

Chorus

My heart is screaming out your name

Every time you're not around
You're a thought within my mind
Hold me near, never fear
I'm right beside

Chorus

Chorus
