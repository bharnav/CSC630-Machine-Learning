Aaaaaaaahhhh....

Hiding in the winds
Watching every move she makes
A champion in the ring
Then she starts to sing
Chills and goosebumps neckhair standing
While she bents that string
And she steps into the light
So possesive

Not an ordinary girl
Almost shining like a pearl
She's a rockstar
She's the ordinary girl
Like an outcast of this world
She's a rockstar

Hi it's me again
I´m the one who wrote you, signed:
"Your one true only fan"
You remember, I can tell
I heard that you've been missing me
Just like a long lost friend
When you look into my eyes
You posses me

Not an ordinary girl
Almost shining like a pearl
She's a rockstar
We're the outcasts of this world
Just like kindred me and her
She´s my rockstar

Yes I've been away
On vacation you might say
Didn´t feel too good about myself
But your music make me stick it through

Not an ordinary girl (not an ordinary girl)
Almost shining like a pearl (almost shining like a pearl)
She's a rockstar
We're the outcasts of this world (ooooohhhhh)
Just like kindred me and her
Oh, she´s my rockstar

Not an ordinary girl (she's not an ordinary girl)
Oh, she's shining like a pearl
