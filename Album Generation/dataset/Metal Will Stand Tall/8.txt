Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooooh

Stand on the outside, looking in
Don't know where to turn, where to begin
It's a long winding road
I am a traveler with a restless heart

We're flying so high, touching the sky
Spreading our wings again
My heart is on fire, with burning desire
Always I will stand by your side
Don't give up on love

No, no

Don't give up now, we've come so far
Together we'll find out who we are
And the road has been long
I need a companion for my restless heart

We're flying so high, touching the sky
Spreading our wings again
My heart is on fire, with burning desire
Always I will stand by your side
Don't give up on love
Don't you give up, don't you give up
No

Don't give up on love
My heart is burning, my soul's on fire
Don't give up on love
So take my fire, my good desire

We're flying so high, touching the sky
Spreading our wings again
My heart is on fire, with burning desire
Always I will stand by your side
We're flying so high, touching the sky
Spreading our wings again
My heart is on fire, with burning desire
Always I will stand by your side

Don't give up on love
No, no

Don't give up on love
Oh
Don't give up, don't give up
