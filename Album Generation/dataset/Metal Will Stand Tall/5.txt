I... I don't wanna feel this pain anymore
And I, I don't wanna be your prisoner anymore
And tell me, tell me you would die for me
Oh make me, I'll belive you'll save me from captivity

I've been waiting, waiting for the day that never comes
I'm still searching for a glimpse of something to hold on
Try, I really wanted you to try
But I'll compromise

I want you to lie to me
So I can feel alive
I want you to crush me
Say the words I love thee
It's easy when you lie to me
Save me from reality
I want you to lie, lie to me

Let me carry you far away
From all of this darkness
I wanna hear you speak my name
Your fondle flame is burning inside of me
You're responsible for striping me of all
My pride and dignity

Wicked woman you don't understand
The scars I'm hiding
My heart is like a dagger
Deep inside your careless hand
Try, I really wanted you to try
But I'll compromise

I want you to lie to me
So I can feel alive
I want you to crush me
Say the words I love thee
It's easy when you lie to me
Save me from reality
I want you to lie, lie to me
Lie to me

I'm obsessed, I need to have you night and day
Am I the hunter or am I the pray
Stalking you at night
And I know, I'll end up being your sacrafice

I want you to lie to me
So I can feel alive
I want you to crush me
Say the words I love thee
It's easy when you lie to me
I've had it with reality
I want you to lie, lie to me

Tell me, tell me you would die for me
