I lose my religion
Then, am I a sinner
In the end?

Well it seems
Like every woman
Is the devils
Right hand

Watch me now!!

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun
Like I've already won
I'm second to none
I'm second to none

Slave
To your rhythm
And the sent
I know so well

Have I
Found my Eden
Or am I done
The road to hell?

Watch me now!!

Number one
See me shine like the sun
Chewing confident gum
I ain't done 'til I'm done

You're second to...

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun
Like I've already won
I'm second to none

What me now

Number one
See me shine like the sun
Chewing confident gum
I ain't done 'til I'm done

You're second to...

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun
Like I've already won
I'm second to none

Number one
Oh Oh Ah Ah
YouÂ´re second
