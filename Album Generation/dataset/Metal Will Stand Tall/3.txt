If you can see me now
If you can hear me now

So long, I will see you again
I don't know how, and I don't know when
But I've seen this phase before
(Ah) Who knows what we leave behind?
What we had is surely hard to resign
You keep me, I be coming back for more
You and me go back a long, long time
I know you well enough to, read your mind

If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time, try to get by
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
I wait for a sign, to bring back the time
This is my song for you

It's been this way before
You come and go, this time I'd had to know
What goes on inside of you
It's not so hard to see
The consequences of the life that we leaved
So tell me, what it means to you
Sometimes it all come's shining through
What I miss the most, is talk to you

If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time, try to get by
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
I wait for a sign, to bring back the time
This is my song for you

Sometimes you far away from me
Away to reach, and I do believe
You're tired of making plans that no one's attended to keep

If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time, try to get by
This is my song for you (If you can see me now.)
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you. (For you)

If you can see me now. (If you can see me now.)
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you
If you can see me now
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you
