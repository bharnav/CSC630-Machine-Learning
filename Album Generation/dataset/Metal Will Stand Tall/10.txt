Many people living in the world they believe
They´re caught in a trap and never do what they please
Stand up
You know it´s all a lie
I reach out to you

I´m building my Kingdom of heaven
I´m just a pilgrim of light
Collect the golden hearts
I´m building my Kingdom of heaven
Live and let live in your life
Open up your heart

All around the world
So many people who bleed
Strenght love and honours is the feed that we need
Raise up and shine a ray of light
I reach out to you

I´m building my Kingdom of heaven
I´m just a pilgrim of light
Collect the golden hearts
I´m building my Kingdom of heaven
Live and let live in your life
Open up your heart
