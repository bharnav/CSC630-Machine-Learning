Don't say it, because you must
Destroy the beautiful, from love to dust
A promise, like hearts of steel
Can break so easily, when love's not real
We don't make much sense without it
Is this the end?

It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
I need your love, just like the shadow needs the light
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life

You're falling, away from me
I'm right in front of you, still I can't reach
We don't make much sense without it
Is this the end?

It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
I need your love, just like the shadow needs the light
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life

It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
I need your love, just like the shadow needs the light
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life
