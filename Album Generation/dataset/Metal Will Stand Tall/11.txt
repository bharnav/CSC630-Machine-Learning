Another day, I lose direction
Memories of yesterday, their call
Keeps me feeling small

I used to feel the sweet conviction
Now I walk to crucifiction
Please won't you catch me when I fall

But I can't take this screaming anymore
Still there's nothing like your kisess
I recall

You know I'm trying, denying
That you don't love me anymore
You've closen all your doors
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find a way back to your heart
But I break before I start

I can't live up, to expectations
Now you leave your resignation
I, will miss you when you're gone

I guess, you can't take
This screaming anymore
Remember all my kisses like before

You know I'm trying, denying
That you don't love me anymore
You've closen all your doors
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find a way back to your heart
But I break before I start

I know I can't refuse the call
And your silence says it all
It's over, don't leave me standing here

Ooohhhh
You know I'm trying, denying
That you don't love me anymore
You've closen all your doors
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find a way back to your heart
But I break before I start

You know I'm trying, denying (I can feel your sweet conviction
Now I walk to crucifiction)
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find a way back to your heart
But I break before I start

Another day, I lose direction
Memories of yesterday
Their call, keeps me feeling small
