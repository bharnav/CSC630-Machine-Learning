Do you remember, do you recall
Oh, that moment we lost it all
Everything, I'd die, if you choose not to fight
On and on, the same old story
Another night we fall from glory
When will we ever learn

Forever, and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past, oh
Wherever, whenever you should call my name
I swear, I will be there, don't you know

To cut the rope, I am still afraid
'Cause I know, nothings left to say
Because we ran, I can never return
I lose my mind, inside I'm craving
I turn to God, he laughs, he's saying
When will you ever learn

Forever, and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past, oh
Wherever, whenever you should call my name
I swear, I will be there, don't you know

Forever, and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past, oh
Wherever, whenever you should call my name
I swear, I will be there, don't you know. (I will be there for you.)

Forever, and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past, oh. (Yeah, the echoes from the past.)
Wherever, whenever you should call my name
I swear, I will be there, don't you know
