For days we fought across the globe
You bit my tongue on a Lisbon Road
We staggered home to the black hotel
Blew our money at the wishing well
December sun didn't make us sing
Wounds too deep to keep anything
But there's no reason to cry
Been fifteen years since we last spoke
The wounds have healed on my throat
The autumn sun's a creamy haze
On Fox Hill Green I lose the day
But there's no reason to cry
