Everybody said that she's good in bed
Other people said that she's well read
She's got a pair or black boots that kick stones
She's got black moods she calls her own
She's got Tasmania in the back of her head
A future move in her head
She's been to Sydney once, no more
They poisoned her water and nailed her door
She wears Lavender it's her scent
Lavender wherever she went
