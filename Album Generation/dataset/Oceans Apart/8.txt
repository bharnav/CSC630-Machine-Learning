I follow footprints to the edge of the moon
While the silver moves around the room
Your sister says your ship is sailing soon
Sighs and whispers from the red lagoon
Then the fire calls and the day blinds you
And a tower falls and the stars find you
This night's for you
I find some feathers buried in the sand
I put them on and try to leave the land
Beyond the break horizons run unplanned
I wear your footprints tattoos in my hands
Then the fire calls and the day blinds you
And a tower falls and the stars find you
This night's for you
