Just pulled out of a train station
We're moving sideways
I'm sitting here with three other people in the carriage

Passing churches, passing stations, a bustling complex
I see a sequence, 22 rivers
Out my window

Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me
The skyscrapers, the cloud scratchers
Here comes a city
The sandwich maker, the trolleycar pusher
Here comes a city

Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me

Etterzhausen, Frankfurt Central, here comes a city
And why do people who read Dostoyevsky
Always look like Dostoyevsky?
A crowded train, a silent night
The country's black and the cities are bright

On this flight, through the night
On this flight, historic night

Here comes a city
Here comes a city
Here comes a city
Here comes a city

Rolling, moving, pushing, screaching
Rolling, moving, pushing

Here comes a city
Here comes a city
Here comes a city
Now
Here comes a city
Now
