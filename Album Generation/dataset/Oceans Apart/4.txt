There's a boundary rider
At the five mile fence
Bloodwood, bones + steers
And the sky's so deep
You can't find your sleep
Keeps you walking through these tears
So you reach for things
You're never satisfied
You're running down the years
And to know yourself
Is to be yourself
Keeps you walking through these tears
Some days you ride it hard
To stop them getting out
Then comes the day you ride
To stop them getting in
There's a boundary rider
On the five mile fence
Bloodwood, bones + steers
And to know yourself
Is to be yourself
Keeps you walking through these tears
