In the mountains near Dellray, acres and a farm, music in the barn, it's no struggle
Snow in the sun. October in the rain. The people that have come are in the middle
And does the Derwent flow? Anywhere up that way
Does the Derwent flow near Dellray?
And when you make a wish. And you get the wish. Never let it go, it's no struggle
