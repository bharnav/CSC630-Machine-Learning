Born to a family
A family of workers
Born to a family
Of honest workers
Then I came along
Golden boy who belonged
And changed the system
Of honest workers
I was square into the hole
There was something in my soul
What could I do
But follow the calling
What could I do
But follow this calling
When I was five years old
Asked when I'd be old
Did I have a plan
But I knew who I am
Born to a family
