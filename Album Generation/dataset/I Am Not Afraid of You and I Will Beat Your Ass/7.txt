Sometimes I don't get you
It's like an endless night
All I do is a waste
And the look on your face is like a knife
Am I fooling myself making believe
Together as one happily
Sometimes I don't get you
And I never lie

Sometimes I don't know you
It's like we never met
And what seems fine by me
Is your litany of regrets
Am I'm clinging to something that's passed
That was never intended to last
Sometimes I don't know you
Messes with my head

Sometimes I think I don't know
How to be on my own
Sometimes I won't answer the door
Or talk on the phone
With you by my side
I don't have to hide
The twig needs a trunk
So that it can continue to grow

The twig needs a trunk
So that it can continue to grow

Sometimes I don't get you
It's like I'm lost at sea
But then you say you're okay
And I know that you'll stay with me
Though it never comes soon enough
We'll get through the difficult stuff
No matter what we do
I'll be there for you
And maybe I'll get you
And you'll get me
