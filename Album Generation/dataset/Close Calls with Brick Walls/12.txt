Mark my grace
Mark my grace
Mark my grace

Should I hold on to
What I thought
Was on point and never not
I thought that I thought
As though I actually knew
About it all

Mark my grace

He keeps on working
He keeps on quitting
He keeps on stealing
But keeps on working

Mark my grace

He keeps on working
He keeps on quitting
He keeps on stealing
But keeps on working

Mark my grace
About what's next
And what's not, I thought

He keeps on working
He keeps on quitting
He keeps on stealing
But keeps on working
