Are you ready to go to sleep?
No!
Party!
Then show me what you're made of
Move them bodies
All around!

I'm not going to bed (You're going to bed)
I'm not going to bed
I'm never going to sleep again

Who's going to bed? (You're going to bed)
No, I'm not going to bed
I'm never going to go to bed again

When I think about the stuff I could do
In all the hours of the white full moon
(Everybody go crazy)
I get excited when the number is late
But I get angry when it ends so soon
(I want you to dance)
Tell me what you did
Tell me what you said
Tell me every thought you got up in your head
(I said:)
"I'll go to sleep when I'm old or I'm dead"

I'm not going to bed (You're going to bed)
I'm not going to bed
I'm never going to sleep again

Who's going to bed? (You're going to bed)
No I'm not!
I won't, I won't, I won't ever go to bed again

Yeah!
Come on! Show me more sights!
Ooo yes, that's right!
Ooo yes, that's right!

(We're not going to bed)
No you're not
(We're not going to bed)
Sit up! Sit up!

(We're not going to bed)
Hold it down! Stand down!
(We're not going to bed)
Now move it all around!

If I can you my freedom
To go against my will
(Do it faster)
Then I will use my freedom
And you can bet I will
(Really get it now)
Tell what you did
Tell me what you said
Tell me every thought that you got up in your head
(I said:)
"I'll go to sleep when I'm old or I'm dead"

I'm not going to bed (You're going to bed)
I'm not going to bed
I'm never going to sleep again

Yasss!
Really move it now!
Good god!

Are you going to fall asleep at the table?
(I'm not)
Are you going to fall asleep watching cable?
(I'm not)
Are you going to let your body do a number on you
And give you shivers til you can't stand down?
Or are you going to hit the pavement
Smoking every joint in town?

I'm not

I'm not going to bed (You're going to bed)
I'm not going to bed
I'm never going to sleep again

Who's going to bed (You're going to bed)
No I'm not
I won't, I won't, I won't every go to bed again

I'm not going
I'm not going to bed (Going to bed)
I'm not going to bed again
