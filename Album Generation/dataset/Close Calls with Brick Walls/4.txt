A Hotel Rings At The End Of The Whirl
Whatever Happened To The Telephone Girl?
And Was It Really Just A One Shot Deal
If You Don't Answer The Call Then The Call's Not Real

You Want To Get Rich? Well, Listen To This
You Got To Lick Your Lips And Give It A Kiss
Another Hot (Hot) Shot (Shot) Into Your Mouth
And Then You Take Your Money Way Down South

VERSE 2 -
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Goddamn!
You Really Put Me In A Hardcore Funk
One Man's Treasure Is Another Man's Junk
And One Man's Yard Is Another Man's Dump
I'll Push You Off My Roof If You Are Too Afraid To Jump

A Man's Own Wage Is A Man's Own Pay
But A Mean M.A.D.D. Mama Might Have Something To Say
Mother Nature Does A Favor, Puts Your Body In The Hearse
Is What I'm Doing Really Any Worse? (Any Worse?)

Do You Listen (Do You Listen) To The Sound Of Your Voice?
And Do You Wonder (Do You Wonder) When You'll Make A Bad Choice?
Do You Ever Wonder What Went Wrong With Your Life?
And Do You Wonder What Went Right?
