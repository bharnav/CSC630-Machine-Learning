Did You Come For The Sound?
Did You Come From Miles Around?
Well, You're Here Now

To Move Faster Than Time
And Remove Every Doubt
That You Are What This Is About
When This Was Then

When I Came By Myself
I Came For You

I Came For You
Oh
You Were There Now

Expectations Derailed
So Take The Frame Off The Nail
And See Where The Color Runs Pale?
Its Outline Shows

That All The Essence Remains
It Has Left Many Stains
On Our Walls, On Our Souls
On Our Brains
When Then Was Now

And When I Came By Myself
I Came For You
