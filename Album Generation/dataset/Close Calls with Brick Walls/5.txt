When (I) I (hear) hear (these) these (words) words
(Hear these words)
I (will) will (think) think (with) with (words) words
(Think with words)

And when I'm (Wondering)
I'm (Wondering)
I'm (Wondering)
Wondering
(Wondering) how?

I just (Go with it)
Just (Go with it)
Just (Go with it)
Go with it (Go with it)
Go with it now
(Right now)
Right now
(Right now)

Because I had my hand on the place
But I had no way of knowing
If my hand was just falling through space
Or into the place that was showing

But I still had my hand
Oh I had my hand on the place
(Oh) (Oh)
Over (And over)
And over
(And over again)

What (if) if (it's) it's (my) my (fate) fate
(It's my fate)
To be right (where) where (I) I (am) am (now) now
(I am now)
And now it's (Happening)
It's (Happening)
It's (Happening)
Happening (Happening)
Happened again
(And again), And again

Because I had my hand on the place
But I had no way of knowing
If my hand was just falling through space
Or into the place that was showing

But I still had my hand
Oh, I had my hand
I had my hand on
My hand on the place
(On the place)
(Oh)(Oh)(Oh)(Oh)
