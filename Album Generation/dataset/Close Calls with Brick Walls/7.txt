Setting the pace when you walk through the door
You're finding a place for your face on the floor
Oh, how will it turn out, you never can tell
One thing's for sure, you're sure not living in hell

Well, hell
The feeling you get when you're running the game
The ceiling has cameras they know you by name
You're working the tables and they're working for you
You're like an earthquake baby, earthshaker
It's easy to do

Unholy passion in a timeless night
You came to win
Who can resist the sin?
In Las Vegas

Las Vegas yeah yeah

Oh well now, you're putting your feet up
You're turning the heat up
A high-stakes dealer
With a high-card hand up
You're letting it ride
And letting it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll

My heart is pounding in my chest
I can't believe I'm here
I cannot believe it
(I cannot believe it)
I cannot believe it
(I cannot believe it)
I cannot believe it
(I cannot believe it)
What's not to believe in Las Vegas

Las Vegas, Nevada
Las Vegas, Nevada
Las Vegas, Nevada

1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Well, you're putting your feet up
You're turning the heat up
You're letting it ride and
You're letting it roll
Las Vegas!
