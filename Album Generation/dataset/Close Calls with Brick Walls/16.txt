Fly Down The Highway
Into A Dreamland
Voyage To Somewhere
Huh Hey
All Inside Of A Thought

In The Center Of Midnight
In Between A Black Hole
There's A Dark Orange Panel
From Which We Take Control

Watch The Full Colored Sunset
Without Need For Remark
And Then Into The Hallway
And Then Into The Dark

Welcome To The Moving Room
See Through The Picture
To The Horizon
Into The Landscape
Huh Hey
Take Any Chance

So Roll Up The Windows
And Consider The Season
Then Consider The Movement
In The Tune Of This Song

You Know You Can't If You Want To
You Know You Can't If You Want To
You Know You Can't If You Want To
(If You Want To) If You Want To
(If You Want To) If You Want To
(If You Want To)
Welcome To The Moving Room

Fly Down The Highway
Into A Dreamland
Voyage To Somewhere
Huh Hey
All Inside Of A Thought
