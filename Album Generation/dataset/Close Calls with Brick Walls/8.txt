I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
(Go wild)
I want to see you lose your mind
I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
(Go wild)
I want to see you lose control

Sometimes you need to go loco
Sometimes you need to explode
Sweat will flow when the camera rolls
And the television says: "Let's g-g-g-g-g-g-go!"

Sometimes you need to go crazy
And other times you need to go crazier
Big night out can you hear me shout?
Saying "That's what I'm talking about!"

I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
(Go wild)
I want to see you lose your mind
'Til your body's on fire
I want to see you go wild
And even if you get tired
I want to see you go wild
Go wild (go wild) go wild
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!

Sometimes you need to get electric
Sometimes you need to get arrested
People go nuts when the going gets tough
And they do bad stuff 'cause they never get enough

(Right now) Right now you've got to go down
(Right now) Right now you've got to go to town
Got to go right down in history
You got to show the people what they want to see

I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
I want to see you go wild
(Go wild)
I want to see you lose your mind
Like a runaway train
I want to see you go wild
Like a hurricane brain
I want to see you go wild
Go wild (go wild) go wild
Go wild (wild) wild (wild)
Wild (wild) wild (wild) wild
I want to see you lose control

I want to see you go wild
