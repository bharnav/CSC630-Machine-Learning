I Can Roll Out Of Synch
With The Beat Of The Rink
Cause I Roll On My Own Terms
I Don't Need Any Sisters Anymore
I Already Ate My Fill Of Worms

I Can Drape Like A Gown
On The Curve Of A Sound
That You Heard Inside Your Room
But I Don't Need Any Sisters Anymore
And I Won't Wear Your Cheap Perfume
Woah Woah

Well, The Car Pulled Up A Long Time Ago
You Only Need One Brother
(Now Say It Again)
And Let The Right Ones Leave Like They Left You Before
You Only Got One Brother
(He's Only A Friend)
And You'll Be Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Just Friends

I Posses All The Grace
That It Takes To Erase
All The Nightmares That I've Had
Well, I Don't Need Any Sisters Anymore
But Now I Admit They're Not So Bad

Having Faith In A Dream
Put A Whole In The Seams
Of The Shadows That You Sew
And I Don't Need Any Sisters Anymore
'Cause I Only Need To Do My Show
Woah Woah

Well, The Car Pulled Up A Long Time Go
You Only Need One Brother
(Now Say It Again)
And Let The Right Ones Leave Like They Left You Before
You Only Got One Brother
(He's Only A Friend)
And You'll Be Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Just Friends

Well, The Car Pulled Up A Long Time Ago
You Only Need One Brother
(Now Say It Again)
And Let The Right Ones Leave Like They Left You Before
You Only Got One Brother
(He's Only A Friend)
And You'll Be Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
And You'll Be Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Making No Love, Making No Love
Just Friends
