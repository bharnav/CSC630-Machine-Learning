You Will Remember Tonight
You Will Remember Tonight
When You Remember Your Life
You Will Remember Tonight

Today Will Be Over And Done With A Sunrise
But The Way That You Feel Will Be Frozen Forever In Time
You'll Forget Yesterday
You'll Forget All The Fears In Your Old Life

You Will Remember Tonight
(You Will Remember Tonight)
And After All These Years This Is Your Night
(You Will Remember Tonight)
And After All This You Will Remember Tonight

Until The End Of Your Days
When You Remember Your Life
You Will Remember Tonight

The Face That You See When You Look In The Mirror
It Won't Be The Same Shape When You Look At It Hours From Now
You Will Notice A Change
You Will Always Remember Tonight

After All These Years This Is Your Night
You Will Remember Tonight
And After All This You Will Remember Tonight

You Will Remember Tonight
You Will Remember Tonight
And After All These Years This Is Your Life
You Will Remember Tonight
And After All This You Will Remember Tonight
