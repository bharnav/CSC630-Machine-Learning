Yeah!

[Verse]
Hollywood's acting depressed
Medicate yourself
The teacher said to the gun

They are addicted to fear
Nicoteenage queers
Are eating holes in the sun

[Chorus]
Sedation is safe and clean
Buy American machines!

[Verse]
Abductor shopping at home
Wire tap the phone
Receive her sick and alone
(You gotta give me my fix! You gotta give me my fix!)
God lives inside your TV
Turn it off as he
Goes broke and gets crucifixed

[Chorus]
Sedation is safe and clean
Buy American machines!

[Bridge]
Cause everything you do
I'll be watching you

Oh shit

[Chorus]
Sedation is safe and clean
Buy American machines!

Fuck you!
