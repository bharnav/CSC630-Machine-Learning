Look in the mirror
What are you searching for?
To dissappear or
Accelerate...
Our lives to their ends
I came to and found myself behind the wheel
Pilot and artifical flight
We sigh and sink into the river bed
Stay asleep
My friends can't breathe underwater i guess
They have weak lungs
Black cuts herself so that you could fall in
This is heaven
Alone in her dark room
I slip through the open door
Pull off my wet clothes
To climb inside...
Her life
Is still warm
Ive got my finger on the trigger oh
Heartbeats are effervescent life
We sigh and sink into the river bed
Stay asleep
They only stab me in the back now anyway
Ill put you out of your cell and your misery
I'm gonna tear
I'm gonna rip it out
