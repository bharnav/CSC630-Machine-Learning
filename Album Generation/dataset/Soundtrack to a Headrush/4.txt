Breathing hard. Static on the line. I'll never get enough
Emptiness of telephonic sex
I imagine you undressing and i can barely stand
Turn down the lights
Your mouth turns me to rust
So let's unwind
I can't escape the hotline
Take your picture. Bite you on the neck. It's all i wanna do
Secretly romancing the recluse
There is no touch. I am dead inside. This is all that's left
Where are you now?
I need your voice
I've been wrapped up tight and spending all my nights...
There's not enough
You can't stop now I'm almost there
