Live from the vacant lot. Everything that you dread
We are the broken teeth amassing in your head
This is the new violence. We want more
Cry if you're feeling faint. Yeah yeah
We'll bring the cameras in its time to carve you out
Bang, bang motherfucker yeah
So while you sleep at night
We will crawl inside and eat you alive
You host the parasite, we'll hold your televised suicide
We're gonna find you tonight
We've got the bright lights
You'll be a star
So get the bullets all right
And pull the trigger
What is there left to lose? Why are you holding back?
Your fifteen minutes will be over in a flash
The leeches are at your throat. We want blood
Lie if you're feeling faint
We'll tie you up and down and drain your life away
We want blood

(chorus)
Who are you?
You're no one
