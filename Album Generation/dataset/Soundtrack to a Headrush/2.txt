[Verse]
How did I get so lost inside of you?
I could be saved, I could be found
Get high and dry that's all I really wanna do
So I guess I'll just stick around

[Pre-Chorus]
Fading going black
Gotta move, gotta wake up
(It is the sunlight)
Everyone is dead
And we dance like a knife fight
(I am the sunlight)

[Chorus]
I lost my inspiration lying in your bed
But you cannot rape the willing
You taste like self-destruction, I follow where I'm lead
But you cannot rape the willing

Alright

[Verse]
I count the days and watch your fires burn
Just give me time to blow them out
But get high and dry that's all I really wanna do
So if you want I could bring you down

[Pre-Chorus]
Fading going black
Gotta move, gotta wake up
(It is the sunlight)
Everyone is dead
And we dance like a knife fight
(I am the sunlight)

[Chorus]
I lost my inspiration lying in your bed
But you cannot rape the willing
You taste like self-destruction, I follow where I'm lead
But you cannot rape the willing

[Bridge]
Now I get chills when you're around
But we still speak without a sound
Sound, sound
Well I'm dying
I'm dying
Oh...
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I lost my inspiration lying in your bed
But you cannot rape the willing
You taste like self-destruction, I follow where I'm lead
But you cannot rape the willing

[Outro]
Get high and dry is all I really wanna do
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
So if you want I could stick around
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
