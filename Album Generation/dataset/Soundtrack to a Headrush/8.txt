Brother we stick together
We fall apart
While we haunt these hollow halls
Inside her fathers residence

Empty heads fill crowded rooms
I can hear my own spine crack
I keep my collar up and wear a lions mask

I feel their stares they violate me
Bodies pile in suffocating
Firewalk the coals there's no turning back once you're gone

Meet by the back door run for our social lives
Sell your soul
Revive
I'm alive
Now were faster than fashion when fascism's in
And its never out of style...
Xeroxicide

You smell like sex and cigarettes
This moment is a blur
Everyone hold down your favorite girl

I feel their stares they violate me
Bodies pile in suffocating
Firewalk the coals there's no turning back once you're gone

Meet by the back door run for our social lives
Sell your soul
Revive
I'm alive
Now were faster than fashion when fascism's in
And its never out of style...
Xeroxicide

Brother we stick together
We fall apart
While we haunt these hollow...

Brother we stick together
We fall apart...

Meet by the back door run for our social lives
Sell your soul
Revive
I'm alive
Now were faster than fashion when fascism's in
And its never out of style...
