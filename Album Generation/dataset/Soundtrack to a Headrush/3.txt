She puts her lips to a bottle of cola
I watch the kiss and it turns me on
It makes me feel as though I am helpless, there is nothing else
She grabs my wrists and leads me to streetlights and locks her door behind my back. Relax relax and let these taxes of your reflex act

Chorus:
Sway so sway, you know you taste so good
This is the night you are the fire
Come on, Come on, Come on
Sway so sway, and we melt into the floor as one

I grab her hips and pull them closer
I close my eyes and it turns her on
Impress her skin and though it resists, oh i slip inside
I feel her breath it slides down my neck yeah, yeah we sweat to the rhythm that we make

Make love, hate yourself but baby I'm all yours, yeah

Chorus

Make tonight stay (we turn around again)
Stay tonight, right here (we turn around again)
Make tonight, stay (we turn around again)
Stay tonight, right here (we turn around again)

We give it all, we all just fade away
We give it all, we all just fade away
We give it all, we all just fade away

We give it all and fade away
