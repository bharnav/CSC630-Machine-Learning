[Intro]
Listen up, motherfuckers
This is that new unheard of, unspoken
So if you're down, then get down
And if you're not, then get the fuck out!

[Verse]
Yeah! With guns still smoking
We're taking off the masks, that we all wear
There's bloodstains on the dancefloor
And it's dripping from the lips of another jealous mouth

[Chorus]
Hey man! You better watch, better listen in
Oh yeah? You got her taking home this record to fuck
Hey man! You ask me now if I want it all
Well, right now!

[Post-Chorus]
This is the sound that sparks the fire
Live tonight for liars
Alive tonight to say
That I am, I am the voice inside your head
And you give yourself away

[Verse]
I see you getting high in the alley
"What if you do? I'll hold one for you"
You walked up and you kicked in a dent
"Not with these boots you'd recognize the prints"
You showed up and you ruined my party!
"It's not true. What is it to you? It's everything and nothing I do"

[Chorus]
Hey man! You better watch, better listen in
Oh yeah? You got her taking home this record to fuck
Hey man! You ask me now if I want it all
Well, right now!

[Post-Chorus]
This is the sound that sparks the fire
Live tonight for liars
Alive tonight to say
That I am, I am the voice inside your head
And you give yourself away

[Bridge]
Hey brother put your best shoes on
Hey brother it's your, it's your come up and
Hey brother grow your hair out long
Tell your sister she's a...

Hey brother put your best shoes on
Hey brother it's your, it's your come up and
Hey brother grow your hair out long
Tell your sister she's a...

Hey brother put your best shoes on
Hey brother it's your, it's your come up and
Hey brother grow your hair out long
Tell your sister that she's a...

Bitch!

[Outro]
This is the sound that sparks the fire
Live tonight for liars
Alive tonight to say
That I am, I am the voice inside your head
And you give yourself away

Hey Man!
