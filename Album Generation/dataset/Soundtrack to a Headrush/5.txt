Slow roll quick drags. im gonna wrap my head in plastic
Yeah so catch me when i...
Fall down face first. im gonna scream gonna make it hurt
Yeah so start the car and...
Drive me home. because i need to be alone
Hold on tight. could lose my grip or lose my mind
Well i guess im cool. if you are too. you always know just what to do
I guess im fine ill blow my mind and say goodnight
Slow turns bright skies. im gonna die man fuck a speed limit
Yeah so catch me when i...
This is the end of everything. i take a breath and i choke i push it all back up

(chorus)
This was the first this was my last taste of the technicolor
Why are you alone?
