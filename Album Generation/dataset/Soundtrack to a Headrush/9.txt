I watched the cars collide. It shattered glass and stopped time
Stealing my sight. Blinding my eyes
Our bodies disconnect
Struggle you are trapped there
Gasping for air
Abused
These hearts are lead and sinking down
Under the ground
Tonight, we are all in
Let go. This is the end
Tonight we are all in
Tell me you're there
Brighter than aircraft lights cutting into the night
Climbing so high. In the blank sky
We waited our whole lives, for this moment to burn
Our immolation
Consumed
Smoke signals to a greater cause
The message was lost
Dislocated watching myself die
