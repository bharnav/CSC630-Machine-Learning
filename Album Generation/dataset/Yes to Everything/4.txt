Break in the pleasure, breaking it in
All around the world
Measure for measure getting it out
Got to let you know
Chorus
I Love you, love you, love you all
Yeah I love you, love you, love you all
Breaking the fences down
Yeah forever we're together
Got a reason
And there's nothing can go wrong
Chorus
More than life more than life
More than anybody can
More than wine more than wine
More than anybody yeah
Breaking the exit I'm breaking my neck
I'm breaking over you
Break in the airwaves yeah
Calling out to you
Chorus
More than life more than life
More than anybody yeah
Ooou baby break me up into little pieces
Ooou baby I'm breaking over you
Breaking it down to what
Happens only once
And this one is it oh yeah
It's such a surprise that I don't realize it
Chorus
More than life more than life
More than anybody can
More than wine more than wine
More than anybody yeah
Nothing can nothing can
Stop me now
Nothing can nothing can
Stop me
