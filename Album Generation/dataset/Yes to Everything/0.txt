I don't ask much, less than you know
The limits of our language are the limits that we sow
And I want to explain why the vacancy gets you needing a buzz
You got to obey what it is that gets you off

Speak what you feel, not what you know
Fear in our cities leave us alone

I don't do much, I'm just passing through
On the authority of the beat and groove
Why do we kill all the things that we love because it's easy to do
It's easy to do because everyone else is doing it too

Speak what you feel, not what you show
Fear in our cities it only grows
Say it, say it's nothing or say nothing all
'Cause you don't get it from turning your face away

At the sound of attack I'm craving a blast for ease on my mind
I can never go back because I think I left a long-long time ago

Speak what you feel, not what you know
Fear in our cities we all know
We can never go back because we left a long time ago
And you don't get nothing from turning your face away today

Speak what you feel, what do you feel
Speak what you feel, what do you feel
I can never go back because I think I left a long time ago
At the sound of attack I'm craving a blast for ease on my mind
Ease on my mind

You had to take me on
