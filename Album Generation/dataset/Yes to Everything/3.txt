And as for seventeen on
You think that, you know everything but you'll fall, sometimes
Your life's about a ton of choices and all emotions that turn and go
I believe there's something that is coming, that we do not know
Seventeen on
Go you, where feeling is strong
Work your heart easy, set your love free
And if you get lost you can always come back, to me
You'll worry about the future, sometimes deny your past
Waiting for an answer, too afraid to ask
You won't sleep some nights, you won't breathe some nights
You won't ever find any peace some nights, and you'll say "why me, why me, oh why me?"
Seventeen on
Go you, where feeling is strong
Work your heart easy, set your love free
And if you get lost you can always come back, to me
To me
You'll jump in the fire, jump in the sea
Sometimes you'll think, how bad can it be
Don't let it fool you, don't let it move you
Don't let it change, who you are
You are young, you are loved, you are all on
Seventeen on
Go you, where feeling is strong
Work your heart easy, set your love free
And if you get lost you can always come back, can always come back, to me
