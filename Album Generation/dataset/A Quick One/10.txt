[Intro]
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T [x3]

[Verse 1]
Found her in a barn in Tennessee
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T
Took me three years of sweat and blood
To clean off all of that Tennessee mud

[Chorus]
My Bucket T (Bucket T)
Bucket T (Bucket T)
My Bucket T (Bucket T) [x2]

[Interlude]
T T T[?] Bucket bucket bucket[?]
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T [x2]

[Verse 2]
Cruise down the street in front of school
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool
Driving down the road I'll get my kicks
I'll pop in the clutch and slip in the sticks

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I was right, too, she's first in her class
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass
All the girls want to take a ride with me
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T

[Chorus]
