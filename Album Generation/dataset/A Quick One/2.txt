[Chorus 1]
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean "So long"

[Chorus 2]
You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

[Chorus 3]
Please talk to me again
I need you

[Verse]
We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you
Distort my ears when
The music's loud
Yet you raise your hatchet
In the yellow crowd

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
