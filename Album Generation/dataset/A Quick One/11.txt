[Verse]
Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann [x2]
Barbara Ann, take my hand, Barbara Ann
You've got me rocking and a'rolling
Rocking and a'reeling Barbara Ann
I went to a dance
Looking for romance
Saw Barbara Ann so I thought I'd take a chance
With Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rocking and a'rolling
Rocking and a'reeling Barbara Ann
Tried Mary Lou
Tried Peggy Sue
Tried Freddie too
But I knew she wouldn't do
Like Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rocking and a'rolling
Rocking and a'reeling Barbara Ann
Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann [?]
