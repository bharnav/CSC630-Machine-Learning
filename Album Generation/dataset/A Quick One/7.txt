[Chorus 1]
La la la la la la la [x4]

[Verse 1]
So sad about us
So sad about us
Sad that the news is out now
Sad, suppose we can't turn back now
Sad about us

[Chorus 2]
So bad about us
So bad about us
Bad - never meant to break up
Bad - suppose we'll never make up
Bad about us

[Verse 2]
Apologies mean nothing
When the damage is done
But I can't switch off my loving
Like you can't switch off the sun

[Chorus 1]
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

[Chorus 2]
