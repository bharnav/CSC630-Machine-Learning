[Chorus]
Run, run, run [x4]

[Verse 1]
Well baby, better take my advice
A black cat crossed your path twice
The moon came out next to the sun
Then you opened your umbrella in a room

[Chorus]
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run [x3]

[Verse 2]
Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know
And you won't get luckier the way you're going
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked
You walk under ladders then you walk right back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When you dropped that little pin
Never thought what a mess it'd get you in
Little pin, little pin, bring me luck
Because I stopped to pick you up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well now, little girl, I'm helping you
I hope you believe what I say is true
Whenever you run, I'll be running too
Whenever you run, I'll be following you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Run, run, run
