[Verse 1]
I've been away so long
Wonder where I went wrong
I spent the last years inside a cell
Never ever go away again
I've been so sad and lonely
Never ever ever going to go away again

[Verse 2]
It's a waste of time doing time
When you didn't commit a crime
It wasn't me it was my brother Bill
And I'd have to tell never going to speak to Bill again
He's made me sad and lonely
Never ever gonna speak to brother Bill again

[Verse 3]
It was no use, they put my brother on the jury
He bribed the others 'cause he owns the local brewery
They let me out today
Brother Bill's gonna pay
No one's ever gonna speak to Bill again
Never ever gonna speak to Bill again
He'll be too cold and bony
Never ever going to go away again [x3]
