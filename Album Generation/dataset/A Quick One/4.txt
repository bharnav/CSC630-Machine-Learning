[Chorus 1]
Heat wave [x2]

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?

[Chorus 2]
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart

[Verse 2]
Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain
I feel, yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
Because this is the way love's supposed to be

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Oh yeah [x4]
Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance

[Chorus 1] [x2]
