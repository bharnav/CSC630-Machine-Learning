[Chorus 1]
Come along
Into the city
Where the girls are pretty
And you can't go wrong

[Verse]
Take your time
No need to hurry
Don't have to worry
Cause it won't take long

[Chorus 2]
Well you can surf in the city
You can swim in the pools
Do anything you want
Because there ain't no rules
Drive your super-stock car bur to the long highway
And you can drag

[Chorus 3]
In the city in the falling right
The kids are hip and they can dance all night
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
In the city, into the city
