Part 1: The Death of St. Jimmy

[Intro]
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

[Verse 1]
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure and what is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

[Verse 2]
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says “We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame"

Jimmy died, today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
It's my own private suicide

Part 2: East 12th St

[Intro]
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

[Verse]
Jesus filling out paperwork, now
At the facility on East 12th St
He's not listening to a word, now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming

He'd rather be doing something else, now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety, now
And she had enough and he had plenty

[Interlude]
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

[Outro]
So far away, I don't want to stay
Get me out of here, right now
I just wanna be free, is there a possibility?
Get me out of here, right now
This life like dream ain't for me

Part 3: Nobody Likes You

[Verse]
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee, and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone, 'cause you're not here
Left me here alone when I should have stayed home
After ten cups of coffee, I'm thinking (Where'd you go?)

[Chorus]
Nobody likes you, everyone left you (Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you, havin' fun (Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you, nobody likes you (Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you, havin' fun
(Where'd you go... go... go... go...)

Part 4: Rock and Roll Girlfriend

[Intro]
Geez... Ha...

[Verse]
I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar

I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothing in over 22 days
(Don't want to be an American idiot)
So, get off my case, off of my case
Off of my case!

Part 5: We're Coming Home Again

[Verse]
Here they come, marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet

The time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is spinning 'round
And 'round, out of control again
From the 7-11
To the fear of breaking down

So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We're the ones going

[Refrain]
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

[Interlude]
I started fuckin' running
Just as soon as my feet touch ground
We're back in the barrio
But to you and me, that's Jingle Town, that's...

[Refrain]
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

(No! Fuck off! Just go! I don’t care! I don’t! I don’t know! I smashed my phone! Just go! I don’t care! I don’t! I don’t know! I smashed my phone!)

[Outro]
Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, havin' fun
