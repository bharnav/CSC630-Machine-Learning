[Verse 1]
Growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds, the boats, and past loves
That flew away or started sinking
And it's crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way
Say it's all up in the stars

[Verse 2]
Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights
I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh god, I miss her so much
And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
They're telling me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall
To get right back up, back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much
I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby

[Chorus]
And I'd be saying that you
You're always holding on to stars
I think they're better from afar
Cause no one is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I have faded in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?

[Bridge]
Oh, come on girl
I just need a helping hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true, it came true
It never came true

[Chorus]

[Outro]
No one's gonna save us
No one's gonna save me now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No one's gonna save us
Who we are, who we are
Who you are, who you are
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
You're always holding on to stars
