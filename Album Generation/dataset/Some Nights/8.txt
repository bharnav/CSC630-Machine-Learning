[Verse 1]
I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
I can’t help but love thinking that everyone doesn’t get it
To my left there’s a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just blends in to rows of clothes and bad ideas
But ideas nonetheless in a song

[Hook]
I put one foot in front of the other one
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

[Verse 2]
I happen to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can’t help but back up when I think of what’s happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
But what you're calling a sin isn’t up to them
After all, after all I thought we were all your children
But I will die for my own sins thanks a lot
We’ll raise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all
So up off the ground up for fathers and nothing but dust now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over twenty-five and I can’t make a name for myself
Some nights I break down and cry
I’m lucky that my father’s still alive
He’s been fighting all his life and if this is all I’ve ever known
Then may his soul live on forever in my song

[Hook]

[Outro]
In front of the other one
In front of the other one
Just a better place to die
