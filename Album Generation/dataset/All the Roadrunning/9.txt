I didn't ask for much
As maybe I ought've
But I'm staying in touch
With the one I love
And I can see in the dials
And in these headlights beams
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with you

These are the big payloads
Hammer down on the floor
These are the restless roads
Every one a war
But in the flashing lines
I see a love supreme
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with you

They promised me some good home time
And some layover pay
The agent he's a friend of mine
Says it's due my way
I'd drive a thousand miles
Haul a trailer of tears
Just to see you smile
And as the dawn appears
At the edge of the night
There's still a light that gleams
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with you
