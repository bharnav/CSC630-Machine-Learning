They say there's wreckage washing up
All along the coast
No one seems to know too much
Or who got hit the most
Nothing has been spoken
There's not a lot to see
But something has been broken
That's how it feels to me

We had a harmony
I never meant to spoil
Now it's lying on the water
Like a slick of oil
The tide is running out sea
Under a darkening sky
The night is falling down on me
And I'm thinking that I should

[Chorus:]
Head on home
(Head on home)
Been gone too long
(Gone too long)
Leave my roaming beachcombing

Little wild kitten out hunting
To see what he can get
You're in a big city now
That won't stop growing yet
The sun is going down smokin'
A flaming testament
Something has been broken
And it feels permanent

A little sea bird flying
He knows where he wants to go
Guess I better pack my stuff
And do the thing I know
I turn around and head on back
Along the old sea wall
I feel something give and crack
And I'm sorry, that's all

[Chorus]
