[Harris]
My famous last words are laying around in tatters
Sounding absurd, whatever I try
But I love you, and that's all that really matters
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye

[Knopfler]
Your bright shining sun would light up the way before me
You were the one who made me feel I could fly
And I love you, whatever is waiting for me
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye

[Both]
Who knows how long we've got
Or what we're made out of
Who knows if there's a plan or not
There is our love
I know there is our love

[Harris]
My famous last words could never tell the story
Spinning unheard in the dark of the sky
But I love you, and this our glory
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye

[Both]
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
