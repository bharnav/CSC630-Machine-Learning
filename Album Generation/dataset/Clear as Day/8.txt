Mama hollers "Suppertime
And don't make me tell you twice
Wash your hands and wipe your face
The table's no place for your toys
And try to use your inside voice
Don't dig in until we say Grace"
So we put down our forks and bowed our heads
And then she prayed the strangest prayer ever said:

[Chorus]
"I want to thank You Lord
For noisy children and slamming doors
And clothes scattered all over the floor
A husband working all the time
Dragging in dead tired at night
My never ending messy kitchen
And dirty dishes"

[Verse 2]
We all got real still and quiet
And daddy asked "Honey, you alright?"
She said, "There ain't nothing wrong
Noisy kids are happy kids
And slamming doors just means we live
In a warm and loving home
Your long hours and those dishes in the sink
Means a job and enough to eat

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"For my little busy bees
Begging mama, mama can you please?
Always wanting me and calling me
Loads of laundry piling up
Crayons crushed into the rug
In those little sticky kisses
And dirty dishes
And dirty dishes"
