[Verse 1]
I'm just a country boy, I drive a four-by-four
It's usually covered in mud, from the axle to the door
It's a little banged up, a little too much rust
But when you're sitting beside me in my old truck

[Chorus]
You make that look good, honey, better than it should
Might as well say Cadillac there on the hood
The way you flash that smile, girl, the way you look
No matter what you do, you make that look good

[Verse 2]
In your old flip-flops, in your worn-out jeans
In that little tank top, you're still a beauty queen
Sitting there on the steps, painting your toenails
With your hair put up in a ponytail

[Chorus]
You make that look good, honey, better than it should
Is that my front porch or Hollywood?
The way you flash that smile, girl, the way you look
No matter what you do, you make that look good

[Bridge]
Boys will be boys, we like running around
Painting the town, don't know a thing about settling down
Oh, but baby right now

[Chorus]
You make that look good, honey, better than it should
Always swore I couldn't, now I'm thinking I could
The way you flash that smile, girl, the way you look
No matter what you do, you make that look good

[Outro]
No matter what you do, you make that look good
