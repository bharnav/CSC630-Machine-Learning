[Verse 1]
Running from the rat race
Just as fast as I can
Take off my tie so I can breathe
Me, I'm going where the fresh air's blowing
Take a little walk in the country with me

[Chorus]
Walk in the country with me
Watch the sun sinking down on the trees
It's going to do us some good
To get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me

[Verse 2]
I'm so sick of all them TV shows
I need some dirt road under my feet
Come on let's point our toes where the red fern grows
Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Walking in the country
Oh bless my soul
Just give me that country road

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Take a little walk in the country with me[x2]
