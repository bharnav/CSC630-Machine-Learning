[Verse 1]
It's the Duquoin, Illinois county fair
I could still see her standing there like a dream
Flatbed stage on a little dirt track
She was second row, her hair pulled back
We were young and free

[Chorus 1]
Oh, she could've been mine
But we ran out of summertime

[Verse 2]
Spent a few weeks out on a lake shore beach
Carved our names high as we could reach on an old wooden pier
We made plans we planned to keep
300 miles from her to me and her senior year

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And of all the things I let get away
She's the one that keeps me awake at night
And I've never seen days go by so fast
A little more sand falling through the glass
She was hot as July and sweet as sunshine

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
If the days had only stayed that long
And those autumn leaves didn't have to fall
Oh, we'd have fell in love
Because what we felt on that Ferris wheel
Was just too right and just too real
But just not long enough

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Chorus 1]
