[Verse 1]
First crush, first kiss, first time I saw the ocean
And dug my toes in the sand
(Your love is better than that)
Baseball and summer nights, casting out when the fish first bite
First time I got a Chevy in my hands
(Your love is better than that)
I thought nothing can touch that by a mile
I thought nothing can make that moment seem so worthwhile

[Chorus]
Your love is better, better, better than that
Nothing is sweeter than you
Making my heart beat so fast
Everything I could have been
That was at the end of all those other paths
Your love is better
Your love is better than that

[Verse 2]
Six string, first song, the way it felt to sing along
To some words that were scribbled on my soul
(Your love is better than that)
I thought nothing can touch that by a mile
I thought nothing can make that moment seem so worthwhile

[Chorus]
Your love is better, better, better than that
Nothing is sweeter than you
Making my heart beat so fast
Everything I could have been
That was at the end of all those other paths
Your love is better
Your love is better than that

[Bridge]
One day, years from now
When I'm old and gray, I'm going to smile about
How life has been so good

[Chorus]
Your love is better, better, better than that
Nothing is sweeter than you
Making my heart beat so fast
Everything I could have been
That was at the end of all those other paths
Your love is better
Your love is better than that
