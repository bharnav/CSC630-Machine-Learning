[Verse 1]
In a water tower town everybody waves
Church doors are the only thing that's open on Sundays
Word travels fast, wheels turn slow
Yeah working hard and living right is the only life we know

[Chorus]
Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
The fireflies come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town

[Verse 2]
Where your friend's a friend and your word's your word
And our pickup trucks, they ain't for looks, they're made for work
Corn grows high, crime stays low
There's little towns everywhere where everybody knows

[Chorus]
Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
And the girls come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town

[Chorus]
Yeah, Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
Peace and quiet make such a beautiful sound
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town

[Outro]
Yeah, in a water tower town
