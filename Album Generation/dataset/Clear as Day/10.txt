[Verse 1]
I dropped by to check on Mama for a minute
I could hear her humming a tune through the screen door in the kitchen
She was putting the final touches on a homemade pecan pie
And just like always I was right on time
Little game of guess-who and I got a hug and "How's my baby?"
I said, "You know me, Mama, I've been hitting it hard, running like crazy
But I don't want to bore you with that same old nothing's new
I'd rather just pull up this chair and get caught up on you"

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how it all comes back around
I remember when I couldn't wait to get out of her hair and ditch this town
I was restless a time to move on
Now it's any reason to go back home
That's what's it all about
Yeah, I'm just slowing down
To get my feet back on the ground

[Verse 2]
That minute turned into an hour before I knew it
And I got my fill on pie and how everybody's doing
I used to look for every reason in the world to hit that door
And she said, "You want another cup of coffee?"
I said, "Yeah, I'll take one more"

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how it all comes back around
I remember when I couldn't wait to get out of her hair and ditch this town
I was restless a time to move on
Now it's any reason to go back home
That's what's it all about
Yeah, I'm just slowing down
To get my feet back on the ground

[Outro]
And now, I can't go too many days without
Checking in, just touching base, and just slowing down
Back on the ground
I dropped by to check on Mama for a minute
