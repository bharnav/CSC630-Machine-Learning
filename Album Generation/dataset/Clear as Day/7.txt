[Verse 1]
She climbed up an oak tree and double back-flip
The river-drenched bikini sitting pretty on her hips
So we shared a Coca Cola sitting on a log
And I was wanting to kiss her like an old bullfrog
Did you say you're only here for a couple of days
Well alright, we ain't got much time to waste
We talked until the moon chased the sun from the sky
Said this is hello, it sure ain't goodbye

[Chorus]
Write my number on your hand where it's easy to see
Write my number on your hand and give yours to me
It will look good in blue on your sun-kissed tan
Baby write my number on your hand

[Verse 2]
We jumped back in the water in the moonlight glow
I said, come tomorrow, where you want to go
Maybe some place cool, because it'll be hot
Do it one more time, I think it might've rubbed off

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you're ever back in town, just give me a ring
She said, well that's so sweet, but if you want to see me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It'd look pretty dang good with your farmer's tan
Baby write my number on your hand
