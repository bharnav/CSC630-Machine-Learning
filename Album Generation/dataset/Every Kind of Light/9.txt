Well I finally found a jungle I like
I’ll be swinging my machete tonight
The jungle floor’s like a rug, if you don’t mind the bugs
At least you know that all of them bite

I got my mind in a clump
Trump tight from the jump
All right!
I finally found a jungle I like

Don’t you try to help me chop on through
Or I’ll be swinging my machete at you
All the new friends I’ve made might burn up in the shade
But they’ll never tell me what to do
I might get stuck in a canopy drinking every Saturday night

But I finally found a jungle I like

Crazy days are getting bettet than the ones before
My mind is playing time for the team
Different than the one that’s keeping score

Yeah I finally found a jungle I like
I’ll be drowning in confetti tonight
Nancy Spumante by the full moonlight
'Cause I finally found a jungle
All right!

Hang ‘em high 'til they fry in the friendly skies
I’m psyched!
I finally found a jungle I like
