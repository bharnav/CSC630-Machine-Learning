The black CNN has gone all HSN
You’re on the move, we’re all preapproved now get out there and spend
Don’t turn around cuz it’s all one view
Look up the skirt of Sweetheart and you can still see Malibu

Take it away now, sweethearts

Paper or plastic body bags
You think I am being crass?
Look at the guy you walked in the door with
Scaled up like an asp

Don’t turn around cuz it’s all one view
Sweethearts are cutting in the line now and shoplifting for the few

Take it away now, sweethearts

Is that what it’s all about?
You believe in something and die while you’re still devout
I can almost hear a country’s faintest cry
But the sweethearts have you now, goodbye

Hey Adrien Brody
Hey Shaquielle O’Neal
Humvees are driving boys to battle
You’ve got shiny wheels

Don’t turn around cuz it’s all one view
Sweethearts are keeping it flowing it for ya, baby keep on keepin it real
Keep on keepin it real
Keep on keepin it

Is that what it’s all about?
I believed in something I’ll die while I’m still devout
I can almost hear a country’s faintest cry
But the sweethearts have you now, goodbye
