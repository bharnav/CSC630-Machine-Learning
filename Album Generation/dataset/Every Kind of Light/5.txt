You
You're the beauty to behold
You're the reason why I'm still alive
You dove on in and took right hold

I
Would've drown when I let go
I was looking for the answer to a question
Finally now I know

First star in the sky - don't lose that feeling
I'm ready to stay the second time around

You
You're the summer I lived through
You're the days of April I was dead to life
Instead I am renewed

First star in the sky - don't lose that feeling
I'm ready to stay the second time around

I'll make it clear and keep you mine
Starting to shine this light of life so crystalline

See
You're the reason I believe
The story yet to be and truth be told
Until the final scene

First star in the sky, don't lose that feeling
I'm better to stay
Second time around
Second time around
