I'm hiding here again
From the January snow
And the bottles on the wall
Tell me there's 93 to go
I wish you'd never been here
Like I hope I'll always know you

Could this bar look any better than when I'm half blind from the cold?
Apologetic with the most pathetic story ever told?
I'm undeveloped roll in a picture-perfect world you sold me

Dreams of you die harder
But dreams of you still go the farthest

Vodka to the left of me, tequila to the right
And time is like a bruise on my face tonight
I could never live it down but the again I might be tempted

And I ain't never been so beat by the misery I made
Like a paradise tossed on some lost crusade
Guess I'd better start saving for the debts I'll never pay in time

Dreams of you die hardest
But dreams of you still go the farthest

Just one last crawl
Before I can't move at all
There's just one last crawl
Before I can't move at all

Second-hand drunks keep me coming back for more
And hope I'm not the first to be the last through the door
Could I love you any less than if I loved you any more?
Not likely
Not likely

Just one last crawl
Before I can't move at all
There's just one last crawl
Before I can't move at all
Before I can't move at all

Just one last crawl
Before I can't move at all
Before I can't move at all

Just one last crawl

Kepe it straight now
It could be any day now
Keep it straight now
It could be any day now
Keep it straight now
It could be any day now

Before I can't move at all
