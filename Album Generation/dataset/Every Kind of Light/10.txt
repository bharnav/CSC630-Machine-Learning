Someone you knew wasn't able to be true
I can't help you now
Led away weigh in your chains, when you asked me for changes
I can't help you now
It's got me more than just down
We used to disagree so well
But that's long gone
And I wonder if you even noticed I'd left you
For another shore

And I try to resemble the score that I settle
But that just don't fly with me
That just don't fly
And I cry, tears like I haven't cried in years
When I say goodbye

I stood on the floor of the Monument Valley
Sky deep with stars
And I asked "are you safe from the thieves in this country"?
I hope that you are
Sanitized souls, did you airbrush out your roles?
I can't help but ask
I used to be young with a strong constitution
Just look at me now

Every broadcast disaster just adds a new wrinkle
But that just don't fly with me
That just don't fly
And I cry tears like I haven't cried in years
I had to say goodbye

Don't make me cry, don't give me one more flyby
I can't stand the sight
A plan that's delayed by its own executioner
What's left to debate?
And I hope that my protests will prove to be useless
And we can move on
But the street that I lived on, the grass that I laid on
When will it be gone?

Are we deep in the dream of a chemical scion?
But that just don't fly with me
That just don't fly
And I cry
Cry tears like I haven't cried in years
I had to say goodbye
I had to say goodbye
