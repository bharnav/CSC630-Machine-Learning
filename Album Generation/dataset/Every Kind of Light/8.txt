[Verse 1]
Oh baby, you're too pure
You're too pure for this wicked world
Your data's uncorrupted
But does something skip inside you?
That's what takes up time in your life
Add up the sum of the slights
And sooner or later

[Chorus]
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under its wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?

[Verse 2]
Sense memory, that's so pass√©
Is that what passes for vision these days?
I engineer no strangeness
I don't have that modern streak
What fills up the space in your life?
Does the sum of the slights hurt?
Sooner or later

[Chorus]
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under its wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?

[Bridge 1]
I said time can't hurt you
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
You can do it yourself
But make your ends known to your means
And your lovers

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Drop your guard, get over yourself
Kick your shoes to the floor
And run from your cover
Run to the other side of your head
And I'll stand right by you

[Chorus]
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under its wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?
I said love, love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under its wing
Is it some, some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?

[Outro]
I said time can hurt you
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
(I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world)
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
