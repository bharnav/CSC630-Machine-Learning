It’s easy livin’ in the house of your dreams
Wall to wall with every trophy you don’t need
All the players say the damndest things
Making time for the camera 16 minutes can bring

Hands tied, put them up in the air
And load it down like you probably don’t care
The whole world is starting to share
In a sense all the senseless events happen here

Yeah, it’s great to be here again
Where the saints all sing along
I hope the party never ends

Act now and you’ll play for it later

Chill out before you learn how to hate her
It’s too late to take it all back
While you wait for the top of the ladder to crack

Order up!
This one’s for the kiddies
They don’t care now and they never Diddy
Holy water is under the bridge
To the future we’re burning to get to the fridge

Yeah, it’s great to be here again
Where the saints all sing along

I hope the party never ends

Yeah, it’s great to be here again
Where the saints all sing along
I hope the party never ends

A ryhming dictionary and a bag of chicken
A pin button puffin starting to thicken
Most extreme eliminatin’ the rival teams
A midget mercenary married to a Wiccan

Hell yeah, it’s great to be here again
Where the saints all sing along
I hope the party never ends

I like the scene, I like the sound, I like the way that we pretend
While the saints all sing along
Hope the party never ends!
(I’m glad we’re still friends
I'm hoping that it won’t end
I’m in love with the fight
I’m breakin those who won’t bend)
