I got summertime on the brain again
I got maps and charts but I can’t find the end

Baby I’m willing to try anything, everything

There’s nothing for you to deny

I got summer sun, I got every kind of light
I got the air that keeps me wide awake at night

Baby I’m willing to try anything, everything
There’s nothing for you to deny
(For you to deny, for you to deny)

Can I roll onto the space where you once were?

And can I have another taste so I’ll be sure never to forget it?

Baby I’m willing to try anything, everything
There’s nothing for you to deny

Take in all the delights
I’ll never refuse you the right

Can I have another taste so I’ll be sure I never will forget it?
(Another taste so I)

Can I have another taste so I’ll be sure I never will forget it?
(Another taste so I)
Can I have another taste so I’ll be sure I never will forget it?
I never will forget it
