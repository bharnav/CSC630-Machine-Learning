Well it’s a beautiful day for a certain arrangement
There’s wheels in the water and tires on the pavement
Don’t tell me the party’s through
The lights are coming on at 2

Most of the time
And if the bartenders come out to play
I’m going to try to keep them out of the way

I’m crossing the line that leads to a good time

There’s only so many chords that haven’t been played yet
And the check’s in the mail but we haven’t been paid yet
The chauffeur’s picking up our tab
It’s looking like we need a cab

We’re counting our dimes

And if the ploy won’t come into play
Were gonna save it for a rainy day
When we’re blurring the line
Between us and the good times

It’s all in a day’s work
(All in the way you work with the changes)
It’s all in a day’s work

(All in the way you take to the strangers)

Then we’ll be back in the morning and brush off the pay dirt
Derange it by evening and call it a day’s work

And every word that we parlay
Gets forgotten the next day
It’s better that way
But if the boys don’t come into play
You’ll have to save them for a rainy day

When we’re writing the lines and making up good times

It’s all in a day’s work
(All in the way you work with the changes)
It’s all in a day’s work
(All in the way you take to the strangers)
It’s all in a day’s work
(All in the way you work with the changes)
It’s all in a day’s work

(All in the way you take to the strangers)
