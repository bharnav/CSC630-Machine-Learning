On the way back from yesterday, give yourself a break
And say hello to the now you know
Now you know (let it go) today
There's no prison left inside to guard you through

Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
I can tell you're the one that I'd bet our lives upon

Will it be such a mystery if you leave without a clue?
Don't let it end on this note again
Just one word shy of true
And we'll talk more than those behind closed doors will ever know

Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
From a side of my mind that you helped to help me find

Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Is it clear, can you tell?
Can you feel me just as well?

And we'll talk more than those behind closed doors will ever know
They'll never know

Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
I can tell you're the one that I'd bet our lives upon

Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Is it clear?
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me just as well?
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
Conversations on and on
