[Verse 1]
Winded through monotone
One foot on checkered floor
Head hung but still watching
One dim-lit figurine

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, pass it on
Appeal, play along

[Verse 2]
Please don't stop singing
Cohorts are empty jars

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, pass it on
Appeal, play along

[Chorus]
Meanwhile (meanwhile) another scene, yeah
Tracking mud while blood letting
We've been so proud

[Verse 3]
Watch how our star behaves
We'll all roll in our graves
Sink with every word
While all their backs were turned

[Chorus 2]
Meanwhile our little gem, yeah
Is sleeping with sycophants
We've been so proud
But now and then we're joining in
We've been so proud
Tracking mud while blood letting
We've been so proud

[Outro]
We've been so proud
We've been so proud
We've been so proud
