[Verse 1]
I took my seat and stared
At the cardboard screen while no one cared
While the lights stayed on
The familiar buzz was now long gone
I just waited there
As the music soared into the air
As the lights went down
She said, "Don't open your eyes"

[Chorus]
Don't open your eyes

[Verse 2]
At tempo 119
They took to the crowd and aimed towards me
As the circle closed
I held onto the one with splintered clothes
Twenty years before
She said, "Don't open your eyes and you can swim"
All my friends ignored
She said, "Don't open your eyes"

[Chorus]
Don't open your eyes
And said goodnight
Don't open your eyes
And said goodnight

[Bridge]
Don't open your eyes
And said

[Verse 3]
I couldn't end it there
As her wooden bones grew through her skin
Crumbled naturally
As her limbs and leaves had broken free
Twenty years before
She said, "Don't open your eyes and you can swim"
Wanted nothing more
She said, don't open your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't open your eyes
And said goodnight
Don't open your eyes
And said goodnight
