[Verse 1]
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
But it's not quite right
And this 'real'
It's impossible if possible
At whose blind word
So clear but so unheard
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus 1]
To appear sad
With the same 'ol decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

[Verse 2]
Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine
Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

[Chorus 2]
Locked and loaded
Still the same 'ol decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate
It's so fun to relate

[Bridge]
It's the room the sun and the sky
It's the room the sun and the sky

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment...
