[Verse 1: Brian Aubert]
So much for the light show
Pissing on while pissing off
Sucking in a smokescreen
Selling of a loose knit dream

[Bridge]

Folding up the skyline
Agreeing on a steep decline
Can't control this airplane
Being caught is just the same
Headed for a lowlife
Little lover’s so polite
Waking up the core needs
With smelling salts and faulty means

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Aubert]
Did the bones collide
Who let the bones collide
Why did the bones collide

[Chorus: Nikki Monninger]
It’s always the same way for me
Ending in the same way

[Verse 2: Brian Aubert]
So much for the showdown
Keeping up while keeping off
Choking on the cold feet
Rolling up the plastic sleeves

Can't control the slow ride
Little lover's so polite
Turning off the low light
Tell me did the bones collide
The bones collide, the bones collide
Little lover’s so polite
So polite, so polite
Turning off the low light

[Chorus: Nikki Monninger]
It’s always the same way for me
Blue turns soft with time
Broke remains, an everyday disguise
Ending in the same way. . .the same way (way)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Brian Aubert]
Tell me did the bones collide
The bones collide, the bones collide
Little lover’s so polite
So polite, so polite
