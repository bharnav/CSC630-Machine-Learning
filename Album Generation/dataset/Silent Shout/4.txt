[Verse 1]
I've got soul in my bones
Got a home, a dog and a man to call my own
And every month
I've got my period
To take care of
And to collect in blue tampons

Na na na
Na na na

[Verse 2]
I've got mace, pepper-spray
And some shoes that runs faster than a rapist rapes
What I need is chemical castrations, hope and godspeed

Na na na
Na na na

[Outro]
What I need is chemical castrations, hope and godspeed
