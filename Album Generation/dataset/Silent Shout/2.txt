[Verse 1]
Coming home after a long, long walk
Coming home after a dozen of walks
Coming home after a long, long war
Coming home after a dozen of wars

[Chorus]
We are out of wind
We have pockmarked chin
We have lots of water
We turn the other cheek and we win

[Verse 2]
One thousand stories and there's always more
We've been offered one more lap to go
In my hand I hold a key
It's dear to me because I know where it leads

[Chorus]
We are out of wind
We have pockmarked chin
We have all this water
We turn the other cheek with a grin
