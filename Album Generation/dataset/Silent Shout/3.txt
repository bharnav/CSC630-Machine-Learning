[Verse 1]
We came down from the north
Blue hands and a torch
Red wine and food for free
A possibility
We share our mother's health
It is what we've been dealt
What's in it for me
Fine, then I'll agree

[Pre-Chorus]
Trees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always near

[Pre-Chorus]
Trees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always near

[Chorus]
Say you like it
Say you need it
When you don't
Looking better
Shining brighter
Than you do

[Chorus]
Say you like it
Say you need it
When you don't
Looking better
Shining brighter
Than you do

[Chorus/Pre-Chorus]
Say you like it (Trees there will be)
Say you need it (Apples, fruits maybe)
When you don't (You know what I fear, the end is always near)
Looking better (Trees there will be)
Shining brighter (Apples, fruits maybe)
Than you do (You know what I fear, the end is always near)

[Chorus/Verse 1]
Say you like it (We came down from the north)
Say you need it (Blue hands and a torch)
When you don't (Red wine and food for free, a possibility)
Looking better (We share our mothers' health)
Shining brighter (It is what we've been dealt)
Than you do (What's in it for me, fine, then I'll agree)

[Chorus/Pre-Chorus]
Say you like it (Trees there will be)
Say you need it (Apples, fruits maybe)
When you don't (You know what I fear, the end is always near)
Looking better (Trees there will be)
Shining brighter (Apples, fruits maybe)
Than you do (You know what I fear, the end is always near)
