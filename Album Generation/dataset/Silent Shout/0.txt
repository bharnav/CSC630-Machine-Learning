[Verse 1]
I never knew this could happen to me
I know now fragility
I know there's people who I haven't told
I know of people who are getting old

[Verse 2]
Wish I could speak in just one sweep
What you are and what you mean to me
Instead I mumble randomly
You stand by and enlighten me

[Verse 3]
In a dream I lost my teeth again
Calling me woman and a half man
Yes in a dream all my teeth fell out
A cracked smile and a silent shout
A cracked smile and a silent shout

[Verse 4]
If I explain it once thoroughly
He'll have you later cause it's never free
You were at the gigantic spree
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me
