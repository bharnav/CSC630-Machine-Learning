[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Things you've done have set you back in time
I think about the way we lived our life was it yours or mine?
Why can't you tell me? (I can't)
I had a feeling (you'd crawl on your knees) to punish me

[Chorus 1: Lajon Witherspoon]
It's hard to keep you by my side
Haunted by the vision
Too ugly for one day, go live your life

[Verse 2: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Sick of all the ways I try to change to keep the promises we made
All over again
Can't you see
I'm gonna try to live again?
(Why can't) you give me a reason?
(Why can't you just see) misery (set us free?)

[Chorus 2: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
It's hard to keep you by my side
Haunted by the vision
Too ugly for one day
You tried to keep me far behind
Caught by indecision
Too ugly, if only you'd live your life (live it!)

[Bridge: Lajon Witherspoon]
Haunted by the vision
Haunted by the vision
Too ugly (Too ugly, too ugly)

[Chorus 3: Lajon Witherspoon]
It's hard to keep you by my side
Haunted by the vision
Too ugly for one day
You tried to keep me far behind
Caught by indecision
Too ugly, if only you'd live your life
