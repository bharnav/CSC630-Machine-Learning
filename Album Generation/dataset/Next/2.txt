Walk that crooked line
I see you try to be the one standing
In the middle of the circle
Try and try, you ask me to answer
All the time I give you a reason
Why you want me to show you, why?
Ask again, ask again, then you'll see
Why I wanna feel the same as you?
Ask again, ask again and I'll show you
The circle's broken down
I don't care if you blame me
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me
I don't care if you blame me
Now the circle is broken
I can feel you squirm
At the thought of my name
Stop walking around talking shit again
Will you remember my face when
I reach out and touch you?
You'll know why
I'll never be the same as you
Ask again, it's the end, you fuck
The circle's broken down
I don't care if you blame me
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me
I don't care if you blame me
Now the circle is broken
Walk that crooked line I see
Now it's my turn
The circle's broken down
The circle is broken
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me next
I don't care if you blame me
I just don't give a shit
