[Verse 1]
Feeling days with empty space
Wasting my time I've shown I've grown
The lies have caught up there's nothing left to show

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
I never had a chance to know you
Where did we go?
I never had a chance at all
To know you

[Chorus]
Staring in the face of a broken dream
(stand em up stand em up)
Knocking down all my shame
To save my name
I'm tired of seeing and sick of being on a living lie
(knocking down knocking down)
All the shots at my dream so I can breathe

[Verse 2]
Ask forgiveness but don't say please
Taste the shame that I've always known
Drown yourself in your own obscurity

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
I never had a chance to know you
Where did we go?
I never had a chance at all
To know you

[Chorus]
Staring in the face of a broken dream
(stand em up stand em up)
Knocking down all my shame to save my name
I'm tired of seeing and sick of being on a living lie
(knocking down knocking down)
All the shots at my dream so I can breathe

[Bridge]
Wait a sec I thought you said you had me pegged
Instead your left reeling from the smack
I swore I'd give to you if I could have
Just one fucking chance I'd convince you why

[Chorus]
Staring in the face of a broken dream
(stand em up stand em up)
Knocking down all my shame to save my name
I'm tired of seeing and sick of being on a living lie
(knocking down knocking down)
All the shots at my dream so I can breathe
Staring in the face of a broken dream
Knocking down all my shame to save my name
I'm tired of seeing and sick of being on a living lie
Knocking down all the shots at my dream
So I can breathe, yeah
