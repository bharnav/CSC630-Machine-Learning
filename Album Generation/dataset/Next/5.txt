[Verse 1]
Focus on a new way
A new day has begun for me
I thought that yesterday was a bad day
So I took my time to figure it out
What's the right way to live by me

So I'll find a reason why

[Chorus]
All my life I've been waiting for a chance like this
I've seen horizons fall before me
All my life I've been wishing for your promises
I always thought I'd be a failure
All my life, all my life I've been here
I've been here

[Verse 2]
Sorrow was the old way
I won't subdue the truth
From regrets and failure, I arise
To redefine all they expected of me
In the meantime, I hope you'll see
You never stood by me

And now you know the reason

[Chorus]
All my life I've been waiting for a chance like this
I've seen horizons fall before me
All my life I've been wishing for your promises
I always thought I'd be a failure
All my life, all my life I've been here
All my life I've been waiting for a chance like this
I've seen horizons fall before me
All my life I've been wishing for your promises
I always thought I'd be a failure
All my life, all my life I've been here
I've been here, I've been here
