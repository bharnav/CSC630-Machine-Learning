[Verse 1]
I heard your heartbeat
And my body grew so still
I looked into your mothers eyes
And I knew you were alive
I long to meet you
And show you all I know
Hand in hand with this new love
This life means so much more

[Chorus]
I know now what I hear
It's a new love that I feel
It's you that blessed us with this life
That we've waited for so long

[Verse 2]
Your life has changed me
I'm not the man I was before
You're in my head, my heart, my soul
You're always on my mind
My time to know you
Is quickly drawing near
But not as fast as my love grows
You've made me feel alive

[Chorus]
I know now what I hear
It's a new love that I feel
It's you that blessed us with this life
That we've waited for so long
I know now what I hear
It's a new love that I feel
It's you that blessed us with this life
That we've waited for so long

[Bridge]
Nice to see you
Welcome to this place that we call home
Life looks brighter now you're here

[Chorus]
I know now what I hear
It's a new love that I feel
It's you that blessed us with this life
That we've waited for so long
I know now what I hear
It's a new love that I feel
It's you that blessed us with this life
That we've waited for so long
We're so happy now
We're so happy now
You're here
