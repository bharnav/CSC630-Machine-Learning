[Intro: John Connolly & Morgan Rose]
Aah!
(Step down)
(Step down)

[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
(Step down) on the hand that keeps me down again
Will I drown again? (Will it ever end right now?)
I feel so overwhelmed (Somebody took it away!)

[Chorus 1: Lajon Witherspoon]
Deafening silence breaks the walls I built around me
The guilt that feeds my soul is here surrounding

[Verse 2: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
(I know now) that the man who holds me back again
Will go down again! (Will it ever end somehow?)
This, too shall pass and then, and then, (I know I'll get it back!)
(Somebody took it away!)

[Chorus 2: Lajon Witherspoon]
Deafening silence breaks the walls I built around me
The guilt that feeds my soul is here surrounding
Deafening silence breaks the walls I built around me
The guilt that feeds my soul is here surrounding

[Bridge: Lajon Witherspoon]
Silence… the silence kills me!
Overwhelming… the silence kills me!

[Chorus 2: Lajon Witherspoon]
Deafening silence breaks the walls I built around me
The guilt that feeds my soul is here surrounding
Deafening silence breaks the walls I built around me
The guilt that feeds my soul is here surrounding

[Outro: Morgan Rose]
Step down!
Step down!
