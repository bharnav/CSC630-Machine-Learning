[Verse 1]
(Not one thought for us but did you really think)
Something was lost but could it be found again
(Bite the hand that fed you all these fucking years)
You lie to my face
(But what I really wanna know)
Is how do you sleep at (night)
You're still a fucking disgrace

[Chorus]
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)

[Verse 2]
(Your words turn to ashes in your burning mouth)
Unheard your tongue lashes to spit em' out
(All along you tried to destroy me)
But look at you know
(And all I really wanna know)
Is do you believe your own (lies)
You pathetic disgrace

[Chorus]
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)

[Verse 3]
(For years I've swallowed my words...I am full
Watched you talk and act absurd you fool
Protected you now detesting you what the fuck
Did I ever expect of you write this song now
Your gone fuck you) this is the last time
(Fool) this is the last time (you piece of shit)
(Fool) this is the last time
(Fool...I don't need you)
(You left me) you'll always be dead to me

[Chorus]
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)
(This won't) be the first time
(I ever) wrote a song
(Without) you but this will be
(The last time I ever write about you)

[Outro]
(Fool) this is the last time
(You piece of shit) this is the last time
(Fuck you)
