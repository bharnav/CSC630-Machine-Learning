[Verse 1]
What was I searching for?
In God I trusted to heal all the open sores
Seeing an open door but dying inside before I was even born
Unlearning, seeing the clock stop turning

[Pre-Chorus]
My conscience breaks down

[Chorus]
See and believe it's me now, it's never over
To see and believe it's me now, it's never over

[Verse 2]
Now I'm holding tears of guilt from inside
Still I try to love
Wrong deceived and cursed out loud
I've earned them all and I'm not proud

[Pre-Chorus]
My conscience breaks down here and now
Give me a choice and stop all the noise

[Chorus]
See and believe it's me now, it's never over
To see and believe it's me now, it's never over
See and believe it's me now, it's never over
To see and believe it's me now, it's never over

[Bridge]
Now you just sit back and watch me
You never helped me, you never gave me a chance

[Chorus]
See and believe it's me now it's never over
To see and believe it's me now it's never over
To see and believe it's me now it's never over
To see and believe it's me now it's never over
