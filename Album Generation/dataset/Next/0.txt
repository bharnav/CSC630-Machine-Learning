[Intro: Morgan Rose]
Aah, feel it!

[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon Morgan Rose, & John Connolly]
Stop, drop, roll, get up, take a crack at me
(You look at me, you look at me!)
Like every other motherfucker that I've seen today
(You wanna hurt me like I've never been hurt right now)
Feel it (Now-stop) come again
(Now) feel it (right now!)

[Chorus: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Show me just one thing
To help me make the day stop moving (slowly!)
Show me the only thing that'll make you stop controlling

[Refrain: Morgan Rose]
(Then you'll see how, now)

[Verse 2: Lajon Witherspoon Morgan Rose, & John Connolly]
Give up every second for the one shot left in me
(You look at me and now you see)
How I took the real from you, fucker 'cause you had so much to say!
(You wanted me, you got me right here, right now)
Feel it (Now-stop) drop again
(Now) see it (right now)
I'm coming in!
(Why can't you justâ€¦)

[Chorus: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Show me just one thing
To help me make the day stop moving (slowly?)
Show me the only thing that'll make you stop controlling

[Bridge: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Why can't I just start over?
It's like I'm rolling over
Don't wanna be the one to bleed (not me!)
It's like I'm mourning over the death of me (no!)
It's like I'm rolling over
Not me, not me, not me, not me!
(Not!)

[Chorus: Lajon Witherspoon & Morgan Rose]
Show me just one thing
To help me make the day stop moving (slowly!)
Show me the only thing that'll make you stop controlling
