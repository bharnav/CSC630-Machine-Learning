Stick it in my face and let me see the look
As I watch the lump, slipping right down your throat
I wonder how it feels to know
I had you pinned down long ago
I wanna know why it went wrong
Why can't you see it my way
The world was never revolving around you
Now it's your way
You never thought anyone would desert you now
You get to walk alone again
Look up at me, look up at me
I took away the spoon
You gotta fend on your own
It's sad to watch you grow older
Try to change your colors
You disappointed me
I know you'll never see it my way
The world was never revolving around you
Now it's your way
You never thought anyone would desert you now
You get to walk alone
Watch the clock stop, your alone
Can't you see the damage that you've done
Why can't you see it my way
The world was never revolving around you
Now it's your way
You never thought anyone would desert you
See it my way
You never thought anyone would desert you now, now
Look up at me, look up at me
Look up at me, look up at me
Look up at me, look up at me
