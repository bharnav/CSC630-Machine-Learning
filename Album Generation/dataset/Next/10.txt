[Verse 1]
Lookin' out the window of pain
I see clearly now your face
Something so pure
Something I'm sure will be lost

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm staring at the shadows in red
Sends me chills now
I see clearly
Everything except your face

[Chorus]
I'm lonely, scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within
Now they begin
To be lonely, scared of the only
Thing I knew best so I thought
I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely

[Verse 2]
Shatters everything in my head
Consumes me
Blinded by one thing
Obsessed with the need to be loved

[Pre-Chorus]
Screams become whispers instead
Assuming
I know I'm losing all the things
Closest to me

[Chorus]
I'm lonely, scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within
Now they begin
To be lonely, scared of the only
Thing I knew best so I thought
I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely

[Bridge]
Angels swirl around me
So now I know, I'm not alone (I'm not alone)

[Chorus]
Only scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within
Now they begin
To be lonely, scared of the only
Thing I knew best so I thought
I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely
