[Verse 1]
Tell your boyfriend next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if bre would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my 'dro

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed man
You got to call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

[Verse 2]
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed man
You got to call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

[Verse 3]
I'm my own man so when will you learn
That you got a man but I got to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my homegrown
It's got me addicted, does more than any dick did

[Outro]
Yeah I can get mine and you get yours
Yeah I can get mine and you get yours
