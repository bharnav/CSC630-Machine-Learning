[Verse 1]
It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

[Chorus]
He gets fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Verse 2]
Regardless my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

[Chorus]
He is fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked to his soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in

[Outro]
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
