Too many fucked up years
And I can't hold her
Too many fucked up times
Have come my way
Too many teardrops yeah
I don't get it
Life moves on
If you want it to
Too many times I've felt
My heart was broken
Wasting time on someone
I don't get
But I've found someone
Who makes me better
Yeah I've found someone
Who makes me go

I wanna ride with her
In uncertain times
I wanna go where my thoughts
Can take a nap
And if the atom bomb should end us both
I'll be happy to go to the stars with you
