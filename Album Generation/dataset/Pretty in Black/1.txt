I love when you kiss me
And hold me tight
I love when you squeeze me
And teach me right

Your young love bewitch me
Seductress of bums
Oh young love invade me
While this dynamo hums

Too young to know
Nightmares of you
Caught in your dynamo
Of sexual intensions
Hold me
Tell me you care
Don't really understand
Why people stare

Now young love has faded
Have all gone to sleep
I'll rewire my lovebox
For my soul to keep

I've got no regrets though
Just fun at the time
I'll give back what's yours girl
I'll take back what's mine
