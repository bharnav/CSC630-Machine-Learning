Oh, now don't you never disappear
On a night where the moon hangs so low
Hold me amongst falling stars
On a night where the signal turns to go
Step away I'm off to the heavens
But my heart stays with you all the time

Oh, lies don't they ever ring true
Or is it just a means to be cruel
Oh, words when they hit you head on
Do you feel like a saint or a fool
Tell you what, I feel so enraged
My heart turns black all the time

Oh, now I'm racing like the Devil
And I think I'll just stay and hold on
Oh, you've seen the last of me
But my heart stays with you after I'm gone
Oh, yeah I feel no regret
Cause my heart stays with you all the time
Yeah, my heart stays with you all the time
