Here comes Mary
All dressed in black
Her heart so heavy
A love attack
Her dying cigarette in the rain

The gangs are out
And here comes Mary
They rave and shout
Her love to bury
Her dying cigarette in the rain

Go home and cry to your mama tonight
Go home and bury your love tonight

Young love dead
Lost forever
Young love dead
Lost forever
A dying cigarette in the rain

A shiny gun
To her head
Here comes Mary
Forever dead
A wet cigarette in the rain

Went home and cried to her mama tonight
Went home and buried her love tonight
Went home and cried to her mama tonight
Went out and killed herself tonight
