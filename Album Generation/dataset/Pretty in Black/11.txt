Come on let's go to where it's fun
I want a slice of L.A. sun
Whoa ho ho ho

Honey let's go
(Feels like you never have to)
Honey let's go
(Come down you don't really want to)
Honey let's go
(Stay out is all you need to)
Honey let's go
(Go to sleep you don't really want to)

So come along and pay the price
This ain't New York this tasty slice
Whoa ho ho ho

Take a minute listen to this town
Don't you ever feel you have to come
Take a minute she won't let you down

See you excited in her arms
L.A. and all her crazy charms
Whoa ho ho oh
