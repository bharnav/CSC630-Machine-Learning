Sleepwalking

Think you look good today
Pretty in black you got it down
I can't hold my breath so long
When you pass me by without a sound
You got something more to give
To girls who thought they'd never love
Love

Upon a summer's night
I flicked my cig and looked at you
Feels like it's always been
Pretty in black knows what to do

Sleepwalking

Then came that beautiful day
When our hearts collided in great sparks
I can't hold my breath so long
Something evil in our hearts
You gave all you had to give
Pretty in black is all you were
Were
