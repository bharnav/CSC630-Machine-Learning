Valentine I adore you
Her eyes tearing when I say I love you
My brass knuckles you know them well

The pale moon licks my valentine
Uh, uh, honey it's all mine
You'll always remember the very first time

Walking home
Hush, hush girl
Won't believe you today
And if you and me
Should ever go to hell
Come on, let's go right now
Come on, let's go right now

I got things to do
Can't wait around
Better times for you and me
But you're stuck in a rut
Another love affair
Another boy another scare

I can't feel a thing
But I'm sure you can
Warm summer's night red tan
Warm summer's night red tan
Warm summer's night red tan
