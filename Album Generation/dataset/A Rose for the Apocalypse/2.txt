All the misery you create
And all the pain you shape...
You are not to blame, my friend
Somebody filled your empty page

Shaped as we silently wept
Confined (as) transformation begins
The table was set and then we slept
As architects of time

So much grief behind the facade
And symptoms of certain demise
We drown in fragrant illusions
Illusions of right and wrong

We clench to a lustful saint
Digging graves on top of our lives
Stuffed with values til we choke
I guess we've reached the end of the rope

Through the mist, in the haze
The impending doom's upon us
The dividing blade of nature
And man severed our callow breath

The sun will set
On the blindfolded

The self-appointed guardians
Are scratching at my door
We kiss their venomous lips
And join the hallowed parade

Flying on paralyzed wings
Wondering who we should be
As tyranny becomes normality;
We hang at the end of the rope

Through the mist, in the haze
The impending doom's upon us
The dividing blade of nature
And man severed our callow breath

The sun will set
On the blindfolded
