I am so far away...
You see, I'm nothing without thee
I fall down, down to the ground
And all alone, I wish that I could go

Drown here with me
Hold me, save me

Are you there, beloved one?
I clench our whisper to the fading
Playing out the frozen dream
To watch me bleed in the sunrise
Watch me bleed in the sunrise

Break, can you see how I break
And still, my world remains the same
Don't die, please stay awhile
This night we'll learn how to fly

Snow is falling from ebon skies
And I see some peace in your eyes
Playing out the frozen dream
To watch me bleed in the sunrise
Watch me bleed in the sunrise

I can't go on with the quiet
To wait until we wake up
To be gone with the fire
I must go now

Are you there, beloved one?
Will you help me carry on
And lead me through the sunrise?
Lead me through the sunrise

I can't go on with the quiet
To wait until we wake up
To be gone with the fire
I must go now
