Greed in a cage obsolete
Paining colors of old
Victims of culture unfold
The world sighs once more

Look at us, our eyes are dead;
A gaze of incentives mislead
A deadlight, a whisper
Unearth your face in the mirror

My hope soon to be over...
Take me and lock me in
Throw away the key
I'm beyond all help
So kill me

Bleed in this cage of deceit
Then; die in the cold
This is the pain you withhold
When the world sighs once more

A treacherous spaun here fester
Holding the future hostage
And dancing restlessly and bare
With the phantom of time

Flies swarm as mouths open
And dead words are spoken
This room has a foul smell...
There's blood on the walls
And I need to break out

Look at us, our eyes are dead;
A gaze of incentives mislead
A deadlight, a whisper
Unearth your face in the mirror

My hope soon to be over....
Take me and lock me in
Throw away the key
I'm beyond all help
So kill me
