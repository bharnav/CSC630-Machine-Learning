The chorus of life has spoken;
Past has the child of reason
Fading through winters' lonely passage
We crawl at the feet of evolution

Some became kings and some became gods
And the rest just followed
Swallowed their freedom and joined the charade
We did not realize we all had lost
We locked the door and hid our shame
In this environment of fear

A hopeless scenario of apathy unleashed
A dreadful travesty captured and revealed ...
Shown under a cloak of loud indifference
Where the human stain kisses the pestilence

Gather for life's final hour
Cold hands reaching for the fire

Some became wolves and some became sheep
And eyes sown shut governed our frozen
Perspective of the world
We did not realize we all had lost;
We locked the door and hid our shame
In this environment of fear

A phantom dissonance;
The quiet storm erupts the eminence...
Of sickness born

A hopeless scenario of apathy unleashed
A dreadful travesty captured and revealed...
Shown under a cloak of loud indifference
Where the human stain kisses the pestilence
