A closing sanctuary in this shimmering night;
So tired, so restless under an ominous light

I found myself in thoughts of dying
Shivering in bitter dismay
I see you there; and I wonder why
The silence does not break

Away, please turn away
In my dreams you haunt me still
Come, please come my way
In my life I need you still

The morrow-winds shall blow no more
So many pale moons ago;
A flower of death did grow

A closing sanctuary in this shimmering night;
So tired, so restless under an ominous light

You find yourself in thoughts of dying
Shivering in bitter dismay
I see you there; and I wonder why
The silence does not break

Away, please turn away
In my dreams you haunt me still
Come, please come my way
In my life I need you still

To blossom in the deepest of black
And thus we die to flower again

"I keep your memory near my heart
My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star
Till long life over, I too depart
To the infinite night where perhaps you are"
(Lawrence Hope 1865-1904)

A rupture through the dirty glass
Cutting myself to behold another spring

So I became the exile, unable to (sustain) love
Smiling at death and unite with my solitude
To finally turn the blooded page

I pray these tears will end soon
But you just left my lying here
I wasn't ready for the world...
Still, I was thrown in there
