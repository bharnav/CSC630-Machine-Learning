Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It was gettin' kind of long
I coulda said it was in my way

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Yes, I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

But I'm not giving in an inch to fear
Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

Woo!

When I finally get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather

And I find a space inside to laugh
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel like I owe it to someone, yeah
