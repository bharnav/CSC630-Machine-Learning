Messenger, when have you seen my face ?
I will become, become like the wind
A tyrant in disguise
A muse upon our eyes
A rare extermination, non stop till extinction

When have you seen my face ?
I will reform, reform like the storm
No stop to my spreading
Unarmed die around me
Enter vicious circles
Feel it close upon you

You feel it consume us all, us
Our honor is out the window for tonight
Choke on leverage
You feel it consume us all,ours
Our honor is out the window for tonight
For tonight
For tonight

When have you seen my face ?
I will become - become like the stone
So strong to my standings
My skin cold and lonely
Feelings will mean nothing
I laugh at their coming
I'd taunt what they'd die for
I'd taunt what they'd die for

When you find yourself in that room not alone
You are surrounded
You will collide with your thoughts
Brand yourself a natural inside you know it (X2)

No one will save you today
This is a fight for your pride (X2)
