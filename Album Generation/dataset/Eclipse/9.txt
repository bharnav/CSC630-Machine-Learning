This is a war
And attack on us all

We all let it slide as our
Morals burn in it's wake

We all fly
Until the day that it strikes you
Leaves you broken inside

How could this be
Happening? We were like
Brothers

I won't forget you
Keep you with me
When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears

We will map everything
Structure all of the Lines

When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears

You were a king to us all
Gentle giant of the land

When you have life in
Your hands
Hold it tight
Grasp it with strong
Demand

Mount this earth and excel
With Passion and Power
