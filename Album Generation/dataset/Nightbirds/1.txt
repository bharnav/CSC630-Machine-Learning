Somebody somewhere
Has all the answers to the questions in our minds
Somebody somewhere
Has grown impatient with your reasons
And your crimes
And no more lies shall be told
And no more lives shall be sold
Who has the key?
Who will it be?
Is it you or me
Or an unborn child
Who is growing wild like a weed?

Somebody somewhere
Must lead us homeward to the truth in our hearts
Somebody somewhere
Will hear our cries for freedom if we never stop
And no more lies shall be told
And no more lives shall be sold
Who has the key?
Who will it be?
Is it you or me
Or an unborn child
Who is growing wild like a weed?

The writing on the wall
Says that he ain't right at all
He's a liar
And he'd be ten feet tall
If he wasn't so short and small
He'd be higher
And no more lies shall be told
And no more lives shall be sold
Who has the key?
Who will it be?
Is it you or me
Or an unborn child
Who is growing wild like a weed?

Be prepared!
He's coming back...
