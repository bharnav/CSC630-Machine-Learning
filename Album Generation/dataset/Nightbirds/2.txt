Are you lonely? (Lonely) Are you lonely? (Lonely)
Are you lonely, living in a city without a heart?
You've been runnin’ around counting teardrops
They said it was rain falling from the sky
You've been wondering why the rain never stops
Only tears your people cry
Who are lonely. (Lonely)
Are you lonely, living in a city without a heart?
Are you lonely, living in a city without a heart?

See the well-dressed preacher, living like a king
Hold the unwed mother, who's afraid to scream
See the hungry children, posing for a shot
Hear their mothers tell them, that’s all we've got
Ain't that lonely?
Ain't it lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Ain't it lonely? (Lonely)
Living in a city without a heart?
Who are lonely. (Lonely)
Are you lonely, living in a city without a heart?
Living in a city with a heart
Are you lonely? (Lonely) Are you hungry? (Hungry)
Are you lonely? (Lonely) Are you hungry? (Hungry)
Are you lonely? (Lonely) Are you hungry? (Hungry)
Are you lonely? (Lonely) Are you hungry? (Hungry)
Living in a city without a heart?
Living in a city without a heart?
