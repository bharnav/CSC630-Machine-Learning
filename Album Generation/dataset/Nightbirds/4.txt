Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher, higher, higher

Now I can tell your mother
Brought you up to be a brother
But now it's time to be a lover
And not just undercover
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher , higher, higher

Now you know I've got potential
Plus I'm very, very sensual
But instead of recognizing
You're always criticizing
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher, higher, higher

I make mistakes
Don't everyone?
That's just the breaks
For everyone there's a lesson to be learned
On the other side of the fence
And since you're such a doctor
And you got all the sense
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher, higher, higher

Now I can tell your mother
Brought you up to be a brother
But now it's time to be a lover
And not just undercover
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Life me up higher , higher, higher
