In a brand new sky
Each time I open my eyes
It's raining
Love could never be
The same for me
There's too much painin'
Too much!
Now I'm all alone
The painted smile has gone
I can't stop myself from saying
It's you!
You, ahh you, turn me on
Hey it's you,mmmm you,turn me on
Nooooooooooo!
Every time was new
When I was loving you
And believe me!
I come like the pouring rain
Each time you call my name
What a good feeling
It's no mystery
Like I need air too breathe
I can't stop myself from saying it's you

(Repeat chorus)
I come like the pouring rain
Each time you call my name
It's good what your doing, what your doing

(Repeat chorus)
I'm all alone
The painted smile has gone
I can't stop myself from saying it's you boy!

(Repeat chorus)
Fade out
