Nightbird fly by the light of the moon
Makes no difference if it's only a game
Released, relived, just for the day
It's a nightbird's way
She sees, she scores, she stores nothing away
And tomorrow's a dream, running out of steam
Leaving bits and pieces in her way
She lives the day before day

Nightbird's sky is never high enough
She only touches down
Just to fill her wings again
Laughing, crying, all the way
Hear the nightbird pray
She lives, she dies, she buys
What life gives away
And yesterday's a thought, unwillingly caught
In a mind where time has nothing to gain
She feeds the fire for the flame

Nightbirds fly
Fly by the light of the moon
