Space children, universal lovers
Space children, are there any others?
You'd better take a look if you're in doubt
You may be flying through the air
Wrapped up in how high you can go
And no one will be there to bring you down
Just stop -- take a look around
Space children, universal lovers
Space children, are there any others?
You'd better take some time and check it out
Check it out -- there's something for you to see
Check it out -- glowing balls of lightning speed
Check it out -- greater stars in galaxies
Check it out -- and they're waiting for you
Space children, universal lovers
Space children, are there any others?
You'd better take a look if you're in doubt
Reach a bit higher in your mind
One look isn't all you can see
And no one will be there to bring you down
Stop -- take a look around
Space children, universal lovers
Space children, are there any others?
You'd better take some time and check it out
