It took a long time to find this place;
It took a long time to see happy...
It took a long time to recognize your face;
It took a long time, running around...

It took a long time to find this place;
(For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life,)
It took a long time to see happy...
(For the first time in my life, I got a chance to see happy...)
It took a long time to recognize your face;
(For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life,)
It took a long time running around...
(For the first time in my life - running around...)

Nothing good comes easy, nothing makes it fast
No one ever made love overnight to last
So it took so many, many years to meet;
'Til we came together, I was incomplete...

Yes, I was! (Took a long time, took a long time,) Yeah! Yeah-heah-heah-heah... (Took a long time...)
(Took a long time, took a long time, took a long time...)

(It took a long time to find this place...)
Love won’t be divided - helped me find my space;
(It took a long time to see happy...)
Spirit over matter - felt my angel near!
(It took a long time to recognize your face...)
You’re the place I worship, you’re the place I’ll stay;
(It took a long time, running around...)
Wherever you will go, I’m gonna go your way...

It took a long time to find this place;
(For the first time in my life, I see the sun and moon shining bright,)
It took a long time to see happy...
(And my life looks so much better than it ever did before...)
It took a long time to recognize your face;
(And though my heart’s been broken time or two before this time,)
It took a long time running around...
(I’m sure, I got a chance to see happy...)

Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey... (Took a long time, took a long time, took a long time...)
(Took a long time, took a long time,) Yeah! (Took a long time...)

(It took a long time to find this place;)
For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life
(It took a long time to see happy...)
For the first time in my life, I got a chance to see happy...
(It took a long time to recognize your face,)
For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life
(It took a long time, running around...)
For the first time in my life, I got a chance to see happy...

It took a long time to find this place;
(For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life,)
It took a long time to see happy...
(For the first time in my life, I got a chance to see happy - I see happy...)
It took a lo-ho-ho, oh-ho-hong ti-i-i-ime to recognize...
(For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life,)
