There was Martha, standing there saying Hiawatha
I wonder can we make it off the road in time
So I can find what used to be mine all mine
And there was Mary, quit her job at the dairy
Took up the name Blackberry
And when it's down and feeling low
She can be the whole damn show
And there were others, like any ordinary mother's
Daughter trying to make it on her own
Far away from home
Far away from home

It's just an all girl band
Dealing with the facts and the pain
It's just an all girl band

And there was Linda, thought no lover ever win her
Kept her emotions bottled in her
But now it shows in her eye
Last  month went by very dry
And there were others, like any ordinary brother's
Sister trying to get further
And now it shows in her eyes
Life is just a do or die
And there's Beulah, did her thing on the cooler
Side of life, nobody used her
Much too cold inside
Much too bold to cry

It's just an all girl band
Dealing with the facts and the pain

It's just an all girl band
Dealing with the facts and the pain
It's just an all girl band
Dealing with the facts and the pain
It's just an all girl band
Dealing with the facts and the pain
