They started up the hill
With their young lives exploding still
They love to dream and run
They had the grass and the trees and the sun
They dreamed of the gold they'd find
At the top of the hill as they climbed
No one would ever doubt
Their spirit and strength would run out

But the hill was steep and long
They never thought they'd be wrong
It wasn't a hill at all
It was a mountain a thousand feet tall
But with the gold still in their thoughts
They used their young lives to climb and climb
By the time they got up to the peak
They were old and they were weak

There was no gold that they could find
It was all just in their minds
They had dreamed and they had loved
They found the grass and the trees and the sun
They said "What do we do now?"
Spend the rest of our lives climbing back down?
Or we can treasure what we find
And make it golden in our minds
