(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your W.A.N.D. in the air)
Time after time those fanatical minds
Try to rule all the world
Telling us all it's them
Who's in charge of it all
I've got a tricked out magic stick
That will make them all fall
We've got the power now
********ckers, it's where it belongs
You've got that right
(You've got the power in there)
You know that it is
(Waving your W.A.N.D. in the air)
They have their weapons
To solve all your questions
They don't know what it's for
(They don't know what it's for)
Why can't they see
That's not power, that's greed
To just want more and more?
(To just want more and more)
I got a plan and it's here in my hand
A baton made of light
We're the enforcers
The sorcerer's orphans
And we know why we fight
(And we know why we fight)
You've got that right
(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your W.A.N.D. in the air)
(You've got the power in there)
(You've got the power in there)
(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your W.A.N.D. in the air)
You've got that right
You know that it is
