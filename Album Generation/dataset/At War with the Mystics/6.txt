One, two
One two three four
You can turn it up even a little bit more
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it master-slaves me
It overtakes me, oh
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it wakes and bakes me
It overtakes me, oh
You know that it isn't real
You know that it isn't real
(You'll disappear in a black hole)
You know that it isn't real
(Floating out of control, oh wow)
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
Yeah
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it master-slaves me
It overtakes me, oh
You know that it isn't real
You know that it isn't real
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it wakes and bakes me
It overtakes me, oh
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh
And I'm there
Looking up at the sky
And I'm scared
Thinking 'bout the way that I
I don't understand
Anything at all
How it overtakes me
And I'm just so small
Do I stand a chance?
