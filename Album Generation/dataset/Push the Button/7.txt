In your eyes I can see that you're cracking up
In your eyes I can see that you've had enough
And it pains my head
In your eyes I can see that you're cracking up
In your eyes I can see that you fell in love
And it pains my head


In your eyes I can see
That you're cracking up
And it pains my head
What - if - all - that - was...


In your eyes I can see
That you fell in love
And it pains my head
What - if - all - that - was...


In your eyes I can see...

And it pains my head
What - if - all - that - was...
Coming to me
And it pains my head


In your eyes I can see...

And it pains my head
What - if - all - that - was...
Coming to me
And it pains my head

I'll end this love I'm in
I'll end this love I'm in this love
I'll end this love I'm in
I'll end this love I'm in this love

Should I walk, should I wait (turn the radio on, turn the radio on now)
What I found, love is in the hands of tomorrow
(Turn the radio on, turn the radio on now)
Should I walk, should I wait (turn the radio on, turn the radio on now)
What I found, love is in the hands of tomorrow
(Turn the radio on, turn the radio on now)

What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
What if it all were to change like I thought it would
