Onward the seer
Glass ships of fear, maruder's path
Gaze in her eyes
Sacred and wise, prophecy
Lost in her trance
In her eyes the flames dance, foreboding
Truth of her days
Black endless rays, shows the skryer

Damsel in chains
For love the bard reigns, destroyer
Skills surpass strength
Towers that quake, song of doom
Unsinkable stars
Bring powers at large, the day they mote
The shaking of Teir
Sonic psalm terrors, chains are freed

Come to me, champion
Your life has been sieged in me
Calling from distances
Yearning to be set free
