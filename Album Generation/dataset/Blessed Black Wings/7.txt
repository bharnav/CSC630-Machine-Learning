Drive the fist into your face
And blacken your eye
Unearthly sounds rumble guts
And stomp your insides

Riffs have come, your fate is sung
Don't even try
Blacks the set, kills all the rest
The slay masters fly

Enter in the battle ground
You've come to my time
Black arena, till the death
A game we play blind

You've stepped your bounds, beg for life
If we'd be so kind
Drive the fist into your face
And blacken your eyes
