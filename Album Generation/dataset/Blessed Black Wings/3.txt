Enter stoned paravex
Mother of the seekers
Cometh down hessian
To plunder the archaic tomb

Stolen ancient amulet
Black the hexed sarcophagus
Summoning the hound
The bringer of impending doom

Necromatic lunatics
Murder of the innocents
Stepping on the curse
Inflicting its beastious wounds

Undo the evil spell
Undig the graves demise
Unveiling the horror
The hair covered corpse now will lie
