Don't look ahead, there's stormy weather
Another roadblock in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay

Oh, we set our dreams to carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
On how to win what they have lost

[Hook]
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

So let them say we can't do better
Lay out the rules that we can't break
They wanna sit and watch you wither
Their legacy's too hard to take

Oh, we set our dreams to carry us
In the middle where we were one
Now we push right past to find out
On how to win what they have lost

[Hook]
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

In their heads, hedging their bets
In their eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks for them
You ask and they don't know
Oh tell me then
I turn my back while the odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled
But now the odds all stand beneath me

[Hook]
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

Oh, we set our dreams to carry us
If they dont fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
On how to win what they have lost

[Hook]
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

You were wrong, let me here what you say
Now here we come, can't stop, nothing in the way
You were wrong, let me here what you say
Now here we come, can't stop, nothing in the way
