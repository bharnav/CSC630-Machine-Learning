We ain't got no name
No we ain't got no name
We're rough I understand
Cause the status here to claim
Want it in my hand
Don't want it in my head
Searching for a win and a battle's on the way

Hustle make you high, high
Hustle make you low
Say I want, say I want
What I want they'll never know
Hustle make you high, high
Hustle make you low
All I know, all I know
All I got will make you go

[Hook]
Always still longing
We all want the fame (We all want it)
Oh, we want the fame (We all want it)
All the same, we're all the same. (We all want it)
We all want the fame (We all want it)
We all want the fame

We don't got no shame
No we don't got no shame
Aim up we got a plan
Say we never play their game
Keep our hands in the sand
So our hearts can't be mislead
We're herded through their lane
Holding close to what we said

Hustle make you high, high! Hustle get you low
Here it come. Hold it tight. Somehow we still let it go
Hustle make you high, high! Hustle get you low
I don't want, I don't want, Maybe just a little though

[Hook]
Always still longing
We all want the fame (We all want it)
Oh, we want the fame (We all want it)
All the same, we're all the same. (We all want it)
We all want the fame (We all want it)
We all want the fame

Oh, we really want the same you and I down low
Oh, we really want the fame fame!
Oh, we really want the same you and I how low
Low! Oh we don't go for fame fame!

[Hook]
Always still longing
We all want the fame (We all want it)
Oh, we want the fame (We all want it)
All the same, we're all the same. (We all want it)
We all want the fame (We all want it)
We all want the fame
Always still longing
We all want the fame (We all want it)
Oh, we want the fame (We all want it)
All the same, we're all the same. (We all want it)
We all want the fame (We all want it)
We all want the fame
