This time, I'll comfort
I saw you standing
And I am by your cage
I think you should wait now

I can hear you calling
I'm reaching you my hand
I can hear you now
I can hear you calling

[Hook]
And I say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Won't you calm down?
Won't you calm down?
And I say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey now
Won't you calm down?
Won't you calm down?
This isn't our parade

This time all we heard
Forever blending
I bridled all my rage
You won't make me buy that

And I hear you calling
No you won't understand
But I'm near you now
I can see you falling

[Hook]

Hey hey hey hey ya
Hey hey hey hey ya

[Hook]

This isn't our parade
