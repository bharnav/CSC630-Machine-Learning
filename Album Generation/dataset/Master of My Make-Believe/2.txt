[Hook]
You can make it alone, oh if you try
'Til the beat come home, I know you’ll sing it
You can make it alone, oh if you try
They’ll never see your fire 'til you make it out

​But are you with them? If not, let it go
You’re either gonna rock the boat or have what they’re handing out
Now you’re somewhere removed
They think you got a wire broke
Well what you hashing up?
Something that you wrote is gonna make a good life boat
Asylum for the torn
The rumbling below, said if not now you’ll never go
So while we wait it out

[Hook 2x]
You can make it alone, oh if you try
'Til the beat come home, I know you’ll sing it
You can make it alone, oh if you try
They’ll never see your fire 'til you make it out

It’s what you know but you can’t tell a soul just where it is
You let it go for fear they’ll turn it sour
You can see through the smoke, and though you know that something’s broke
You’re holding on for now
Aiming for the mark, how is it that your scars light up
Like flashlights in the dark?
Leading with the heart, you know your battle from the start
Don’t let it wear you down

[Hook 2x]
You can make it alone, oh if you try
'Til the beat come home, I know you’ll sing it
You can make it alone, oh if you try
They’ll never see your fire 'til you make it out

[Bridge]
Oh now you leave them alone (Ya ya yo)
I wanna see you're on your own (Ya ya yo)
You're on your own
You're on your own (Ya ya yo)
Oh na na (Ya ya yo)

[Hook 4x]
You can make it alone, oh if you try
'Til the beat come home, I know you’ll sing it
You can make it alone, oh if you try
They’ll never see your fire 'til you make it out
