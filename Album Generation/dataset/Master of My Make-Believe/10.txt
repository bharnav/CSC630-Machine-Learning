Tick-tock tock I shoot non-stop
Tip-toe don’t make you rock
What they say that’s not ‘nough
You long long what you know I got
Blah blah blah against the wall
So pee-wee cyber tall
Ring ring ring but when duty calls
Now now not word at all

Big mouth, big mouth
Quiet now, you've said enough
Got a big mouth, big mouth
My my my, you've said enough
What’s that you said

See the world, but watch it tear me up
See the world, but watch it tear me up
What’s that you said
See the world, but watch it tear me up

Deep down don’t know what you want
Dismount throw me up front
Be red but got no guts
You strong strong, why play debutant?
Ga, ga, ga, all slightly off
Not me, I’ll take the loss
See see see doesn’t it be off
Bomber wonder what's not lost

Big mouth, big mouth
Quiet now, you've said enough
Got a big mouth, big mouth
My my my, you've said enough
What’s that you said

[Hook x2]

You're everywhere I go, thinkin' that you know
You're everywhere I go, thinkin' that you know
You're everywhere I go, thinkin' that you know
Hey, go off, go you, go lead it if you know

[Hook]
