I've been looking for a fight
All the trouble that I know
Trying to loose the world inside
But it's got no place to go

Oh, I'm armed and dangerous
At the whim of my command
I've been searching for an angle
For a cause I can't defend

[Hook]
Oh take me home
Let me go all day
Just be here 'til I know
'Til I know that
The riot's gone, the riot's gone away

I've been haunted all my life
On the brink of something close
People know that I ain't right
Know I'm grappling with a ghost

Oh, I'm armed dangerous
And I'm deafened by the fray
Waiting for the day I'm able
And I set it on its way

[Hook]

Turn it up, turn it up, gonna get fucked up
I wanna make up, now
For all the things I saw that I can't control
Cut it out, cut it out, when it doesn't go
So, one day we wake up
So when we wish to go, we can zip and go now(?)

[Hook]

Hey, I heard it for a moment now
Hey, I hear you coming at me quiet
Hey, I heard it for a moment now
The riot's gone, the riot's gone
