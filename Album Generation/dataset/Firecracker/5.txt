I have come back to you broken
Take me home
And my body bears this trouble
Take me home
Take me back to my beginning
Before the hell of night set in
And I came to this border
Take me home

I have toured the endless starlight
Take me home
I have shattered under midnight
Take me home
There are no vultures in this clearing
Except the ones who brought me here
And I'll no longer feed them
Take me home

Kingdom come, their will was done
And now the earth is far away
From any kind of heaven
Hallowed be these frozen fields
And every single one of us
Still left in want of mercy
Take us home

Now the bells stand still and hollow
Take me home
And no one has come to mourn me
Take me home
Find me where I close my eyes
Beneath this sky of powerlines
And let me see us clearly
Take me home

Kingdom come, their will was done
And now the earth is far away
From any kind of heaven
Hallowed be these frozen fields
And every single one of us
Still left in want of mercy
Take us home...
