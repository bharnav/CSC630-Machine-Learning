Well it took a long time but you've finally worn out your smile
That's when I knew it
I'd run out of borrowed time
You always used to say that you could learn a lot through wasting time
And that if you look hard
You'll see yourself in your lovers eyes

Your time is near it won't be long
You've got to go when you're called upon
No light of day no sight of dawn
Don't turn around just walk right on

You came riding into town with a black and white five and ten
Said I'll be your captain
And take you back home again
It's your third time around but you know I'll get a second wind
But if we ever get there they'll be no one there to let us in

Your time is near it won't be long
You've got to go when you're called upon
You caught me dancing in the street last night
You walked right past me into the light

Packed up my souvenirs, tied my shoes, and sold my car
Yes I should have known it
I'd never get very far
Ever since we've met you've been a hungry and a restless child
You're just like your father
You know he's got a poison mind

Your time is near it won't be long
You've got to go when you're called upon
You said you and me we'd never will pretend
But my broken soul is never gonna mend
