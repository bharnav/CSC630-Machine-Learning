On the North side of town, where the cold winds always blow
Peoples faces are hard to see, noone that you know
And on the South side of town the bad ones are carrying guns
They are all the screaming and swearing, they even got the cops on the run

The city is full of lonley hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We got to get away, and make a brand new start
We got to get away, before it falls apart
You and me, you and me
We can still make it, yeah we got to leave!

On the West side of town they say the streets are lined with gold
But the all the peoples tongues are turing black from the lies they told
On the East side of town you can hear someones baby cryin
And when the kid grows up he?s going to turn into a mean old guy

The city is full of lonley hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We got to get away, and make a brand new start
We got to get away, before it falls apart
You and me, you and me
We can still make it, yeah we got to leave!
You and me, you and me
We can still make it, yeah we got to leave!

The city is full of lonley hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We got to get away, and make a brand new start
Got to get away, before it falls apart

The city is full of lonley hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We got to get away, and make a brand new start
Got to get away, before it falls apart
You and me, you and me
We can still make it, yeah we got to leave!
