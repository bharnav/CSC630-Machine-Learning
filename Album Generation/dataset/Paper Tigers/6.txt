It's in the atmosphere we breathe tonight
It's in the people that we meet
And in your eyes
Just like every other fool out there
We don't think were so unique
Such special freaks

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

I see the world light through a looking glass
I see the people walk right by, by, by
Like paper tigers roaming in the street
They stare right through me when we meet

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a city bus
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us
