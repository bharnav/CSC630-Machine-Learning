Running down the street I know
All too well and it feels like
I've been put under a spell
And I've tried hard to break it to make it
But since the day you put this poison in me
Broke into my life and you did the deed
Now I can settle down nowhere
Somehow I got lost out there

No no no no no no no
You lit my light and put it out girl
Left me dying on the floor
All alone, I'm nowhere, you're out there

And ever since the day this firefly
Started bugging me I really tried
To run away but I can't get nowhere
I'm stuck in here and I can't get out there
Get out there

Running down the street I know
All too well and it feels like
I've been put under a spell
And I've tried hard to break it to make it
But since the day you put this poison in me
Broke into my life and you did the deed
Now I can settle down nowhere
Somehow I got lost out there

No no no no no no no
You lit my light and put it out girl
Left me dying on the floor
All alone, I'm nowhere, you're out there
