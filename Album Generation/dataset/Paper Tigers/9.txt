The Wind is freezing all around
Dirty snow keeps falling down

Im still here and you are gone
The city is cold and winter's come

Ooh gone ooh gone all winter long
Ooh gone ooh gone all winter long

Im running down the icey streets
Trying to catch the last sun beam

Stumbling on my tired feet
Chasing down the summer street

Ooh gone ooh gone all winter long
Ooh gone ooh gone all winter long

The Wind is freezing all around
Dirty snow keeps falling down

Im still here and you are gone
The city is cold and winter's come

Ohh gone ohh gone all winter long
Ohh gone ohh gone all winter long

Ohh gone ohh gone all winter long
Ohh gone ohh gone all winter long
