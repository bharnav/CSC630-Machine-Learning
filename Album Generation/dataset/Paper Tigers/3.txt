[Verse 1]
Wind me up, put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center, and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue
But I'm all right

[Chorus]
Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out when you jerk it out

[Verse 2]
Shut up, hush your mouth
Can't you hear, you talk too loud?
No, I can't hear nothing because I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue
But that's okay

[Chorus]
Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out

[Outro]
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?
When you jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?
When you jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?
