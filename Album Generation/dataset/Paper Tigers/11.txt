You took the last train out into the night
You see the outside world its rushing by
There goes another town
And there's no turn around
Well the big bad city is just ahead
And just a million lives of the living dead
Will put the squeeze on you
So what you gonna do

Well you've bent your mind you've spent your life
And you've ended up with what
But you've gone way too far by now to turn around
Running fast and you're running blind
But the past is always close behind
A million leaves are falling to the ground
As the night turns to day
And the days fade away

All the silent people with empty eyes
Its like a drive in version of paradise
And you just can't wait
You gotta fill that play
You feel the morning rain at the break of day
Is gonna wash the sins of the night away

Well don't you understand
Its getting out of hand

Well you've bent your mind you've spent your life
And you've ended up with what
But you've gone way too far by now to turn around
Running fast and you're running blind
But the past is always close behind
A million leaves are falling to the ground
As the night turns to day
And the days fade away

You're running fast and you're running blind
But the past is always close behind
A million leaves are falling to the ground
Well you've bent your mind you've spent your life
And you've ended up with what
But you've gone way too far by now to turn around
Running fast and you're running blind
But the past is always close behind
A million leaves are falling to the ground
As the night turns to day
And the days fade away
