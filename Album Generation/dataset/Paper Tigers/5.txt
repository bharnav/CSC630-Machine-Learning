I see the lightning strike the tree
Its when my love moves away from me
I hear the thunder roaring by
The rivers of salty tears you cry
My heart is breaking down
And i like to arrange to see you again
I can't go on whithout you
So dont be too long 'couse my heart ain't strong
Ain't got no suger im my coffee
The times are hard and got the right cards
My cup is running over
My cup is cold yhea im really soo
My heart is breaking down
And i like to arrange to see you again
I can't go on whithout you
So dont be too long 'couse my heart ain't strong
I see the lightning strike the tree
Its when my love moves away from me
I hear the thunder roaring by
The rivers of salty tears you cry
My heart is breaking down
And i like to arrange to see you again
I can't go on whithout you
So dont be too long 'couse my heart ain't strong
My heart is breaking down
And i like to arrange to see you again
I can't go on whithout you
So dont be too long 'couse my heart ain't strong
