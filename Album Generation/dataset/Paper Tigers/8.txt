I didn't know the other day
But I guess I sure found out
All you wanted was another trophy for your shelf

There goes a sweet thing down the drain
Nothing new and nothing strange
It's the tiny little slip
In my life

Next so that I can sleep at night
In my mind no fuss or fight
And today's just another rainy April day

There's another sweet thing gone to waste
And there ain't no looking back
Just a tiny little slip
In my life so
There's another sweet thing gone to waste
And there ain't no looking back
Just a stupid little glitch
Just to throwaway

And you know
I ain't taking it all to heart
You just write me a little card
From wherever you're going

There goes a sweet thing down the drain
Nothing new and nothing strange
Just a tiny little slip
In my life so
There's another sweet thing gone to waste
And there ain't no looking back
Just a stupid little glitch
Just to throwaway

Just a throwaway
