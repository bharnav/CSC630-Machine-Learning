I, I need some young blood
Come Friday night
Bring on the big flood
Like September's coming on
Summer won't be back for long

Hey, let's start a big fire
Let's shake it up
Let's try to burn brighter
There's no one here to catch our fall
No one here to hear us call

Tonight, this dirty September night
We're stuck out here
You're caught in the starlight
Running through these empty streets
This city's built for you and me
Running through these empty streets
This city's built for you and me

I, I know that the road's long
It lingers on
And Lord knows it's uphill
Seems like you're not getting anywhere
You give up just before you're there
Seems like you're not getting anywhere
You give up just before you're there

Hey, don't lose your spirit
Feel all alone
But it's there if you need it
Seems like you're not getting anywhere
But don't give up you're almost there
Seems like you're not getting anywhere
But don't give up you're almost there
