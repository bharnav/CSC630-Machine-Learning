Come inside
Close the blinds
Let's hide away
We're gone

Lock the door
Let them fuss about
Could pretend
We're not home

Good and gone
On our own
All alone
Good and gone
On our own
All alone

Shut the lights
Shut the shades
Make it all go away
Let them scream and shout
We dont hear a thing
Out of reach
We're gone

Good and gone
On our own
All alone
Good and gone
On our own
All alone

Good and gone
On our own
All alone
Good and gone
On our own
All alone
