[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth

[Verse 2]
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth

[Chorus 2]
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope
Money for rope
Oooh oh

No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope

[Verse 3]
I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth

[Verse 4]
I've had enough of watching scenes
With schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoiac, prima-donnas

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth, now, now
Just give me some truth

[Chorus 3]
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of hope
It's money for dope
Money for rope

[Verse 1]
I'm sick to death of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now

[Verse 2]
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians

[Chorus 1]
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
All I want is the truth
