[Verse 1]
You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
You can comb your hair and look quite cute
You can hide your face behind a smile

[Chorus 1]
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside

[Verse 2]
You can wear a mask and paint your face
You can call yourself the human race
You can wear a collar and a tie

[Chorus 1]
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside

[Break]
Well now you know that your
Cat has nine lives
Nine lives to itself
But you only got one
And a dog's life ain't fun
Mamma take a look outside

[Chorus 2]
You can go to church and sing a hymn
You can judge me by the color of my skin
You can live a lie until you die

[Chorus 1]
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside

[Break]
Well now you know that your
Cat has nine lives
Nine lives to itself
But you only got one
And a dog's life ain't fun
Mamma take a look outside

[Chorus 2]
You can go to church and sing a hymn
You can judge me by the color of my skin
You can live a lie until you die

[Chorus 1][x3]
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
