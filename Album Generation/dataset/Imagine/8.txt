[Chorus 1]
How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 1]
How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus 2]
You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough

[Verse 2]
How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give
How can I give love when love is something I never had
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
