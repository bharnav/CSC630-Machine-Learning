[Verse 1]
I think I might be a fortune teller
I read your face just like a letter
The funny thing about forever
Is it comes with a side of never, never
I can't buy into what you're selling
And no, it's not that I don't want it
Believe me, I'd love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride
But you reek of indecision and I...

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you'll count down
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you'll burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
Right when I think we could be something
You'll go and let me down, let me down, oh

[Verse 2]
I am too smart to let you in here
But I'm just dumb enough to linger
I wanna think that you'll be different
Smoke and mirrors are so clever, clever
I'll pretend that things aren't so bad
That what you say will actually happen
I've been dying to open my eyes
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know

[Chorus]
You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you'll count down
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you'll burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
Right when I think we could be something
You'll go and let me down, let me down, oh

[Bridge]
I need you to be there when you say you're gonna be
(I care) I care too much and you care enough to leave
(I want) I want some place to rest my head without worrying
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair
It's not fair to me, 'cause I know, I know

[Chorus]
You're only gonna let me down (let me down)
When it counts, you'll count down
You're only gonna turn me out (you're only gonna turn me out)
As I burn, you'll burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
(You're only gonna make me feel so crazy)
Right when I think we could be something (we could be something)
You'll go and let me down (you'll go and let me down)
Let me down (let me down)
You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you'll count down
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you'll burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
Right when I think we could be something (we could be something)
You'll go and let me down, let me down, oh
