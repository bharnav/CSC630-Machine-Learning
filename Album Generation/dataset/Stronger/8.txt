[Verse 1]
Yeah, I stumbled into the night
We're touching, but I feel like you are still out of reach
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me
Sentimental feelings
Never get me anywhere
My heart continues beating
Is there anybody, anybody?

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
No, oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm combing through this desert of stone
These faces on these statues that I used to know
Wishing I was more than what my story has told
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening
Gotta keep it all together
Longing for a hand to hold
Keep clear of the shadows
Is there anybody, anybody?

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
No, oh

[Bridge]
Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know
Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone
Yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Hello
Is anybody listening? (hello)
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone (Won't somebody, won't somebody?)
Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone (Show me that I'm not alone)
No, oh
