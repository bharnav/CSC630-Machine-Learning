[Verse 1]
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?
'Cause the lights are on
But I'm never home
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude
'Cause I forgive you

[Chorus]
I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you
I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceilings falling in on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

[Verse 2]
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again?
If I hate you, what does that do?
So I breathe in and I count to ten
'Cause the lights are on
And I'm coming home
Yes, I am back with a new heart in my hand
'Cause I forgive you

[Chorus]
I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you
I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceilings falling in on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

[Bridge]
I forgive you
For every time that I cried
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me
That's right
Yeah, I forgive you

[Chorus]
I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you
I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceilings falling in on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you
