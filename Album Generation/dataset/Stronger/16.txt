[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson]
I can see the weight there in your eyes
I can feel the thorn in your side
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing fight
One way down a dead-end street
Broken glass underneath your feet
You think the day won't break the sunless night

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Kara DioGuardi]
The sun will rise
The sun will rise
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

[Verse 2: Kara DioGuardi]
I've been in stuck in a storm before
Felt the winds raging at my door
Couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't find a way out
Somehow the clouds disappeared
Somehow I made it here
Maybe just so you could hear me say

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Kara DioGuardi]
The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright (It'll be alright)
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

[Bridge: Kelly Clarkson & Kara DioGuardi]
And though you can't see it
So hard to believe it
Sometimes you just need a little faith (All you need's a little faith)
There's an answer to your prayer
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Kara DioGuardi]
The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise, yeah
The sun will rise
The sun will rise
It'll be alright
It'll be alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It'll be alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It'll be alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It'll be alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The sun will rise
