[Verse 1]
You say it's easier
Alone and undisturbed
You said yes and danced before
And got your feelings hurt
You say most days you're good
It's not so bad, this room
Why chance the rain today
Even though it's clear and sunny
And you fight it so hard
How to tell if it's real or not

[Chorus]
Take a breath and listen (listen)
Open up, stop wishing (wishing)
All that you've been missing (missing)
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearing (fearing)
All the walls you're building (building)
Take a chance, your reasons (reasons)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)

[Verse 2]
You start to sway again
Feeling good in your skin
You start to remember when
You didn't have to try
And then the glitter turns to dust
The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire
That burns like love
You can close your eyes, don't worry
I'll still be here in the morning

[Chorus]
Take a breath and listen (listen)
Open up, stop wishing (wishing)
All that you've been missing (missing)
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearing (fearing)
All the walls you're building (building)
Take a chance, your reasons (reasons)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)

[Bridge]
And they won't break us
And they can't get through
'Cause I'm gonna be here
Standing in front of you

[Chorus]
Take a breath and listen (listen)
Open up, stop wishing (wishing)
All that you've been missing (missing)
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearing (fearing)
All the walls you're building (building)
Take a chance, your reasons (reasons)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)
Standing in front of you (Standing in front of you)
