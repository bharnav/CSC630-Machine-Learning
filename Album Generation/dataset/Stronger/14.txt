[Verse 1]
When we're drivin' in your car
It's like I'm on my own, yeah
I can't ask you how you are
You're always on the phone, yeah
And when we kiss, I feel so empty
I really wish you knew what's been on my mind
You're gonna miss me, so get ready
I'm about to tell you why

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with you, I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, whoa
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, whoa, oh

[Verse 2]
When you look me in the eye
It's like you're far away, yeah
Some pretty legs go walking by
Your gaze is wandering, yeah
It's such a shame that you don't notice
The way that everybody's looking at me
Get off the train
This love is hopeless
Feelin' like I'm gonna sink

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with you, I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, whoa
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, whoa, oh

[Verse 3]
Well, here's something you don't know about me
When you pushed me out
I found something better, you'll see
While you weren't paying no attention to me
I found somebody who could treat me right

[Bridge]
When I'm with him, I'm not alone
It gets better every day
I hope you know, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
And it's never gonna change
I hope you know
When I'm with you, I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, whoa
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah, oh

[Outro]
I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone)
I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone)
