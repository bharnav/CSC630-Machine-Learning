[Verse 1]
Thick skin, soft touch
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough
Forgiving arms, the higher road
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough
You said I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough
But what you really mean is you're not good enough, you're not good enough
You can't deliver, so you turn it around

[Chorus]
You didn’t let me down
You didn’t tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart
You didn’t do it for me
I’m not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that
I’m not good enough, I’m not good enough

[Verse 2]
Strong hold, a fun ride
But rollercoasters are just na-na-na-not enough
I keep it in, you wear me out
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough
You said I’m just a sinkin' ship, I’m just a sinkin' ship
But what that really means is you can’t handle this, you can’t handle this
You couldn’t win, so you turn it around

[Chorus]
You didn’t let me down
You didn’t tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart
You didn’t do it for me
I’m not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that
I’m not good enough, I’m not good enough

[Bridge]
Your love feels different
It’s like a blow to the head with your compliments
Your love hurts deeper
Like a brick in the sea and I’m drowning with it

[Alternate Chorus]
You didn’t let me down
You didn’t tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart
You didn’t do it for me
I’m not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that
I’m not good enough, I’m not good enough
So understand that it means nothing when you say you love me
You love me, you love me (when you say you love me)
When you say you love me
You love me, you love me

[Chorus]
You didn’t let me down
You didn’t tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart
You didn’t do it for me
I’m not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You know that truth is that
You're not good enough, you're not good enough
