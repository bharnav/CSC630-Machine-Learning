[Verse 1]
Shaking your head like it's all wrong
Before you're here, you're already gone
And even with the light all around you
You're all alone in the dark

[Chorus]
You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down a lonely road
You say you just want love
But when it's close enough, you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart

[Verse 2]
Too many tears, too many falls
It's easier here behind these walls
But you don't have to walk in the shadows
Where life is so hard

[Chorus]
You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down a lonely road
You say you just want love
But when it's close enough, you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart
You're breaking your own heart

[Bridge]
It's not too late, I'm still right here
If only you'd let go of your fears

[Chorus]
You're breaking your own heart
Taking your own heart down a lonely road (down a lonely road)
You say you just want love
But when it's close enough, you just let it go (you just let it go, you just let it go)
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart

[Outro]
You're breaking your own heart
