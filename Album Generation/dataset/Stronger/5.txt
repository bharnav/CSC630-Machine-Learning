[Verse 1]
Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone

[Chorus]
I didn't get it's the first time
But don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein, but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

[Verse 2]
Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes, and now get out of my place
You say I'm crazy, and that we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me?

[Chorus]
I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein, but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

[Bridge]
All of your promises plus
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and then it leaves us
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all
You can stop wasting my time
Without you, I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure it out?
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Equals you, yeah

[Chorus]
I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein, but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

[Outro]
Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
And I may not be Einstein, but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
