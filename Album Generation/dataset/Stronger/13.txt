[Verse 1]
Never saw 'I Love You' as a trend
'Cause I don't really work like that
I mean what I say when it leaves my lips, oh
Nothin' you could say would change my heart
'Cause I don't really love like that
If you'd only let me in, I'd show ya
But I'm tired of working so hard

[Verse 2]
You keep pushin' me away
Tearin' down your walls
Is forcing me to break (break, break)
Don't know what to say
Will you ever let me in?
It's hard for me to pretend
So tell me what you wanna do
Tell me is there any other way (way)

[Chorus]
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue (tip of my tongue)
Tell me there's a reason to stay (stay)
Cause I'm about to get up and run (get up and run)
Better think about the words you say (say)
If you don't wanna end up alone (alone)
Tell me is there any room for me (me)
Cause when it's all said and done, babe
I'm tired of singing, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my...

[Verse 3]
Never confuse me with where you've been
'Cause I don't really work like that
If I'm holding you then I'm all in, in
I know you're scared, yeah, you've been burned
But I won't ever hurt you like that
If you'd take a chance, I'm not like them, them, them

[Verse 4]
Give and get nothing in return
You don't seem to care
You're not the only one who hurts
Tell me is there any other way

[Chorus]
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue (tip of my tongue)
Tell me there's a reason to stay (stay)
Cause I'm about to get up and run (get up and run)
Better think about the words you say (say)
If you don't wanna end up alone (alone)
Tell me is there any room for me (me)
'Cause when it's all said and done, babe
I'm tired of singing, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my, tip of my....

[Verse 5]
Why ya gotta pull away
Pull away and leave me hanging
Why ya gotta make me say
Don't make me say what you've been thinking all along

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
I'm about to get up and run

[Chorus]
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue (tip of my tongue)
Tell me there's a reason to stay (stay)
Cause I'm about to get up and run
Better think about the words you say (say)
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me (me)
'Cause when it's all said and done, babe
I'm tired of singing, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue, oh
Goodbye's on the tip of my...
