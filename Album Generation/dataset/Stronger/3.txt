[Verse 1]
Could you love somebody like that?
Could you attract someone like that?
Could you go where people can't see someone like me?
Could you do that?

[Chorus]
Would you face me?
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me?
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly

[Verse 2]
All I see are Stepford-like lives
Needles and knives, beautiful lies
Bringing out the green in your eyes
A perfect disguise for envy and pride

[Chorus]
Face me
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly

[Hook]
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me

[Chorus]
Face me
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly
Would you face me?
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me?
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly

[Hook]
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me (If you're hating me)
Do it honestly

[Hook]
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can
