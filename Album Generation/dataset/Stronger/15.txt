[Verse 1]
Any chance you get to play the worn-out pity card
Any opportunity to push my buttons hard
It's gettin' old, your "poor me" thoughts
Believe me, boy, when I say "so what?"
This broken record thing has got to stop
I'm losing interest in your pillow talk

[Pre-Chorus]
And oooh, it's not looking good
And oooh, I'm not in the mood
And oooh, I can't get through
To you, you

[Chorus]
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, and now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

[Verse 2]
Now your up in arms because I say we're not working out
You wonder if I loved you from the start, well, I'll tell you what
I knew a guy who changed my world
And then he grew into a little girl
This metamorphosis is just too much
You're crossing lines that I just can't let go of

[Pre-Chorus]
And oooh, it's not looking good
And oooh, I'm not in the mood
And oooh, I can't get through
To you, you

[Chorus]
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, and now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

[Hook]
And oooh, I'm sleeping with the enemy, oh-oh
And oooh, I'm counting sheep while you're in love
(While you're in love)

[Bridge]
I guess it's true that love can grow in different directions
I chose the high road and you chose to be a girl
Well, I know you're mad at me now
And it's all my fault somehow
Here comes my favorite part
You're so misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
And oooh, it's not looking good
And oooh, I'm not in the mood
And oooh, I can't get through
To you, you

[Chorus]
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it, 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, and now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

[Hook]
And oooh, I'm sleeping with the enemy, oh-oh
And oooh, I'm counting sheep while you're in love (you're in love)

[Outro]
You're such a girl about it
Don't be a girl about it
