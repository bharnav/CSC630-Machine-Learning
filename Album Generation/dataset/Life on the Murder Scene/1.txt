[Verse 1]
This night, walk the dead in a solitary style
And crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates

Way down, mark the grave
Where the search lights find us
Drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss
That made it so hard

[Verse 2]
Back home, off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun, staring down a loaded gun

So I won't stop dying, won't stop lying
If you want, Iâ€™ll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss
That made it so hard

[Bridge]
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss
That made it so hard

When will I miss you?
When will I miss you so far?
And the collision of your kiss
That made it so hard

[Outro]
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
Way down, way down
