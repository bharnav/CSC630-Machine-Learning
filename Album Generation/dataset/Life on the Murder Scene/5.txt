[Verse 1]
In the middle of a gunfight
In the center of a restaurant
They say
"Come with your arms raised high"

Well, they're never gonna get me
Like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war
Against your faith in me

Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer

[Chorus]
Now, but I can't, and I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can!

Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips, again

[Verse 2]
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate'sâ€‹ a killer
They make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?

Well, I miss my mom!
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope, if you dare?
Nobody knows all the trouble I've seen

[Chorus]
Now, but I can't, and I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can!

Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips, again

[Bridge]
To your room
What they ask of you
Will make you want to say, "So long"
Well, I don't remember, why remember you?

(Do you have the keys to the hotel?)
('Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire!)
(Fire!)

[Outro]
Life is but a dream for the dead
And well I, I won't go down by myself
But I'll go down with my friends

Now, now, now, now (I can't explain)
Now, now, now (I can't complain)
Now, now, yeah!
