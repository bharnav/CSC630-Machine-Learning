[Verse 1]
Stay out of the light
Or the photograph that I gave you
You can say a prayer if you need to
Or just get in line and I'll grieve you

Can I meet you, alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue to hide my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those

[Chorus]
Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

[Verse 2]
Touched by angels
Though, I fall out of grace
I did it all so, maybe
I'd live this, everyday

[Pre-Chorus]
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and those

[Chorus]
Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

[Interlude]
Down
And down we go
And down we go
And down we go
And we all fall down

I tried!
I tried!

And we'll all dance along
To the tune of your death
We'll love again, we'll laugh again
And it's better off, this way

[Bridge]
And never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead, now

And never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead, now

I tried
One more night, one more night
Well, I'm laughing out
Crying out, laugh out loud

I tried, well, I tried
Well, I tried
'Cause I tried, but I lied
I lied

I tried, I tried
I tried, well...

And we'll love again, we'll laugh again
We'll cry again, and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way, so much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed

[Outro]
And never again, and never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead, now
