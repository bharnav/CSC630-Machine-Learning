[Verse 1]
Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on
Just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight

[Verse 2]
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight

[Bridge]
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
