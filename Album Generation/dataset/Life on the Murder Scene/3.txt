[Verse 1]
Well, let's go back
To the middle of the day that starts it all
I can't begin to let you know
Just what I'm feeling

And now, the red ones make me fly
And the blue ones help me fall
And I think I'll blow my brains
Against the ceiling

And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
Fall on your tongue like pixie dust
Just think happy thoughts

[Chorus]
And we'll fly home, we'll fly home
You and I, we'll fly home, come on

[Verse 2]
Well now, I'm back
In the middle of the day that starts it all
I can't begin to let you know
Just what I'm feeling

And now, these red ones make me fly
And the blue ones help me fall
And I think I'll blow my brains
Against the ceiling, now

[Chorus]
We'll fly home
You and I, we'll fly home

[Post-Chorus]
Now honestly, that's what I said to her
What I said to her

[Outro]
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think ha... Whoo!
