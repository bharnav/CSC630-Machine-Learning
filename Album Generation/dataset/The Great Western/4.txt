I can see all the things that used to be there
So much I wish I was suspended in a different time
The radio waves are creeping along the corridor
At thirty-three a minute we'd better stay inside
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the devils behind
Run run, Romeo run
This is your last stand
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
The blue I wear is not so beautiful anymore
There's always something in my mind that I should've done
The radio waves are creeping along the corridor
At thirty-three a minute we'd better stay inside
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the devils behind
Run run, Romeo run
This is your last stand
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the devils behind
Run run, Romeo run
This is your last stand
Run run, Romeo run
Leave the demons behind
