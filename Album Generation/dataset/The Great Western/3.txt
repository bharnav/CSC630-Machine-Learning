I fall asleep to the national anthem
To break the spell of a winter night
For there is too much I could dream of
So turn off the TV and the lights
Because there's something coming
Round the bend
You could catch it on a tape cassette
It's no joke and it's no lie
It's salvation and it's coming fast
On Thursday morning we will raise the world
On Friday night we will pay the price
A Ford Capri and a telephone
On Saturday morning we will rule the world
All you need to start a bonfire
Is the story of a short and tragic life
And you could see it past the treetops
In the second hand daylight
Second hand daylight
Because there's something coming
Round the bend
You could catch it on a tape cassette
It's no joke and it's no lie
It's salvation and it's coming fast
On Thursday morning we will raise the world
On Friday night we will pay the price
A Ford Capri and a telephone
On Saturday morning we will rule the world
On Thursday morning we will raise the world
On Friday night we will pay the price
A Ford Capri and a telephone
On Saturday morning we will rule the world
