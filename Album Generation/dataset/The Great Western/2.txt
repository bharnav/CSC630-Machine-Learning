Bad boys and painkillers
Together like peas in a pod
Look at me just sticking around
The oxygen draining through my blood
Body crunched up and tight
Pounding and kicking me blind
Failing my body design
Digging trenches, looking for mines
(Bad boys and)
Looking for a new way out
(Painkillers)
Swollen hands looking for love
(Bad boys and)
Safe from harm is all I ask
(Painkillers)
Bad boys and painkillers
Drags me down so I'm miserable
Buy some time, I'm coming unstuck
Leave me here, I'll crawl my way back
Cold as statues with such grace
My head imprinted with your face
I long for longing in this place
It's no so hard with some patience
(Bad boys and)
Shaking like there's no way out
(Painkillers)
Swollen hands looking for love
(Bad boys and)
Safe from harm is all I ask
(Painkillers)
Never complain or explain
Never felt lucky or shame
Micro climates and acid baths
Epic human achievement at last
(Bad boys and)
Still shaking still shaking
(Painkillers)
Swollen hands looking for love
(Bad boys and)
Safe from harm is all I ask
(Painkillers)
