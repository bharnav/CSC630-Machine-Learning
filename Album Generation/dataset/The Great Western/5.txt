You're falling through the night and giving in to bad dreams
Where nothing is as it seems
There's still a long way to go
And the fading glorious night
Never seems to bring you home
You think that this is your road
There's still a long way to go
I can't give you an A to Z, there's some things I just can't show
Just try to disbelieve your eyes;
For this I surely know - there's a long way to go
Like laughing in the dark, to keep the dogs at bay;
No matter what you might see, there's still a long way to go
Cold comfort in the dawn, the dawn that brings you round, a pale light that you found, there's still a long way to go
I can't give you an A to Z, there's some things I just can't show
Just try to disbelieve your eyes;
For this I surely know - there's a long way to go
You're falling through the night and giving in to bad dreams, where nothing is as it seems
There's still a long way to go
