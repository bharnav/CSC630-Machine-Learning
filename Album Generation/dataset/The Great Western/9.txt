Please don't ever tell me
I really don't want to know
How it could have been different
If you would have had blue eyes
To draw the perfect circle
And so the perfect girl
You came out of the half light
Surrendering your peace of mind
You chose the wrong beginning
To stand a chance of coming first
And now the only payback
Is that everybody wants to know
How to draw the perfect circle
And be the perfect girl
You came out of the half light
Surrendering your peace of mind
To draw the perfect circle
And so the perfect girl
You came out of the half light
Surrendering your peace of mind
