We got directions but nowhere to go
So should we start to make our way back home
And forget the things we'll never know
We got directions but nowhere to go
Should we follow the sunset or
Trust the stars and follow the road
Which way to Kyffin, we don't know
We don't know which way to go
We'll paint ourselves a different life
We'll paint ourselves a different life
We'll paint ourselves a different life
The green and gray and red and white
The fading glow of this dark amber sky
He sits and prays for the light to die
To show the life hidden from our eyes
Where the sky is calling him
Where the light pours through his eyes
The sky hangs low and fakes its death
To share its memories one more time
We'll paint ourselves a different life
We'll paint ourselves a different life
We'll paint ourselves a different life
