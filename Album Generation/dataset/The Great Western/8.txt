The doorbell of your house still bears your name
But you'll never come back to this place
You were sitting on your steps yesterday again
I guess it's just an old neighbourhood thing
You don't have to pray, because he knows my name
So just remind yourself to say hello to the Pope
To say hello to the Pope
You can swear all you like but you're still such a beautiful girl
Especially when you walk through that door in your Sunday best
So just one more cigarette and a vodka for you
I'll even dance the old town music for you
You don't have to pray, because he knows my name
So just remind yourself to say hello to the Pope
To say hello to the Pope
You don't have to pray, because he knows my name
So just remind yourself to say hello to the Pope
To say hello to the Pope
