I hear you've got some love to give away
And maybe it never belonged to you
So how come you know my name?
So it's closing time again
For the lost souls on a pilgrimage
I think I've been here somewhere before
That's no way to tell a lie
That's no way to tell a lie
I hear you've got something to say
But first you need some people to say it to
Just before you rise from the dead
So we crawl from the water's edge
Returning to dip our heads again
I'm back to where it all began
That's no way to tell a lie
That's no way to tell a lie
Sha la la la la
That's no way to tell a lie
That's no way to tell a lie
I hear you've got something to say
But first you need some people to say it to
Just before you rise from the dead
Sha la la la la
