Out of the shadows and out of my dreams
Creatures of death rise you know what that means
From their grave they rise with power and lust
Destroy all mankind crushing bones to dust

I see a falcon high over the blue sky
Cruising in between the good and the bad
In this world where darkness reigns
Faith passion and religion only remains

Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls

There is no way out no rescue in sight
Thunder and lightning light up the night
Angels of darkness unleash the immortal
Turning the wheel of live up to the end

I see a falcon high over the blue sky
Cruising in between the good and the bad
In this world where darkness reigns
Faith passion and religion only remains

Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls

Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
Saints of the broken souls
