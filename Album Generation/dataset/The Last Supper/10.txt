Killers on the prowl
Hell is on earth
Slaughter everywhere
The world's getting worse
Fires in the sky
Blood runs forever
When children cry

Hundred days of genocide
One million people have left to die
The world stood still
No tears, no cry
Hundred days of genocide

Don't close your eyes
It's time to react
Dead bodies around
It's a bloody fact
Brother killed brother
We don't have to wait
Blood red skies
Stop the hate

Hundred days of genocide
One million people have left to die
The world stood still
No tears, no cry
Hundred days of genocide

Hundred days of genocide
One million people have left to die
The world stood still
No tears, no cry
Hundred days of genocide
