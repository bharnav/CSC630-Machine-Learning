[Verse 1: Steven]
Running hot into the night
[?]
My legs have failed
I can tell
Tearing through the place

[Chorus]
What the fuck am I doing here
Lying on the floor
What the fuck am I doing here
Lying face down on the floor

[Verse 2:Laura-Mary]
Where the hell has he gone
He said he won't be long
I can't tell him
How many times I've heard that one

[Interlude]
Backstreet
City
I'm Lost
Save Me
Backstreet
City
I'm Lost
Save Me

[Chorus]
What the fuck am I doing here
Lying on the floor
What the fuck am I doing here
Lying face down on the floor
