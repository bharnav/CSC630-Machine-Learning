Write a note on the back of your hand
These are so oyu can understand
And take good pride in what you have
The day is done, the day is gone again

I'll be waiting up at midnight
When you feel
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me

Blackened sky is closing in
Concrete wall, yet still and often spin
Cool breeze and cocktails fight
This bitter taste, this bitter wate of mine

I'll be waiting up at midnight
When you feel
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
Its the ghost you made of me
