Stop kicking against anyone, I can't listen
To the sound of myself, so close to the fear
Of what I already know
There's nothing left to learn
I just let it go

Fall backwards, it won't be long until it's over
I can cut a new wound on an old scar that I can't cover
I've been here before, it's where I don't belong
I just let it go

Faces that change, nothing responds
Night becomes short and days are long
Eyes wide away, a body that aches
Chasing the light leading to escape

Stop kicking against anyone, I can't listen
To the sound of myself, so close to the fear
Of what I already know
There's nothing left to learn
I just let it go

Fall backwards, it won't be long until it's over
I can cut a new wound on an old scar that I can't cover
I've been here before, it's where I don't belong
And I already know
There's nothing left to learn
