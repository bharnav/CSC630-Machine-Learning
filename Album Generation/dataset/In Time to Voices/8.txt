Quiet as a child hiding scared in the night
There's a ghost in this cage, that you can't escape

(Ooh)
Close to the break
(Ooh)
Can't keep away
(Ooh)
Caught as you wait

Stopped you breathing, treasure I'm keeping
Stolen from you, while you're sleeping

Slip into blue, as the nightmares come to you
The last thing you see, you can't turn away from me

(Ooh)
Close to the break
(Ooh)
Can't keep away
(Ooh)
Caught as you wait

Stopped you breathing, treasure I'm keeping
Stolen from you, while you're sleeping

Stopped you breathing, treasure I'm keeping
Stolen from you, while you're sleeping
