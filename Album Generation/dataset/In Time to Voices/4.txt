Rinsing his hands of gold
The fear that makes us old
Abused into control
The only thing he knows
Swallowing it down whole

He does what he is told
The lies that he's been sold
A place that feels alone
The silence and the drones
The only thing he knows

Bowing his head in sorrow
The light turns on
So won't you let me please forget?
They're watching close
So won't you let me please forget?
Let me please forget

His eyes showing defeat
A record on repeat
A soul that never sleeps
His heart grows old and weak
Decays and cannot keep
A choice in not to speak
It only makes it harder

The light turns on
So won't you let me please forget?
They're watching close
So won't you let me please forget?

A thousand hands are reaching out
A choir of voices to shake me down
A broken conscience
Won't you let me please forget?
Let me please forget
Let me please forget
Let me please forget
Let me please forget
