[Laura-Mary Carter]
Keep me from you, I don't want to be around anyone
You are free to let go
Follow, slowly

[Chorus]
Cold cold heart heart
Cold cold heart heart
Cold cold heart heart
Cold cold heart heart

[Steven Ansell]
Take a step out into the daylight
I don't wanna fight for it all
And forget it when we fall
You and I are moving the same way
I don't wanna fight for it all
And forget it when we fall

[Laura-Mary Carter]
I see your face
Look at me like I'm nothing
I believe in you
Something is happening

Cold cold heart heart
Cold cold heart heart

Take a step out into the daylight
I don't wanna fight for it all
And forget it when we fall
You and I are moving in the same way
I don't wanna fight for it all
And forget it when we fall

Cold cold heart heart
Cold cold heart heart

Take a step out into the daylight
I don't wanna fight for it all
And forget it when we fall
