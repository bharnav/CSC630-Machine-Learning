[Verse 1]
I feel locked away
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Crushing on my head are boulders
Made of lies and dust from all of us

[Pre Chorus]
What of the bonds we've made
That have started to fade?
We can't control the time
But right now I'll take
What I can get out of my life

[Chorus]
Medicate me again
So I fall away
Medicate me now
So I fall away

[Verse 2]
I feel torn between
Two different sides of an opinion
Don't know what state I've been in
Don't believe in trust, for only one of us

[Pre Chorus]

Chorus][2x]

[Outro]4x]
I never said that I didn't need you
Put down your arms
And wrap them both right around me
Right around me
