If you blink, you might miss it:
Population: 803
Five miles long, four miles wide: feels just right to me
Where a handshake still means something
An' the little man still counts
Water tastes like it's supposed to:
Yeah, folks 'round here are proud
To be from a little town

Well, the stars, they just seem brighter
An' the pace is nice an' slow
An' families stay together
God must be smilin' down here on little town

There's a cardboard lemonade stand at the end of our drive
For fifty cents, they'll fill you up:
He's seven an' she's five
An' in the Fall, there's Football Fridays:
We pack the kids an' we head out
We climb the stands and pass the band
And join the hometown crowd
An' scream for little town

Well, the stars, they just seem brighter
An' the pace is nice an' slow
An' families stay together
God must be smilin' down here on little town
Aren't you glad we settled down here in little town?

If you blink, you might miss it:
