She got a pair of pink an' purple high heeled-shoes
An' her baby-doll tee-shirt, says: "I got issues."
She got holes in her jeans in all the right places
Let's just say she's downright curvaceous

Aw, she's wild, wild, wild as my wildest dreams
Yeah, she's wild if you know what I mean
She's wild as the wild, wild west
An' here's the part I love the best:
That girl only gets wild with me
Hah, hah, hah, whoo

She loves to drop the top on her red VW
An' the truckers lookin' down, they love it too
She blows 'em a kiss just to get their air-horns blowin'
Any more than that, they'd never get to where they're goin'

She's wild, wild, wild as my wildest dreams
Yeah, she's wild if you know what I mean
She's wild as the wild, wild west
But here's the part I love the best:
That girl only gets wild with me
Whoo

Sunday picnic, summer afternoon
Red hot sun, spicy barbecue
Workin' up a sweat by the riverside
She says: "Let's get wet. It's skinny-dipping time."

She's wild, wild, wild as my wildest dreams
Yeah, she's wild if you know what I mean
She's wild as the wild, wild west
But here's the part I love the best:
That girl only gets wild with me
Yeah, that girl only gets wild with me
Whoo

Aw, she's wild, hmm, hmm
Wow, she's wild, ah hah
Ah hah hah
She wild
