All right
Oh, yeah

Everywhere I look lately, the only thing I see
Is some advertiser tellin' me what I'm supposed to be
At the movies, on my radio, on my TV screen
Someone sellin', someone's yellin':
It makes me want to scream
My brain is ringin': it's gettin' harder an' harder

To think through all this noise
I gotta get out of this noise
I can't even hear my own voice
It's drivin' me crazy
Will somebody save me?
I gotta turn down this noise

I need some peace an' quiet, just one minute to relax
All the information junkies keep distorting' all the facts
If you dial this toll-free number, it's all within your reach
We'll all be rich an' skinny
While we're dancin' on the beach
The truth is, we're laughing, but it's harder an' harder

To hear through all this noise
I gotta get out of this noise
I can't even hear my own voice
It's drivin' me crazy
Will somebody save me?
I gotta turn down this noise

Something keeps telling me
This ain't how it was meant to be
We gotta stop this noise
Hmm, mm, mm
I gotta turn down this noise
It's drivin' me crazy:

I'm drownin' in all this noise
I gotta get out of this noise
I can't even hear my own voice
It's drivin' me crazy
Will somebody save me?
I gotta turn down this noise
I gotta get out of this noise
Oh yeah
