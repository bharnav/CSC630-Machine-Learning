I never should have turned my head
To see some other lovely thing
Walkin', pretty, down the street
'Cause just about that time
My girl, she realised
Caught my eyes an' busted me
Now I'm back out in this bed I made
Face down in the dirt
Beggin' to get my baby back
You'd think I would have learned

It's just another day in the doghouse:
I better change my ways an' my wanderin' eyes
It's just another day in the doghouse
Thinkin' this is where this dog is prob'ly gonna die

I stumbled in at three a.m
After poker night with all my friends
She was waitin' up an' angry
I said: "Honey, I lost track of time
"Not to mention every dime
"I had on me."
Now I'm back out in the yard
Sad and all alone
If you find forgiveness in your heart
Just throw this boy a bone

It's just another day in the doghouse:
I better change my ways an' my wanderin' mind
It's just another day in the doghouse
Thinkin' this is where this dog is prob'ly gonna die
Yeah

Now I'm back out in this bed I made
Face down in the dirt
Beggin' to get my baby back
You'd think I would have learned

It's just another day in the doghouse:
I better change my ways an' my wanderin' eyes
It's just another day in the doghouse
Thinkin' this is where this dog is prob'ly gonna die

It's just another day, another day in the doghouse:
Ah, yeah
(Just another day in the doghouse.)
It's just another day, another day in the doghouse:
Oh, yeah
Just another day, yeah
