I am a man on a mission
I have a case of tunnel vision
Just 'cause I'm not talkin' don't mean that I'm not listenin'
You can say I suffer from a lifelong condition
You know I love you, baby, but try to understand
Iam a man: I'm your man

I am a man of passion
Maybe it's magic maybe it's a chemical reaction
All I know is you walk into a room:
There's a fire, deep inside me, burnin' just for you
You know I want you, baby, but try to understand
I am a man: (A man.)

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm weak, I'm strong
I'm all points in between
I don't say much, but when we touch
You know just what I mean
You know just what I mean

I am a man of conviction
I do believe in God but I wrestle with the devils of addiction
Sometimes I lie awake at night an' pray that you'll turn over
Wrap your arms around me tight, put your head on my shoulder
You know I need you, baby, but try to understand
I am a man: (A man.)

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm weak, I'm strong
I'm all points in between
I don't say much, but when we touch
You know just what I mean
You know just what I mean

I, I am a man

I, I am a man. (Ahh.)
I am your man
Baby, I am a man. (I am a man.)
Yes, I am
I am your man
I'm your man
Oh, I am your man
I'm your man
I'm your man
