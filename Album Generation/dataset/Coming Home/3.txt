You've been livin' way too long
In broken-promise land
Your dreams crushed an' scattered
Like a million grains of sand
I'd love to be your redemption
But I am just a man
I may never be a hero
But I'am a rock you can lean on

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'

I'll listen to your secret prayer
An' share your deepest wish;
Search for a hundred years
Just to find the perfect kiss
Of everything within my power
There's nothin' I won't give
To be that part of you an' your life
Oh, that takes what's wrong an' makes it right

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'

I may never be a hero
But I'm a rock you can lean on

If I don't love you like you deserve;
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin';
If I don't make your life
A Heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin'
Oh, I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'
