Ridin' restless under broken sky
Weary traveller, somethin' missin' inside
Always lookin' for a reason to turn around
Desperate for a little peace of mind
Just a little piece of what I left behind:
Well, I found it now: you're like coming home

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home;
You're like coming home, all right

Go head an' let your hair fall down
This wanderlust: it's gone now
I'm here in your arms; I'm safe from the road again
These are the days that can't be erased:
Baby, there isn't a better place;
You're like heaven: you're like coming home

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home;

You're that innocence, that serenity
That long-lost part of me

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
A midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes;
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home, yeah
You're like coming home;
Baby, like coming home;
You're like coming home
