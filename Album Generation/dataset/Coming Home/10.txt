Baby, come sit down beside me
I wanna hear all about your day
There was a pile-up on the interstate:
I'm sorry that I got home so late
I thought about you all the way home
Can we leave the TV off tonight, unplug the 'phone?

I just wanna love you more than anything else
More than life itself, more than ever, baby
I just wanna hold you, feel your breath on my skin
Again an' again an' again
Let's shut out the world an' dim all the lights:
Baby, tonight, I just wanna love you

We could light a couple a-candles
An' watch the shadows dance on the wall
While we're movin' thorugh the silence
To the rythmn of our own song
I don't wanna fall asleep tonight
Don't wanna think about tomorrow, baby

I just wanna love you more than anything else
More than life itself, more than ever, baby
I just wanna hold you, feel your breath on my skin
Again an' again an' again
Let's shut out the world an' dim all the lights:
Baby, tonight, I just wanna love you

I just wanna hold you, feel your breath on my skin
Again an' again an' again
Let's shut out the world an' dim all the lights:
Baby, tonight; baby, tonight, I just wanna love you
Ohhh
