When we punch out at four o'clock
Some of the boys down at the shop
Like to stop at Mojo's an' have a beer or two
They laugh an' make jokes at my expense
'Cause I go home instead of joinin' in
But I got other things I like to do, yes I do
Now I'm not sayin' I'm better than them
But where they're goin', I've already been

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me
Three little angels, cute as can be
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat
When the thunder rolls like thunder can
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

I used to drwam of bein' rich
While shovelling mud in a rain-soaked ditch
My boots had busted laces an' worn out soles
I used to hang out with the party crowd
An' drank more beer than the law allowed
But that feels like a whole other life ago
Sometimes we still live hand-to-mouth
But I got more blessin's than I count

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me
Three little angels, cute as can be
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat
When the thunder rolls like thunder can
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

It took some time an' a lot of pain
To fin'lly figure out
I can live without anything
Except what's in that house

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me
Three little angels, cute as can be
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat
When the thunder rolls like thunder can
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

(Got a good woman at home waitin' for me.)
Yeah, yeah, what's wrong with that
(Three little angels, cute as can be.)
Oh, oh, what's wrong with that?
(What's wrong with that?)
Someone tell me, whoo:
Absolutely nothin'!
