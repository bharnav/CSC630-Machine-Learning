Here I am again
Starin' at these unfamilar walls
Of some hotel so far from home
I try my best to sleep
I close my eyes but all this peace an' quiet
Just reminds me I'm alone
Let me hear your voice on the wind
Let me feel your touch on my skin

I never wanted you the way I want you now
I would give anything to see your arms reach out
I never hurt like this or felt the emptiness I feel inside
I never needed you like I need you tonight

All I think about
Is how sweet you looked standin' in the doorway
Smilin' while I brushed away your tears
An' all I dream about
Is the next time I can hold you
An' I can show you all the love I'm feelin' here
All I know, (All I know.)
Is I can't wait, (I can't wait.)
My body trembles, my heart aches

I never wanted you the way I want you now
I would give anything to see your arms reach out
I never hurt like this or felt the emptiness I feel inside
I never needed you like I need you tonight

I never wanted you the way I want you now
I would give anything to see your arms reach out
I never hurt like this or felt the emptiness I feel inside
I never needed you like I need you tonight
Mm, mmm
