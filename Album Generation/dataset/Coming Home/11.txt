When I go home this summer, I done made up my mind
Gonna do some things I wish I'd done once upon a time
Everybody in the whole place, they're gonna know my name
I'll blow in like a hurricane then blow out just the same

Paint scenes on the water-tower:
I got the paint an' I got the power
Do everything I wish I'd done back then
Better late than never, they say
Can't let the moment slip away
I'm gonna fin'lly take my chances
When I go home again
Whoo, hah

Call old Frankie Walker an' ask him if he might
Meet me at the drag strip an' he can eat my dust tonight
I'm gonna look up Laura What's-her-name an' I'll fin'lly make it clear
I studied every square inch of her legs, our junior year

Paint scenes on the water-tower:
I got the paint an' I got the power
Do everything I wish I'd done back then
Better late than never, they say
Can't let the moment slip away
I'm gonna fin'lly take my chances
When I go home again
Whoo

Everybody's got some things they wish they'd said or done
An' I'm gonna do my best to do 'em, every one

Gonna fin'lly tell my Mamma about that Friday night
Didn't trip or fall: I got that shiner in a fight
An' if I get my courage up, I might just spill the beans
An' tell her all the details 'bout the night I turned eighteen

Paint scenes on the water-tower:
I got the paint, I got the power
Do everything I wish I'd done back then
Better late than never, they say
Can't let the moment slip away
I'm gonna fin'lly take my chances
When I go home again
All right

When I go home again
Whoo, oh it's good to be back home.....again
