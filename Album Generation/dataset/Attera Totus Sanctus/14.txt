Vobiscum Satanas
Cursed Nazarene, impotent king
Behold great Satanas
As he drives his nails deeper
Into they hand

The weak fugitive, God eyes
Cries holy tears of blood
As the evil one
Presses down his crown of thorn

Ego vos benedictio
In nomine magni dei nostri Satanas
Ave Satanas
Ave domini inferni

Oh, crucified Nazarene
Where are your powers now?
When you are facing the greater force
Cursed Nazarene, impotent king
Behold thee, great Satanas
