When darkness is upon us and skies have turned to black
When blood rains from darkened skies and crying angels die
When the sun has burned its last rays and light no more remains
When tears of god stain the ground, the dark age has arrived

Lightning strikes the realm of light, angels burn in flames of fire
Storms from Hell embrace the skies as blackwinged hordes arrive
Infernal winds come forth from the abyss
Satan rides the winds of wrath across the blackened sky

The dawn no more rises across the darkened horizons
Light no more shines over the kingdom of damnation

When shadows rise upon the earh and the horned one has returned
When light has turned to darkness and heaven has been burned

Lighting strikes the realm of light, angels burn in flames of fire
Storms from hell embrace the skies as blackwinged hordes arrive
Infernal winds come forth from the byss
Satan rides the winds of wrath across the blackened sky

When firestorms consume the earth and ashes is what's left
Everlasting darkness forever shall remain
When the sun no more rises over the darkened horizons
When damnation is eternal, the dark age has arrived

The dawn no more rises across the darkened horizons
Light no more shines, the dark age has arrived
