[Verse 1]
From your chair, my narrative tonight
Is your dickless cousin, brother, father, pet, friend, husband or wife
A lavender scent, a bone orchard of hearts seems to surround you
As you stare each gift horse straight in the mouth
Stare my arrow down
I was invited, I was called out to watch you frolic and dance

[Chorus]
Oh, I buried my head in my hands
I buried my heart there in the sand
I was cocked, blocked, cured and charmed
I was ferociously put upon until it was clear
I should not keep on, I'll just creep on creepin' on
Yes I will, I'll not keep on, I'll just creep on creepin' on

[Verse 2]
Failed manifestation to levitate your bed
And move her hair on to my chest, exposing her neck
And I tear her through a twin into my arms
And my stomach dropped as you shifted me off to stop
The ectoplasm coiled like a hovering halo of smoke
And our beloved invention is conjured each night in your throat

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Do I try one more time?
No, I'll not keep on, I'll just creep on creepin' on
