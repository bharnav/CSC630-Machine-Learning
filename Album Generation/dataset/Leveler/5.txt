I’ve thrown away all of my outside distractions
I’m diving headfirst to chase a dream that I won’t let go

It’s worthless - a waste of time
This goal is out of reach, you better fall back in line

This is what I need. You are what I need
I need motivation to prove you wrong, and I will prove you wrong

What makes you think that you are different?
How can you chase these dreams? They’ve become a chore

I know I’m close. I’m almost there
Just a little more, and I will prevail
Through what you call "ignorance", I will prevail

Now I’ve chased this dream to do what I love
And I wouldn’t trade it for a thing
Now I’ve chased this dream and I made it out alive
I wouldn’t trade it for a thing
I threw away what naysayers say
And started on a race that I had to win for myself
And you proved me wrong, you proved me wrong
All I’ve learned is teaching me more. All I know is driving me on

All I’ve learned is teaching me more. All I know is driving me on
