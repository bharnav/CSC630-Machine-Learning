You stand up pridefully in front of thousands
Screaming words of justice and truth
You wear a mask of this city’s hero. You are the pretender
You fake, you fake, but fortunate
You wear a mask of this city’s hero
You fake, you fake, but fortunate. You are the pretender

Your weak speech lines your gums with gold teeth
Yet you don’t believe in a word that you say
You’re speaking shackles to life
Self-righteousness is your demise

You coward. Draw a line in the sand
You bastard. Look at what you have become
Your breath it reeks of perversion
Your tongue is just like a whore
Full of vulgarity, full of the disease

Where is the life in the life you live? You are the poor millionaire
Where is the life in the life you live? A lifeless empire, a lifeless heir

Your crown is like a lion’s mouth devouring you from the inside out
Turn away before there’s nothing left. It’s life or death

Tyrant. Ring the bells of repentance
Awakening from your deathbed
Tyrant. Ring the bells of repentance
Awaken from your deathbed
Oh tyrant. Oh tyrant

You stand up pridefully in front of thousands
Screaming words of justice and truth
You wear a mask of this city’s hero. You are the pretender

Coward. Coward
Where is the life in the life you live?
Where is the life in the life you live?
Life you live (Live, Live, Live)
