Closed off, we wake from the dusk. (the dusk)
Only to step out into open air
Just to see the same clouds opening. (Yahh)
Into open air, only to step out

If this is a place people dream of (people dream of)
Insomnia is the only cure - the only antidote
You’ve been deceived into thinking this is the perfect life
It’s an illusion to your perception
You’ve been deceived

I wish time was still ancient so I could bridge the gap
(bridge the gap)
Between here, between there, between you and I
(between you and I)
Frustration is setting in. I am seeing red. (I’m seeing red)
This blessing is a curse. I am seeing red. (I am seeing red)

Counting all the things that I took for granted
Counting down the days
Watching the clock as it just stands still
To just sail away, sail away, sail away
Waiting for the morning that takes me home
That takes me home, to take me home

This bittersweet dream that I dreamt
Oh Pangaea

All of this is worth every penny
Every cent I would give back
Everything just to be back, back home

This is a bittersweet dream I’ve dreamt
Oh Pangaea, where have you gone?
I’m at all four corners of this world
Oh Pangaea, what have you done?
This is a bittersweet dream I’ve dreamt
Oh Pangaea, where have you gone?
I’m at all four corners of this world
Pangaea, what have you done?
