Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our buildings rival the heavens
Our bridges span the seas
Ingenuity is so cunning
Innovation is not ours
Creativity is a luxury
We build with our hands what we have in our hearts

Fight the avalanche, you'll be buried every time
We run and run and run, keep falling behind
Fight the avalanche, you'll be buried every time
We run and run and run, always last in line

Before lines were lines, before time was time
The Author wrote a story in the sky  (little we know)
Little do we know, we have only what we're given
Light up the sky  (Light up the sky)
We're going where no man has ever gone
Little do we know we have only what we're given
Light up the sky, we're going where no man's forgotten
All you are is all we want, It burns inside us all
We're finding heart in giving soul
We're walking home into thin air singing

Woah oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh

We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Many walk away, but we stand firm
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Our decisions affect our descendants
We are justice fighters with faces of fire

Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history
Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history
