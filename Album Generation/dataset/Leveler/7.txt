Show our eyes true color
We want to hear the trumpet roar
We want to hear the trumpet roar
With words that trample the pagan’s cavalry
Pummel the darkness with the light

Hand in hand, side by side, we will march with full force
With your words, from our throats, we will march with full force

Words that will shake the earth and boil the seas
Trample the bones of the living
Living dead as they roam the streets alone
Roam the streets alone
We go marching on. Let the trumpets roar. (Go)

I’m the harbinger, not the author of these timeless words
Led by the Comforter I sing to you
And if my throat were to be cut from ear to ear
I hope that these words
Would carry on in these songs that I pray you sing one day
We sing for you. We sing for you. We sing for you. We sing for you
We sing for you. We sing for you. We sing for you. We sing for you
