You have become a malicious liar that breathes for attention
Playing charades, wearing the head of a lamb
My days consumed by nights of you

Howling at the moon as if you were wounded, but no
You’re the one showing teeth
Ready to feast on newborn beginnings as you cry wolf

Howling at the moon, but no, you’re showing teeth
We know
You’re ready to feast on newborn beginnings as you cry wolf

8,064 hours of conspiracies
200 months which brings me
17 years of lies and betrayal

The truth. Never seen. Never told. Never known
You’ll never tell the truth. Never seen. Never heard
You’ll never tell the truth
All I want is the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth. (Oh)

Queen of hearts. Queen of hearts
But you are the deceiver with a lying tongue and matching lips
My heart thirsts for vengeance
But my Father has thought me forgiveness
If I had not decided to follow him

I’d devour you like a lion leaving your bones out to dry
I’d put you through the same hell you put me through
Pouring out conspiracies and lies (and lies)
But this world will remember me for all that I’ve done and all that I’ll be

The victim in me is dead, I am reborn
The victim in me is dead, I am reborn
So even though you call me self-righteous
And call my beloved treacherous
There is one thing to take away

Leveler, make level the road for the righteous
Leveler, make level the road for the righteous

I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me
He will show you true love, Love
I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me
He will show you true love, love, love
I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me
He will show you true love, love, love
