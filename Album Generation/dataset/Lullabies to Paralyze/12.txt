[Verse 1]
I don't mean to make obscene
But even the mob know what the hell I mean
The knot is tight, on my blindfold
I got my flesh full of blood
I hate rock n roll
Some think too much, then come too soon
I just curse the sun so I can howl at the moon

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna love you no more
Don't wanna love you less
I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress
What's the fucking difference, we all gonna die
You gonna do something killer?
Come on give it a try

[Verse 3]
Got no big plans but a good idea
Let's put this town in my rear-view mirror
Yeah, I got enemies (fuck 'em), but they don't know
They won't get no glory on that side of the hole

[Verse 4]
We are united, by drifting alone
This is the army of none, got no flag, got no home
Just witches & scabs, an awful mess
I confess... (I confe...)
Let's do it again
