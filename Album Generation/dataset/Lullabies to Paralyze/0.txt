[Verse 1]
Where O where have you been my love?
Where O where can you be?
It's been so long, since the moon has gone
O what a wreck you've made me
Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?
Until the return of my love
This lullaby
My hope is on the horizon
Every face, it's your eyes I can see
I plead and pray though each night & day
Our embrace is only a dream
As sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby
