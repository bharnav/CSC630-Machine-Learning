[Verse 1]
It's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high I run in place
Only a line we separate
So

[Chorus]
I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

[Verse 2]
You're the only thing I've got
I can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace
So

[Chorus]
I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

[Chorus]
I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

Hurry up, and wait forever

[Chorus]
I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

[Outro]
I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it
Now
