[Verse 1]
You wanna know why you feel so hollow
Because you are
You're missing out, well, if you say so
Then you're missing out

[Chorus]
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

[Verse 2]
You wanna know
Just how long you can hide from
What you are
Not very long
I have been lost
Down every road I follow
Out in the dark
On my way home

[Chorus x2]
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

[Bridge]
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?

[Chorus x2]
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
