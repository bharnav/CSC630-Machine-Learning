[Verse 1]
I slipped
Didn't mean, didn't mean to do it that way
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow?
(Shit...) I'm gone today

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Come lets play along and let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me
Don't matter to you

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah

[Chorus 1]
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself

[Verse 3]
Self inflicted wound, your gift
Impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your wake

Oh yeah
(It hurts) so bad
(It must) oh yeah

[Chorus 2]
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
To kill yourself
