[Intro]
And you know this...

[Verse 1]
I've got wine & so do you
Mine came with a cork
I wish yours did too

Everyone
Just loves you so
Well hurray!
Now you know where to go

[Chorus 1]
In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where I came
In my head you're all brand new
I just didn't want what you gave
In my head you're all brand new
Go and find yourself another slave

[Post-Chorus]
Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
There you are
Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
There you are
Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu
There you are
Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu

[Verse 2]
Ooohh you're so in love, just like Juliet
Well guess what?
That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get

Tears from the sky
In pools of pain
Well baby tonight
I'm gonna go and dance in the rain

[Chorus 2]
In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where I came
In my head you're all brand new
Take that broken pussy elsewhere
In my head you're all brand new
Save it, baby, I don't care
