[Verse 1]
When you say
"It's dead and gone."
Yes I know
You're wrong
Cut and slash
Sharpest knife
It won't die

Poison cup
Drank it up
It won't die

No fire, no gun
No rope, no stone
It won't die

[Chorus 1]
Why you got to shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place
Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Not goin' to spend another night
In your bed
In your bed

[Verse 2]
Laws of men are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love, so good
Love, so bad
It won't die

Some talk too long
They know it all
Well I just smile and move on

Words ain't free
Like you and me
I don't mind

[Chorus 2]
Why did you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leaving cause it's just
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
