[Verse 1]
I could tell by the look in her eyes
Maybe I'm just another one of her lies
'Cause I know we've been through this so many times
Still I'm here though I'm burning up inside

[Chorus]
And I try to walk away but I keep telling myself
She's the one for me
'Cause her love is so contagious
It keeps pulling me in
We were meant to be
And I can't leave her so
We're right back in the water
Oh we're right back in the water

[Verse 2]
I could tell by the look in her eyes
All my friends keep telling me now's the time
But I know
Just the notion saying goodbye
It breaks my heart, it tears me up inside

[Chorus]
And I try to walk away but I keep telling myself
She's the one for me
'Cause her love is so contagious
It keeps pulling me in
We were meant to be
And I can't leave her so

[Bridge]
We're right back singing
Ooooh, ooooh c'mon, ooooh, ooooh c'mon
I wanna walk by but there is something that won't let me singing
Ooooh, ooooh c'mon, ooooh, ooooh c'mon
She's the one that's always there
I could tell by the look in her eyes
Maybe I'm just another one of her lies

[Chorus]
And I try to walk away but I keep telling myself
She's the one for me
'Cause her love is so contagious
It keeps pulling me in
We were meant to be
And I can't leave her so
We're right back in the water
Oooh we're right back in the water yeah
