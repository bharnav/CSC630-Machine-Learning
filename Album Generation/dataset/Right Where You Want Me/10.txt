[Verse 1]
I said don't do it babe
Said it ain't worth it babe
But you did it anyway
Four or five drinks and you were on your way
September 1st, 2003
It took the life right out of me
Hung up the phone
Raced out the door
Broken
Tried to believe that it wasn't true
But in my heart I always knew
That being the life of the party would catch up to you
Your family was waiting and crying for three damn hours

[Chorus]
I said don't do it babe
Said it ain't worth it babe
But you did it anyway
Four or five drinks and you were on your way
Everythings cool on the straight away
But you took that turn doing eighty-five in a thirty-five
Why babe?

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm home I pass that road
Driving alone and the street feels cold
Seeing your face yeah it's haunting me
My mind goes crazy tryin' to figure out
Just where you would be four years from now
And what you were thinking when the lights came down
The Doctors were trying to save you for three damn hours

[Chorus]
Who ever said that life was fair
When you live without a care
When you're invincible
When you're invincible
When you're invincible
Who thinks about leaving when you're livin'

[Chorus]
