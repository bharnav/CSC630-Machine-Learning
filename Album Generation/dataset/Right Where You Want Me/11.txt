[Verse 1]
You just turned eighteen a week ago
You want to learn what you don't know
You're grown up don't need permission
Find out what you've been missin'
It took some time but now you really want to figure out
Just what it is that all the other girls are talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
And it's driving you're mama crazy
'Cause daddy's little girl is now my baby
I think you're ready, baby
I think you're ready, baby
Come on and get it, baby
I think you're
I think you're

[Verse 2]
You've always followed all the rules
Done just what you're supposed to
Stick the key in the ignition and light it up
Have a taste of what it's like to be old enough
Move your body baby let me see you work it
Looking at you make me wanna blow a circuit

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's driving you're mama crazy
'Cause daddy's little girl is now my baby

[Chorus]
I think you're ready, baby
I think you're ready, baby
Come on and get it, baby
I think you're, I think you're
I think you're ready, baby
Daddy's little girl is ready baby, yeah
I think you're ready, baby
I think you're, I think you're

[Bridge]
Tell me girl if I'm mistaken
All the signals that you're makin'
Brought you to the road you're takin'
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, let's go
Girl shake what your mama gave you
Shake it like you're trying to break it
'Bout to start an earthquake

[Chorus]
I think you're ready, baby
I think you're ready, baby
Come on and get it, baby
I think you're, I think you're
I think you're ready, baby
Daddy's little girl is ready baby, yeah
I think you're ready, baby
I think you're, I think you're
