[Verse 1]
I shouldn't love you, but I want to
I just can't turn away
I shouldn't see you, but I can't move
I can't look away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know how to be fine when I'm not
'Cause I don't know how to make the feeling stop

[Chorus]
Just so you know
This feeling's takin' control
Of me and I can't help it
I won't sit around
I can't let him win now
Thought you should know
I've tried my best to let go
Of you but I don't want to
I just gotta say it all before I go
Just so you know

[Verse 2]
It's gettin' hard to
Be around you
There's so much I can't say
Do you want me to hide the feelings
And look the other way?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know how to be fine when I'm not
'Cause I don't know how to make the feeling stop

[Chorus]
Just so you know
This feeling's takin' control
Of me and I can't help it
I won't sit around
I can't let him win now
Thought you should know
I've tried my best to let go
Of you but I don't want to
I just gotta say it all before I go
Just so you know

[Bridge]
This emptiness is killin' me
And I'm wonderin' why I've waited so long
Lookin' back I realize it was always there, just never spoken
I'm waitin' here
Been waitin' here

[Chorus]
Just so you know
This feeling's takin' control
Of me and I can't help it
I won't sit around
I can't let him win now
Thought you should know
I've tried my best to let go
Of you but I don't want to
I just gotta say it all before I go
Just so you know (woah)
Just so you know (woah)
Thought you should know
I've tried my best to let go
Of you but I don't want to
I just gotta say it all before I go
Just so you know
Just so you know
