[Verse 1]
Slow down, things have been a little crazy
Right now, it's time to get away
You can, find out, what it is you're really after
Time is on our side
Come on, we're leaving everything behind
You know that sun is shining
We'll keep driving doesn't matter where
Cause' we got that open highway
Leading our way
As long as you are there
Yeah, we can go anywhere
Woah, we can go anywhere
Ohhh, yeah

[Chorus]
Breakdown, all the pressure that surrounds you
Allow, it all to fade away
We can, move on looking in the rearview mirror-
Wave goodbye, come on we're leaving everything behind
You know that sun is shining
We'll keep driving, doesn't matter where
'Cause we got that open highway leading our way
As long as you are there
Yeah, we can go anywhere

[Verse 2]
We're gonna be so far gone
Some place we ain't never been before
Finding a favorite song
We'll end up right where we belong
You know that sun is shining

[Chorus 2]
We'll keep driving, doesn't matter where
'Cause we got that open highway leading our way
As long as you are there
You know that sun is shining
We'll keep driving, doesn't matter where
'Cause we got that open highway
Leading our way
As long as you are there……
Yeah, we can go anywhere
Ooooohhhh, we can go anywhere
Mmm, yeah

[Outro]
Come with me, everything will be alright (We can go anywhere)
Movin' on 'cause we're leavin' it all behind (We can go anywhere)
Come with me, everything will be alright (Ohh-Whoa-Whoa)
Movin' on 'cause we're leavin' it all behind (Mmm-Ahhh)
