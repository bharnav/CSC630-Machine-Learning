[Verse 1]
Girl, there's somethin' 'bout me, things you oughta know
I've never felt the need to lose control
Always held on back and played it slow, but not this time
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

[Chorus]
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me
Right where you want me

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm gonna let you have your way with me
But when you move like that it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this, but I was wrong
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

[Chorus]
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me

[Bridge]
Can't explain it, how you swept me
Off my feet unexpectedly, in slow motion
My imagination's on me, tryin' to keep my body still
Oh, I can hardly stand the thrill
Well, baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

[Chorus]
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me, whoa, you got me right where you want me
