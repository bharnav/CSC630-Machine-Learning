[Verse 1]
I see something in you
Something nobody sees
I see yellow and blue
Yeah, the sunshine and the sea
When I think of love I think of you
Yeah it's my favourite thing to do
You're my missing puzzle piece
Yeah you are, perfect for me

[Chorus]
You walk into the room
All eyes are on you
Everyone wants to know your name
Baby you make 'em swoon
Yeah baby you're so smooth
You take every breath I breathe away
I just wanna tell you baby
How much I am feelin' you

[Verse 2]
You, you, you, you, you
Yeah, you got your own rules
I don't mind playing your way
Baby take me to school
And I'll pay attention to every word you say

[Chorus]
You walk into the room
All eyes are on you
Everyone wants to know your name
Baby you make 'em swoon
Yeah baby you're so smooth
You take every breath I breathe away
I just wanna tell you baby
How much I am feelin' you

[Bridge]
I'm right where I wanna be
Next to you standing next to me
Oh baby why don't you take my hand
And we'll walk to the other side
Where all we see is that love is blind
I think by now you understand
Just wanna tell you baby
How much I am feelin'...

[Chorus]
You walk into the room
All eyes are on you
Everyone wants to know your name
Baby you make 'em swoon
Yeah baby you're so smooth
You take every breath I breathe away
I just wanna tell you baby
How much I am feelin
Jus gotta tell you baby how much i am feelin
Jus wanna tell you baby how much i am feelin you
