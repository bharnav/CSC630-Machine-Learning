[Verse 1]
I know how it feels
To wake up without her
Lying here all alone
Just thinking about her
I can't believe
Her hold on me
It's something indescribable
I know she knows
But won't you please

[Chorus]
If you see my girl
Just tell her I miss her smile
Tell her I'm counting the minutes
Gonna see her in a little while
I know when she
Holds on to me
She's the one thing that I could never live without
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And tell her I love her

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, just tell her I love her
The way that she moves
You know what it does to me
And when I catch her eye
I can hardly breathe
Still can't believe
Her hold on me
She's just so indescribable
I know she knows
But won't you please, please

[Chorus]
Every time that I'm around her
I just go to pieces crashing tumbling to the ground
I'm so glad I found her
I know how it feels

[Outro]
Oh yeah, just tell her I love her
