[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you
Can't believe just what I'm seeing
You've been watching me
Yea baby, better believe it
If you wanna dance
Here's your chance to make it right
If you want romance
Baby I'll take you home tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I know exactly what you wanna hear
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oooh
Baby girl it's on tonight
Oooh

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Hold you close and do you right
Turn off all the lights and lay back while I blow your mind
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh
Baby, I'mma make you mine
Gonna have to take a deep breath when I blow your mind

[Verse 2]
She left me on the floor
Kept me on my knees just begging
For a little more
Room was hot the fire burning
Never leave me girl
Show you how to keep it goin'
I'mma rock your world
Baby, the temperature is growing
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She leaned over and whispered in my ear
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna give it to ya

[Chorus]
Oooh
Baby girl it's on tonight
Oooh

Oooh
Hold you close and do you right
Turn off all the lights and lay back while I blow your mind
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh
Baby, I'mma make you mine
Gonna have to take a deep breath when I blow your mind

[Bridge]
So c'mon and let it ride
I feel it in your eyes
So tell me anything you want
Because there's nothing I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Baby girl it's on tonight
I'mma keep ya by my side
Hold you close and do you right
Turn off all the lights and lay back while I blow your mind
Oooh
Baby girl it's on tonight
Oooh

Hold you close and do you right
Turn off all the lights and lay back while I blow your mind
Oooh

Gonna have to take a deep breath when I blow your mind

Baby, I'mma make you mine
Gonna have to take a deep breath when I blow your mind
Oooh, yeah
