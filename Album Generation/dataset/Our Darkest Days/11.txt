Give me strength
To hold my head up high
And spit back in their face
Give me the keys
To unlock these doors
And leave this world a better place

Sitting in a low lit room
What am I supposed to do
I'll stand my ground and fight for you

Hold my hand
And I'll help you through this
Don't you give up now
I want to help another
Persevere my brother

Sitting in a low lit room
What am I supposed to do
I'll stand my ground and fight for you
Give me strength

It takes your freedom from you
And leaves you all alone
So change your selfish ways
And leave this world a better place

Give me strength
To hold my head up high
To fight my darkest days
I'm going to start living tonight
And change my messed up ways

Sitting in a low lit room
What am I supposed to do
Sitting in a low lit room
I'll stand my ground and fight for you
