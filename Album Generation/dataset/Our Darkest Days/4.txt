Sold by your own
October revolution
Out to the streets
To fight against the tyranny
In 56' we fought the occupation
The young and old
Against the Communist regime

The sorrow, a so-called liberation
The sorrow, a violent domination
Sorrow, the humiliation
Fifty years, the death of a nation

Poverty for all
But freedom's the exception
The Proletariat, now the
Red Bourgeoisie
The murder, the torture
The terror, the famine
Fifty years under the
Communist regimes

The sorrow, a so-called liberation
The sorrow, a violent domination
Sorrow, the humiliation
Fifty years, the death of a nation

The price of freedom
Is worth it to me
Fighting
A revolution
Fighting
For human rights
The Cheka, the Stasi
The human tragedies
The casualties of the state
Fifty years
A tragic philosophy
Fifty years
Collective suffering
Fifty years
We're the casualties
Of the state

The sorrow, a so-called liberation
The sorrow, a violent domination
Sorrow, the humiliation
Fifty years, the death of a nation
