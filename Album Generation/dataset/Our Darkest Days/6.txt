Down and out
In Budapest and Los Angeles
I drank a river to forget
To forget about the coming storm
The curtains are down
The lights are off
And the doors are closed
I think about this life I've known
And I hope this time
I won't let it go

Will you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow down

I walk alone through this place
I can't find my way
This house is just an empty space
I never felt it was my home
Where've you been
I stole, I lied
I've hurt, I've sinned
My path has led
Me here again
There's splinters in my
Knees and bones

Will you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow down

Every time I start to break
You pull me back
And help me stay
You struggle with me
There's splinters in my
Knees and bones
I try to find my
Way back home
You struggle with me
I try to find my way

Will you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow down
