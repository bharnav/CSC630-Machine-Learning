Everything you said to me was constant lies
Everyday you fail to see I'm trying to help you

I'm losing grip on you
Can't seem to pull this though
You fight, can't win
Your time, at hand

Where is your belief
Can you save yourself
One more time, one more lie
Will it ever end

More repetition of your failing ways
More ammunition, come and put you in your final place
Can't stand to see you lose your saving grace

Your fight, can't win
Your time, at hand

Where is your belief
Can you save yourself
One more time, one more lie
Make it through another night
You're drowning in these waters
One more time, one more lie
Will it ever end

Everything you said to me was lies
I'm losing grip on you
Can't seem to pull this through
You count your days
You change your ways
You change your ways

You're pushing, it's certain
Toward that final curtain
Tearing you apart
You're falling, you're failing
Alone in all your ailing
Here we go again

Where is your belief
Can you save yourself
One more time, one more lie
Make it through another night
You're drowning in these waters
One more time, one more lie
Will it ever end
