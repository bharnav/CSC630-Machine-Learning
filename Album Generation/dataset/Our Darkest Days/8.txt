You said you'd make a change
Instead you let the days
Just pass you by
All this time, wasted time
Why did you even try

And if it falls apart
At least I took a chance
Are you listening
I'm sorry
You're not the one
But I'm still here
I'm sorry
Your day has come

You think of no one else
Your talk is cheap
You've got nothing good to say
All your words, empty words
I hear them everyday

And if it falls apart
At least I took a chance
Are you listening
I'm sorry
You're not the one
But I'm still here
I'm sorry
Your day has come
