Success
I'm able to live my life in my way
Luck never gives, it lends
If you're willing to pay

'Cause I'm broken, but I'll mend
All I have is today
Yes, I'm broken, but I'll mend
Screaming, God please help save me

Tired of running out
I'm praying so much more
I'm thinking about going down
Down this broken, empty road

Progress
Has taken its toll
But I've changed my ways
I've pain all my amends
Before it was too late

'Cause I'm broken, but I'll mend
All I have is today
Screaming God please this time
Don't forget about me

Tired of running out
I'm praying so much more
I'm thinking about going down
Down this lonely road
I'm living from hand to mouth
Just like the times before
I'm tired of running around
Down this broken, empty road

Success, I'm blessed
For all I have today
Regrets, obsessed
This time I will obtain
What I've been waiting for
This is my judgement day

Tired of running out
I'm praying so much more
I'm thinking about going down
Down this lonely road
I'm living from hand to mouth
Just like the times before
I'm tired of running around
Down this broken, empty road
