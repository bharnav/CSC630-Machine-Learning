I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
Cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...

Oh...
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday x4

How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
Cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...

(tonight) Sunday, bloody sunday x2

Oh, let's go!
Wipe the tears from your eyes (sunday, bloody sunday)
Oh, Wipe your tears away (sunday, bloody sunday)
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes (sunday, bloody sunday)

Sunday, bloody sunday x2

How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
Cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight
(tonight)...(sunday, bloody sunday)
(tonight)...(sunday, bloody sunday)

Oh, let's go
