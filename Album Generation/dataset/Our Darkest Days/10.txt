You want to take a stand
You haven't made a plan
Your new crusades bring misery
Better know your history

You spot your war disease
Bring this nation to its knees
The largest debt we've ever seen
Better know your history

Under the burning sun
Another dead hero
This road we're walking on
To reap what we have sown
A lockdown, here we go again

Foreign aid with strings attached
Cut down the working class
The World Bank creeps in sheep's clothing
Better know your history

The masses, so deaf and blind
Back down to the Roman times
The truth is now the enemy
Better know your history

My family lived through both regimes
The rising tide of lies and mass deceit
They'll tell you what to think and what to say
Know your history

You send the poor to fight
Then praise the religious right
A sacrilegious blasphemy
Better know your history

An empire of greedy thieves
Bring the nation to its knees
The new world corporatocracy
Better know your history

History
For the past to repeat
Is your destiny
History
I know we're going to pay
To history
