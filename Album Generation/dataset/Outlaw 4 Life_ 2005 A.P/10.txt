Slim Thug (talking): I don't feel so well

Slim Thug:
I'm fresh up off the A train
Breaking out my A game
Ain't shit shaking so im baking up the 'cane, man
This rap shit slowing up,
Prices keep going up,
I'm stressed, so you know I've got that hydro blowing up
I'm sick, can't sleep
Scarder than I've ever been.
Feel like I'm about to die
If I don't get this medicine
The money
This shit ain't just a want, it's a need
Every drip of blood I bleed is infected with the greed
I've got a disease
Somebody please give me my dope
I swear to god I'm going to just die
If I go back broke
I can't live without out it
Just take away my pain
Because all I ever knew was that rap and that trap game.

Chorus (4x):
Give me life
Give me hope
I'm addicted to this green
So give me my dope

Chris Ward:
Yea yea
My vision is vivid
But now my sight is rigid for these digits
I've got so much in my possession
I need to distribute
Lord help me
Cuz I'm addicted to living exquisite
The cash, the cars and clothes
I don't know what is it?
It's like I'm lost trying to find these Jacksons, Grants and Franklins
Its like blue magic's in this purple (shit)
Because I can't quit drinking
I'm so high
But yet I'm so fly
The screen got me feinding to live
Knowing I'm gonna die
So now you know why
I need money
Like hits in "How High" nigga,
I need money
And if being broke is funny
Trust me I'm so serious
That if rich people are crazy
I'm trying to go delirious

Chorus (4x):
Give me life
Give me hope
I'm addicted to this green
So give me my dope

Interlude:
Know what I'm saying?
Me and my people
We've been starving so long just to eat
And now we're eating
We're starving to eat some more
So all that broke and that petty nonsense
That's for you peasants
That's for you lames
That's for you squares
As for us
Our circle is small
And we've got to live baby

Killa Kyleon:
I propose
Put the ring in his left hand
Married the game
The streets is my best man
Promised I'd never leave her
Till death do us part
We've got a baby named coke
I pay child support
I'm on the road to riches
And I stay on the path
Until I reach my destination I stay on the slab
I've got a GPS
I get paid in stacks
I'm trying to get it where my millions and my age match
Cane for sale, I bought it and paid tax
In return the same thing that I bought, I gave back
Addicted to the green like fiends that blaze crack
I've got to get it until I'm in a pine box laid flat
