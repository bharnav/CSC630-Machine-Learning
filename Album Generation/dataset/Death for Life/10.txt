I need the answers I can't find, I know I'm never left behind
If we can hold one more night, I think we might just find the light
Eternal quest for what we seek, your strength, my rock, this heart will beat
As they try to beat us down, from gutters rise we take this crown
From gutters rise we take this crown, from gutters rise we take this crown

We are not alone, out from the dark we come

Your eyes see the truth when I am blind, I cannot steer with both hands tied
This vicious world it deafens me, it's crushing my heart, killing me
You strength, this bat that I will swing, smash through this glass that cuts so deep
Swimming through a sea of hate, this abscess drained, I will create
I will create total destruction of this world

We are not alone, out from the dark we come
I will never run, this fight has just begun

No, this bond won't break, not today!
From gutters rise, we take this crown
We are not alone, out from the dark we come
I will never run, this fight has just begun
