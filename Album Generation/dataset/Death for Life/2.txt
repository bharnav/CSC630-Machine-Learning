And we survived, through death
Unanswered questions, a night I can't forget
The horror, the sorrow, the shame, all trapped inside
When some on shoots all the lights, I see you when I close my eyes
All the things I want to change I hide, no longer running from my fears
Shedding my skin, not just shedding tears, and no I know I must forget
And now I know I must forget regret

Life and death, this is killing me
I can't forget, this is eating me alive
Trapped inside, this is burning from inside, close my eyes
All the things that hold us back from moving on
We strike this match; this torch will lead us out of the dark
Into light of fire we find our spark, we carry on, face the day

For the rest of my life I'll find my way out of this prison
We learn from the past, we live to fight, we live to fight!
And now I know I must forget
And now I know I must forget regret

Life and death, this is killing me
I can't forget, this is eating me alive
Trapped inside, this is burning from inside, close my eyes
I can't bring back this life; I can't bring back this life
I can't bring back this life: forget regret!

Life and death, this is killing me
I can't forget, this is eating me alive
Trapped inside, this is burning from inside, close my eyes
