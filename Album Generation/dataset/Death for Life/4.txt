Did you ever wonder, will I make it through this night?
Did you ever wonder, will I live for sacrifice?
Have you ever wondered, will I ever see the light?
Have you ever wondered, can I live another life?
Can I live another life?

I can't take away this fever, I can't take away the pain
But I will fight with you forever, forever and a day
I can't face this world on my own, I keep on searching for your face
I promise that we'll live forever, forever and a day

And in your darkest hour, you bleed without a knife
Your searching losing power, your whole life has been a fight
You keep on giving selflessly, the world keeps on taking selfishly
You keep it bottled up inside, feel the sting, lets take another ride

I can't take away this fever, I can't take away the pain
But I will fight with you forever, forever and a day
I can't face this world on my own, I keep on searching for your face
I promise that we'll live forever, forever and a day

Am I alone inside this glass box, I can't shatter from inside?
Can you tell me, can you tell me, will we make it out alive?
Come on, come on, let's take another ride

And in your darkest hour, you bleed without a knife
Your searching losing power, your whole life has been a fight
You keep on giving selflessly, they keep on taking selfishly
You keep it bottled up inside, feel the sting, take another ride

Let's take another ride, yeah
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
Day, forever and a day, day
