Blood spills, terror fills, world is on its knees
You think a little faith will stop catastrophe
Well I've got news for you, it's looking pretty bleak
Unless we all start thinking, wake up, stand up
Get up off your knees

In a time of desolation, what we need is real salvation
In a time of desolation
When you look up to the sky, you see your life is ruled by lies
You cannot look up for an answer

Look to him, what should I do? Follow do not think
These are the building blocks of our society
Slit the wrists, watch the false truths drain into the sink
When will you see the answer lies in you and me

In a time of desolation, what we need is real salvation
In a time of desolation
When you look into my eyes, you see the dark polluted night
You cannot look up for an answer

Look to myth to solve reality
When will you see the answer lies in you and me

In a time of desolation, what we need is real salvation
In a time of desolation
When you look up to the sky, you see your life is ruled by lies
You cannot look up for an answer
In a time of desolation, what we need is real salvation
In a time of desolation
When you look up to the sky, you see your life is ruled by lies
You cannot look up for an answer
When you look into my eyes, you see the dark polluted night
You cannot look up for an answer, no
