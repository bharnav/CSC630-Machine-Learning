No heaven, no hell, just this wonderful place
This is our battlefield, we fight for our ways
Ways to reach freedom, to be who we are
Taking back our lives, and breaking down the walls

Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay

We keep looking forward, never looking back
My voice is my weapon, these words are my attack
As we sharpen our wit, cut the fabric of this nation
Blocking out the brain wash, your mental masturbation

Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay

Where is the light at the end of my tunnel, no where to run at the end of this rope
When everyone around me softens their blow, I hit twice as hard
I hit twice as hard, go!

Straight to the grill, boot to the face, my blood is boiling
My heart is beating, straight to the core, hammer comes down, now beg me for more
I lay it down, life on the line
You're looking good, while I'm getting mine

Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
Here today but gone tomorrow, you're gonna die, we're here to stay
I'll make you eat your sorrow, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die
You were built to be destroyed, we were born to attack!
