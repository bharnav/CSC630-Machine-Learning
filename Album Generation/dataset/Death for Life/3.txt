Hands tied; crucified, lost, found, entombed we collide
Black whole, my brain
Focus, insane
Left out, betrayed
Your hole, my vane
I can't sustain, for much longer
Without your pain, makes me stronger
Sandpaper licking my wounds, I want more, make me hate myself!

Ice cold, disown, sickened now
I can't die in this balloon, suffocating
This world, disown, sickened now, and now I'm breaking free

I can't feel with this f**king insane, I can't feel with you f**king my brain
I can't feel unless you pushed from inside, I caress then crush, hope and the light
I will burn this book, shove it inside, Shove it up my ass, spit out your pride
I can't think, I'm just f**king instead, Somebody slit my throat, D.B.S!
Sandpaper licking my wounds, I want more, make me hate myself!

Ice cold, disown, sickened now
I can't die in this balloon, suffocating
This world, disown, sickened now, and now I'm breaking free

Ice cold, fit the mould, crushing me, I'm breaking free, I can't die in this balloon
Blood! I wasn't born from this womb
Pain! This world, crushing me alive
Cum! My will is stone, my hope won't die
Blood, pain, cum, insane
Blood pain, cum, the same

I collide, consumed inside
This hate, this life, then we slide
Entombed inside we collide
I collide, then it dies

Ice cold, disown, sickened now
I can't die in this balloon, suffocating
This world, disown, sickened now, and now I'm breaking free
Breaking free
