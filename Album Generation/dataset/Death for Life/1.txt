I've got my discontent, I've got my right to vent
And if you question me, I'll show you who I've got to be
I've got to strive for something, I will not die for nothing
It's time to bend for no one, anger release, gone, gone, gone
I give my life to free will

I have no other way, I give my life to you
I cannot see another day
Unless we leave this place, follow our hearts and minds
Live strong and we will find our way

Won't take this sitting down, I won't be pushed around
I've got one life to live, I've got so much I have to give
And all this information, fed to us by a nation
With sights set on your freedom elimination, I give my life to free will
I must think to be free, hold on to identity

I have no other way, I give my life to you
I cannot see another day
Unless we leave this place, follow our hearts and minds
Live strong and we will find our way

We will find our way, we will find ours
We will live strong, we will find ours
We will live strong, we will find ours
We will live strong, we will find ours
We will live strong, we will find our way
We will find our way, we will find our way!

I have no other way, I give my life to you
I cannot see another day
Unless we leave this place, follow our hearts and minds
Live strong and we will find our way

I have no other way, I give my life to you
I cannot see another day
Unless we leave this place, follow our hearts and minds
Live strong and we will find our way
We will find our way, we will find our way
We will find ours, we will live strong!
