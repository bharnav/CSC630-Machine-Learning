You can't take us down, you can't stop us now
You can't crush all my hopes, my dreams, my enemy is time
There is no silence now, you will not shut my mouth
My thoughts you will no longer oppress, my enemy is time

And as I fight for breath, I will not give up hope, no
And as the winter comes, and as the seasons change
Closer to death I draw, we face this curse of days

I think you're scared I'll live forever, and in so many ways I will
These words are fuel to feed the fire, and hold us back you never will

You can't take this now, I will scream out loud
About this world you force upon me, my enemy is time
I only have right now, to f**king bring you down
Watch your world crumble around you, my enemy is time

And as I fight for breath, I will not give up hope, no
And as the winter comes, and as the seasons change
Closer to death I draw, we face this curse of days

I think you're scared I'll live forever, and in so many ways I will
These words are fuel to feed the fire, and hold us back you never will
And as the winter comes, and as the seasons change
Closer to death I draw, we face this curse of days

I think you're scared I'll live forever, and in so many ways I will
These words are fuel to feed the fire, and hold us back you never
You never, you never, never will!
