One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life
One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life

Takin', takin', takin' it all
Takin', takin', takin' control
You're takin', takin', takin' the fall, no!
Takin', takin', takin' it all, (broken hearts)
Takin', takin', takin' control, (broken dreams)
You're takin', takin', takin'(You control the airwaves), the fall, no! (we control the streets)

You can take it all from me, but you can't have my mind
Show me what I'm supposed to see, but you won't make me blind
I am but one voice of many, you cannot define
To terrorize us is inhuman, to slit your throat devine

One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life
One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life

Takin', takin', takin' it all
Takin', takin', takin' control
You're takin', takin', takin' the fall, no!
Takin', takin', takin' it all, (broken hearts)
Takin', takin', takin' control, (broken dreams)
You're takin', takin', takin'(You control the airwaves), the fall, no! (we control the streets)

You can take it all from me, but you can't have my mind
Mind control infecting me, no!

One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life
One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this is my life

You can't win this fight, total control is mine
I'm DEATH FOR LIFE! DEATH FOR LIFE!
I'm DEATH FOR LIFE! DEATH FOR LIFE!
DEATH FOR LIFE! DEATH FOR LIFE! DEATH FOR LIFE!

I am but one voice of many, to stand up and defy
To push your hate into the fire, and burn up all your lies

One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this life
One, one destiny
One, one quest for me
This will set me free, this is my life
