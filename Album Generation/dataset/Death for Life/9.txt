The more we fail, the higher the ratings, higher the ratings
The more we fail, it's the image your making, it's the image your making
Drawn in dirt and blood from our hands
Mass self destruction, your means to an end

Hate fuck this revolting world, hate fuck
Hate fuck this revolting world, hate fuck
Open wide as I fuck you in the mouth, block the lies from gouging my eyes out
Choke on my cum, enjoy your last breath, turning blue we celebrate your death

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest
I'll drag this dagger across your throat, with every fucking word I've wrote

Stoop and you'll be steeped on, stand tall and you'll be shot
We give up on ourselves, to be someone we're not
Dedicated to the human cause, without a rest, without a pause
I'll speak my mind until my dying breath, this fight lives on, beyond our death

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the young die fast, you fuck the rest

Blood sucking scumfuck, I will erase you from this world
Power mad orgy begins to curdle
As I bend your head and snap your neck
Spill a drop of blood for each life you've wrecked
When your well runs dry, no blood to spill
One look at your face and its making me ill
When your well runs dry no blood to spill
Castrate the pig, a testament to free will

The absolute rejection of authority
The absolute rejection of authority
The absolute rejection of authority
I'll drag this dagger across your throat, with every fucking word I've wrote
