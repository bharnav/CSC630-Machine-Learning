Bringing on the hatred, bringing the lies
Bringing on the violence, devouring our lives
This world is so cold; you feed on the meek
We're gutting up ourselves, fear keeps us weak

So I purge out all this violence, ignorance, apathy
I destroy your Babylon, kingdom of misery
As we survive these wars you fight now you will quickly learn
You can't erase true desire, watch your empire burn

Some people have so much respect for their superiors, they have none left for themselves
I'm thrusting trying my best to fuck and ruin you, now you're locked in my cell
For all of the rejected souls, No love, no regret, no mercy
We give you the collective cum, you're just a cheap fuck

So I purge out all this violence, ignorance, apathy
I destroy your Babylon, kingdom of misery
As we survive these wars you fight now you will quickly learn
You can't erase true desire, watch your empire burn

So I purge out all this violence, ignorance, apathy
I destroy your Babylon, kingdom of misery
As we survive these wars you fight now you will quickly learn
You can't erase true desire, watch your empire burn
