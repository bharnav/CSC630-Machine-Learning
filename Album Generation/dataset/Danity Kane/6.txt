[Shannon]
I know you wanna come over
You can come over

[Shannon] (Dawn)
Baby I'm alone tonight
And I wanna feel alright
You already know what I like, boy
(If you come over)

[Aubrey] (Dawn)
I will lay it down so right
It will really blow your mind
Baby just relax your mind
You know (Whenever you come over)

[D. Woods] (Dawn)
Ain't nobody thinkin' 'bout leaving
Cause we've got each other in the end
You can stay until the morning
(I love it when you come over)

[Aundrea] (Dawn)
Because I don't want to wake up alone
Baby, I'm checking the phone
Boy you belong here (If you come over)
