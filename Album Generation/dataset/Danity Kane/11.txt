Would you like that
(Dawn add libs)
Do you like that
(Dawn add libs)
I know you like that

(Aundrea)
Starin at me all nite
While im out on the floor
It was clear what you wanted
So you pushed up on it
I was grinding with the DJ
With my hands on the floor
I gues you couldn't take it
You got tired of wating

(Dawn)
So you walked over to me(Breathin in my ear talkin bout what could be)
Saying you can do this and that
Then you start workin me like a champ and im like

(All)(Chorus)2x
OH! You touchin my body
OH! You must want me to get started
Boy I can't take its so crazy how you makin me feel

(Shannon)(Bridge)
If I put you on
(Would you like that)
Keep it nice and warm
(Do you like that)
Do it on the floor
(Do you like that)
I wanna give it some more
(I know you like that

(Aubrey)
Now you got me sweatin
Dancin out on my clothes
I was headed for the door
But you made it so I had to know
(oh just what you was workin with)

(Shannon)
Put it out there so I'd come get it
Im the one who can't handle it

(D.Woods)
The way you workin me out on the floor

(Dawn)
So you walked over to me(Breathin in my ear talkin bout what could be)Saying you can do this and that Then you start workin me like a champ and im like

(Chorus)2x
OH! You touchin' my body
OH! You must want me to get started
Boy I can't take its so crazy how you makin me feel

(Shannon)(Bridge)
If I put you on
(Would you like that)
Keep it nice and warm
(Do you like that)
Do it on the floor
(Do you like that)
I wanna give it some more
(I know you like that)

(All)
When your touchin' me
Like that step back
And catch my breath
This way I've never felt
You doit feels so well

(Chorus)2x
OH!you touchin my body
OH!you must want me to get started
Boy I can't take its so crazy how you makin me feel

Keep it nice and warm
(Do you like that)
Do it on the floor
(Do you like that)
I wanna give it some more
(I know you like that

OH! You touchin my body
OH! You must want me to get started
Boy I can't take its so crazy how you makin me feel

Would you like that
