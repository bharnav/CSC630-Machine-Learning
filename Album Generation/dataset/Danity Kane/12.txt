(Shannon:)
Big Boy I like
The way you be lookin' at me
It be drivein' me crazy
And I like everytime you up
In my ear you be talkin'
All sexy

(D.Woods:)
Show me cause I don't
Ever wanna look past it baby
I'm curious if you can
Shake me baby
Can you really make me go?

(Pre-Chorus (All):)
And if you think you can
Handle it show me what
You workin' with
Let me know before we get down
(D. Woods:)
Before you get up on it
Before I let you get up on it
No no no

(Chorus (All):)
I can't fight if you makin' me sweat
Baby I can't have it
I really like it
(Aubrey:)
But if you can't get it jumpin'
You better back up off of me
And If I really don't want it
You better back up off of me

(repeat Chorus one time)
(Andrea:)
Two gonna play the game
Wit you boy
Too much for me to
Wait for you boy
I really wanna know wit you boy
Do all the things
You say you do boy

(Dawn:)
We could go round for round
At best pound for pound
But if I knock you down
Better get up on one
I wanna know if you can
Really really move me
It takes a lot for somebody
To really want me

(Pre-Chorus (All):)
And if you think you can
Handle it show me what
You workin' with
Let me know before we get down
(D. Woods:)
Before you get up on it
Before I let you get up on it
No no no

(Chorus (All):)
I can't fight if you makin' me sweat
Baby I can't have it
I really like it
(Aubrey:)
But if you can't get it jumpin'
You better back up off of me
And If I really don't want it
You better back up off of me

(repeat Chorus one time)
I hope you know what you're doin' boy
Don't play with me, and if you wanna
Get it right we can get it right
Anytime you wanna get it right

I hope you know what you're doin' boy
Don't play with me, and if you wanna
Get it jumpin', if you wanna get it poppin'
We can get it right

(repeat chorus 5 times)
