[Intro - Aubrey]
Yeah... you know what baby
No matter what I go through
No matter what I do
You're always there
To hold me down
And that's real

[Verse 1 - Aundrea]
You tell me there's nothing better than me
So you draft me like I'm the top pick of the league
Then you gave me what I need
So fly it was like you planted a seed
[D. Woods (Group)]
(Oh) Even when there is trouble
(Oh) You handle it before I know
(Oh) So I'm letting you know
It's beautiful, us together
Who can ask for more?

[Pre-Chorus - Aundrea]
Anytime, anyplace I know you're down
You're the type I can trust to be around
The way you hear me and feel me
Got me lovin you that much more really
[D. Woods]
I don't wanna see myself
With anyone else cause the way I felt
Got me so caught up I'm stuck on you
So real I know I got the truth

[Chorus - Group]
I'm the only one written on your list
You and me so legitimate
Everything is about your chick
That's why we're so exclusive
You hold me, baby you hold me down
You hold me, baby you hold me down
You hold me, baby you hold me down
You hold me, baby you hold me down

[Break - Group (Shannon)]
Hold me, yes, you hold me down (I know you got me)
Hold me, yes, you hold me down
Hold me, yes, you hold me down (and you know that I got you too)
No matter what you talk you hold me down

[Verse 2 - Aundrea]
So deep that I ain't worried
Thinkin' baby you're out there runnin' the streets
No, you're playin' with me so perfectly
That's why you got me convinced you were made for me
[Dawn (Group)]
(Oh) You're everything I been missing
(Oh) With you there's no second guessin'
(Oh) You with me is a blessin' that I can't and just won't let go of

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge - D. Woods]
Got a life with you
Got a right with you baby
[Dawn]
More than just a friend
More than just a man you're
[Aundrea]
Everything I could ever need
You want my heart got the best of me
I ain't gon' let another come between
I'ma hold you down the same way you hold me:

[Chorus - w/ ad-libs 3x]

[Break - Group]
Hold me, yes, you hold me down
Hold me, yes, you hold me down
Hold me, yes, you hold me down
No matter what you talk you hold me down
