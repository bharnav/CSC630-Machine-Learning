[Verse 1: Aundrea & (Dawn)]
You all in my ear (I hear you talkin' dirty)
You wanna get me alone
But you ain't sayin' nothin' new to me (new to me)
Are you sure that you can handle me?
Uh, uh uh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Shannon & (Dawn)]
So let me put on my boots
(Do you think that you can rock it?)
Turn it up, let it loose
Boy can you get with this minor tease (minor tease)
Before I bring it to you mentally

[Chorus: Group with Dawn on Lead Vocals]
All I need is one shot
And baby you're gone
It'll have you callin' non-stop
Just can't leave it alone
(if I give ya what ya need)
Do you really think you can handle me?
Oh, oh-oh
Boy, do you think that you can handle me?

[Verse 2: Aubrey & (Group)]
Oh (I hope you're ready)
Tell me (that you're ready)
'Cause I can't even fight it no more
'Cause baby my body (is like a potion)
When I put this (thing in motion)
Guaranteed that you'll be beggin' for more

[Pre-Chorus: Dawn]
(Boy, give me all that you got)
Gotta make it hot for me
(keep it comin' don't stop)
I hope that you're ready
(I hear what you're sayin')
'cause I'm about to show you
(you think you can handle me)

[Chorus â€’ with ad-libs 2x]
All I need is one shot
And baby you're gone
It'll have you callin' non-stop
Just can't leave it alone
(if I give ya what ya need)
Do you really think you can handle me?
Oh, oh-oh
Boy, do you think that you can handle me?
All I need is one shot
And baby you're gone
It'll have you callin' non-stop
Just can't leave it alone
(if I give ya what ya need)
Do you really think you can handle me?
Oh, oh-oh
Boy, do you think that you can handle me?

[Bridge: D. Woods & (Group)]
So if you got what I want and
You think you're ready, baby
(come on and get it)
Come on (and just get it)
And if you got what I need, boy
Don't keep me waitin' baby
(come on and get it)
(come on and just get it)

[Pre-Chorus: (Dawn) & D. Woods]
(boy, give me all that you got)
Keep it hot for me yeah
(keep it comin' don't stop)
I hope that you're ready
(I hear what you're sayin')
'cause I'm about to bring you
(you think you can handle me)

[Chorus with ad-libs]
All I need is one shot
And baby you're gone
It'll have you callin' non-stop
Just can't leave it alone
(if I give ya what ya need)
Do you really think you can handle me?
Oh, oh-oh
Boy, do you think that you can handle me?
All I need is one shot
And baby you're gone
It'll have you callin' non-stop
Just can't leave it alone
(if I give ya what ya need)
Do you really think you can handle me?
Oh, oh-oh
Boy, do you think that you can handle me?


One shot!! [8x]
