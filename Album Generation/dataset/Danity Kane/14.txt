[Verse 1 - Aundrea]
I might like to get to know you
But I can't hear you right now
You're competing with the music
But the music's way too loud
[Aubrey]
Why don't you write down your number and slip it to me?
But you gotta maneuver discreetly
I don't want my business leaking people like run their mouth

[Hook - Wanita + (Group)]
I don't need no pressure from you
(I don't need pressure, no pressure, no)
Don't need no lectures from you
So just give me one night and I'ma

[Chorus - Group]
Sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna
Sleep on it, sleep on it
You can keep popping off if ya wanna
You keep on stressing me
You, you keep on stressing me (Damn!)
Keep on stressin' if you wanna
Sleep on it (sleep on it), I'ma sleep on it (sleep on it)
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna

[Verse 2 - Dawn]
I would've loved to hit the dance floor
But it's way to crowded right now
Maybe we'll bump into each other in the future
If you wanna see me then you'll figure it out
[Shannon]
Me and my girlfriends came to do it
After workin' hard all week
We like to throw our open toes on and get jazzy
Lounge in the party but you're tryna make me speak

[Hook - Wanita + (Group)]
I don't need no pressure from you
(I don't need pressure, no pressure, no)
Don't need no lectures from you
So just give me one night and I'ma

[Chorus - Group]
Sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna
Sleep on it, sleep on it
You can keep popping off if ya wanna
You keep on stressing me
You, you keep on stressing me (Damn!)
Keep on stressin' if you wanna
But I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna

[Bridge - Dawn]
Ooh, I ain't tryna be rude
But you're the third guy tonight that's come to me like this
You see I'm tryna be cool, but these dudes keep grabbing me
They keep on grabbing me
I'm ain't tryna be conceited
See I appreciate the compliments you're giving to me
But any other night it'll be alright
But now theres way too much going on

[Chorus - Group 2x]
Sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna
Sleep on it, sleep on it
You can keep popping off if ya wanna
You keep on stressing me
You-you keep on stressing me (Damn!)
Keep on stressin' if you wanna
But I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna
