Let's go to the rendezvouz
Of the past, me and you
DJ, plays deja vu
As we were in '82

I see your face fade to gray
Just wait for Blue Monday
Imagine you're dancing
You're a robot man-machine

I don't want a Tainted Love
I want something from above
But don't go
Just play me Moscow Disco

Let's go to the rendezvouz
Of the past, me and you
DJ, plays deja vu
As we were in '82

I just can't get enough
