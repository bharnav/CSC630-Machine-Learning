Pour yourself another cup another cup another cup
And wait
I can't wait forever

Live your life
A stupid life a stupid life a stupid life
Nobody does it better

Breaking everybody's heart
Taking everyone apart
Breaking everybody's heart
Singing everybody's song

All your dreams are waking up are waking up are waking up in space
You can't sleep forever
Every day you torture us you torture us you torture us
Nothing stays together

(repeat chorus)
