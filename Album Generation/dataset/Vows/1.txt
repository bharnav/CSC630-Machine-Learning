[Verse 1]
Something got me out of my
Slumber in the broken light
Watching you across the room
Shadowed by the placid moon
I can feel it in my bones
Something that nobody knows
How it really feels inside
To let go of all my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
I sense it, I feel it
I sense it, I feel it

[Chorus]
Something in the way you lie
Something so hard to find
Something in the way you slammed (that door)
Something's always left me wanting (more)
Something in the way you smile
You make a silly joke and itâ€™s fine
Something in the way you are
Something in the way you are

[Verse 2]
I'm wondering about your childhood
Wonder if you were misunderstood
I'm watching you inside your head
I wonder if you know how long I cared
And I can feel it in my bones
I love all of the sticks and stones
And every little word you say
You're breaking me in the best way

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Something when you look so tough (Oh)
Something I can't get enough (Oh)
Something when you make that sound (Oh)
Something when you break it down
Something when you raise your voice (Oh)
I know that I don't have a choice (Oh)
Something in the way you are
Something in the way you are

You're my (favorite) pastime
Even when you're just passing by
Stay a little while
It's only you and I
You're my (favorite) pastime
Even when you're just passing by
Stay a little while
It's only you and I

[Hook 1]
