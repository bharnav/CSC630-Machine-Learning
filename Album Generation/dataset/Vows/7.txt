[Verse 1]
It's no use we’re gonna have to fight
You’re throwing words 'round a thousand times
Like a child who can’t empathize
You don't speak my language, you don’t read my signs
You wanna know what I really think
You wanna know what I really believe
There’s a fire burning up in here
See the smoke coming out of my ears

[Pre-Hook]
Oh no, we both know
More trouble’s gonna find us, if we’re all alone
I wanna show you what I really mean
But you’re always on the outside looking in

[Hook]
Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside, lie down in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head!

[Verse 2]
Look through my eyes I'm your binocular
And every time you'll get a shock you'll learn
What it’s like to be in my dimension
I’ll be the center of your attention
Listen to all the sounds I hear
The quiet noise and the crack of my snare
Make your mark on my territory
Carve your name in every cavity

[Pre-Hook]
Oh no, we both know
More trouble’s gonna find us, if we’re all alone
I wanna show you what I really mean
But you’re always on the outside looking in

[Hook] (x2)
Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside, lie down in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head! [x2]

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you want a piece of my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime
Oh, you want a piece of my mind?
Climactic and dramatic like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh, you want to read my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime
Oh, you want a piece of my mind?
Da da da da da da da da da da da da

[Break]
Da-la-da-da da-la-da-da da-la-da
Da-la-da-da da-la-da-da da-la-da
Ha-la-da-da da-la-ha da-la-da
Da-la-da!

[Verse 3]
Like the blood running through my veins
It’s my DNA and my chemistry
From the pews of the congregation
You'll never know the real salvation
You wanna know what I really think
You wanna know what I really believe
There’s a fire burning up in here
See the smoke coming out of my ears

[Hook]
Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside, lie down in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

[Bridge 2/Outro]
Oh want a piece of my mind?
Climactic and dramatic like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh want a piece of my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime
Oh want a piece of my mind?
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
