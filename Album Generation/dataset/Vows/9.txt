I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
I don't wanna be all caught up in your social scene
I don't wanna be, be in your front seat girl
I know I'm your recruit, but I ain't gonna follow suit

You got Morrissey Joy Division on CD
But I don't go for them, I can't move to that beat
I like Marvin Gaye and gospel music, my soul and my heart
But you call it noise, always spoil my favorite parts

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
I don't wanna be caught in your social machine
I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
It's not my scene, I don't need your company

You're skipping school cause it's cool, but it's not for me
I learned to dream, learned to read at this old academy
You're out to make every man your fleeting dream
But I'm a, a one-man woman, I'm all down with monogamy

You cuss up and you curse so they think that you're rough and tough
But I like Shakespeare and I find "Dammit!" heavy enough
You like new age, all the rage, philosophy
But I don't read my palms, I read the psalms, they speak to me

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
I don't wanna be caught in your social machine
I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
It's not my scene, all of that aristocracy

It's not you, maybe I'm just too pedantic
I'm a self-confessed idealist and romantic
You say, "Join the gang, be my yang and I'll be your yin"
But try as I might I'm not your type, I don't fit in

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
It's not your fault and I send my apologies
I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
I don't wanna be all caught up in your social scene

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
You're a trip but I don't flip on your ecstasy
I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
Trust me, you'll see, (We're yin and yang) that's not prophecy

Yin and yang, yin and yang, ooh
That's not prophecy
Yin and yang, yin and yang, ooh, ooh (x7)
