[Intro]
Boom, boom, boom, ba
Boom, boom, boom, ba
Boom, boom, boom, ba
Boom, boom, boom, ba

[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down

[Verse 1]
We can settle at a table
A table for two
Won't you wine and dine with me?
Settle down
I wanna raise a child
I wanna raise a child
Won't you raise a child with me?
Raise a child
We'll call her Nebraska
Nebraska Jones
She'll have your nose
Just so you know

[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down

[Verse 2]
Run from Angela Vickers
I saw her with you
Monday morning small talking
On the avenue
She's got a fancy car
She wants to take you far
From the city lights and sounds
Deep into the dark

[Chorus]
Star so light and star so bright
First star I see tonight
Star so light and star so bright
Keep him by my side

[Bridge]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Baby there's no need to run
I'll love you well
I wanna settle down
It's time to bring you down
On just one knee for now
Let's make our vows

[Chorus]
Star so light and star so bright
First star I see tonight
Star so light and star so bright
Keep him by my side

[Outro]
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
Hey, oh oh
