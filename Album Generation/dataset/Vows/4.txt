[Verse 1]
Old flame, it's always the old way
When did it get so darn cold?
You're so seasonal
You flickered and swayed
Each time the winter soul came
I remember gold days
Under love's warm haze

[Hook]
Old flame, still the one that holds me
Can't you feel it burning?
Can't you feel it burning still?
Old flame, fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go?
Can't you feel the wind blow you closer to me?

[Verse 2]
I went by your house today
When'd you get so hollow?
So closed, so overgrown?
I flicker and sway
Still dancing on the aftertaste
I remember gold days
Wrapped up in the warmth we made

[Hook]
Old flame, still the one that holds me
Can't you feel it burning?
Can't you feel it burning still?
Old flame, fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go?
Can't you feel the wind blow
Smoke skies, colors and cloud nines
Circles and straight lines and drowned eyes
(There's something in the air)
From such heights, I fell into Fahrenheit
And time only fuels the desire
(There's something in the air)

[Bridge]
It's always the old way
When'd it get so darn cold?
You're so seasonal
Old flame, burning
Burning still
Old flame, inferno
Where did all the love go?

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Someone's been sleeping downstairs
Someone's been sleeping downstairs
