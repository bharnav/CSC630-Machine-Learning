[Verse 1: Kimbra]
My hands are tied, but my eyes are open
This modern denial has me broken
Nothing mystical, no hullabaloo
Just chemicals and no one looking down on you

[Pre-Hook: Kimbra]
What am I thinking?
Ooh, if you're so sure it's rational
Well, the world's shrinking
But that don't make it logical
What am I thinking?
If you say I'm just an animal
I feel like I'm sinking
You can't explain away the way I feel

[Hook: Kimbra & Mark Foster]
You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down
They tell you, "Trust your head, be like men," but never feel like you're good enough
You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down
They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love

[Post-Hook]
Cry for the ones you love
I'll be your warrior, your warrior (Cry for the ones you love)
I'll be your warrior, your warrior (Warrior)

[Verse 2: Kimbra]
You're taking over and I'm feeling small
When I was a child I knew it all
Nothing magical, no hologram behind the door
Just a chain reaction, but I know I'm made for more

[Pre-Hook: Kimbra]
What am I thinking?
Ooh, if you're so sure it's rational
Well, the world's shrinking
But that don't make it logical
What am I thinking?
If you say I'm just an animal
I feel like I'm sinking
You can't explain away the way I feel

[Hook: Kimbra & Mark Foster]
You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down
They tell you, "Trust your head, be like men," but never feel like you're good enough
You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down
They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love
And you're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down
You wanna change the world, but your girls will be seen and not be heard
You just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down
They wanna take our light, make us fight, and never cry for the ones you love

[Breakdown]

[Hook: Kimbra & Mark Foster]
You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down
They tell you, "Trust your head, be like men," but never feel like you're good enough
You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down
They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love
And you're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down
You wanna change the world, but your girls will be seen and not be heard
You just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down
They wanna take our light, make us fight, and never cry for the ones you love
