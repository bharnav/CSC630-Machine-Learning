[Verse 1]
I feel the four become five
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
For you to walk down the boulevard
And to take me, take me, take me

But the moment you appear
You wake me, wake me, wake me
Out of the slumbers of my head
From the slums of loneliness

[Hook]
And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way two hearts meet
When love is a two way street (Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me (Love is a two way street)

[Verse 2]
We're coming close to our fame
They'll put a star beside our names
But I couldn't care for the history
When I've got you in front of me

And the cars could all collide
The shards of glass  won't catch my eye
Because you're almost by my side
We're counting down at the green light

[Hook]
And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way two hearts meet
When love is a two way street (Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me (Love is a two way street)

And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way two hearts meet
When love is a two way street (Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me (Love is a two way street)
