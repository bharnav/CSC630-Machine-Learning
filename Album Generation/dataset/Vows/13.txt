Where do you walk on a Saturday?
I see you hurrying to get somewhere
Stop and smell the roses
Stop, get closer feel it in the air (Yeah you)
Can I hold out my hand?
Make you listen to me, help you understand
Why you make me high
Can I tell you all the reasons why?

Won't you slow down I
Just need a moment of your time
It's electric, baby
I could be the one or I could be just crazy
I know you've been hurt before
I can tell it in the way you're wanting more
I know the game you're playing
I wanna break the rules
Stop your questioning

[Hook]
Call me
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna bring us down (Come bring your love)
Call me
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna bring us down (Come bring your trust)
Call me
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna bring us down (I won't let you stay lonely)
Call me
Nothing's gonna bring us down (Come bring your love)

When will we talk on a Saturday?
You're always hurrying to get somewhere
Striking all your poses
You think I don't notice that you're everywhere? (Yeah you)
Can I hold out my hand?
Make you mine forever, all that money I could spend
Looking out for you
Let me take you out where you want to (Oh yeah!)

I'm gonna hold you I got nothing to lose tonight about time
I wanna let go with you
Wait for a moment alone with you
See that golden light that shines each time we walk by?
It's electric baby
Come and take a chance on all the dreams you're dreaming

[Hook]

Nobody understands
I got love but I ain't got plans
You make me high
Can I tell you all the reasons why?
The night is nigh and it's coming fast
Feel like little kids at school skipping class
Come break the law with me
Listen to me, I'm the one you're really waiting for

[Hook]

I got what you want, baby don't move when they move along
Get tight, get it tough, everyone's fighting for the one they want
I got what you need, baby don't move when they come for me
Get tight, get it tough, everyone's fighting for the one they want
I got what you want, baby don't move when they move along
Get tight, get it tough, everyone's fighting for the one they want
