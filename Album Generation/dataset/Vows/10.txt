[Verse 1]
I'm gonna play with my cards
Hoping I find the love I'm talking 'bout
Gonna get out of the past
Nothing is left there that I'm talking 'bout

[Hook]
Where is home?
Is it caught in a lover's charm
Taught in my father's lies
Where is home?
Fall from the highest star
Called from another's heart
Where is home?
Ohh, ohh
Home is here

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna stop at the side
Groping at bright lights and the broken parts
And I'm a dancing outcast
Hoping for futures who outweigh the past

[Hook]
Where is home?
Is it caught in a lover's charm
Taught in my father's lies
Where is home?
Fall from the highest star
Called from another's heart
Where is home?
Ohh, ohh
Home is here

[Outro]
Home is here
Home is here
Home is here
