There's a heartbeat in the distance, a flicker of light ahead
I've been down the street where they offer the deals
I'm shaking hands with the man who says he'll give me my dreams
Reaching up for a taste from a hand that feeds
I feel it growing from a whisper, to a shout and a fist in the air
I could smell the fire from miles away
But I was always going to run after the chase
I didn't leave you, I just went my own way

I know I've been here before
It must have been years or more
Like the first the day that I got off of the plane
And nobody cared to know of my name
I think I've been here

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I once used to be
I've grown out of my own muse
But my heart, it has its say
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart it hasn't changed

There's a melody I'm missing
But your song travels out to me still
Like the eyes of the dusk in the hot of the glow
But I was always going to run after the storm
I didn't leave you, I just leapt out from the shore

It's not like it was before
My hair's short and my jeans are torn
Time passed in the nighttime over my head
Suddenly, I'm in the sea and I'm unprepared
I wish you'd been here

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I once used to be
I feel so out of my muse
But my heart, it has its say
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart it hasn't changed

I let go of your hand, I knew our time was measured
I sailed out to foreign lands, we'll still fly together
There's a child that I left in the town I treasured
I'm running fast but I'm not running away

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I was
I don't know how I got here

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I once used to be
I feel so out of my muse
But my heart, it has its say
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart it hasn't changed


The push and the pull
I've been the Lover and the Fool
The grime and the glam
I've been the Devil and the Lamb
