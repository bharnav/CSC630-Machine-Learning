[Verse 1]
This is nonstop baby, you've got me going crazy
You're heavier than I knew
But I don't want no other, you're my cameo lover
Only here for a moment or two
You stay inside that bubble with all of your trouble
In your black hole
You turn from the skies, you dance with your demise
I'll be here when you come home (home)

[Pre-Chorus]
We've all gotta break down
Let me come and break down, there with you

[Chorus]
'Cause everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams!
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out
Everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams!
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out of here

[Verse 2]
I've got high hopes baby, but all you do is take me
Down to depths that I never knew
You've got two arms baby, they're all tangled in ladies
As the black skies posing blue
Let go of your mother and turn to your brother
Not a long gone lover's noose
Sometimes baby the hardest part of breaking
Is leaving pieces behind you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we've all gotta get by
Let me come and hold you high, with you

[Chorus]
'Cause everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams!
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out
Everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams!
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out of here

[Bridge]
Open up your heart to me!
The sun won't shine if you're not looking
Baby, love is all that you need...

[Chorus]
When everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open, open... (open...)
When everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams!
Open up your heart, open up your heart!
Open up your heart and let me pull you out!

[Outro]
Open up your heart, open up your heart
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum)
Open up your heart, open up your heart
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum)
Open up your heart, open up your heart
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum bum, bum-bum...)
