[Refrain]
And I've got a lot to lose
You've got a lot to prove
I've got a lot to risk
You know I can't afford to miss

[Verse]
So we're gonna run around forever just typing
Thinking of what could have been, what might be
I know you say you're sad but you type back before
Running 'round in limbo, running round it all

[Interlude]
Running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all
Running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all

[Hook]
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love worth fighting for
Give me a good reason to believe at all
Running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all

[Bridge]
If you say you're scared then I'm terrified
If you say you're ready then I'm justified
If you say it's easy then you've crossed the line
If you say it's over then I'm in denial

[Hook]
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love worth fighting for
Give me a good reason to believe at all
Running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all

[Refrain]
And I've got a lot to lose
You've got a lot to prove

[Hook/Outro]
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love
Cause we're running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all
Show me that there's love
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love
Show me, cause we're running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all
Running 'round in limbo, running 'round it all
