[Verse 1]
Please don't let it begin, you're under my skin
Same old story
Boy meets girl and she falls much harder than him
Baby, where's the glory?
If all night, all night
You're attention's not mine
Please don't let it begin, you're under my skin
It's a sin, cause you're starting to win

[Chorus]
Since I'm already screwed, here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
And I'm just not getting through to the lover in you
But I'm still hoping, that tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

[Verse 2]
Just push her aside, she's not your type
So clich√© when a boy falls under the spell of a woman from hell
It's hard to take cause tonight, tonight
You could've found out I might
Have been the girl of your dreams
Baby, you might've seen what it means just to really be free

[Chorus]
Since I'm already screwed, here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
And I'm just not getting through to the lover in you
But I'm still hoping, that tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

[Bridge]
Tell me that you do, tell me that you do
Tell me that you wanna take my number
There will come a day, a hazy day in May
Or a storm in mid-December
When you need someone, just to have a little fun
Then I could be the perfect girl for you to run

[Chorus]
Since I'm already screwed, here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
And I'm just not getting through to the lover in you
But I'm still hoping, that tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

[Outro]
Don't let it begin, cause you're under my skin and I'm screwed, I'm screwed
(I'm screwed, I'm screwed)
Don't let it begin, cause you're under my skin and I'm screwed, I'm screwed
(I'm screwed, I'm screwed)
Please don't let it begin, you're under my skin
Please don't let it begin, you're under my skin
