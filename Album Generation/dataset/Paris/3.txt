[Verse 1]
Excuse me, I think I've seen you the dance floor
Excuse me, I think there playing one of our songs
I've seen you, you been here alot of times
And you've been on my mind
'Cause, baby, you're just so damn fine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What do you say?
What will it take to make you see that I'm not playing?

[Chorus]
I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

[Verse 2]
The nights young, and baby, I'm just getting started
So don't go, cause i'm feeling open hearted
And I could give you everything you need
You'll been living in dream, if you'll be waking up next to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Give me chance, how about a dance?
I promise you, you won't regret it

[Chorus]
I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

[Interlude]
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

[Bridge]
When you looking like that and am I'm feeling like this
You make my head spin around and I want a kiss
When you looking like that and am I'm feeling like this
You make my head spin around and I want a kiss

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What do you say?
What will it take to make you see that I'm not playing?

[Chorus]
I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

[Outro]
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
