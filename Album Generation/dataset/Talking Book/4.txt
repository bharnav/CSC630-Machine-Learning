[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you believe in a feeling
And it's holding you back from my love
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 1]
When you insist on excluding
The tenderness that's in my kiss
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Verse 1]
If you try to display an emotion that will contradict itself
You will find your heart just sitting
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Should you depend on an outlet
Through which an escape can be found
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 2]
If you don't see there's no way out
Just no way of getting around me
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Verse 2]
Yes, you know the plans I am making are intended to capture you
So you practice false reactions to delay the things I do
The things I do, things I do, foolish you
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Bridge]
There's no reward in detouring, my deep sincerity
Especially since what you're feeling
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Before you discover the feeling
You've tried very hard to hide
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 3]
But when you can find just a small space
To let my love live in your mind
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl
