[Verse 1]
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair
Cause you say that you found another man
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care
Cause you found you another man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want to be with you when you're all alone
I want to be with you
When you feel you got another man
You see, baby, it's all alright

[Chorus 1]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes
I wanna stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you

[Verse 2]
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag
When you know that you love her especially
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams
Maybe than I can see you all the time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes
I wanna stay and never go away
Oh baby, it's alright

[Chorus 2]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna stay with you till the morning runs
I wanna, baby, baby, baby, it's alright

[Outro]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you till the daytime comes
Oh baby, get away, alright
