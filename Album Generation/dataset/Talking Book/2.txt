[Verse 1]
Here we are on earth together, it's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you
Will it say the love you feel for me?
Will it say that you will be by my side?
To see me through until my life is through

[Hook 1]
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

[Verse 2]
I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

[Hook 2]
'cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I
