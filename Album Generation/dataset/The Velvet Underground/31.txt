[Verse 1]
One of these days
Ain't it peculiar?
You're gonna look for me
And baby, I'll be gone
One of these days
And it won't be long
Oh, darling, gonna call my name
And I'll be far gone

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is, if I can stop dancing
And get my poor self off this barroom floor

[Verse 2]
One of these days
Ain't it peculiar?
Babe, you're gonna call my name
You know that I'll be gone
(Bye, bye, baby)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is, if I can stop dancing
And get my poor self off this barroom floor

[Outro]
One of these days
And it won't be long
You're going to call my name
And I'll be gone
You're going to call my name
And I'll be gone
Oh, you're going to call my name, child
And I'll be gone
