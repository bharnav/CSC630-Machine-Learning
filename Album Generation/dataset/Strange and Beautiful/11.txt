No need to tell her
She knows that there's another little hole in her heart
Each day each dollar
She knows it tears another little hole in her heart
'cause she feels it happen
No doubt that there's another little hole in her heart

The day is breaking
And time is taking
The love were making away
This life can only
Leave us lonely
Theres no tommorow
Just another little hole in her heart

No need to tell me
I know that theres another little tear in my eye
I'm quite aware
I see thats there another little tear in my eye
Do you ask yourself why
Should we ask oursleves why
Is there any point in wondering why
Any point in wondering why

The day is breaking
And time is taking
The love were making away
This life can only
Leave us lonely
There's no tommorow
Just another little tear in my eye
Another little tear in my eye

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't, I don't know, ...

The day is breaking
And time is taking
The love were making away
The gods have spoken
The spell is broken
And love will tear us
Love will tear us apart

This life can only
Leave us lonely
Theres no tommorow
Just another little hole in my heart
Another little hole in my heart

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't, I don't know
