Swept away
By the wonder of it all
So amazed
Never saw it coming
Left me dazed
And I don't know where to turn

Here and now
Seems I'm standing on the edge
Looking down
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
Makes me feel I'm not alone

If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?

Seems to me
I'm exactly where I dreamt
I would be
And the view from here is something to see
But I need a hand to hold on to

If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?

If I fall, if I fall if I fall
(Will you catch me, make it alright, 'cause I'm standing, on the edge now, see your face and)
Will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall
(Will you catch me, make it alright, looking down I, see your face, yeah, if I fall now)
Will you catch me?

If I fall, if I fall, if I fall will you catch me?
