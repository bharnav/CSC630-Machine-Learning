Need to know, I don't wanna know
Already know, I've seen the signs
I watch you as you pull yourself away from me

Can't believe, I wanna believe
How can I believe? You're making me doubt
I thought I knew you, I don't even know myself

I'm losing faith
I'm losing all faith

You're breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart again

Don't ask me to start
Ask me start
Don't ask me to start again
Start again

I wanna fight, afraid to fight
Why don't I fight and make you see?
I hold my breath and disappear inside myself

I'm losing strength
I'm losing all strength

You're breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart again

Don't ask me to start
Ask me start
Don't ask me to start again
Start again

Oh, you're breaking my heart again

Don't ask me to start
Ask me to start
Just don't ask me to start again
Start again

No
Oh, no no

I'm losing you
I'm losing, oh, you
