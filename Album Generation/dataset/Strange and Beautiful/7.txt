The end it was the end the sirens were pulling him down
And his heart was cold so very cold you believe it might never have beat

When the sun sets around me my daydreams confound me
And the long nights surrounds me
You turn me around
You turn me around

And you she was there too drownig and wanting it over
And her hope was all lost
All hope was lost given up and never again

But watch as fingertips touch and the life floods in
And they swim to the sun

And the long night surrounds me
You turn me around

I won't let you down won't let you down
I won't let you down you turn me around
