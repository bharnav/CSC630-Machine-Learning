Need to know
If you're letting go
It's alright,alright, it's alright
Didn't know
I was hurting you so
It's alright, alright, it's alright

You came to me from nowhere
With nothing
And no-one
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Goes to show
You never really know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

This is just one of those
Lonely nights
The good times gonna come

See me then
Investing so much
In you, in you, in you
Came so close
To the edge
I do, I do, I do

This is just one of those
Lonely nights
The good times gonna come

In the end
We let it go away
We let it float away
On the breeze

'round the bend
The sun is in the sky
It's starting to look like
It's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be
A bright
Beautiful day
Yeah, the good times gonna come, oh no
The good times gonna come, yeah, yeah

This is just one of those
Lonely nights
The good times gonna come, oh
The good times gonna come, oh yeah
The good times gonna come, ohh
The good times gonna come, yeah
Need to know if you're letting go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
