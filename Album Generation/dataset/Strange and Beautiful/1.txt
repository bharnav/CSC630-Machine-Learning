(Verse 1)
I watch the sun
See it rise and fall
Waiting for something to change
I get through the day
Hope to turn things around
Seems like

(Chorus x4)
I'm falling out of love

(Verse 2)
Feeling alone
With you by my side
Further and further away
Funny how long
A moment can seem
When you're trying to hold on
Feels like

(Chorus x4)
I'm falling out of love
Yeah I'm falling out of love

(Repeat x3)
I'm falling out of love
Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling
