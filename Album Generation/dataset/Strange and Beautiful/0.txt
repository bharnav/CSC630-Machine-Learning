[Verse 1]
I've been watching your world from afar
I've been trying to be where you are
And I've been secretly falling apart
Unseen
To me, you're strange and you're beautiful
You'd be so perfect with me
But you just can't see
You turn every head but you don't see me

[Chorus]
I'll put a spell on you
You fall asleep and I put a spell on you
And when I wake you, I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first
Sometimes the first thing you want never comes
But I know that waiting is all you can do
Sometimes

[Chorus]
I'll put a spell on you
You fall asleep, I'll put a spell on you
And when I wake you, I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me

I'll put a spell on you
You fall asleep, because I put a spell on you
And when I wake you, I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me, yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
