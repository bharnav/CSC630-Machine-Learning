To bear the weight
And push into the sky
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

And honestly
To look you in the eye
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

To be the one
To be the only one
Someone has to give a lot
Something has to give a lot

And who am I
To give you what you need?
Well, I'm learning
Just learning
Learning how to live
And to bear the weight
And push into the sky
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

And honestly
To look you in the eye
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

To fill the space
The space you made for me
I try to be the one you want
I try to be the way you want

And maybe I
Could be the one you need
If you'd only
Show me
Show me how to live
And to bear the weight
And push into the sky
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

And do what's right
When everything is wrong
It's easier to run
It's easier to never have
To look you in the eye
It's easier to lie
Easier to lie

To bear the weight
And push into the sky
It's easier to lie
