I still hear your voice calling my name
I still see you smile
Childhood memories never will fade
At last now you're free

And you've finally gone home
You're home

I hope you can see all of my pain
My tears burn my eyes
I pray that you feel all of my love
At last now you're free

This loss leaves me cold - hollow inside
In time we'll embrace
At last now you're home
