I'm at the point where I can do what I feel
But I can't break away - these things are still real
I recreate as I hold on
Re-animate as I burn long

Into my eyes - come take a long hard look
There's no disguising it - I've known what it took
I recreate as I hold on
Re-animate as I burn long

New dawn brings me all I need
New dawn gives me all
