I got a call to rule the underworld - that passion burns in me
I've got a gift and a commanding mind - my faith will set me free

Stand before me now - take what I give and you will make it back

There ain't a law - there ain't a reason why
No man should feel that hurt
What's in your heart should be enough for you
- believe in what you're worth
Forget the past - forget the negative
Just crush what brings you down
Be merciless in your awakening
- accept the things you've found

Release that hold
- take all you've known
Release that hold
- that world is gone
