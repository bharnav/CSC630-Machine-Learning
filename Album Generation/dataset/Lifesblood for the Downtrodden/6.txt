Releasing the hatred of enemies - lost friends
You give me a smile for some sympathy
I can't hide it now
A tribute to man's doubt in loyalty - it's long gone
You talk about honor then spit on me
I won't hold it

Cold, dead, sun I feel
Love for you is gone

The deep ugly scars that you've given me
- they won't die -
The need to forgive is haunting me
I must give in
