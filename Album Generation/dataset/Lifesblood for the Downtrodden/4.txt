Fall back to zero - come back to life

You can't hold me down
You can't hold me down

That light ahead has always shown the way
That voice above is why I'm here today

Take all my sorrow - leave all my love
You can't hold me down
You can't hold me down

That light ahead has always shown the way
That voice above is why I'm here today

A better life has grown from all the pain
A stronger mind is what I long to gain
