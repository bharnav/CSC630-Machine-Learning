I've felt lost before
I don't want you suffering anymore
But it can't feel right using day and night
And I hope that you'll soon find your way

The walls are closing in on you
Your world is coming down on you
Going down - the walls are closing in on you
Now watch your whole world pass by you

How much time is left before you're not craving it anymore
Still the smell comes thru - it's killing you
That disease you've got won't wash away

The walls are closing in on you
Your world is coming down on you
Going down - the walls are closing in on you
Now watch your whole world pass by you
Coming down
... told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
