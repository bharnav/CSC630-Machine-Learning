The energy inside - the damage I can't hide
Got me by the throat as I become another slave
This angel's wings still growing form the cradle to the grave

An attitude exhumed

The poison I've consumed - an attitude exhumed
Carry me back to a place I once loved - nothing below me
It's all up above

Please take me back to the place that I love
Dirt underneath me but light up above

Destroy what's in your way and never lose love for yourself
Control your everyday and never lose love for yourself
