I could be desperate
I think I'm brave
Could stay and watch you

I could be desperate
I think I'm brave
Could stay and watch you
You gave me nothing
An early grave
I'm vegetating
I want more, more, more
I want everything in 1981

Anywhere
Anyplace will do
I'm leaving England
We're near the ending
You gave me nothing
No more pretending
I'm looking forward
To our parting in 1981
1981

We're near the ending
I'm just pretending
It's all been said before

I want more, more, more in 1981
1981
1981

You gave me nothing
I want more, more, more
I want everything in 1981

I'm leaving England
Near the ending
You gave me nothing
No more pretending

1981
1981
1981
1981

1981
1981
I want everything in 1981

1981
1981
I want everything in 1981
