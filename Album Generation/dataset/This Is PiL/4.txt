[Verse 1]
I think you need me now
From chapter to chapter
I'll never let go
I have an appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
Admire the scenery
It's where I left it last
This room now has a view
It's nearly night at last
The ceiling seal of ice
The walls and windows have your eyes
Almost a honeymoon
I feel clean inside

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful

[Verse 1]
I think you need me now
I'm from chapter to chapter
I never let go
I had this appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice

[Verse 2]

I'm safe inside this body
Body beautiful
This body beautiful

Body beautiful

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful
