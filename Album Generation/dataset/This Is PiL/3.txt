Trials and tribulations

[Verse 1]
When I was born, the doctor didn't like me
He grabbed my ankles, held me like a turkey
Dear Mummy, why'd you let him hit me?
This was wrong, I knew you didn't love me

[Verse 2]
There is selection, many shapes and sizes
Variety fondling surprises
The syllables, they trigger happy opposites
Encountering those devious devices
Satisfying all that you are craving
Considering life is now worth saving

Tie me to the length of that

[Chorus]
Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that

You’ll be sorry you don’t love me
Something is happening to my body

Nature is those little bits and pieces

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

I keep these feelings deep inside my body
It's not the union both of us expected
Remember daddy when you made him hold me
Safe in his arms, then the bastard dropped me

Ooh, ahh, pretty, pretty baby
Pretty baby, baby, baby boo-hoo...

Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Considering life is now worth saving
Stupid drunk
You’ll be sorry you don’t love me

Pretty baby, pretty, pretty baby
Pretty baby, pretty, pretty baby
Ooh, ahh
What a lovely little baby

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]

Until the end
