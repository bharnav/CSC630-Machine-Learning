Hello

Hello
Where are you?
Where are you?

[Chorus]
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you now?

So now you keep your distance
Double on the nuisance
Avoid the situation
Avoid your occupation
Well, it's hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

[Chorus]

You’re never near when you’re needed
Nothing ever heeded
The lying and the faking
The lying and the waiting
It’s hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

The lying and pretending
But you don’t even try

[Chorus]

A car without an engine
A plane without a pilot
It’s hardly surprising
Too busy socialising
The lying and the faking
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

Where are you?
Where are you now?

[Chorus]
