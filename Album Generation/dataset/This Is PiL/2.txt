[Verse 1]
Think you know the answer
Think you got all the problems
Well, why not try and solve them?
Instead of sitting on them

[Chorus]
Solitaire
Solitaire

[Verse 2]
Taking on new projects
Steadily slipping sideways
Close your ears to reason
Your very valued opinion

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Nothing is getting nowhere
Never meaning what you're saying
Well now I need a decision
Not empty headed ambition

[Chorus]

Slightest things explode you
Well the whole world will implode you
Solitaire for the lonely fly
You're not the only one

Solitaire
Lonely fly
Fly

[Chorus]

Solitaire
For the lonely fly

[Verse 1]
[Verse 2]
[Verse 3]

Solitaire
