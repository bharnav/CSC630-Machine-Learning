[Verse 1]
Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right
What do you want, what do I get?
Did you just need the argument?
Well, bad life

Corporate city, lucky for some
Richest island in the sun
That's life

Name of the game, it's competition
Top of the pile, not demolition
This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad, bad
Bad, bad
Bad life
Bad life

[Verse 1]

Bad life
Bad, bad
Bad, bad
Bad life, bad
Bad life

Now this machine is on the move
The open road
I’m getting gasoline
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Bad life

Now looking out for number one
The open road
I’m getting gasoline
The human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Bad, bad, bad life

The human gets dubious snide
Well, that's life

This is what you want
This is what you get
This is what you want
This is what you get
This is what you want
This is what you get
(repeat...)
