Cuttin' through the cane break
Rattling the sill
Thunder that the rain makes
When the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street
Hill to Evermore. Packin' down the ladder
With the hammer to the floor

Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford

Well he's all boxed up
On a red belle dame
Hunted Black Johnny with
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger
Get an old bell Jim

Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford

Sent to the skies on a
Benny Jag Blue
Off to bed without his supper
Like the Linda brides do
Now he's got to do the story
With the old widow Jones...
He's got a wooden coat this boy
Is never coming home

Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford

Cut through the cane break...

Well he's all boxed up
On a red belle dame
Fat Blue Johnny on
A blind man's cane
A hundred yellow bullets shook a
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger
On a pair of new wings

Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford
