There's a whisper I always hear
Screaming out never been so clear
You think you're right but you got it wrong
Givin up on all your rag & bones
I took a ride up to I don't know
Crossed the lines where no-one else would go
I can tell you all the things I've done
I've lived a life as if I've lost my own
And you can hold me down
Take the pain away
The pain away
Hope I've found
Another day, like yesterday
I took a ride up to I don't know
Crossed the lines where no-one else would go
And I can tell you all the things I've done
I've lived a life as if I've lost my own
And you can hold me down
Take the pain away
The pain away
Hope I've found
Another day, like yesterday
So what you gonna do now? Now I've found a way yeah!
So what you gonna do now? Now I've found a way yeah!
So what you gonna do now? Now I've found a way yeah!
So what you gonna do now? What you gonna do now?
