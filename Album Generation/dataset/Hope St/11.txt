Here come the shadows, you turn the victims in
It's all coming together, original sin
I didn't want to know it
I didn't have to know that...
All my life is on fire
All my life is on fire
Going to sell the secrets, in exchange for lies
One persons gaining, from a blank demise
I didn't want to know it
I didn't have to know that...
All my life is on fire
All my life is on fire
Got to leave town, got to get away, people moving fast!
Got to get away
When all my life is on fire
All my life is on fire
Got leave town, got to get away, people moving fast!
Got to get away
