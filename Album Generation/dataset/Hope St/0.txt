Hey 'Stray Cat', why'd you leave for the woods?
Well, it's been six years and I hoped you'd come good
Your new religion won't show you the truth
I've been in jail so I know it's not for you
'Cos you're everything, you're everything
I always wanted, I always wanted
'Cos you're everything, you're everything
I always wanted, I always wanted
Well, it's been six years, what you done for yourself?
I think it's time that you came from the shelf
Your soul's departed and that face isn't young
I've been here living while slow death becomes you
'Cos you're everything, you're everything
I always wanted, I always wanted
'Cos you're everything, you're everything
I always wanted, I always wanted
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
