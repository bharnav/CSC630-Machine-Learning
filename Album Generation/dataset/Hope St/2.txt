I'm just around for winter and not for may, I don't know
There's not a lot for me to see, I don't know
She's gonna get me soon and I hope I get her too but
I don't know, who knows?
I'm just around for summer, that's not today, I don't know
My doctor said you're troubled and then I'd say I don't know
She's gonna get me soon and I hope I get her too but
I don't know, who knows?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Is it wrong (x4) to say I don't really like you
Do you think (x4) that I'll still be strong without you
And I know (x4) that I'm still gotta think about you
I guess I need some time, to say that I'll be fine without you
I'm just a clown for happiness, underpaid? I don't know
There's not a lot for me to say, I don't know
She's gonna get me soon and I hope I get her too but
I don't know, who knows?
Is it wrong (x4) to say I don't really like you
Do you think (x4) that I'll still be strong without you
And I know (x4) that I still gotta think about you
I guess I need some time, to say that I'll be fine without you
Without you
Whooaaaah, I don't really like you
Do you think, I'll still be strong without you
And I know, I still gotta think about you
Yes I need some time to say that I'll be fine without you
Is it wrong (x4) to say I don't really like you
Do you think (x4) that I'll still be strong without you
And I know (x4) that I still gotta think about you
Yes I need some time to say that I'll be fine without you
Without you Without you
Yes I need some time to say that I'll be fine without you
