Well here you are! my only way out in anything that i do
I try to fight, but i am weak and you watch as i start to lose
And now i hide, my only answer, i'm never making it through
Well...
I'm getting tired because i'm older
I place a kiss upon your shoulder
And in the eye you see i'm hurting
Cause nothing compares to you!
And a ohhhh
And a ahhhh
I'm losing you!
I'm losing you!
And a ohhhh
And a ahhhh
I'm losing you!
I'm losing you!
And a ohhhh
And a ahhhh
I'm losing you!
I'm losing you!
And a ohhhh
And a ahhhh
Well here i am with eyes of fire, from spending my time with you
I've waited all my life to find it, my luck seems to change with you
And in the night alone in exile, just waiting to find the truth
Well...
I'm getting tired because i'm older
I place a kiss upon your shoulder
And in the eye you see i'm hurting
Cause nothing compares to you!
