I'm gonna take you down
To where you once belonged
I'm gonna see you out
Until the break of dawn
I'm gonna get you in
I'm gonna get you out
I'm gonna leave you there
That's what i'm talking about
Now I'm trying
Now i'm trying
To do the best that I can
Now i'm trying
Now i'm trying
To do the best that I can
I'm gonna leave this town
I'm gonna do it right
I'm gonna see you there
Were we will start us a fight
I'm gonna get you in
I'm gonna get you out
I"m gonna leave you there
That's what i'm talking about
Now I'm trying
Now i'm trying
To do the best that I can
Now i'm trying
Now i'm trying
To do the best that I can
