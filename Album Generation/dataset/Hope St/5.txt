I lost a friend, a friend that was right
You couldn’t lead me on my way
I dreamt a dream; I dreamt I was right
I had enough to keep me sane
I lost a friend, a friend that was right
You sent me packing on my way
I dreamt a dream; I dreamt I was right
I had enough to keep me sane
And did I mention about the way
She took my heart alive?
And did I mention about the way
She took my heart alive?
I lost a friend, a friend that was right
I packed my things and on my way
I dreamt a dream; I dreamt I was right
I had enough to keep me sane
And did I mention about the way
She took my heart alive?
And did I mention about the way
She took my heart alive?
Take another ride with me!
Take another ride with me!
Take another ride with me!
Take another ride with me!
I know there is hard time coming!
I know there’s hard times
I know there’s hard times
Take another ride with me!
Take another ride with me!
Take another ride with me!
