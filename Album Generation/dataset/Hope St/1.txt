I know I'll say a line to you as if I'll make me right?
You'd listen to me ranting on about someone else's life
Oh no now finally I start to see you in a clearer light
I'd mention that I'm hopeless, and ask can you save my life?
Oh won't you try? And get it right? This time...
I'm waiting on my number, like I've a gave up on my time
I'll wait it out eternally, and hope that I can find
Something that's better for the lovers who are hurting in the rain...
Reciting all their memories whilst god proceeds to wait
Oh won't you try? And get it right? This time...
Do you remember when they came to us and told us what we'd done?
I don't believe I'd mentioned that I don't trust anyone
Who tries to make me out a hater and I lie to everyone?
I am a man who does believe in two becoming none
Oh won't you try? And get it right? This time...
Now you will go!
Now you're on your own!
You left me in my mind with that old song
