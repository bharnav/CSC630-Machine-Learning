Lurking in the shadows of madness
I'm feeling like a fool in the silence
I'm waking up sideways
I'm waking up sideways
Well I'm low 'cause you're here
Got it right, I'm seeing clear
When it's hard to let go
And I think you should know
Moving on from your eyes
Got me down, I feel alive
When you're on my mind
And I hope there's time for me to say
Lurking in the shadows of madness
I'm feeling like a fool in the silence
I'm waking up sideways
I'm waking up sideways
I forgot what to say
What to do when you're away
When you're up i'm down
When you're near I'll find a way to stay
