Hanging on this sunny afternoon
Living old is all I want to do
People watching, what am I to do?
Waking up can never come too soon
When I put these thoughts to rest
I know that I can worry less
Seems that its just something I can’t do
So, oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottle
Oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottom
Oh my God, I spent time with you
Hanging is as hanging does
You know I can't stop crying
Hanging on this sunny afternoon
Nightmares into daydreams if I could
Listen to the thoughts i won't refuse
An open ear would do my heart some good
When I put these thoughts to rest
I know that I can worry less
Seems that its just something I can’t do
So, oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottle
Oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottom
Oh my God, I spend time with you
Hanging is as hanging does
You know I can't stop crying
Standing on my own, I know I got to let it go
Standing on my own, I know I got to let it go
Standing on my own, I know I got to let it go
Let it go.....
So, oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottle
Oh my God, this time I know I've hit the bottom
Oh my God, I spend time with you
Hanging is as hanging does
You know I can't stop crying
Hanging is as hanging does
You know I can't stop crying
