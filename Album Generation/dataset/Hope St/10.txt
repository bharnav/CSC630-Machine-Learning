When a secret tells a lie
It burns a hole into your mind
Misunderstood like you want it to
When secret passes by
It burns a hole into the sky
Misunderstood like you want it to
And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Felt like this before
And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Tell a lie...
When the face begins to shine
Use more words to pass the time
Misunderstood like you want it to
When these walls keep closing in
Close the doors, don't let them in
Misunderstood like you want it to
And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Felt like this before
And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Tell a lie...
So when I come home, when I come home
When I come home tonight
I'm gonna meet you before morning light
As I open up the window to fall down the stairs
At the end of each day, who really cares?
Turn on the light, what do I see?
I see the same three people singing back at me
Another surprise that I'm trying to hide
Because nothing's much better on the outside
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Felt like this before
And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Tell a lie...
It makes me wonder...
