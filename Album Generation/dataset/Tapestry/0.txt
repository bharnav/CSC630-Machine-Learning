[Intro]

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Oh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

[Bridge]

Ooh, darling, when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are something I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby
Uh, ah, ah
Uh, ah, ah yeah

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down

I just lose control
Down to my very soul
I get hot and cold all over
All over , all over, all over

{Outro}

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
Uh Tumbling down
Uh Tumbling down
Uh Tumbling down
Tumbling down
