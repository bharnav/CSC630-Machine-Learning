[Verse 1: Patrick Monahan & Ashley Monroe]
Haven't seen you since high school
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
Quite yet I bet you're rich as hell
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan & both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises

[Verse 2:  Patrick Monahan & Ashley Monroe, both]
Have you seen him? Not in years
How about her? No, but I hear
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams
Funny back then she said that about you
Que sera, you'll never guess who I saw
Remember Johnny B?
Remember him we were best friends, practically
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan & both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises

[Bridge: Patrick Monahan, Ashley Monroe, both]
I would love to fix it all for you
I would love to fix you too
Please don't fix a thing whatever you do

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Monahan]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to know you've got a friend
But you remember now and then
Everybody loses

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan, Ashley Monroe, both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
We all got bruises
We all got bruises
We all got bruises
