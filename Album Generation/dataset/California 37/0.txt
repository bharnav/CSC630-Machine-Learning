[Verse 1]
In '85, Tuesday morning
Came alive, I didn't know ya
Route 66 is gone
And Reagan's here, it won't be long
Nintendo comes, Live Aid, too
Back to the Future, where were you?
While I spent all my days in Catholic school?
In '89, the dream begins
First in line to California
Pete Rose is banned for good
The Simpsons come to Hollywood
Russia leaves Afghanistan, Flight 103 ends Pan Am
Bush is here, this is the year
That I feel most alone

[Chorus]
No more counting down the hours
No more wishing you were here
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Verse 2]
In '92, a boy is born
The skies were blue in Ohio
Boris Yeltsin chills
Freddie dies, but Queen is still
Barcelona has the games
Lady Di is single again
Clinton wins and I still dream
That I'll find you someday
In '97, a baby girl
Adds some heaven to the world
Tony Blair tips the scales
Elton sings for the Princess of Wales
Microsoft buys into Mac
My dad has a second heart attack
And Train leaves San Francisco
In a thousand-dollar van

[Chorus]
No more counting down the hours
No more wishing you were here
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Verse 3]
2001, the towers fell
The World is stunned, I wish I knew ya
I was on a plane, the world would never be the same
The artificial heart is born
Ironic when New York's is torn out
2004, began in May
On tour when I met ya
Facebook joins the Internet
Oldsmobile joins the cassette
I met your family
It took a while until you kissed me
But when you did
I finally felt at home

[Bridge]
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Outro]
2012 and all I know
Is everybody comes and goes
Everybody sings and cries
Makes the grade and takes the prize
In something, nothing, I don't care
Because I always know that you'll be here
With me
