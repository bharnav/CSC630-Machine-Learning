[Verse 1]
Don't cry when I die
When it's my time I probably won't die
I'll just lie down and close my eyes
And think about stuff
These eyes got too wide seen too much of life's goodbyes
Should have spent less time making loot
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And everybody upstairs, everybody downstairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not Jimi Hendrix, Jesus or the dude
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles
You not Chris Farley Mr. Rodgers oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

[Verse 2]
Life is good, but love it's better
Even Bieber ain't forever
We all got to go you know
So you might as well go in style

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everybody praying, everybody singing
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not Gilda Radner, Buddha or the dude
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time
You, not Jesse James, Paul Newman and oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

[Bridge]
I'm not making light of things
But who's to say who's right with things like this
There's so much that we miss
Tryin' so hard to be rich and famous
Pretty and thin, to win
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So forget everything and just be with me here now
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot

[Chorus 3]
You, not Etta James, Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way
You, not Sitting Bull, Ella or Bach and I almost forgot
You can finally meet my Mom

[Verse 3]
No Steve Jobs, or Ty Cobbs, Al Capone or any other mobs
No Whitney Houston, no Chet Baker, Andre the Giant or the Undertaker, just you

[Outro]
You can finally meet my Mom [x4]
