[Verse 1]
If I go before I say
To everyone in my ballet
Let me take this chance
To thank you for the dance
If I run out of songs to sing
To take your mind off everything
Just smile, sit a while

[Pre-Chorus]
With the sun on your face and remember the place we met
Take a breath and soon I bet you'll see
Without you I would never be me
You are the leaves of my family tree

[Chorus]
Sing together
If you knew me from the very start
Or we met last week at the grocery mart
Just sing together
It's the least that I can do
My final gift to you
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oooo

[Verse 2]
When I'm past the pearly gate
I will find some real estate
We can settle down
And watch the world go round
We'll send down all the love we got
Let them know we got a spot
For them to be and it's all free

[Pre-Chorus]
With the sun on your face and remember the place we met
Take a breath and soon I bet you'll see
Without you I would never be me
You are the leaves of my family tree

[Chorus]
Sing together
If you knew me from the very start
Or not at all, you're still a part
Just sing together
It's the least that I can do
My final gift to you
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
