Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I’m callin' you to
I’m callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I guess I could make it without you
If I just didn’t feel so all alone

Don’t let me down
Don’t let me down
I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down
No I won’t
Ya' know I can oh (?), honey
Honey, please don’t

I got my black dog barkin’
Black dog barkin’
Yes it is now
Yes it is
Outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn’t have to try so hard

Your mama’s workin'
Your mama’s moanin'
She’s cryin' ya' know
She’s tryin' ya' know
Ya' better go now
Well, I’d tell you what she wants if I
But I just don’t know how

Fifteen jugglers
Fifteen jugglers
Five believers
Five believers
All dressed like men
Tell your mama not to worry because
Yes, they're just my friends

Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I’m callin' you to
I’m callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you honey
If I just did not feel so all alone
