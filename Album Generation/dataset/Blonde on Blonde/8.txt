You say ya' love me
And you’re thinkin' of me
But ya' know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanta' hold me
But ya' know you’re not that strong
I just can’t do what I done before
I just can’t beg you anymore
I’m gonna let you pass
And I’ll go last
Then time will tell just who has fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say ya' disturb me
And ya' don’t deserve me
But ya' know sometimes you lie
Ya' say you’re shakin'
And you’re always achin'
But ya' know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can’t be this way everywhere
And I’m gonna let you pass
Yes, and I’ll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

Well the, the judge he holds a grudge
He’s gonna call on you
But he’s badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don’t fall on you

Ya' say you’re sorry
For tellin' stories
That ya' know I believe are true
You say y' got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe ya' do
Say my kisses are not like his
But this time I’m not gonna tell you why that is
I’m just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I’ll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
