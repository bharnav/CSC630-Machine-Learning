Before you tell me how loud I can play my music
Before you tell me the way I should raise my kids
Before you try to tell me what to say
You might wanna think about it, yeah
Before you turn my family farming to a strip mall
Before you move another factory overseas
Before you go giving my job away
You might want to think about it, yeah
Think about this land that we live in
Of the rights we've been given
And people who die to make us free
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
You might want to think about it, yeah

Before you try to take away my ten commandments
Before you try to tell me when and where to pray
Before you go messing with my faith
You might want to think about it, yeah

Think about the choice that you're making
And the stance that you're taking
Before you come rolling down my street
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
The ass whippin' you'll get from me

Before you go and try to take away my freedom
Before you go and try to take my voice away
Before you go and make a big mistake
You might wanna think about it
You might wanna think about
You might want to
You might want to
You might wanna think about it
