It's all the same
Only the names have changed
And everyday
It seems we're wasting away
Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night
Just to get back home

'cause im a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
And im wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes its not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times that your alone
All you do is think

'cause im a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
And im wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive

Whooaaa alright yeah

Well I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
And I'm wanted
Dead or alive

And I walk these streets
A loaded six string on my back
And I play for keeps
'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere
Still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces
And I rocked em all

Yeah im a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
And I'm wanted
Dead or alive
I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted
Dead or alive
