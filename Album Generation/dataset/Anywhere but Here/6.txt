I pulled up to a cattle yard
Got on out opened up the gate
I drove down the long dirt road
To the banks of an old 2 acre lake
We had bon fires and barbed wire
Fresh caught catfish in the deep fryer
I jumped out my truck and I said it's on

And everybody sang Hey ya'll
Break out the beer turn the Skynyrd on
Hey ya'll how ya doin, what ya doin?
Hey ya'll, we ain't leavin' till they call the law
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll
Hey ya'll come on

A cloud of dust came rolling in
Blue lights flashin' there were 10 of them
Sheriff Hopper and all of his boys
Said all they had to do was just follow the noise
He dropped his gun and then his star
Reached in his cruiser pulled out his guitar
I said officer what have we done wrong?
He just smiled and me and said nothing at all

Singing hey ya'll
Break out the beer turn the Skynyrd on
Hey ya'll, what ya doin how ya doing?
Hey ya'll, crank it up, we ain't never going home
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll watch this
See that girl over there looking fine
Well I bet you by morning I can make her mine

And everybody sang Hey ya'll
Break out the beer turn the Skynyrd on
Hey ya'll, what you doing? Baby how'm I doing?
Hey ya'll, we ain't leaving till the law goes home
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll come on

Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll
