C'mom baby, won't you take my hand
I wanna walk with you a while
And tell you what's been on my mind
I know this life can get so crazy sometimes
And we forget about the most important things
And I know I've been guilty of gettin' caught up
In the rush of today and the worries of tomorrow
But that ain't the point of my exsistence
No, that's not why I'm breathin'

Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you, lovin' you

Sun and rain and wind and sand
Somehow came together to make this world we're livin' on
Flesh and bone, I'm only human
But I know God had a plan for me
And it took me a while to figure it all out
I had to go down some roads I should've never gone down
But you were all the answers
To every question I was askin'

Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you, lovin' you

Like the glass that holds the wine
The sunset in the western skies
Like the love there in your eyes

Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you, lovin' you

Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you, lovin' you

I was made for lovin' you
C'mom baby, won't you take my hand
Sun and rain, wind and sand
Lovin' you
I was made for lovin' you
Oh, I was made for lovin' you
