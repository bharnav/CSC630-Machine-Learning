Well you can have the truck and the stuff
Baby you can have the house
Yeah you and your lawyer and your new boyfriend can all sort it out
What's left in my pride and these two wheels is all I need
To take me away from somewhere I don't wanna be
Well baby I'm gone, when you read these words, I will be a blurr of chrome
I want to ride, watch the heat waves rise, I wanna feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair
Ya I'll know where I'm goin, when I get there
From what I hear, the beer is cheap down in mexico
I wouldn't mind being where they speak a language I don't know
The altitude of the rockies might be what I need
If anybody ever asks about what happened about me, tell them I'm gone
When you read these words, I will be a blurr of chrome
I want to ride, watch the heat waves rise, I wanna feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair
Ya I'll know where im goin, when I get there
Ya if I miss a turn, it won't make a bit of difference
Baby where we're concern, all I need is a bit of distance
Baby I'm gone. I need to feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair
I'll know where I' goin, when I get there
Baby I'm gone
I'm takin back my hear and hitting the road with these two wheels
Gone gone gone
