I can't know the hell you love
But i know you've had enough
Some baptize in water some in flames
In flames
In flames

Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Look into my eyes with all your hate and scorn
But don't you give me a reason to mourn

What has life done to you
All you ever wanted was someone to run to you
There's more to life then what makes you cry
What makes you cry
I want save you by

Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Look into my eyes with all your hate and scorn
But don't you give me a reason to mourn
I'll remove the crown of sorrow wich you have been adorned
But don't you give me a reason to mourn

Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Don't you give me a reason to mourn
Look into my eyes with all your hate and scorn
But don't you give me a reason to mourn
