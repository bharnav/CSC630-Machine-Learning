You left them swimming for their lives
Down in New Orleans
Can't afford a gallon of gasoline

With your useless degrees
And your contrary statistics
This government business
Is straight up sadistic

And it's black rain
Oh, I said black rain gonna fall

You don't fight for us
But expect us to die for you
You have no sympathy for us
But still I'd cry for you

Now you may kill the revolutionary
But the revolution you can never bury

And it won't be long
'Til the people fill the streets
[Incomprehensible] for you
One and all

That's a black rain
Yeah, that's a black rain, is gonna fall

Don't you dare speak to us like we work for you
Selling false hope like some new dope we're addicted to
I'm not a desperate man but these are desperate times at hand
This generation is beyond your command

And it won't be long
'Til the people flood the streets
Take you down, one and all

It's black rain
Talking 'bout the black rain, gonna fall
Yeah, it's gonna fall, go-gonna fall
One and all
