The more i smoke, the more i drink
The more i talk, the less i think
The less i think, the more i feel
Folks don't change
They just reveal

My mind is broke, my last nerve is shot
What you want from me, i ain't got
Two plus two will never be twenty-two
So please don't tell me twice what i need to do

There's no rules to lust
Only passion, and it can be so unjust
If we don't speak, we'll get along just fine
Don't ask me how i'm doing
'cause i don't feel like lying

Take me as i am
Or leave me the way you found me
