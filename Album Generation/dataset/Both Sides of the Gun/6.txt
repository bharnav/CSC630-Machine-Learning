Goodbye
Hasn't been so good to me
Stepped out into the night
Back against the moon
I saw ten thousand hands with candlelight
We all think that we're right
It's hard to tell
If the night is full of hope or doom

My eyes
Burn with unshed tears
My body is weak
From so many silent years
Too many people say goodbye
Before they say hello
Step into the morning
And disappear

What more than sorry can i say
What more than sorry can i be
Before our love fades away
What more than sorry
Do you want from me
