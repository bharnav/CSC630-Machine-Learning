Battles over which direction to kneel
People reaching out to touch
But forgetting to feel
Daily breath shouldn't be a daily penance
Is that what you believe
Or just a life sentence

I look into the mirror
And i see someone there i used to know
They all want you to serve them
But the only one you got to serve
Is your soul

So much time
And at such a cost
We spend looking for what we've lost
Now that you know
You can't find it from him
You're gonna have to find it within

I look into the mirror
And i see that life has taken its toll
They'll all want you to serve them
But the only one you got to serve
Is your soul

Listen to the wind it won't lie to you
If you love it let it go
And watch it fly to you
Every setting sun gently weeps
You can always hear it
'cause trust never sleeps
