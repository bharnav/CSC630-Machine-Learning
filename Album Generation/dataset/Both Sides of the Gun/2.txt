Now you can sell your soul
But you can't buy it back
I've spent my whole life
Working to give you everything you lack

Now I wish you were here
So we could walk and talk
In the soft rain, in the soft rain
Now all that left of us
Is a picture sitting in a frame

I would gladly trade
All of my sympathy for sorrow
If I could have you, If I could have you here with me to my own

I wish you were here
So we could walk and talk
In the soft rain, in the soft rain
Now all that's left of us
Is a picture sitting in a frame

Everything i wish for
Is everything i see
I remember when your kisses were for me

So many wasted days
The past is so hard to get out from under
So many words that i wish i could say
The future rattles my bones weak like thunder

I wish you were here
So we could walk and talk
In the soft rain, soft rain, soft rain
Now all that's left of us
Is a picture sitting in a frame

Everything i wish for
Is everything i see
I remember when your kisses were for me

Everything i wish for
Is everything i see
I remember when your kisses were for me
