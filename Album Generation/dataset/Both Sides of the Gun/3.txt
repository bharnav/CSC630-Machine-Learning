Like an old man
Sitting alone at a lunch counter
Never leave lonely alone
Like a small town girl
A big city devours
Never leave lonely alone
Some of us laugh
Even in our darkest hour
Never leave lonely alone

Unspoken rules of solitude
Wound without a trace
A lifetime of dreams roll down your face
All that we can't say
Is all we need to hear
When you close your eyes
Does the world disappear

There's something in everyone
Only they know
Never leave lonely alone
It moves in the hidden ways
Of joy and sorrow
Never leave lonely alone
