Throw your hands up to the sky
And scream out loud i'm free
'cause wrong is the new right
So we can cut loose tonight
It costs a lot to look this cheap

Fire makes it burn and water makes it turn
We must still be here living on earth
They keep telling me jesus walked on water
He shoulda surfed

In 1918 the great bambino
Kicked a piano into willis pond
But johnny damon swung a bat
Grand slam that was that
An 86 year curse is gone

Throw your hands up to the sky
And scream i'm not alone
Is it irony or fate
Don't become what you hate
We've all got stardust in our bones
