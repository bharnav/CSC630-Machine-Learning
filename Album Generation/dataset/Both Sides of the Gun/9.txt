I'm a living sunset
Lightning in my bones
Push me to the edge
But my will is stone

'cause I believe in a better way

Fools will be fools
And wise will be wise
But i will look this world
Straight in the eyes

'cause I believe there's a better way
I believe in a better way

What good is a man
Who won't take a stand
What good is a cynic
With no better plan

I believe in a better way
I believe in a better way

(Instrumental)

(hope these words feel pleasant
As they rest upon your ears)

Reality is sharp
It cuts at me like a knife
Everyone i know
Is in the fight of their life

And I believe there's a better way

Take your face out of your hands
And clear your eyes
You have a right to your dreams
And don't be denied

I believe in a better way
