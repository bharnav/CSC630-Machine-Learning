One, two, three

When I walk along your city streets
And look into your eyes
When I see that simple sadness that
Upon your features lies
If my spirit starts to sink
It comes as no surprise
It's been a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to your town, this town

There's a pasture in the countryside
I used to call my own
There's a natural pillow for my head
The grass there's overgrown, yes and no
I think of that place from time to time
When I want to be alone
It's been a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to your town, this town

Now, people live from day to day
But they do not count the time
They don't see the days
Slipping by and neither do I

Now, people live from day to day
But they do not count the time, no
They don't see the days
Slipping by and neither do I

When I walk along your city streets
And look into your eyes
When I see that simple sadness
That across your features lies, I see lines
If my spirit starts to sink
It comes as no surprise
I've come a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to this town, your town
