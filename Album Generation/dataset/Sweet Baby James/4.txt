Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name
Your way and my way
Seem to be one and the same

Mamma don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
But you know I could feel it
On a country road

Sail on home to Jesus
Won't you good girls and boys
I'm all in pieces
You can have your own choice

But I can hear a heavenly band full of angels
And they're comin' to set me free
I don't know nothin' about the why or when
But I can tell that it's bound to be
Because I could feel it, child, yeah
On a country road

I guess my feet know
Where they want me to go
Walkin' on a country road

Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name
Your way and my way
Seem to be one and the same, child

Mamma don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
But I could feel it, Lord
On a country road

Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down a country road
La la la la la

Country road oh yeah
Walkin' on a country road
Country road woah
Country road
