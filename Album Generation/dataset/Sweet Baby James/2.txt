Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
Look at him yawning
Throwing his morning hours away

He knows how to ease down slowly
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know
That sunny skies hasn't a friend

Sunny skies weeps in the evening
It doesn't much matter why
I guess he just has to cry from time to time
Everyone's leaving
Sunny skies has to stay behind

Still he knows how to ease down slow
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know
That sunny skies hasn't a friend

Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
And throws it all away

Looking at the snow and trees that grow outside my window
Looking at the things that pass me by
Wondering if where I've been is worth the things I've been through
Ending with a friend named sunny skies
