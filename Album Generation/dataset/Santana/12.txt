She said, I feel stranded
And I can't tell anymore
If we coming or I'm going
Well, it's not how I planned it
I've got the key to the door
But it just won't open
And I know, I know, I know
Part of me says let it go
That life happens for a reason
I don't, I don't, I don't
It goes, I never went before
But this time, this time
I'm gonna try anything that just feel better
Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better
And I can't find my way
Girl, I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better
She said, I need you to hold me
I'm a little far from the shore
And I'm afraid of sinking
You're the only one who knows me
And who doesn't ignore
That my soul is weeping
I know, I know, I know
Part of me says let it go
Everything must have it seasons
Round and round it goes
And every day's a one before
But this time, this time
I'm gonna try anything that just feels better
Tell me what to do, you know I can't see
Through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better
And I can't find my way
And God I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better
Long to hold you in my arms
To all things I ought to leave behind, yeah
It's really getting nowhere
I think I need a little help this time
Yeah
I'm gonna try anything that just feel better
Tell me what to do, you know I can't see
Through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better
And I can't find my way, girl, I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better
