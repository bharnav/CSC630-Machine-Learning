[Verse 1]
I swapped my innocence for pride
Crushed the end within my stride
Said 'I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver
I love the sound of you walking away
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear, oh
And I am cold
Yes I'm cold
But not as cold as you are
I love the sound of you walking away
You walking away
I love the sound of you walking away
Walking away

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don't you walk away?

[Chorus 1]
No buildings will fall down
Don't you walk away
No quake will split the ground
Won't you walk away
The sun won't swallow the sky
Won't you walk away
Statues will not cry
Don't you walk away
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away?

[Verse 2]
I cannot stand to see those eyes
As apologies may rise
I must be strong, stay an unbeliever
And love the sound of you walking away
You walking away
Mascara bleeds into my eye, oh
And I’m not cold
I am old
At least
As old as you are

La-la-la...

[Pre-Chorus]
And as you walk away
Oh as you walk away
And as you walk away

[Chorus 2]
My headstone crumbles down
As you walk away
The Hollywood wind’s a howl
As you walk away
The Kremlin’s falling
As you walk away
Radio Four is static
As you walk away
Oh as you walk away
Oh as you walk away

[Outro]
The stab of stiletto
On a silent night
Stalin smiles
Hitler laughs
Churchill claps
Mao Tse-Tung
On the back
