[Verse 1]
Well that was easy waiting
Everything's easy now
Oh and the days are "Oh So Normal"
But oh, Hannah
How I miss you
Oh Hannah how I miss you
Oh Hannah how I miss you now

Now

I used to lock myself in your bathroom
Swallowing the codeine kept for your back
Numb, so numb
I'd let your words
Come and come
Eeuuw

[Chorus]
So come
Come on, come
Come on -
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Because I'm leaving you now

That was easy, but how I miss you
Oh that was easy, but how I miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
Now

[Verse 2]
I watched you clean the filth off your phone dial
Swallowing the things your finger picked up
Tongue, your tongue
I watched your tongue licking on
Eeuuw

[Chorus]
So come
Come on, tongue
Come on -
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Because I'm leaving you now

That was easy, but how I miss you
Oh that was easy, but how I miss you
That was easy, but how I miss you
Now

That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
Now
