[Verse 1]
As I took step number four
Into the close of your tenement
You cast your darkened eyes so low
Said we're cold as the step cement

[Chorus]
But I just don't know
Oh what you meant
What you meant

[Verse 2]
So Alec you may want a pill
We are so cruel and to communicate
Without the red stuff being spilled
We must MDMA our sentiment

[Chorus]
But I just don't know
Oh what you meant
What you meant
What you meant

[Verse 3]
If we were feckless we'd be fine
Sucking hard on our innocence
But we've been bright in our decline
Been left as blackened filament

[Chorus]
But I just don't know
Oh
Oh I don't know
No, I don't know
No, I don't know (what did you mean?)
No, I don't know (what did you mean?)
No, I don't know (what did you mean?)
No, I don't know

I've got to get away from
I've got to get away from you

[Verse 4]
But I feel blood inside the vein
I feel life inside the ligament
I feel alive yeah just the same
Same vigor and the same intent

[Chorus]
Oh but I just don't know
If that's what you meant
