[Verse 1]
Some granite wall
Numbs our bones, numbs our all
As we sit on skinny hands
Nothing to say, nothing at all
I don't know you and I don't want to
You're so awkward just like me
But I don't care

[Chorus]
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
And by leaving, we don't stop living you know

[Verse 2]
I'd no idea that in four years
I'd be hanging from a beam
Behind the door of number ten
Singing well, fare thee well, fare thee well, fare thee well
I am leaving
Yes I leave it all to you

[Chorus]
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
And by leaving, we don't stop living you know

I'm the reason you're leaving (leave him alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
And by leaving, we don't stop living you know

[Verse 3]
As we ride along under an optimistic sun
The radio sings that Everybody song by R.E.M
And Here I Am fighting fighting
Yes I'm fighting not to cry
And that's another reason
Why I ought to hate you like I do
Oh like I do, oh like I do

[Chorus]
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
And by leaving, we don't stop living you know

I'm the reason you're leaving (leave him alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (leave him alone)
If we're leaving, we don't stop living you know
