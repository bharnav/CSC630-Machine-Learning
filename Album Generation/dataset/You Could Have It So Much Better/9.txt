You toss in a word and I'm your villain
I see the passion emerged and I'm your villain
But serious, you're so serious
Oh like a waiter
Hating the rich
But taking their tips

If I could laugh, I'd love you
If I could smile at anything you said
We could be laughing lovers
I think you prefer to be miserable instead
If I could love, I'd love you
If I could love like anybody else
Anybody else, anybody else

I know what I am and I'm your villain
Oh no I don't give a damn if I'm your villain
Because serious, you're so serious
But I got ready salted
Ready on your belly
If you wanna have fun

Yeeeesss
See you later, baby see you later
See you later, baby see you later
See you later, baby see you later
...
