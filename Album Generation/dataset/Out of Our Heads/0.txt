[Verse 1]
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said Man, your baby going to leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed

[Chorus]
That's right
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
But if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
I'm going to make it to the nearest river child
And jump overboard and drown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I said hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you trying to do
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
But if you stay baby
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to work two jobs, seven days a week
And bring my money home to you

[Chorus][x2]
