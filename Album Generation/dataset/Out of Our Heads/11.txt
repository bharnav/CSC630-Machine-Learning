[Verse 1]
You need some money in a hurry
But things isnâ€™t right
You try to beg and borrow maybe start a fight
Your friends don't want to know you they just pass you by
So they couldn't be your friends because they wouldn't lie

[Chorus]
Sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try

[Verse 2]
You got to girl that doesn't bring you all she cries
The day turns into night to try to satisfy
You buy her all the things she want she don't improve
You think you'd give her up if you could make that move

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The things that don't matter easy come and go
And the things that satisfy only come real slow
You got to know and watch it all in your mind
Cause it's better when you get it if you really try

[Chorus]
Sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't y you a panic don't you  panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Keep on trying[x5]
You got to keep trying
