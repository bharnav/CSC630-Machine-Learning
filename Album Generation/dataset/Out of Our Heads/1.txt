[Verse 1]
I'm going to Chicago that's the last place my baby stayed
I'm packing up my bags I'm going to leave this town right away
I'm going to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
Chicago City" that's what the sign on the freeway read
I'm going to keep on going until I get to that street's called 6th and Main
I've got to find that girl if i have to hitch hike around the world

[Chorus]
Come on hitch hike
Hitch hike children
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
Come on hitch hike
Hitch hike darling

[Verse 2]
I'm going to St. Louis but my next stop just might be L.A., that's what I say
I got no money in my pocket so i'm going to have to hitch hike all the way
I'm going to find that girl if i have to hitch hike around the world

[Chorus][x2]
