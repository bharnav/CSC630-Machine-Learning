[Chorus 1]
Sitting thinking sinking drinking
Wondering what I'd do when I'm through tonight
Smoking moping, maybe just hoping
Some little girl will pass on by
Don't want to be alone but I love my girl at home
I remember what she said
She said, My, my, my don't tell lies, keep fidelity in your head
My my my, don't tell lies, When you're done you should go to bed
Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead and you're dead

[Chorus 2]
Sit up, fed up, low down go round
Down to the bar at the place I'm at
Sitting drinking, superficially thinking
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left
Then I said, hi, like a spider to a fly
Remembering what my little girl said

[Chorus 3]
She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty
I would have run away but I was on my own
She told me later she's a machine operator
She said she liked the way I held the microphone
Then I said hi like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead in my web

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
