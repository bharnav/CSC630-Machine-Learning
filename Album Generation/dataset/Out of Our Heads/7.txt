[Verse 1]
When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody call you on the phone

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 2]
When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 3]
Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, it just a waste of your time
But you don't ever, you don't ever have to walk alone
You see, so c'mon, take my hand
Come on walk with me
When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night there is no one

[Chorus]
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

[Verse 4]
Yes, I want you to come on baby
Come on, come on cry to me
I want you to come on, baby
Come on, come on and cry to me
Yeah, come on baby, come on I want you to cry, cry, cry to me
Yeah I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
