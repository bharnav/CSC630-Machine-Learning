[Verse 1]
She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Verse 2]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to meet

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram and

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

Oh yeah hey hey
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
So alive I arrive on dust, you can search
My mind for the red on rust I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me going to hear my prayers, I said

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

[Outro]
We are the ones that will make you feel better[x4]
