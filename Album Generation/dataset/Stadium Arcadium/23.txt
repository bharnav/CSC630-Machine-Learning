[Verse 1]
Next stop on the KLM
A two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when
I get a heavy jam
I'm going to turn it into hydrogen

[Chorus 1]
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I

[Verse 2]
Cowgirl and a troubadour
MGM and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I want to show you what
I want to show you what your head is for

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
So much I wish I could
So many I wish I would
So much I wish I could
Count on you not to deplete me

[Chorus 2]
So much I wish I could
So many I wish I would
So much I wish I could
Count on you not to defeat me

[Chorus 3]
Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
Please don't turn away a friend
Please don't turn me into them

[Verse 3]
Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I got to loosen up
I got to loosen up to get my grip

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
What you're going to give them now, oh now
