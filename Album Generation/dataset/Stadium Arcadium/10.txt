[Verse 1]
Warlocks in Wonderland
I've got to megatropolis in my hand
And a subterranean marching band
Making noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a
A little package and off we go
Oh ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe
I know everybody's Eskimo
We've got another thing coming
And that's our show well

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason

[Chorus]
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

[Verse 2]
Lilacs and contraband
I've got Santa Monica in my hand
A little Beatlemania when I can
And I've got two big bags of old Japan
Ring side and blow by blow
Another main event at the old rainbow
We're coming right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason

[Chorus]
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

[Verse 3]
Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane
Warlocks in Wonderland
I've got a Rockapotomus in my hand
With a happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of loving is all I can

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason

[Chorus]
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason

[Chorus]
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in
