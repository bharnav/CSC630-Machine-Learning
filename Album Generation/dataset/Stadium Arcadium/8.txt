[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah
Wow, wow, wow, wow, yeah

[Verse 1]
Arthur J. did indicate it:
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again, (Yeah)
(Aw, say goodbye to your boots, man)
Hot as Hades, early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I'm in love again, (Yeah)
(You gotta lose to win)

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Oh
Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

Oh, hey yeah, oh
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow yeah

[Verse 2]
All in favor, sign a waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside? (Yeah)
(Aw, it will make you cry)
Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing? (Yeah)
(Ah, you only get what you dream)

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Oh
Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Oh
Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
