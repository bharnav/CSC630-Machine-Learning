[Verse 1]
Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-defendant?

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no!)

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump, bump

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

[Verse 2]
Workin' the beat as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent?

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

(C'mon!)

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no!)

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

[Bridge]
Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out

Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now
