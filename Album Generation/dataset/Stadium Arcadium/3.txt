[Verse 1]
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face and I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this where I find the way

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking now

[Verse 2]
Alone inside my forest room and it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
(Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd that it cannot phase)
And I'm calling
(Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs)
And I'm sorry

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing

[Outro]
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming...to you
