[Chorus 1]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 1]
I've got a cousin making beats
Deep down in Arizona
We're going to rocket to Ramone's
In the city of Pomona, go

[Chorus 1]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

[Chorus 2]
And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it

[Chorus 3]
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

[Verse 2]
I've got a sister making babies
With a Black and Decker blow torch
We're going to fop it all night
In the middle of the back porch, yeah

[Chorus 3]
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

[Chorus 2]
And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 4]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

[Verse 3]
I've got a brother making trouble
In the state of California
I wish I knew another way
But I'm gonna have to clone you, hey

[Chorus 4]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

[Chorus 2]
And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it
