[Verse 1]
All aboard... stitching time
Get yours... got mine
In a minute... ill be there
Sit tight... get square
You can do it at the hippodrome
Slide back... trombone
Anybody got a TV at home
That's right... unknown

[Chorus 1]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

[Chorus 2]
So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now
(tic tic tic tic tic tic)
(one one one more)
(wait wait wait wait wait one more)

[Verse 2]
Everybody... do the twist
Get the the message... on Flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down... get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy... will advice
EverReady... in disguise
Sunset... sunrise

[Chorus 1]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

[Chorus 2]
So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now

[Chorus 3]
My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light

[Chorus 1]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

[Chorus 2]
So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now

[Chorus 3]
My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light
My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light
