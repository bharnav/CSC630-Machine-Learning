[Verse 1]
Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With whatever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

[Verse 2]
You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

[Verse 4]
Letâ€™s dance all night and day now
Get down and show the way how
I need to know that you are there
Two things I want to say now
You make it all ok now
I need to know that you are there

[Verse 5]
I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

[Verse 6]
Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick them high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

[Bridge]
We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

[Verse 7]
I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

[Verse 8]
We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doing the astronaut

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

[Instrumental]
