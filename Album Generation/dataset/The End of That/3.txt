[Verse 1]
I was cut
Open on the way down
Reeling
From the blow
And you were there
On the other line
In between the tears
And the lightshow

[Verse 2]
What a disappointment
I thought there'd be so much more
But all this talking
Is driving me insane
And I was told
If I was to sing along
Forget about myself
We're all the same

[Chorus]
Well maybe, I should change my point of view

[Verse 3]
Dizzy in the morning
And I'm shaking in the afternoon
There's never no warning
When it's gonna hit
And I'm like an earthquake
When I get thinking too much
Everything's falling and shaking and falling
Through my hands

[Chorus]
Well maybe, I should change my point of view

[Bridge]
Well, all this time we have together
It's desperation for everybody
It's wishful thinking
For the whole human race or whoever

[Outro]
(In between the tears and the lightshow)
