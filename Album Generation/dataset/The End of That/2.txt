[Verse 1]
Sittin in the sun, blowing smoke and talking shit with no reasons
I'm happy to be out, disconnected from the scene at the hotel
I'm looking forward to a time when my mind is not so easily scattered
And remembering the days when your love was all that mattered

[Verse 2]
The mountains in the distance look so fake, I can't believe it's not real mountains
And postcard illusions are seducing me to consider my options
Oh, a road is not a home but it soothes me like a friend or a lover
It's a chance to coalesce in a van drink some beer and recover

[Pre-Chorus]
There is no one here
You cannot compare me
You cannot compare me
You cannot compare me
There is no one here

[Chorus]
I let you down
Soul sounds
I let you down
Soul sounds

[Verse 3]
Soon, I'll find a place and rent a box and put some stuff in it
Until then, I'll glorify all my vices and just roll with the punches
Oh, the moral of the story almost always ruins every word in it
Sometimes the learning's in the musing, I'm better off at burning some bridges

[Pre-Chorus]
There is no one here
You cannot compare me
You cannot compare me
You cannot compare me
There is no one here

[Chorus]
I let you down
Soul sounds
I let you down
Soul sounds
I let you down
Soul sounds

[Outro]
