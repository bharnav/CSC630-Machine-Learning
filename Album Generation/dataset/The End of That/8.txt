Drive me, drive me, drive me until I'm far away
Hold me, hold me, hold me until I can't resist
Love me, love me, love me in another way
You got some new moves, and I can't take it
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
It's lonely today, just wasted, I'm wasted, I'm wasted
You got some free time, I can take it
It's phone calls and phone calls and phone calls and more phone calls
Like concentration, you gotta shake it
And no one wants to fake it
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
[x2]
All day like it all day
So many days and so many more to come
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
Control me, control me, control me, control me
Like I'm someone else
[x2]
