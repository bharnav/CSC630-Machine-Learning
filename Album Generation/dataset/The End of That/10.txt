All I want is for us to run away
Listen to me it's the sound of the waves
We come together and others are left behind
The background fades and we'll have to decide
Electrical love
The body remembers so much the mind can not
We're getting closer and others are left in town
You touch my hand and I roll the window down
We're living the dream
We're living the dream
We're living the dream
We're living the dream
Down from the hills and under the stars
We roll from the coast to the capital
I never dreamed we'd make it this far
We're running for our lives
Down from the hills and under the stars
We roll from the coast to the capital
Oh man it's just a window in time
It's a dream dreamt and forgotten
We're almost there but so is the end
Now you're my only friend
Now you're my only friend
Down from the hills and under the stars
We roll from the coast to the capital
I never dreamed we'd make it this far
We're running for our lives
