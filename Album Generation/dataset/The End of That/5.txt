2010 is over
Goodbye to the tears of last year
Now I'm alone in someone else's room
I wait inside, the heat pipes cry and the silence sings along
No one can hear me and no one comes near me
No one can hear me and no one comes near me
You can't understand yourself
You need someone else
Your can't understand yourself
You need... someone else
I gave up forever for a few days
Now I'm looking for new ways
Shake it, break it, destroy it to remake it
Shake it, break it, destroy it to make it
You can't understand yourself
You need someone else
You can't understand yourself
You need someone else
Your can't understand yourself
You need...
La la la, la la la...
And you can't distract yourself
And you need someone else
And call it anything you want
La la la, la la la...
