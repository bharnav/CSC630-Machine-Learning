I tried your cocaine
Just to know what it could do
I had to try it again
Just to give it a second chance
But it tore out my soul
Passed out, crashed out on a mat
And that
Was the end of that

Oh lately
I've been such a drag
All down in the dumps man
Moping and dragging
My feets
Coping with a life of luxuries
Focused on my defeats
And all the things it sucks to be
Like the Great One said
"It's a crock o' crap"
And that
Was the end of that

Here we go

Wait, don't go (no no)
You distract me so
You make it so easy
To hide in the scenery
In your vintage jewellery
Like some fucked up bumblebee
Heading for the potpourri
Of the ladies room

Wait, don't go
You turn me on so
With your bee-sting lips
And your pepper-grinder hips
Like a thread and the needle
We're just typical people
We're hoping to be friends
And do cool stuff
And be equal
I think that's where it's at
Can we just say that that
Oh, Was the end of that
(that was the end of that)
Oh, that was the end of that
That (that was the end of that)
Was the end of the that
