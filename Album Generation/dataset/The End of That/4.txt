Holy matrimony! Everyone's getting married or breaking up
And the stroller situation on the sidewalk is way out of control
I thought there would be time to make arrangements and adjust
To the existential crisis that now secretly controls us
Hey mister mister, have you been through this before?
And mademoiselle, can you relate?
I'm getting tired of the free fall
I'm looking forward to the spring
Heartbreak hotel is getting tired and it's drivin' me to sin
Somewhere between a crisis and a pretty good time
Somewhere between a crisis and a pretty good time
Glorify, glorify everything at night
Idle hands, idle hands and nothing but good intentions
It's a beautiful destruction if you can make the pain aight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, you got to get ready for tonight
Somewhere between a crisis and a pretty good time
Somewhere between a crisis and a pretty good time
Somewhere between a crisis and a pretty good, crisis and a pretty good time
It hit me like a notice of recovery
Takin' hits on the road to redemption
It's a chance at salvation
For the broken-hearted believers there's something more
Something more...
