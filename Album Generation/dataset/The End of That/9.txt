Do you fear loneliness?
Do you fear getting left behind?
All your friends are getting married
And having a time
Do you fear commitment?
Or you never wanna get tied down?
Run wild like a child in the wilderness
Until the sun goes down
And you ask your friends
And I ask mine too
And they got no ideas
About me and you
Do you remember feeling
Like everything was gonna work out?
Peaches in the summer in the sunshine
And no doubts
Well forget about the peaches
The summer and the sunshine too
Cause the winter's got a way of throwing punches
It's turning black and blue
And you ask your friends
And I ask mine too
And they got no ideas
About me and you
About me and you
