Love me now and leave me in spring
The sun done come and changed everything
What looked good in the winter don't look good no more
Forget about me and everything that came
Before
Before

Open your heart before you make that choice
Oh, just a child
Looker at nine with the beautiful voice
Memories I can't handle from before
From before
From before
From before

On another day
