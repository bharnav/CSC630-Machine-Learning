Oh, the sandman is running
Oh, he ain't telling you why
But she knows, yeah she knows
Oh, the thunder is roaring
Oh, hear his wings in the sky
And he knows
She don't know, she don't know, she don't know
She don't know, she don't know, she don't know why
Oh why
Oh-oh, she wants it bad, oh-oh
Oh-oh, she wants it bad, oh-oh
When you're lost and found a brand new friend
Here comes another happy end
Mm, now the fat man is falling
Oh, see that tear in your eye
'Cause you know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know why
Oh why
Oh oh, she wants it bad
Oh, now the new day is dawning
Oh, till their pasts mystify
And you know
We don't know, we don't know, we don't know
We don't know, we don't know, we don't know why
Oh why, why, why
