[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Was she told when she was young that pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Outro: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl
