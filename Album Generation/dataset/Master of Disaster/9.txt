He's the old school
He don't say
When he's hurtin'
He'll just hide away

'till it 's over
And tears are dry
He's the old school
And you can't see him cry

He was young once
Just like you
A heart wide open
To a love that is true

He thought he found it
Now she's gone
And he's the old school
Of love from now on

He's just a student
Like us all
Learned a lesson
By taking a fall

There's noting new in
This love game
In the old school
It's always the same

He's the old school
He don't say
When he's hurtin'
He'll just hide away

'till it 's over
And tears are dry
He's the old school
And you can't see him cry

He's the old school
You can't see him cry
