In the forest of no gravity
Where birds mock reality
We laid out some bread crumbs
Yeah but somebody ate 'em

Always thought we'd make it here
But here keeps movin'
How much blood
How many tears
It's never been proven

Love's not where we thought we left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
Caged love in tried to protect it
Love's not where we thought we left it

The apostles were jealous
Of Mary Magdalene and jesus
Said why do you love her more than us
Jesus turned back in disgust
Said why do I love her more than you
The answer is a question
Just ask yourself what can I do
To gain my lord's affection

Love's not where you thought you left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
Caged love in tried to protect it
Love's not where we thought we left it

When men become more ladylike
I'll see you in the candlelight
When women come to be like men
We'll be ashamed to fight again
No jealous god's the only one
Father, mother, ghost and son

Love's unorthodox
Changes all of nature's clocks
To time remaining
Just twenty-four hours
For lovers in training
Bitter, salty, sweet and sour

Love's not where we thought we left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
Love's not where we thought we left it
Who took the last of love and kept it
Love's not where we thought we left it
