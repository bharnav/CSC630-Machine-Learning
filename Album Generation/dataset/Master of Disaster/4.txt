We made a pact
Lying there on our backs
Swearing to every star
That the sky did hold

Promising our love was true
Promising to see it through
Then we headed due southwest
Across the muscle shoals

We slid down a riverbank
In the pouring rain giving thanks
For the strength just to carry on
Through the fog and the cold

There at the water's edge
She tugged my arm
And I nodded my head
Just one more step
And that river took a hold

When my love crosses over
I'm coming over too
To cross that mighty river that's before us
To the new western world
Mountains high and plain unfurled
Desert stretching out
To touch the californias

We said we'd never look back
We never have and that's a fact
That Mississippi washed us clean
Down to the bone

The journey's been long my friend
Hell, you never know what state you're in
Yeah, but the unknown
It's always the unknown

When my love crosses over
I'm coming over too
To cross that mighty river that's before us
To the new western world
Mountains high and plain unfurled
Desert stretching out
To touch the californias

I lost track of you a while
But you were waiting for me with a smile
Made me feel like a little child
With a brand new view

Let's do it all over babe
It'd just be another trip we made
When my love crosses over
I'm coming too
