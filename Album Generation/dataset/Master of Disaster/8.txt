We were coming down the old turnpike
Horse hooves pounding, sledgehammer night
You can tell 'em anything you like
I was there with you baby

Silver and diamonds and a skin full of tears
The road narrowed then it disappeared
Maybe you figured you might
Wind up some place like here

Acting like you never cared for me baby
Now you shake me off
Like the dust your boots are wearing
The leather's soft but I'm cold and fast

Makes me cough
'til I feel my lungs are tearing
I'll never rest 'til I find you at last
Find you at last

The ground we covered's cracked and spit with rain
Not enough here to fill the smallest vein
Be all right if this god-forsaken terrain
Just dried up and blew away baby

Maybe my memory's just not right
But we've been baptized by fire and light
Eaten by the earth
Swallowed up by the night
I don't care where you think
You're gonna stay baby

Now you shake me off
Like the dust your boots are wearing
The leather's soft but I'm hard and fast
Makes me cough
'til I feel my lungs are tearing
I'll never rest 'til I find you at last
Find you at last
Find you at last
Find you at last baby
Find you at last

I've been searching for an answer
What a waste of time
Should've picked your trail up sooner
But I couldn't stop the pain
That was breaking up my mind

So I found some open country
I forgot the past
I don't care if you don't want me
'cause nothing matters any more baby
'til I find you at last

Tonight you're sleeing on a cold dirt floor
And in my dreams I'm crashing through your door
But you don't recognize me anymore
Do you baby

'til I find you at least
Find you at last
Find you at last baby
Find you at last
Find you at last
'til I find you at last
Find you at last
