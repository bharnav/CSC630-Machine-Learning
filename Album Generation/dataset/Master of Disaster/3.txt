I've been too long with my nose in a book
I hope you sing just as good as you look
Come on over baby, I got a song for you
A little jump of something I call
The wintertime blues

I wanna hear those mockingbird wings
I want gravy on everything
Lovin' in the kitchen
What have we got to lose
Just a nasty case of
These ol' wintertime blues

Cold as snot with a big frozen smile
Ain't foolin' nobody after a while
Time to let the cat out
I've got a real short fuse
I'm just about to blow up
These ol' wintertime blues

There's no spring
There was never any spring
Spring's a long gone thing
There won't ever be a spring no more

At least that's the way it feels when your
Skin is cracked and peeled
And you've been livin' under
Sixty pounds of blanket
And the snow's drifting up to your window
And you're out of firewood
And the wolf is howling at your door

Three hours of day light
And all of them gray
The suicide prevention group has all run away

I'm running out of groceries
I ain't got no rubber shoes
Bring the bacon baby
I got the wintertime blues

I could cut a hole in the floor
Catch you a fish by a quarter to four
But I'm stuck up this mountain
Where I got a bird's eye view
Of couple more months of these
Ol' wintertime blues

And it's a one, two
My lips are turning blue
Come on over baby
What have we got to lose
Just a nasty case of
These ol' wintertime blues

And it's three, four
I'm stiff as Al Gore
Come on over baby
What have we got to lose
Just a nasty case of these ol'
Wintertime blues

Well, it's the same old drill
For Punxsutawney Phil
If he sees his own shadow
I'm shootin' to kill

Come on over baby
I stand accused
There's a man going crazy up here
With the wintertime blues
