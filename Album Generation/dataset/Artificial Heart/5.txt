[Verse 1]
Down to three, I don't like to lose a man
Third location and a second-string team and one awful plan
It's up to us, this is what we came here for
Had enough trouble, but the trouble wants more

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna straighten up
I don't wanna fly right
I just wanna drive around a while and
Bust a couple things up with the bad kids

[Chorus]
And I feel better already
And I feel better already

[Verse 2]
You don't know what you're trying to take from me
You don't like it messy, but it's gonna get as messy as it wants to be
Wind me up, set me down and look away
I can see the bottom and the bottom's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna straighten up
I don't wanna fly right
I just wanna drive around a while and
Bust a couple things up with the bad kids

[Chorus]
And I feel better already
And I feel better already
And I feel better already
And I feel better already
