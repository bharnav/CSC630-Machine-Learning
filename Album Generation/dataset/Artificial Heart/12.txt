Tell me what you think I've been doing wrong
I'm too high to hear what you say
Maybe write a letter if it takes too long
I won't come down today

Found a pretty girl who loves me true
I don't ask why, and she won't say
I'm about ten miles over you
I won't come down today

[Chorus]
I just bought a balloon
Me and the girl, takin' a ride
Float just under the moon
Dumping your things, over the side

If you're gonna leave, could you let me know?
I won't try to make you stay
Gonna throw a party on the day you go
I won't come down today

[Chorus]

I might be coming home but I don't know when
I'm up so high, I might float away
I don't ever wanna come down again
I won't come down today
I won't come down today
I won't come down... today
