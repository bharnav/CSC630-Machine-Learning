Here at the bar who cares what I do
I'm all alone but I'm drinking for two
Drowning the man that I used to be
Nobody loves you like me

I won't sign a thing, or else if I do
I'll use a pencil and that will show you
How nothing lasts, how nothing is free
Nobody loves you like me

I shouldn't stay, I think you'll agree
It's no good for you, no better for me
In the morning I'll go to a place far away
Somewhere you'll never find me

I catch a look, a thing that you say
Out on the fire escape smoking all day
Missing someone, now who could it be
Nobody loves you like me

Noises outside, the trucks in the street
Will cover my flight, my hero's retreat
I'm supposed to feel bad but I don't anymore
Only when you remind me

Air in my lungs, a cough and a wheeze
Holes in the bellows and blood on the keys
You move along, there's nothing to see
Nobody loves you like me
Nobody loves you like me
