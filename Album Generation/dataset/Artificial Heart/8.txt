I am glad to be shopping here with you
I will sit on this chair til you're through
I will wait with your purse
I won't wander off and leave it
I am glad to be shopping here with you

And you know I'll be fine by myself because
I also am alone at home
I'm alone at home

I would love to swing by the candle store
I agree we can always do with more
You just get what you want
And we'll find someplace to keep it
I would love to swing by the candle store

And you know I'll make room for your shit because
I also am alone at home
I'm alone at home

No I don't want you to make it up to me
I just don't want anyone to see the way we are
When we're this way
Can we just not make this a thing

We can stop at your parents' on the way
We haven't seen them at all since yesterday
We can talk about plans
For your cousin's birthday party
We can stop at your parents' on the way

And you know I'll pretend to be nice because
I also am alone at home
I'm alone at home
I'm alone at home
I'm alone at home
