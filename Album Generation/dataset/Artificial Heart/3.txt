Out of the clear blue cloudless skies
A bolt of lightning came
Were you at least a bit surprised
When angels spoke your name?

They said it's you
Who puts the gravity in the ground
They said it's you
Who all the stars revolve around
Scientists were wrong
And you suspected all along it might be true
The world belongs to you

No one escapes the things they've done
A fate that fits the crime
You've got a plan for everyone
Where do you find the time?

Because it's you
Dancing the planets on a string
And it's you who's got to handle everything
There'll be hell to pay
Unless we all behave the way you want us to
The world belongs to you

From inside these limousines
The world is looking darker every day
And you wonder if that means
That when you close your eyes it goes away
It goes away

Tie up your loose ends one by one
Your time is almost through
Even your angels think you're done
They roll their eyes at you
Because it's you
Who's getting bigger every day
And it's you
Who's gonna drive them all away
As they turn to go
You can forgive them for they know not what they do
The world belongs to you
