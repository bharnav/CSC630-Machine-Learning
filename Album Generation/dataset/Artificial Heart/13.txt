On the day she finally left me
She left one thing behind
Just a small box on the table
That she wanted me to find
There was something bad inside it
It was something that I should have left alone

[Chorus]
Now everything is standing still
It was only my head that made it revolve
Everything was fine until
It was awful instead
Now watch me dissolve

It was mine now, something secret
Something precious and rare
And then it changed me, and I liked it
Now I wish it wasn't there
Would you cancel my appointments
Pretty sure I won't be coming in today

'cause [Chorus x2]

It's too late to say I'm sorry
Anyway it's not true
There's a small box on the table
And I left it there for you
And I really hope you like it
If you need me I'll be anywhere but here

[Chorus]
