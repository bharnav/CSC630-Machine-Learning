They gave me a test to make me the best that I could be
They knew all along that there was something wrong with me
We picked out a spot and made a hole
Wire and glass and stainless steel
Now I can imagine how I'd feel

[Chorus]
I got a new heart
I got a new heart
I got a new heart
I got a new artificial heart
It's not a real heart
It's not a real heart
It's not a real heart
It is a real artificial heart

There's blood on the bed but here in my head I'm feeling fine
It's easy to sleep when I'm not buzzing all the time
So funny the way I was before
Once I was blind but now I see
Once I was him but now he's me

[Chorus]

You're happy again, I nod and pretend to think it through
I don't need to think at all if I don't care for you
It's not an emergency for me
I look at the walls and they go clear
I cover my eyes and disappear

[Chorus]
