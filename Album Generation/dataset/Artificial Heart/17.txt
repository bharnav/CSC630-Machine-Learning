In the bag was a razor made for delicate skin
Shaved the peach fuzz, but only on my cheeks and chin

Now I'm rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
Everyday you can watch it grow
Now I'm rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
All this time finally you know
What lips are for, no one can ignore the stache

It's a big school, I think about if Tom went here
We'd be so cool, double dating at the prom next year

We'd be rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
Tender hearts, breaking one by one
We'd be rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
Ladies please, there's room for everyone
Who wants a try, no one dares deny the stache

Men of action all that matters is the bottom line
Grow a nice one and get ready for your time to shine

Keep on rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
Strain the world, let the good stuff in
Keep on rockin' the stache (I'm rockin' the stache)
Make your stand, celebrate the skin
Beneath your nose, ever grander grows, the stache
