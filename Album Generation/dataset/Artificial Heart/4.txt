I had a great time today with your wife
Under an awning
We had to stop there, wait for a while
Because it was raining
And we talked about you
Til the storm had passed through

You should have been there
You should have been there

It rained a long time, the kids didn't mind
Splashed on the sidewalk
And we both agreed that it was too long
Since we had a good talk
Everyone seemed okay
But then she'd never say

You should have been there
You should have been there

Stupid car stuck in the snow
Getting home, too late to go
I'm not saying anything
Just thought you'd want to know

When the rain stopped we checked the sky
Headed for home then
I said I would call, kissed her goodbye
Waved to your children
And the clouds burned away
To a warm sunny day

You should have been there
You should have been there
You should have been there
