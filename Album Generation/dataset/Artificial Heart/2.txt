It's an amazing smile
Even the suit has teeth
Everything flash and guile
And nothing underneath
Except a small black heart that no one sees but me
I've been watching, I can see you start to wonder

[Chrous]
Could it be that you need me
To keep you out, to run you faster
Promise me you'll let me be
The one, the worst of all your enemies
Pretending you're a friend to me
Say that we'll be nemeses

Being a brilliant man
Going to great expense
Devising a master plan
Doesn't make much sense
Unless you find the one you're destined to destroy
Now that you're here I don't seem that crazy do I?

[Chrous]
Could it be that you need me
To keep you out, to run you faster
Promise me you'll let me be
The one, the worst of all your enemies
Pretending you're a friend to me
Say that we'll be nemeses

Ah yes, my old friend
You are a master of this game
The hidden blade when you pretend
That you don't even know my name
Well played

Sometimes it's hard to tell
If you even notice me
Maybe it's just as well
It's better you don't see
The way I'm running just to keep your back in view
In your shadow waiting for the perfect moment

[Chrous]
Could it be that you need me
To keep you out, to run you faster
Promise me you'll let me be
The one, the worst of all your enemies
Pretending you're a friend to me
Say that we'll be nemeses
