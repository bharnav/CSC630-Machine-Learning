Always tryin' to put me down
Did ya think that I would drown
(Whatever makes your world go round)
It's just sticks and stones but you'll never stop me

Doesn't matter how much you try
You can't touch what I got inside
(I'll rise above it every time)
It's just sticks and stones but you'll never stop me

You might annoy me, but ya can't destroy me
In fact if anything it makes me stronger
Now wotcha gonna say 'cos...

You lose
Game over, I showed ya
You choose
Where to go from here
And it's obvious to me
You're a victim of your own jealousy yeah
That's too bad, you're so sad
'cos you lose, game over

Mirror mirror on the wall
I was the fairest of them all
(But now you wanna see me fall)
I'm still standin' you'll never stop me
Tell me where do you get off
Puttin' 'bout your nasty stuff
(You don't know when enough's enough)
I'm still standin' you'll never stop me

You berate me, try to break me
In spite of everything it makes me stronger
Now wotcha gonna say 'cos...

You lose
Game over, I showed ya
You choose
Where to go from here
And it's obvious to me
You're a victim of your own jealousy yeah
That's too bad, you're so sad
'cos you lose, game over

I'm not listening to what you say
Moving on, going all the way
Seeya later!

You lose
Game over, I showed ya
You choose
Where to go from here
And it's obvious to me
You're a victim of your own jealousy yeah
That's too bad, you're so sad
'cos you lose, game over

Always tryin' to put me down
Did ya think tha tI would drown?
I'm still standing you'll never stop me
I'm still standing you'll never stop me
