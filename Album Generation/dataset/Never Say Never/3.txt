(What have you done to me)
(What have you done to me)
I want you to forgive me
(What have you done to me)
I want you to forgive me
(What have you done to me)

Now's the time to look further to the future
On the line our planet's warnings go unheard
The world is sending an S.O.S. to us all
Is sending an S.O.S. but her call
Is lost in confusion as she falls

I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
For all our mistakes
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we waste
With so much at stake
Please know that I need you to forgive me
Don't say it's too late
That we've sealed your fate
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
(What have you done to me)

Like a child you need our love and protection
Now defiled we all stand guilty of our crime
The world is sending an S.O.S. to us all
Is sending an S.O.S. but her call
Is lost in our greed for having it all

I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
For all our mistakes
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we waste
There's so much at stake
Please know that I need you to forgive me
Don't say it's too late
That we've sealed your fate
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
(What have you done to me)
(Why don't you look after me)
(What have you done to me)

I want you to forgive me
(What have you done to me)
I want you to forgive me
(What have you done to me)
I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
For all our mistakes
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we waste
There's so much at stake
Please know that I need you to forgive me
Don't say it's too late
That we've sealed your fate
Please know that I want you to forgive me
For all that we take
(What have you done to me)
