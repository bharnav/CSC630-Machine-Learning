You promise to love me and stay by my side
To honor, respect me 'till the day that I die
Now I don't wanna say that those words are not true
But this I should tell you before you say I do

Oh baby obey me and you won't regret it
Don't play me, betray me, 'cause I won't forget it
But if you want my love 'till you can't take any more
Oh baby obey me and I will be yours

Now love's so confusing when two people lead
So I'm here to tell ya that's not what you need
It's not complicated just do as I say
I'm ready to love you, let's go all the way

Oh baby obey me and you won't regret it
Don't play me, betray me, 'cause I won't forget it
But if you want my love 'till you can't take any more
Oh baby obey me and I will be yours
