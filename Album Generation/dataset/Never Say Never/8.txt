I fly

Written by: R.E. Orrall/J. Coplan

You're like a rush, a killer crush
Straight to my brain
And when I'm down you come around
You numb the pain

Touching your skin is a head spin
I need another hit of you
Licking your lips is a wet trip
You're everything I wanna do

I Everytime I close my eyes and think of you I fly, fly
I Everytime I know I'll get a drink of you I fly, fly

You are my fix, the perfect mix
Of right and wrong
You chill my spine below the line
Where you belong

I need my fill, where's the next thrill
It's right there in your fingertips
I just can't talk, total shell shock
Baby when you flip my switch

I Everytime I close my eyes and think of you I fly, fly
I Everytime I know I'll get a drink of you I fly, fly

High above the ground
I don't wanna come down
I fly

You're like a rush, a killer crush
Straight to my brain
And when I'm down you come around
You numb the pain
