I watch you go
Now I have to face another night
Where time goes slow
I find places in my mind

Now I understand
We're in different worlds
And there's just no reason
And I can't pretend that I'm not in love

And I - I wanna touch you baby
(Feel you next to me)
And I - can't get through
(I can't get, can't get through to you)
And why - Why do I miss you baby
(Even when you're next to me)
Maybe I'm crazy - It's you

Surprised myself
This time it's not me act this way
I hide my tears
And keep my pride and lock my heart away

Now I never planned
To get myself in this situation
It's in your hands
Could you fall in love?

And I - I wanna touch you baby
And I - can't get through
And why - Why do I miss you baby
Maybe I'm crazy - It's you

Imagine our lives with us together
Impossible dreams come true
I still believe Never say never
My head's in the clouds
I'm not coming down
I'm gonna take my chances

And I - I wanna touch you baby
And I - can't get through
And why - Why do I miss you baby
Maybe I'm crazy

And I - I wanna touch you baby
And I - can't get through
And why - Why do I miss you baby
Maybe I'm crazy - It's you
