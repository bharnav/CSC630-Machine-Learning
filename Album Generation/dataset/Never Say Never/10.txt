Thinkin' here we go again
Tell me will it ever end
Contending for who's right or wrong
We're becoming enemies
Taking all my energy
Why can't we get along

I don't know you anymore
Where's the man that I adored?
I've lost him in this war of words
Torn apart
So where to go from here now?

'Cos my heart can't let you go
Hard as I try
Baby time won't heal my soul
Losing you losing myself... again
I can't see tomorrow
No my heart can't let you go
It's lost without you

Do we carry on like this
In a spiritual abyss
Just waiting for the winds of change
Reminiscing with a friend
You said our love would never end
I need those words again

After all is said and done
Through it all you're still the one
I want you to come back to me
Fight for love
Now before it's too late

'Cos my heart can't let you go
Hard as I try
Baby time won't heal my soul
Losing you losing myself... again
I can't see tomorrow
No my heart can't let you go
It's lost without you
