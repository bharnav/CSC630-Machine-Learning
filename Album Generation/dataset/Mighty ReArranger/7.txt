There'll be dancing in heaven
On the night before the longest day
A celebration in rhythm
At this time it was always this way
Sing out for the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine so fine
That we can make it this way

Sing the song of the ages
Giving voice on this beautiful night
Feed the flame in high places
From the earth to the giver of light
Sing out for the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine so fine
That we can make it this way

Bringing peace to the valley
Carry fire through the oaks and the grove
Precious memory carry
As we move through the circles and stones
Sing out to the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine, So fine
That we can make it this way
