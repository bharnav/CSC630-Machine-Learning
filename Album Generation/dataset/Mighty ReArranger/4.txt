Swift and true - straight to my heart
Love has come courting and I'm back there again
I pour myself a brand new start
Glad to be falling for the beauty within

All the king's horses - all the king's men

I'm on the outside looking in
Over and over and over again
There's no telling where I've been
How I returned here - how much I have seen

All the king's horses - all the king's men

I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love

I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love
I am your soldier of love

Glad to be falling for the beauty within
The beauty within, the beauty within
