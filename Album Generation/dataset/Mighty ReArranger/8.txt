Big star, she rise, she warn
Mamma, it ain't long before the day
Red rooster, he crow, he want
Blue moon on the wane
Old black snake, he crawlin', slip slidin'
Crawlin' across my floor
Old mule come, he jumpin', he kickin'
Kickin' in my stall
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
I hear it, 'round midnight
I hear it, somebody knockin' on my door
I hear it, 'round midnight
Somebody knockin' on my door
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
