Last night as I was laying down and thinking
I was wondering about the road that lies ahead
In my mind I heard the wisdom of the Master
Hey Robert those dreams are only in your head

Last night as I was dreaming about the future
Living out my time the days and years ahead
I was moving with the Mighty Rearranger
I was thinking about the wisdom that he said

Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger

Last night as I was walking with an angel
Sweet talking and romancing in my mind
I live my life I know is filled with danger
She tell me daddy good love is hard to find

Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger

Last night I came upon a stranger
He smiled at me and this is what he said
If you're troubled send your mind out on vacation
Let it wonder like the wild geese in the west
Let it wonder like the wild geese in the west

Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
Mighty Rearranger
