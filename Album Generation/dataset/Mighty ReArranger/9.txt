And I open my eyes
As the sun leaves the western sky
Precious memory dies
Once again you are here at my side

Blow wind blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
And I'm back on the hill
Yes you've gone but you're with me still
Now I'm way down the line
Yes you're gone but you're still on my mind

Blow wind blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
I've been walking with strangers and talking all out of my mind
While the dogs in the manger, elusive and so hard to find
Conversations with angels, I seek the dimensional key
I been wheeling and dealing whatever will bring you to me

Blow wind blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
Blow wind blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow

I've been walking with strangers and talking all out of my mind
Now the dogs in the manger, elusive and so hard to find
Conversations with angels, I seek the dimensional key
I been wheeling and dealing whatever will bring you to me
