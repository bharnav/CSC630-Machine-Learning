[Pre-Hook: Pleasure P (x2)]
Girl you make me say.. (OH)
Girl I make you say .. (OH)
You make me say.. (OHH)

[Hook: Pleasure P]
Call me...if you need some lovin' for the night
Call me...you ain't gotta dial the number twice
Call me...babygirl I lick but don't bite
Call me...when it's time to turn off all the lights

[Verse 1: Slick'Em]
Call me
You can call me anytime, anyday cause I like my women feisty, baby
I'm a take ya on a fast ride of ya lifetime that's gonna drive ya crazy
You dealin' wit duds and tell ya the truth they can't come close to me
I'ma a Bluestar, babygirl and I'm built with plenty of energy
But when it comes to sex, I'm a real women scholar
Just hit me on my sidekick and know yo' boy gon' holler
Got you reminiscin' his love ain't true, his love is fiction
I'm tired of sittin' give me a call, I'll be there in a minute

[Hook: Pleasure P (x2)]
Call me...if you need some lovin' for the night
Call me...you ain't gotta dial the number twice
Call me...babygirl I lick but don't bite
Call me...when it's time to turn off all the lights

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Yeah
When ya home alone just hit my phone when you're lonely, girl
You so beautiful, I made you my tenderoni, girl
And I like my girl with some meat and not just some lil' bony girl
And I do like bony girls but long as they not phony girls
Call me up when you turn off ya lights
Might show you a couple things that you'll like
And you ain't never got to dial my number twice
Cause I'll be there quicker than some minute made rice, so

[Hook: Pleasure P (x2)]
Call me...if you need some lovin' for the night
Call me...you ain't gotta dial the number twice
Call me...babygirl I lick but don't bite
Call me...when it's time to turn off all the lights

[Verse 3: Baby Blue]
Yeah
Baby Blue
Whoa
You called me I'm headed up yo' block tryna hit yo' spot
Have that Victoria Secret on when you feel that knock
I see you peepin' out yo' window when you hear my ride
Open yo' door and let me come inside (Come inside)
We can role play I'll be a dirty cop
Headed up yo' block, making it hot
Lock you up in some handcuffs
Throw away the key to the lock
I'm 24/7 like 7/11
Know we better stop when I hear you yellin'
So call me, page me, I'm on the way depending on yo' attitude, baby

[Pre-Hook: Pleasure P (x2)]
