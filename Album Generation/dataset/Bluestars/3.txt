[Verse 1: Baby Blue]
Count my paper stack my weight up
She's a gold digger, but I ain't gone hate her
I'd still date her cut her like a brand new razor
Fine like some old wine in the 'fridgerator
Too much flavor
Sweeter than nowalaters
Hook her then bait her, recieve her like the raiders
I'm that player, I'm that balla, regulate her, crushin' haters
In the baby blue gators

Now only I scratch nipple but I don't bite
Got me paralyzed off your sexy hips and your thighs
And like ooh gasolina wanna jump on your trampolina
Got them bombinas in the winner
Mama come her now I wanna spend the night

Plus you from the projects you remind me of my poor little rich girl
