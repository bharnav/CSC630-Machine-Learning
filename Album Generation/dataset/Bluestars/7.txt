[Baby Blue]
I got a blue Impala
On some blue reams
When I'm stompin in New York I wear my blue Tims
I'm a blue star, rapper not a singer
I got blue leather interior and blue power rangers
Blue diamonds in my grill, blue underwear
New blue socks, blue rocks in my watch
Blue air force ones when I'm chillin wit Nelly
Got girls puttin I love you Baby Blue cross they belly
Baby Blue being true for dat Baby Blue clue
Ain't no proof getting these chicken loose
I bet they do
Pretty Ricky and Pitbull
Tellin Miami wat they do
I'm a gangsta 4-0 G
Interior sittin on Guicci seats
I rub my cuts, my Nike's clean
Baby Blue, Pretty Ricky
Man not be, be
You see, I see, you see
Baby got blue ice in my teeth
And I see, you see, we be
Crusin round the block in a blue Bentley
With no show fa, keeping a costa, in a hosta
You in yo testrosta
We crusin in a end a coasta

[Chorus]

[Spectacular]
Blue Bentley wit the blue rims
Customized wit the chromed grill
Platinum chain wit the blue gyms
Blue fitted wit the blue Tims
Blue stars to click the claim
Blue ice all in my chain
Blue panties comin off yo dame
Blue cards like a poker game
Chevy on 20's and I'm shinin
Hangin out my car cause I'm always clownin
Anything I see that I want I'm a buyin
And if I'm lyin, I'm flyin
Right now we got the biggest deal
Picture this forty mill
Keep 'em thinking that's how it is
So open yo mouth, show yo grill

[Chorus]

[Slick 'Em]
Give me a blue verse (blue verse)
Wit the blue skirts (wit the blue skirts)
Baby blue cut seats, got to make it work (got to make it work)
Blue diamonds in my teeth (my teeth)
Blue diamonds in my chain (my chain)
Don't like it, don't talk to the game playa
I'm off the chain (I'm off the chain)
Now y'all can't mess wit a balla
Fine girls check boys, y'all know we got 'em
Pass the one on the test
We gone get 'em all
Homeboy you softer than cotton
Now you have a problem huh
Cause people round here loose life everday
Dat's M-I-A, dat's kind of ya day like
Give me my money, forget the fame
Now Slick 'Em down wit the nigga
Dem boys got lyrics dat's lethal
Lick you, hit you, and flip you
Leavin you cripple where you stand playa
I bet you a hater, I bet you afender
It's sarcasm
Spec, Pleasure, Baby Blue, and Slick 'Em
And we dem Blue Stars playa's

[Chorus]
