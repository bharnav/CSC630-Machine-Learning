Yeah, this ya boy pleasure, the fine pleasure
To all the ladies who like pleasure
Age ain't nothing but a number
Pretty Ricky and the Mavericks

It ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number
Ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number

[Hook]
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin but a number (number baby)

I'm a young man, but my dick grown up
I like to beat it open with your legs sho' up
I'm the one you call when you wanna get fucked
Hit you in the house, in the car, in the truck
Baby bend over, let me hit you from the back
I'mma show you how Stella got her groove back
How you feel like a little girl
Stickin for your boyfriend, leavin' your window cracked
I get a phone call everyday weekly
Legs open easy
The meanin' of L.O.V.E, babyblue, B.A.B.Y.B.L.U.E
Have you spellin you my name in yo sleep
I beat that drum like the energizer bunny
Keep goin' and goin', goin' and goin'
Show ya that an old man can't do ya like I can
I'll flip it and keep ya moanin'

[Hook]
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number

You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number

I know you been goin' through some changes
People got you anglin' in different directions
Now it's time for the best
Sit down on the bed gurl
Let me teach you what lesson I'm talkin' 'bout
Havin sex 'n' a little romance and a little affection
I'm talking' 'bout headboard bangin'
Forget about dem other ones, ain't noboyd gonna do you like (ahh)
Nothin' but a number, girl
Tryin to blow your mind and make you wonder girl
Trying to hit you with this thunder girl
Trying to make this bedroom rumble girl
Say turn the page to another chapter cause you want
Matter nothin'thats matter
I'm your servent, your my master
I'm tryin to climb this latter happily ever after

[Hook]
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number

You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin but a number (number baby)

Don't waste no time, just gimme your hand
Let's walk on the sand, spend a couple of grand
Approachin' your body with sex appeal
On the real, me and you could just chill
I'm talkin' 'bout black action, satisfaction
Guarantee you wip lashes on your back
Gurl my luv is everlastin, everlastin
I wanna sign ya, and wine 'n' dine ya
Spin you like DJ Rhyma
Suck on your neck like a vampire
You're a bomb
'Bout to blow up all you need is a big timer
Don't worry 'bout age cause I'm 21, bout ninza

[Hook]
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl, but age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin but a number (number baby)
