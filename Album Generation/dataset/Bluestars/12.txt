[Verse 1: Pleasure]
It's 4 O'clock in the morning
And she ain't feeling right
I'm on a first class trip
Through this place called life
I don't know what to do
Cause my body's still shaking
I know it's time to man up
And start my education
I need someone to call on
So I called on my bestfriend
I said "Bro, I can't take it"
He said "Boy, stop tripping"
So I hung up the phone
Packed my shit and got right
I know what I gotta do now
Be a man and face life

[Hook: Pleasure]
Maybe we could work it out
Cause you know I can't live without you
And everytime I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you
Ain't no need to cry about it
Cause you know I can't live without you
I even wrote a song about it
Cause you know I can't live without you

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
At the beginning you was gone
I was staying wit my momma
I stayed getting in trouble, man
Straight damn drama
I started dancing so I stayed out of trouble
Cause I stayed in school, selling candy so my money doubled
But then you told me man, dancing was for punks
Then you told me come and stay
And you ain't care what I want
You told me come and dance and rap wit my brothers
You taught me how to love and how to care for my brothers
And then you taught me all yo hustlin' skills
Just in case I get alone I know how to pay bills
You told me I was straight regardless of a deal
And I love you man for that cause you always kept it real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slick'Em]
Now that I made it, it feel real good
Take you out the hood
Put you on B and the block in the middle of the woods
And as hard as it seems, you was there for me
One bedroom apartment
On 1604 number efficiency down in Coverly
And even though I like to cheat
I'm going along my Geogria peach and that's a promise I'm gone keep
To the end, never gone blend
And I can hear you tell yo friends
And I can see you wanna buss and fuss with yo brand new Benz
To the world, baby it's yours
I'd give you the world cause you not no ordinary girl
I'm yo son, you my ol' girl
My momma, we shared for 19 years
And from the bottom of my foundation I'm telling you how I feel, and I love ya

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Baby Blue]
See, I fell in love wit ya
Wanna raise my kids wit ya
But you left me all along wit tears dripping down the picture
I remember the day like yesterday
May 9th, to be exact
I'd do anything to get you back
Even though I know you ain't coming back
I'm serious as a heart attack
Could we get it back the way it was?
Cause I know you had some outside influences that pulled a plug
The reality, Junebug, girl I know we'll always be together
I got you locked away deep in my heart, always here forever

[Hook]
