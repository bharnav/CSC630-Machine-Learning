[Intro]
You hit me up on your cellphone
You go girl wit your thon...thon..thon...thongs
Sexy black come over here
And let me put a few love buzzes in your ear
You smile at me
Girl your so fly
Shorty, you never had a thug like I...

[Hook]
Say shorty would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Say would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)

Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?

[Verse 1]
I'm like shorty would you be mine?
Think about you all the time
You on my speed dial
Dont answer the phone and I'll be damned if I hit redial
(Can you hear me now?)
Good,from the first time you called I knew you understood
But do you comprehend?
Girl,get wit the plan
I'm like one hour,compared to a minuteman
I'm everlasting
I want longevity]
Under Pretty Ricky baby where you need to be

[Repeat Hook]

(We can bump and grind like R. Kelly)
Baby we ain't gotta fuss and fight
(We ain't gotta fuss and fight)
Let's time our time and do it right
We gonna make love tonight
I'm like a love rollercoaster
Flip you over
Make you scream my real name
Aladiamond Blue Smith when you feel the pain
