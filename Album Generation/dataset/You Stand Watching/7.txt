[Verse 1]
Can you feel the rain?
Can you feel the cold surround you?
You and I are the same
Perfect in our own weird way

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe that things can change?
Do you believe they stay the same?
'Cause I don't need your light to light my way
I don't need it, I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Last night's the last time
I'll shut my eyes
I wanna leave my best side behind when I go
I want you to know
I want you to know

[Verse 2]
Can you feel me breathe?
Can you feel the heart that's beating?
I'm sick and tired of feeling
The candle burn inside me

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe that people change?
Do you believe they stay the same?
'Cause I don't need your light to light my way
I don't need it, I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Last night's the last time
I'll shut my eyes
I wanna leave my best side behind when I go
I want you to know that last night's the last time I'll run and hide
I wanna believe I lived my life on fire when I go

[Bridge]
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know

[Chorus]
Last night's the last time
I'll shut my eyes
I wanna leave my best side behind when I go
I want you to know that last night's the last time I'll run and hide
I wanna believe I lived my life on fire when I go
I want you to know
