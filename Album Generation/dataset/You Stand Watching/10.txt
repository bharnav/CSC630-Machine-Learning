[Verse 1]
Another night goes by without sleeping
'Cause I know I won't wake up next to you
Another life goes by without dreaming
And I can't help but think that mine will too
I'm standing before you with this label on my head
I'm pleading before you for you to understand

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you
When I look up in the sky, I see you
And then I turn and close my eyes
And it's you
When I'm sitting all alone in my room
Everything reminds me of you

[Verse 2]
The time is slow and I am sinking
Into a hole blackened with lies
And though I made it myself
You stand watching as my life passes me by
I'm standing before you with this label on my head
I'm pleading before you for you to understand
How much I adore you
I'll be there till the end
When everything falls down
Will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you
When I look up in the sky, I see you
And hen I turn and close my eyes
It's you
And when I'm sitting all alone in my room
Everything reminds me of you

[Bridge]
Mmmm, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you
When I look up in the sky, I see you
Then I turn and close my eyes
It's you
When I'm sitting all alone in my room
Everything reminds me of you
