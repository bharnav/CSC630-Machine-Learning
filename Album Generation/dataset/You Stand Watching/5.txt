[Verse 1]
This time I'll
Think of brighter days
Where I'm falling deep
Deep inside our story
I'm counting on
Something I can feel
I won't fall asleep
'Cause even if I'm hurting
I'm waitin' on the one for me

[Chorus]
It's a good day for me
It's a good day to take a chance
And let you in and see
Exactly who I am
And if you understand me
Mmm, if you can roll with it
Yeah
I will be your man

[Verse 2]
Around me lies
But no one seems to mind
I can't change time
For anyone to show me
That love is real
You know I'll find a way
I won't be scared
To let her in and love me
Is there anyone in love with me?

[Chorus]
It's a good day for me
It's a good day to take a chance
And let you in and see
Exactly who I am
And if you understand me
Yeah
If you can roll with it
I will be your man

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
It's a good day (it's a good day) for me
It's a good day to take a chance
And let you in and see
Exactly who I am
And if you understand me
Oh, yeah
If you can roll with it
And yeah
Let you in and see
Exactly who I am
And if you understand me
Oh, whoa
And if you can roll with it
I will be your man
