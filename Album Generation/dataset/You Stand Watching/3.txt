[Intro]
I need a lover
Who keeps me warm inside
She can discover
Anything she likes
She could pray, she could break a lot of things
Like my heart

[Verse 1]
I'm sinking slowly
I see your face, it's everywhere
Love can be so mean, but I don't even care
So I pray for the day you'll come back to me
It's not right

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make everything ok
Tell me you'll stay
I never wanted us to break
You'll find your way
You could have anything at all
So find your way

[Verse 2]
I need you, lover
'Cause you mean that much to me
Girl, do you wonder
What it all could be?
True romance
We could dance our life away
It's so right

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make everything ok
Tell me you'll stay
I never wanted us to break
You'll find your way
You could have anything at all
So find your way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make everything ok
Tell me you'll stay
I never wanted us to break
You'll find your way
You could have anything
So find your way
