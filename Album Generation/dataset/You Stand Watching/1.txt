[Verse 1]
Hit me with your light
I'm lost without your help
Me find the right way out
I miss the way it was
Can anybody hear me?
Crying out for love
Me like a newborn baby
I can only dream

[Chorus]
Hit me with your light
Will you catch me if I fall?
I would give my life
If it meant anything at all
Lord, help me carry on
Will you be there when I'm gone?

[Verse 2]
So come escape the night
I'm stuck inside this moment
It's all that keeps me goin'
Callin' out for truth
I battle with the times we fight to find each other
Afraid we might discover who we really are

[Chorus]
Hit me with your light
Will you catch me if I fall?
I would give my life
If it meant anything at all
Lord, help me carry on
Will you be there when I'm gone?

[Bridge]
I'm gone
Lord, where you gonna be when I'm gone?
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hit me with your light
Will you catch me if I fall?
I would give my life, yeah
If it meant anything at all
Lord, help me carry on
Will you be there when I'm gone?
