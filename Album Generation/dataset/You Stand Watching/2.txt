[Verse 1]
I've given every moment I had
Still I can never seem to keep up with you
You're done with one mile and on to another one thousand
Still I can never seem to keep up with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're, you're beautiful, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
Shine on, you were made to, shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on
You were made to

[Verse 2]
It's keepin' me awake every night
But I can never seem to give up on you
I send up a prayer then I'm on to another one thousand
But I can never seem to give up on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're, you're beautiful, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
Shine on, you were made to, shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right
Keep movin' on
Shine on, yeah, you were made to shine on

[Chorus]
Shine on, you were made to
Shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
You're gonna be brighter than you've ever been
So, shine on

[Outro]
You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be alright love
You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be alright love
