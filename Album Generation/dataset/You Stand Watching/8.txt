[Verse 1]
Look at you now
Holdin' on by yourself
Baby, don't doubt
You're walkin' on water
The light in your eyes
Flows from the inside
Beauty runs out
You're walking on water

[Chorus]
You're everything you need
You're anything you wanna be
And everything you are is here right now

[Verse 2]
The sun'll fall down
The shadows come out
Don't fear the clouds
You're walking on water

[Chorus]
You're everything you need
You're anything you want to be
And everything you are is here right now
Life is a dream
Whatever you want it to be
Don't let it slip away
When love is here

[Bridge]
You can call
Any time at all
Or if you need someone
To cushion your fall
You can lay me down

[Chorus]
You're everything you need
You're anything you wanna be
And everything you are is here right now
Life is a dream
Whatever you want it to be
Don't let it slip away
When love is here
So lay me down
