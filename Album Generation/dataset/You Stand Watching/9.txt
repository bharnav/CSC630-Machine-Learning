[Verse 1]
Looking back if we had one more night to spend
I would steal every second, I would never let it end
Like the taste of your lips, what I'd give to drink you in
I will always remember and I know that it goes with me
I will never leave this part of you behind

[Chorus]
With you gone, it plays on, it's so hard to move on
I want to, but I wanted you
Now you stay in my head
I'm not over you yet
I try to, but I wanted you

[Verse 2]
What I miss overall is a smile I can't replace
'Cause it starts in your eyes
And it filled up all the space in my heart
I know I will always remember
And I know that it goes with me
I will never leave this part of you behind

[Chorus]
With you gone, it plays on, it's so hard to move on
I want to, but I wanted you
Now you stay in my head
I'm not over you yet
I try to, but I wanted you

[Bridge]
Make no mistake, I'm here in this place
And I'm waiting around for you
And I can't help it, I'm still searching
For some way to get through
I will always remember
Remember

[Chorus]
With you gone, it's so hard to move on
I want to, but I wanted you
Now you stay in my head
I'm not over you yet
I try to, but I wanted you
I wanted you
I will always remember
I will always remember
