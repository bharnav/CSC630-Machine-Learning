[Verse 1]
Tell me what you need
You know it's on your mind
You say he's usually
Screwin' up your life
He's always gone
When you need to talk
It's just so wrong
I wish you'd wonder

[Chorus]
Love; is it enough?
I'll be your shelter when the weather is rough
And oh, you should let go
I'd let you love me like I was in your heart
Just trust like I was there from the start

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you what you need
A man more like me
It's not a fantasy
You can't have everything
You can be loved
And it's time you know, girl
You've had enough
I wish you'd wonder

[Chorus]
Love; is it enough?
I'll be your shelter when the weather is rough
And oh, you should let go
I'd let you love me like I was in your heart
Just trust like I was there from the start

[Bridge]
So much left
Just look; it's time you leave
Yeah, yeah
Love; is it enough?
I'll be your shelter when the weather is rough

[Chorus]
Love; is it enough?
I'll be your shelter when the weather is rough, yeah
And oh, you should let go
I'd let you love me like I was in your heart
Just trust like I was there from the start
