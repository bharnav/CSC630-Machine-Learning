[Verse 1]
If you just have faith
To let me be the man that I am
I'll always run back
To show you what words never can
I don't wanna be the one just to love and lose

[Chorus]
Let 'em fall baby fall
Just like the rain washes it all
If the tears will help you to heal
All that is real, all that is wrong
Let 'em fall baby fall

[Verse 2]
If you'll trust that I'm gonna stay true
Even when I'm gone
You don't have to worry
'Cause I'll always be the man that you want
And I don't wanna be the one
Just to love and lose

[Chorus]
Let 'em fall baby fall
Just like the rain washes it all
If the tears will help you to heal
All that is real, all that is wrong

[Bridge]
As your world spins around
Feet never touch the ground
Always hurting inside
Hiding behind the sun
Waiting still for the love
But it all seems so right
You know what you need to do
If the tears will help to heal your heart
By all means, let 'em fall, let 'em fall, just let 'em fall

[Chorus]
Fall (baby fall)
Just like the rain washes it all
If the tears will help you to heal
All that is real, all that is wrong
Let 'em fall baby fall
Just like the rain washes it all
If the tears will help you to heal
All that is real, all that is wrong
Let 'em fall baby fall
