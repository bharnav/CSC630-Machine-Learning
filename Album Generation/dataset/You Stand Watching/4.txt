[Verse]
A photo can say a thousand things
But it can't say the million things I wanna say
A photo can capture the way we were
But it can't capture the way we are
'Cause you're far away

[Pre-Chorus]
What it's like to know you
What it's like to touch you, yeah

[Chorus]
When you told me that you loved me
Were those just words?
You can't tell me you don't need me
And I know that hurts
'Cause I'm looking at your picture
'Cause it's all I've got
Maybe one day you and me will have
One more shot

[Verse]
Timing, lost minutes and moments
And I might be lonely, girl
But I'm not afraid
In a second, it all comes right back to me
Nothing's forgotten now
Yeah, everything's saved

[Pre-Chorus]
What it's like to touch you
What it's like to know you, yeah

[Chorus]
When you told me that you loved me
Were those just words
You can't tell me you don't need me
And I know that hurts
'Cause I'm looking at your picture
'Cause it's all I've got
Maybe one day you and me will have
One more shot

[Bridge]
You were my life
You were my faith
You gave me hope every day

[Chorus]
When you told me that you loved me
Were those just words
You can't tell me you don't need me
And I know that hurts
'Cause I'm looking at your picture
'Cause it's all I've got
Maybe one day you and me will have
One more shot
