There are only so many ways to earn your own surprise
I know we're giving up too soon
There are only so many ways to float upon the sea
It makes no difference to me
It must be pretty nice my fellow man
We'll miss you much
I think we overestimate our places underground
Ooo, done
Dust
There are only so many ways to earn your own surprise
It's written down and cannot be changed, if that's what you believe
I know we're giving up too soon
I'm never coming here again
It makes no difference to me
There are only so many ways to float upon the sea
Or collapse on Union Street, I know that you'll be there
I know there's beauty in the fool
So I'll keep reminding you'll agree
It must be pretty nice within your clan, I'll miss you much
Nothing and everything
Oh, oh what have you given me?
Nothing and everything
Done
There are only so many ways to pardon our divine
Let's sow the canyon to the sky
It must be pretty nice my fellow man
We'll miss you much
I think we overestimate our places underground
Oh, oh what have you given me?
Nothing and everything
