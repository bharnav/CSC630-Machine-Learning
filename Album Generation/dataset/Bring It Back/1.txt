Don't put your hand in the pockets that feed you
You might not get it out
Remember the weight of the yellowish night
No cat is for this dull world

I spent a long time trying to see through
People trying to call me out
Remember the weight of the glorious night
That's just so we drink it in

See the glow up above
See it glow telling us to reign the streets of London
Like the lords of other towns
The glistening of make-up helps to construct a better clown

And you will surely find this news pleasing to your ears

See the glow up above
See it glow telling us it rained the streets of London
Like it pours on other towns
And the glistening of make-up helps to construct a better clown

And you will surely find this news pleasing to your ears

You could surely try to be more alive
