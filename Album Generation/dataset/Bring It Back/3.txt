You're spending too long
The people were wrong
They don't even know we're moving on
I just want to feel the taste of the meal, and not the routine of dining here
We'll be so sorry, if we got to the shadow of death having missed all the sun on your face
It's thrilling for you now
Na na na na na na na na na
We do it all the time, do all the time
We're the dreamer in the beautiful mess
I just want to feel the taste of the meal, and not the routine of dining here
Let's lay here awhile
All the sounds will compile
Forgetting to sleep, we ponder this
Here's an alibi
We love the voices don't know why
There was a time we lived in truth
Let's bring it back
