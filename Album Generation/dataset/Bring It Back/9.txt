You have the upper hand to open up the door
Running out, running out
Running out shouldn't give youth back
I have a hardened chain connected to my arms
Running out, shouldn't pull apart
Let's trade this tired home, for all it's worth in paper
Running out, you react
Tired of singing
Oooh oooh oooh
You're tied up, (never) tied of singing
Tired of singing
Revolutionary minds, never know to draw the line
Running out, like a fire so sweet
This will bring you closer (you want it)
Imitating Bransby imitating them
This will bring you closer, never have to say it
Tired of singing
