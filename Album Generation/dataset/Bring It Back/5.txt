Oh, you and me on a fantasy
This is what it's like on a fantasy
No, I wouldn't challenge your home
In the basement of words we knew, there were more of us
Don't want to make you grow numb
If it's not what you thought it was, legs are for discovering
Relieved and now we see the road
This is what's like on a fantasy
Little codes bring the balance to none
And the shapes of your hands do tell of such a rare variety
You put your life on hold as we interest one another
Two steps closer to the level I imagined
I remember when it poured and you sang to me in summer
It's a fantasy
