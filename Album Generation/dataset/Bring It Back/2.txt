I like you crazy
You crazy
Ahhh, I'm suffering lonely ones too, and I can't resist sending/saying this on a whim
Ahhh, there's a compulsion to mend
Write on the wall, my loudest pen goes
I can't wait to say all the things you can't see, all the things that make you better
'Cause I can say all the things that make you
I like you crazy
You crazy
Hot summers repeating
Bubs noticing bees in the air
Won't get off this rail, then great hope remains honestly
Observing the critic, I knew you had plenty to say
I could not resist watching you with him
I can't wait to say all the things you can't see that make you better
I like you crazy
