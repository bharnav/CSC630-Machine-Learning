[Verse 1]
Waiting close by the door for us
Can't hardly see out but if you could
Make it all worth our while, punchlines
Been saving up for some 90 years

Waiting close by the door for us
Can't hardly see out but if you could
Make it all worth our while, punchlines
Take pity on me

[Chorus x2]
But it's not the same without you around
It's not the same without you

[Verse 1]

[Chorus x2]

[x4]
I've been thinking it's an afterthought (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh)
Get into the car and you aim it at the sun, boy
Can't you hear me in the aftermath  (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh)
Get into the car and you point it at the west, uh huh

I've been thinking it's an afterthought
Get into the car and aim it at the sun, oh oh
I've been thinking in the aftermath
Get into the car and point it at the west, oh oh

Whoa!

I've been thinking in the afterthought
Get into the car and aim it at the sun, oh oh
I've been thinking in the aftermath
Get into the car and you point it at the west, whoa oh oh
