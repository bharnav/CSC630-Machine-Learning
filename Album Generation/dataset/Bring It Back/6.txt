Lying down I notice what you see below us
Your arms are like the trees
I know I haven't said enough
I know we haven't said enough
How I will protect, and how each day matters
Spying shows your limbs caught in the rails
These simple games will soon be growing tales
And I know we haven't said enough
I know I haven't said too much
How I will protect and how each day matters to me
Since the wreck, I know more what you need
You need me to put you in the trees
I know we haven't said enough but I know I've never loved this much
