I know what it means
It's a king on his feet with a cavalier face, such a funny place
He's exhausted and shrewd, not a man on the move
Just give him a pen
And I can honestly say no
As he can honestly fight
And this red ink ain't dry, 'cause this cloth it's not right
Where you coming from?
But this day it will end, gather up all his friends and show-off a smile
