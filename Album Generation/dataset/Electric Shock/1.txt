Love... Hate

Love is deep within your gut
Struck with fire to the touch
Hate is when you can't relate
In a different state to hate
Revenge...
Execute pain to the thief of Love

Filled with Hate I won't mistake
Inside out pin Love is grand
Outside in pain Hate awaits

Ain't love grand it saves the human
Sometimes Love is never finished
Some times Hate is never ending
Love & Hate too close for most but revenge can make it even

Love... Hate

Love to Hate to Love to Kill
By the will of loving to Hate
Kill the Love with your fear and then
The Revenge will set in

Revenge...
Quench the Hate in the mean time but
In the end your soul will end
Like a junkie that needs his shott
Hate Revenge the brotha's twins

Love is solid and won't go nowhere
Love will stay as sure as Life lives
Love will stay it's crept in everywhere
Love, Hate, too close for most but revenge can make it even

Revenge is gained when Hate kills Love
Love rises above because Love is the dove
Love and Hate both are the same
Causing the extreme opposites of the same pain

When we meet on the Fields of Onions
To make war brings tears to my eyes...
Love & Hate Brings tears to my eyes
When Love dies Hate will arise

It's a loving hate for the hate that loves
Love's to hate
For a loveless hate
For a hateless love
Rather than the hate filled hate

But no love ? Man !
That's impossible
That's preposterous
That's polukaism
Halt !

If hate was a hat holding back the hoovering hateless hate
Unhate yourself
Of this hate hat
And let the hateless love
Lift loud and lovelable
That's been looming
Under your hate hat
Of helter skelter !

Love don't loath
Live and love
Happy not hate
Happy joy love and happyness cool no heat
Hate is the enemy

Hate will arise for you to despise
Hate is laughing at your fate
Love is beautiful and it is potent
Love inhibits the inhabitant of Love
Love is the permanent state
Hate is for the late freight

Peace, Love and Hate can definitely relate
