Friends say that I better be cool
They say I'm playing the fool
But they don't know what they're talking about
I've got to jump, I've got to scream and shout

Mama said I was a really bad boy
Sis is crying because I've broken her toys
Papa's shouting that I really got to go
But where I'm going I just don't know

[Chorus]
In her eyes
The sun is beginning to rise
In her eyes
I feel myself coming alive
In her eyes
The blood is beginning to flow
In her eyes
I know that I’m ready to go

I'm running but I don't know where
I'm trying but I really don't care
Papa told me that I better watch out
But Papa doesn't know what he's talking about

Mama said I was a really bad boy
Sis is crying because I've broken her toys
Papa's shouting that I really got to go
Where I'm going I just don't know

In her eyes
The sun is beginning to rise
In her eyes
I feel myself coming alive
In her eyes
The blood is beginning to flow
In her eyes
I know that I’m ready to go
Let's go!

In her eyes
In her eyes
In her eyes
In her eyes

In her eyes
The blood is beginning to flow
In her eyes
I know that I’m ready to go
In her eyes
The sun is beginning to rise
In her eyes
I feel myself coming alive
