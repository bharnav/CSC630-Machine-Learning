Faith, I call your name
When the moonlit sky shines in your eyes
Little Faith, I hear you sniffing at the ground
With your head hung down as you are prowling all around

[Pre-Chorus]
Runaway, she won't run away
Runaway, she won't run - run away

Faith, why are you growling in your sleep?
Do you stalk the shadows of your dreams?
And little Faith, do you dream of me
When the fire is low and you are lying at my feet?

[Chorus]
Runaway, she won't run away
Runaway, she won't run - run away

I called her Faith, I called her Faith
I called her dog! And she came
She's a.. Bitch. She's my little bitch

Faith you walk tamely by my side
But I see the wilderness in your eyes
Little Faith, although you wander on your own
I know that when I call you'll come home

Runaway, she won't run away
Runaway, she won't run - run away

I called her Faith, I called her Faith
I called her.. Dog! Dog! Dog! And she came
And she won't - she won't run away
Oh, no!  And I won't run away
No! No! No! I won't run away
No! No! No!
