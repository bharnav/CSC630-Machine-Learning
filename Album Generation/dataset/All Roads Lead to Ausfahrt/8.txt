[Chorus]
Nothing means anything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes
Nothing means anything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes

Let's take turns molesting children
I'm so bored with my life
Yes, we'll take turns molesting children
Then I'll go home to my wife

I was born to be an attorney
I was born to peddle cars
I'll make hay while the sun shines
Then I'll end up behind bars

Nothing means everything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes
Nothing means anything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes

Let's go home and bury the children
In the cellar with my wife
They were all insured for millions
Now we'll do just what we like

I was born to live on credit
You know my Visa's solid gold
Master card is my religion
I've got a mortgage on my soul

Nothing means everything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes
Nothing means anything, everything's permitted
Nothing is forbidden, so anything goes

Let's go to Guam and fuck a baby
I saw a tour on the internet
They say that hell awaits all sinners
But they haven't got us yet

Something is wrong in the heartland
There's an evil that creeps across this land
But they say God accepts all sinners
So why should we give a damn

I was born of love eternal
But now I do the devil's work
If there's a God up there in heaven
He must be one big fucking jerk
