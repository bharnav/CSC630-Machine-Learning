I'm flipping in the wind like a flag on a pole
And it's blowing me away
I've got to go because I feel so low
I'm alone!
(Well, that's not really true-Not technically speaking)

So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)

I threw away the picture of my happy home
Hung a bone-yard in it's place
I've got to go because I feel so low
I'm alone!
I've lost my happy home
(Wait a minute there it is!)

So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)

My baby took the Lexus and left a mule to ride
I never felt so naked
Now there's nothing left to hide
She said there's nothing left between us
That's why I love you so
What she means Iâ€™ll never know, I'll never know
I gotta go, go, go

Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go (no solo)

I've got to go because I feel so low
I'm alone!
(I'm unhappy in my present condition-Ah, you know not withstanding, I think..)

So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no solo)
So low (no, no solo)
