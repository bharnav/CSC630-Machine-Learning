How many notes could post man post, if a post man could post notes?
Here's a clue: there's nothing new just a hell of a lot more of what came before
Like shit on a stick or cum on toast, like "Hey, lawdy mama, I love you the most." - But
Try not to choke and try not to gag, I have your balls in a sling and your cock in a bag
And if those fat bull frogs won't croak I'll give their little beady eyes a poke
And if those hairy lids won't blink, I'll sit for a thousand years and think
Of every fish that's in the sea and every bird that's in the sky
I'll turn to the corpse of god and cry, "I see a mansion in the sky!"

How many holes can a young buck fuck, if a young buck could fuck holes?
There's more to see in the cunt of a flea than in the darkness of your soul - I know
Who is who and what is what, what barks like a dog and quacks like a duck
When the lightning cracks and the wild wind blows you can stick that smell right up your nose
Damned if you do and damned if you don't, I hope those big lead boots can float
On the rivers of blood raised in a flood to wash these words right down your throat
Turn to the thing that's by your side, look into what you hope are eyes and cry
"I see a mansion in the sky!"

In a pure land, you can see forever
Your thoughts float like a lotus in a stream
In a pure land, rise and look around you
Arise and awaken from your dreams
A pure mind sees a pure land
A pure mind sees a pure land
A pure land, a pure land
A pure land

How much wood could a wood chuck chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
How much good could a good man do, if a good man could do good?
Carved from the fire and nailed by the rain, crafted by hope and love and pain
Built of stone or built of wood, I'd build it solid if I could
But if that lead balloon won't fly, I'll piss in the wind and hope to die
And if I'm dead when I awake, you'll know it was all a big mistake
I lowered the sky and raised the ground, and tore from my ass an awesome sound
Lit the eternal torch and cried, "I see a mansion in the sky!"
