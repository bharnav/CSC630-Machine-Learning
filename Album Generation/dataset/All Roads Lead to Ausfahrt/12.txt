Slugs are burning, see the phosphorescence
In the fetid stew
Wrecks on fire floating in the bubbles
Their flames are methane blue
See the sea worms writhing in the silver moonlight
Cutting through the haze
See the dog fish breaking through the waves

Slugs are burning, the wings are turning
As the rays go gliding through

Slugs are burning, see them slowly crawling
Across the forest floor
See the dead eyes staring in the starlight
They will eat them all
Hear the wolves they're howling at the yellow halo
That shines around the moon (shines around the moon)
Hear the eerie hooting of the loons

Slugs are burning, the wheels are turning
And the world is turning too

Dance with me cause I'm a little devil
And you are a demon too (demon too)
Every breeze that whistles through the desert
Calls a mating tune
See the chattel tremble in the stable
Cause they know their time is soon (know their time is soon)
Hear the jackals cackling in the dunes

Slugs are burning, the wings are turning
As the vultures cross the moon
Slugs are burning, the wheels are turning
As the world is turning too

Dance me cause I'm a little demon boy
And you're a devil too (you're a devil too)
In the fire I will dance with you

Slugs are burning, slugs are burning
