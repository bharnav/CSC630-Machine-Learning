I watch everything on TV
And I'm terrified, it scares me, it scares me
A child molester killed my little boy
Someone phoned me to tell me, to tell me
But the call came in while I was asleep
I heard the answering machine in my sleep, in my sleep
I heard the answering machine in my sleep

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming and can't wake up
I toss and turn all night
I'm dreaming and can't wake up
It's just an endless night

Someone choked my little boy
It was a plastic toy that should never have come to market
I saw it advertised on TV
And it scared me, it scared me
It scared me, it scared me
It scared me, it scared me

I'm dreaming and can't wake up
I toss and turn all night
I'm dreaming and can't wake up
It's just an endless night
It's just an endless night
It's just an endless night

I am the man with X-ray eyes
Can you see through me?
Can you see through me?
Can you see through me?

Can you see..
Reality!
Reality!

I remember the lessons that were taught to me on educational TV
I saw them walk on the moon, but I never left my room
They killed my little boy and then showed it to me
They called it reality
They called it reality
They called it reality
They called it reality
They called it reality

I'm dreaming and can't wake up
I toss and turn all night
I'm dreaming and can't wake up
It's just an endless night
It's just an endless night
