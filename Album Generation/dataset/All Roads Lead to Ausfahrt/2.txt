Love or hate me, I don't care
Every step you take, I'm there
I'm the one you can not hide
I stand always by your side

When you walk, I trip you up
When you talk, I mix you up
I'm the dreamer, you're the dream
I'm the famous Mr. In Between

[Chorus]
Who? Mr. In Between
Who? Mr. In Between
Who? Mr. In Between-Mr. In Between
I'm the famous Mr. In Between

It's not pretty but it's true
Look at his face
I am you
You - Mr. In Between

I'm the trick thatâ€™s up your sleeve
I step in and then you leave
I do everything for you
Ask your girlfriend if it's true

When you talk I have to laugh
I'm the head and you're the ass
When you're lying I come clean
I'm the famous Mr. In Between

Who? Mr. In Between
Who? Mr. In Between
Who? Mr. In Between-Mr. In Between
I'm the famous Mr. In Between

You don't like it, but it's true
Look in these eyes
I am you
Mr. In Between

I'm the famous Mr. In Between
