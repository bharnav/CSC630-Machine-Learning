I smell something burning... it's us
Sausage lips and greasy tips
It's that sweet fried pork
Spitting on the spit, spitting on the spit
You can't stem the blood and fire
By squeezing it in your hand
I've got the desire, I've got the desire

My hair's on fire

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

My blood is boiling
I've got the stiff stand straight up my ass
Smell the gas, smell the sewer gas
You can't stoke the coals
Without a couple third degree burns
Hear the wheels of industry turn, turn, turn

My ass is burning

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

Oh. did you.. maybe.. huh?

Fire burn low, down we go

This little piggy went to the market
This little piggy stayed home
This little piggy had roasted beef
This little piggy had none
Break out the firearms, let's do some harm
Rake the pit for the remnants, get it all
Back up that truck, we've got to, got to
Got to get our ashes hauled

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

Got to-Get the children
Get out-Play it-Can you smell
I hear the fire
Can you hear that.. Noise!

Fire burn low, down we go
