Yesterday all my friends decided to have a party
But they said I couldn't come because I was too fat - too fat!?
I was really hurt at that time, very angry, but then I thought
I really don't have anything against gravity
But it really does weight me down

Heaven's is not a hearth fire
Heaven's not a home
Heaven has no reason
It's not together or alone
Heaven's isn't distant
Heaven's isn't close
Heaven's not in heaven
Heaven's in the dust beneath my toes


You were still asleep when I woke up this morning
So I took all your clothes and I buried them in the back yard
Then I phoned your mother and father and told them
Where you were, and that you were naked!
But all they said was that they were very, very busy
And they would try to see you later

Heaven's is not a heartache
Heaven's not a stone
Heaven's never open
Heaven's never closed
Heaven has no angels
Heaven is no goal
Heaven's not in heaven
Heaven's in the dust beneath my soles

A wise man said that you can't step into the same stream twice
But I find that wet feet get soon caked with sand and grit
That's very unpleasant, especially between the toes
So, when I go for a stroll I always stay on the sidewalk
And I always wear a pair of nice, warm boots

Heaven's not a kingdom
Not a land on which to roam
Heaven's not a palace
Where God sits upon a throne
Heaven has no treasure
There is nothing there to lose
Heaven, heaven
Heaven has no choices
There is nothing left to choose
Heaven's not in heaven
Heaven's in the dust beneath my shoes
