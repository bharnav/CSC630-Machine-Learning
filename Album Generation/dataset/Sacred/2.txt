I'm lookin' at a rainbow
Way yonder across them hills
And my baby's love is with me
And I know that it's for real

I ain't got no diamond
Girl you know I ain't got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

We dance out in the moonlit sky
But it pales beside her light
She puts her arms around me
Yeah I tell her it's alright

I ain't got no diamond
And girl you know I got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

When you find something that matters
In that moment you will see
Far beyond our selfish wonders
Love is simple, love is free

I ain't got no diamond
Girl you know I ain't got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

I ain't got no diamond
I ain't got no gold, I ain't got no gold
But I have you...Love you darling
