(Henry)
I'm remembering ol' Waylon and good ol' Johnny Cash
Man they're an inspiration to what I am
But don't get me wrong, I'm still Texican to the bone
Lord I'm passin on the song just like my Daddy to his sons, aw that's right
This one's for the outlaws before me

(JoJo)
You know Indians and outlaws don't mind breaking rules
We'll gladly take your money now if you play us for a fool
You can't make us run and you know you can't make us hide, oh no
You know we have our fun and we don't quit without a fight
So this one's for the outlaws before me

(chorus)
Well outlaws are forever running wild and free
Kickin in all the doors they didn't even need no key
They don't let nobody tell 'em how it's 'posed to be
This one's for them outlaws
This one's for the outlaws before me

(Enrique)
Well I've seen that Folsom prison
Been down that lost highway
You ain't never heard of me
'cause I do things my way
I sing my song and my boys they follow me they follow me
We carry on through it all we still believe, we still believe
This one's for the missing outlaws just like me
Oh yeah, let's do it Willie

(Willie Nelson)
I've always made a living
Making music with my friends
Out on the road again
Lord knows where I've been
Sometimes the man doesn't like the way I am
So I'll put it in a song
Just take you some and pass it on
This one's for the outlaws just like me

(chorus)
Well outlaws are forever running wild and free
Kickin in all the doors and don't even need no keys, that's right
They don't let nobody tell us how it's 'posed to be
This one's for the outlaws
This one's for the outlaws
This one's for the outlaws
This one's for the outlaws before me
