Lord I'm so lonely
How will I ever find my way?
I look out my window
Rain's falling down, just like the tears on my face
It feels like this pain could last forever
Now that I know she's not comin' back

So many things that I tried to say
It didn't matter she wouldn't stay
I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

She had her reasons
But she never felt there was a need to explain
And she won't be knockin'
And she won't be callin' on the phone
It feels like this pain could last forever
Now that I know she's not comin' back

So many things that I tried to say
It didn't matter she wouldn't stay
I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

So many things that I tried to say
It didn't matter she wouldn't stay
I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

So many things that I tried to say
It didn't matter she wouldn't stay
I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

So many things that I tried to say, darlin'
It didn't matter she wouldn't stay, no, no, no
I smelled the roses the other day
When she walked away

I woke up to smell them roses
When she walked away
