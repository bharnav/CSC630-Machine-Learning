I don't need no fortune
I don't need no fame
That's all just an illusion
To me it don't mean a thing

You can try and deceive me
But I see right through your skin
And what you're trying to tell me
Is something I don't beleive in

Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say

'cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day
I don't care what you say
I'm gonna do it my way

You say you have all the answers
And I should do it your way
How many times do I have to tell you
I ain't no puppet on a string
Listen to me...

Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say
'cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day
I don't care what you say
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm gonna do it my way
What'd you say

Ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh

Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say

Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say

'cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day

I don't care what you say
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm gonna do it my way
Ohhhhhhh I'm gonna do it my way
