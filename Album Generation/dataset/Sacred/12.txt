I feel a chang in the weather around me
I'm seeing differently, nothings the same
Everyone's asking questions about me
They say I lost my faith and I'm not the same
But I feel fine
I haven't lost my mind
My heart's open wide
And my eyes on the sky
I'm living my life
I can't be sure that I'll wake up tomorrow
But that doesn't matter to me I live for today
And I still know love
And I still know pain
My heart's open wide
And my eyes on the sky
I'm living my life

Oh I living my life
(guitar)

Oh yea yea yea

I handle on my own
Wherever I may roam
Cause I'm not alone
Well I feel fine
I haven't lost my mind
My heart's open wide
And my eyes on the sky
I'm living my life
I still know love
And I still know pain
My hearts open wide
And my eyes on the sky
My heart's open wide on the sky
My heart's open wide on the sky
I'm livin my life

Oh oh oh
(guitar)
