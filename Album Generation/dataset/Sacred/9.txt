My Loneliness

I saw the waters standing still
And the world began to chill
Around my loneliness

I felt the air come to a stall
And I did not move at all
My world just got colder

Lately it seems that all of my dreams have come true
But why does it feel like nothing's for real without you
The world seems to stop
Around my Loneliness

Why has the sun refused to shine
Maybe â€˜cause I drank the wine
It's bitter in it's sweetness

Now, well it looks as though the sky
Is sad and wants to cry, raindrops filled with fire

Lately it seems that all of my dreams have come true (yes they have)
But why does it feel like nothing's for real without you
The world seems to stop
Around my Loneliness

Where will i go, Lord only knows
I can't tell if its heaven or hell
The world seems to stop
Around my Loneliness

Now as my world begins to clear
A whisper in my ear
Takes away my sadness

Lately it seems that all of my dreams have come true(yes they have,oh)
Why does it feel like nothing's for real without you
The world seems to stop
Around my Loneliness
Ohh, The world seems to stop
Around my Loneliness
