As I lay here in my bed
Racing thoughts run through my head
I just saw you passin' by
You stopped to look me in the eye

I thought i'd leave it up to time
To somehow shake you from my mind
Your kisses soft and your eyes so deep
Let's not forget your pretty lies to me

'cause I
Thought that memories died
I Guess they know where to hide
I wanna forget you,But how could I?
I thought that memories died

I've forgiven everything
Oh I can't forget the pain
Your eyes they haunt my memories
Even though you're gone

Oh..............

Well I know from time to time
That you have me on your mind
Oh I loved you tenderly
But somehow you slipped away from me

I Thought that memories died
I guess they know where to hide
I wanna forget you
But......how....... could......... I..........
I thought that memories died

Oh.....................

I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
