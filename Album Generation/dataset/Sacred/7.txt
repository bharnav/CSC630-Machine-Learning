Look into a mirror and tell me what do your eyes really see
Can they see the world around you
Or just reflections of one little thing
Cause hearts are breakin' and lives are taken
Even the blind can see all the things that are wrong in the world today, oh yeah
Even the blind can see what's goin' on today
Pickin up the newspaper look at what the headlines read
They're takin' about yesterday and how it takes effect on you and me
The clock is tickin' and everybody's wishin'
For just one more day to make a difference
And change what we need to change
Oh yeah
I can see something's wrong out here
Can't you see something's wrong out here
Stop wasting your time begin your life
With others in mind you can change what we need to change
Can't you see something's wrong out here
Something's wrong, something's wrong out here
And even the blind can see all the things that are wrong in the world today
And we got one more day to make a difference and change what we need to change, oh yeah
We got onemore day to make a chnage in your life
