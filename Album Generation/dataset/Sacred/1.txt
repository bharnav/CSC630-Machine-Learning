The Sun is shining on
It makes me proud to know
The good man upstairs
My problems of the day
Seem to fade away
When I look into the sky
It's like drinking clear cool water
Or making castles in the sand
Oh I feel so free from life's tragedies

Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Hey every things alright
So I say Orale

Oh I think I hear
Thunder rolling near
It's all around
But oh sometimes the rain
Can take away my pain
With just the sound
Reminds me of the songs of mother
When she used to sing to me
It's a feeling like no other
Having Faith and flying free
Lift your head and see
Take your time believe

Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Hey every things alright
Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Hey every things alright
So I say Orale

Oh I'm glad I'm still breathing
I thank the lord for blessing me
Cause no matter where I'm going
I can take the sky with me

Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Hey every things alright
Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Cause I'm still alive
So I say Orale
Don't need no more hurting
Don't need no more crying
Hey every things alright
So I say Orale
So I say Orale
Cause I'm still alive
So I say Orale
