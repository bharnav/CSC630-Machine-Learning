[Verse 1]
All the journeys of this great adventure
It didn't always feel that way
I wouldn't trade them because I made them
The best I could, and that's enough to say

[Chorus 1]
Some days were dark
I wish that I could live it all again
Some nights were bright
I wish that I could live it all again

[Verse 2]
All the highlights of that headlong flight
Holding on with all my might
To what I felt back then
I wish that I could live it all again

[Chorus 2]
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels
Steer the airship right across the stars
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel
Oh I wish that I could live it all again

[Verse 3]
All the treasures, the gold and glory
It didn't always feel that way
I don't regret it - I'll never forget it
I wouldn't trade tomorrow for today

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

The days were dark
And the nights were bright
I would never trade tomorrow for today

All the highlights of that headlong flight
Holding on with all my might

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2]
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels
Steer the airship right across the stars
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to steal
Oh I wish that I could...

Oh I wish that I could live it all again
