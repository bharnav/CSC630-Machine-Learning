[Verse 1]
Under the gaze of the angels
A spectacle like he's never seen
Spinning lights and faces
Demon music and gypsy queens

[Chorus 1]
The glint of iron wheels
The bodies spin in a clockwork dance
The smell of flint and steel
A wheel of fate, a game of chance

[Chorus 2]
How I prayed just to get away
To carry me anywhere
Sometimes the angels punish us
By answering our prayers
By answering our prayers

[Verse 2]
A face of naked evil
Turns the young boys blood to ice
Deadly confrontation
Such a dangerous device

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Shout to warn the crowd
Accusations ringing loud
A ticking box, in the hand of the innocent
The angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
