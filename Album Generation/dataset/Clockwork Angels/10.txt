[Chorus 1]
All that you can do is wish them well [x4]

[Verse 1]
Spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy
Always angry and dissatisfied
Even the lost ones, the frightened and mean ones
Even the ones with the Devil inside!
Thank your stars you're not that way
Turn your back and walk away!
Don't even pause and ask them why;
Turn around and say goodbye!
Wish them well!

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Verse 2]
People who judge without a measure of mercy
Are the victims who will never learn;
Even the lost ones you can only give up on
Even the ones who will make you burn!
Thank your stars you're not that way
Turn your back and walk away!
Don't even pause and ask them why;
Turn around and say goodbye!
Don't even pause and ask them why;
Turn around and say goodbye!

[Chorus 2] x2
Ones who've done you wrong
Oh, the ones who pretended to be so strong
Grudges you've held for so long:
It's not worth singing that same sad song!

Thank your stars you're not that way
Turn your back and walk away!

Don't even pause and ask them why;
Turn around and say goodbye!
Thank your stars you're not that way
Turn your back and walk away!
Don't even pause and ask them why;
Turn around and say goodbye!

[Chorus 1] [x3]

Even though you're going through hell
Just keep on going, let the demons dwell!
Just wish them well! Wish them well!
Just wish them well! Wish them well!
Even though you're going through hell
Wish them well! Wish them well!
