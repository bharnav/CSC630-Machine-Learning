[Verse 1]
Will there be world enough and time for me to sing that song?
A voice so silent for so long
For all those years I had to get along, they told me I was wrong
I never wanted to belong - I was so strong!

[Pre-Chorus]
I lack their smiles and their diamonds;
I lack their happiness and love
I envy them for all those things
I never got my fair share of - my fair share of

[Chorus]
The lenses inside of me that paint the world black
The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage
The things I've always been denied
An early promise that somehow died
A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage [x2]

[Verse 2]
In all your science of the mind, seeking blind through flesh and bone
Find the blood inside this stone
What I know, I've never shown; what I feel, I've always known
I plan my vengeance on my own- and I was always alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I lack their smiles and their diamonds;
I lack their happiness and love
I envy them for all those things
I never got my fair share of - my fair share of

[Chorus]
The lenses inside of me that paint the world black
The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage
The things I've always been denied
An early promise that somehow died
A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage [x2]

[Bridge]
Oh -They tried to get me
Oh - They'll never forget me

[Chorus]
The lenses inside of me that paint the world black
The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage
The things I've always been denied
An early promise that somehow died
A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage [x3]
