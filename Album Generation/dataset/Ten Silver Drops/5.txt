Faced with lies
Don't you think that you just lie?

Caught inside
Worlds made mostly of lies

Make up your mind
'cause it's all we love
That's all
Just faded lines

Overwhelmed
Overjoyed is the same

Beneath the stillness
The place where coldness meets cold

Make up your mind
'cause it's all we love
That's all
Just faded lines

And what else?

Yeah, I was scared
The seconds dripped past
So slow

But I just stood there
I thought you
Should know
