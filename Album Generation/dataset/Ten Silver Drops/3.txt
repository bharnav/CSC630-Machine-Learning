Mother walks the streets
With a baby in her hands
While the child weighs on her mind
Mama's looking for a man

'Cause her Daddy's in the doldrums
And Mama wants to dance
Yeah, Daddy's in the doldrums
And he can barely stand

So where were you?

His eyes stood frozen, dark
A breath of overcasting black
I watched her walk away
I know she ain't coming back

'Cause her Daddy's in the doldrums
And Mama wants to dance
Yeah, Daddy's in the doldrums
And he can barely stand

So where were you?

With each step she took
Another nail driven
In building her wreck

No, don't look back or
Watch me reign down
'Cause it's an act

Though my love just feels deceit
The sickening beat gets carried away
