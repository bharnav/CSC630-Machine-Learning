Must have lived so long with covered eyes
But when did you say goodbye?
I'm only just waking up

To all the joy that you've outgrown
Memories I can't break
Alone, jealous and stoned

Idle kids with idle hearts
Some of them went too far
Some still waiting there

Sitting at home, what am I doing?
Boy waitng by the phone
Alone, jealous and stoned

I waited for you
I waited for you
I always waited for you

Can't have been too late 'cause I was still warm
Fighting off heavy eyes
Still thinking that you would call

Echoing words, voices, thoughts
Remembering that you forgot
And I was just hanging out

Sitting at home, what am I doing?
A boy waitng by the phone
Alone, jealous and stoned

I waited for you
I waited for you
I always waited for you

I waited for you
I waited for you
I always waited for you
