I want to know if it's still possible
To find a place that's ours
Maybe there's a world that's still invisible
A murmur coming from the stars

'Cause if it's real then I have never noticed
Hidden by the thoughts that I
Designed and I
Was there the entire time

Don't worry, I'm much too proud
To face the lights in your eyes
Crushing stars, we collide
What makes us?

I want to know if it's still possible
Beneath the endless night
Walking past the window to your bedroom
But the curtain's holding back the light

Oh, if you're home, I wonder if you'd seen me
I wonder if I caught your eye
I wondered if you'd ever notice
That I was only passing by
Why should I?
It was the only time
