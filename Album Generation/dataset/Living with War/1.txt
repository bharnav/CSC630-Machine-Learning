[Chorus]
I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with war right now

[Verse 1]
And when the dawn breaks I see my fellow man
And on the flat-screen we kill and we're killed again
And when the night falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace (visualize)
I join the multitudes
I raise my hand in peace
I never bow to the laws of the thought police
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
To never kill again

[Chorus]
I'm living with war in my heart
I'm living with war in my heart in my mind
I'm living with war right now

[Verse 2]
Don't take no tidal wave
Don't take no mass grave
Don't take no smoking gun
To show how the west was won
But when the curtain falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace
In the crowded streets
In the big hotels
In the mosques and the doors of the old museum
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
Try to remember peace

[Bridge]
The rocket's red glare
Bombs bursting in air
Give proof through the night
That our flag is still there

[Chorus][x2]
I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with what right now
