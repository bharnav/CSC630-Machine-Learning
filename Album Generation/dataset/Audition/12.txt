Hahahaha, whoa

"Yeah."

"Don't yell at me."

"I'm not yelling at you, don't dont."

"Don't dominate me."

I want a girl with toes like Uma Thurman
And a body like suicide doors on a Mack truck
And Suicide Girl ink and a face
Like shut the hell up, dummy (laughs) good luck
I wanna slip under covers
And make punk songs
Charles Bronson blasty
Dillinger Escape
Loving The Nation of Ulysses
Trying to hold us back
Something like Misfits in a sack

"Absolutely not. Can I slap you?"
"Right? Okay, cool cool. Yeah that's done."
