*whispered*
(If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out
You'll feel a whole lot better
If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out)

[Verse 1]
It was buried under a flask and a
Caught peeking from the bottom of a glass
All this nonsense, innocense, common sense, consequence
Indulgence in bourbon, this 'urb, between city King's, it's disturbed
I look around to see the same shit from her
She could just sit silent, watchin' life just pass by in a blur
Ain't it funny, we can sneak into our lives and then stir
Over the perfect things to say and then just choke on the words
Everybody wanna be the next
Everybody wanna be in step
Everybody wanna fuck
Everybody want the consequence of playin' the fence
Everybody's got shit luck
Everybody wanna move to they own beat
Everybody wanna make a dent
Every girl is lookin' for the next best thing
Every boy's in love with his girl's best friend
Everybody hates me, everybody wanna fight
We can't stand to wake up in the sun but can't sleep in the moonlight
I'm right there with ya, I'm sicker than my own skin
I got the clothes and a jaded grin
I'm at the bar or the coffee shop
But I don't like drinkin' and I fuckin' hate coffee shops
I walk to stop
The world is best grinning like it's time to whirl
This ain't amusment, I'mma lose it
Two cents, two cents It was bullshit, uh
Got two cents but everybody seems to have the same change
But can't break my five-o
Two cents, (yeah right) but can't spend nothing if I'm holding a cup
It's like

[Hook]
If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out
You'll feel a whole lot better
Close your eyes, disappear
If you can't see them, then they can't see you, right
Close your eyes

I can never be what I wanna be
Nothin' but a man
Nothin's even inside of me, nothin I can understand
If I try, and so I try
To get a grip, a hold, a handle, a hand {​repeat section x2}​

This
And it's strained to think it might break
Scratch, crack, silence
This
And it's strained I think it might break
Scratch, crack

[Verse 2]
I live in the city, like any other we all live alone
The only difference is we don't seem to know it
Frozen and lonesome when it's cold
In the summer gotta wait for the loathing, holding
Our postures so low and we drink so there's not much worth noting
Strolling, so vagrant, so shaken, so grown, so god so mistaken
So broke, so, so complacent, so worn out, so worn out, so worn out
So full of doubt, so full of restraint
So full of that self-control, or the lack thereof
That we taught the soul

[Hook]

I can never be what I wanna be
Nothin' but a man
Nothing's even inside of me, nothin I can understand
If I try, and so I try
To get a grip, a hold, a handle, a hand
