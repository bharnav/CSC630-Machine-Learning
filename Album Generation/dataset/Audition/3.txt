P.O.S.!
Doomtree!

Stand up!
Yeah!
Stand up!
Stand up!
You know, rappin’ and shit

[Verse 1: P.O.S.]
Yo, it’s funny when the movement makes the mainstream
But still don’t do shit but bruise a dream
Could use a new level of youth on scene
But the truth is the kids are losin’ steam
They say it’s a shame to undermine it
But we’re talkin’ about the most hated machine of all time
They’re playin’ a game with most of our lives
But in November, who had the patience to stand in line?
It’s plain insane, they’d come to realize it
It’s big pain, stalk a flock a sheep
Talk’s cheap, when I shock you
Used to want to street fight like Blanka
Now I just pray I don’t lose my fuckin head like boss Tanaka
Rock a black bandana too tight
Black man with the posture of a punk cast aside ‘cause I ain't white
I’m patriotic like a fox
I hung my flag high, but must’ve misunderstood when Beanie Sigel was like
”Hey, yo, light that shit the fuck up!”
I ain’t white, and there’s laws for that
So I use color-safe bleach at the laundromat
And deal with it, you see how my squad react
We keep our hands warm with the damn Patriot Act
We burn pages, matter a fact we burn back
It was written as an outright attack

See, you can’t fight a feeling. I feel terrified
There’s a war against me, my friends, my fam, my pride
My life, my job, my likes and like-minded
Folks are like, “Psh” like they just don’t mind it
So I’m cool, right?
They wag the dog. We catch the lipstick
What kind of city plumber thought that he could make these old and rusty pipes fit?
Well, they don’t. I’m catching the drip
I’ll practice holdin’ my breath, then sink with the ship

It goes…
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up (Doom)
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up (Tree)
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up (Doom)
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up (Tree)
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up (Doom)
Stand up, so we know who’s here, (Tree)
Who wants to open up the machine and rage against the gears?
Come on!
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up
Stand up, so we know who’s here,(Tree)
Who wants to open up the machine and rage against the gears?
Hands up, if you're broken but find a way to stand up
Give it up, if you're hopin’ to never give it up
Stand up, so we know who’s here,(Tree)
Who wants to open up the machine and rage against the gears?
Come On!

Doom! Tree!
Doom! Tree!

Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
