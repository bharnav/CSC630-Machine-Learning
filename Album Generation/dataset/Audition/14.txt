[Intro]

I think the best threat in the world is to say:
I’m gonna put tacks in your cereal… in two years
You know what I’m sayin’?

[Verse I]

You mother-fuckers get in line for what?
Lazerbeak on the beat
Turbo Nemesis choppin’ the cuts
I’m stickin’ ‘em up
Doomtree givin’ the guts
A little heart
Probably written with love
Or written in blood
To stain the brains of the strange
But don’t bang the content
I’m tryin’ to get my people behind it
Sang along with it
Scream along with it
This goes to the people
Who know better than to give up and die
We try livin’
Bite the hand givin’
Despite our position
Ignite the opposition
Fright, I’m forever srcreamin’
Yeah right
Stay out the dark
Forever sleepin’ with a teddy bear
And a tazer
Givin’ ya cuts
Like a 6-pack of Bic razors
Danger danger
Doom the beat mangling
Strain through the blood
With a thing for word tangling

(Chorus)
Another one of them mother-fuckers
With nothin’ but drive and the hill
To try and climb up
So if I walk right by
Don’t take if for nothin’ more
Than somethin' simple like I’m tryin’ not to lose my grip
Another one of them mother-fuckers
With nothin’ but drive and the hill
To try and climb up
So if I walk right by
Don’t take if for nothin’
Except I’m trying not to lose my fucking grip

(Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!)

[Verse II]

Just breathe!
Yeah yeah just remember to breathe
And get loud!
Yeah Doomtree to hold me down
Let go!
Gotta do what I want and do what I know
Just breathe!
All right all right
Just breathe!
This is fun just remember to breathe
And get loud!
Yeah Doomtree to hold me down
Let go!
Gotta do what I want and do what I know
Just breathe!
All right, all right, all right, all right
Ok, ok, ok, all right
Slow it down, slow it down
Just relax, you gotta breathe
Relax, slow it down…

(WHOA!! OH SHIT!! Oh!! GODDAMNIT!! Oh God!! Oh!! Damnit!)

[Verse III]

See I sat nothing but road on the
And wait in the back
While hangmen waste away on the rope
We pick up the slack
Doom. Smack the crap
And click to 90 1 1
Burn off time I’ll pour my coffee cup
To stay on the run
Never wrecked
Keep it movin’
Till there ain’t nothin’ left
Right left right steps
Fight for balance homie
Hope for the checks
Scratch that
I hope for the best
I test the limits
Like any Doomtree cynics
See I

(Chorus)
Another one of them mother-fuckers
With nothin’ but drivin’ a hand to the hill
To try and climb up
If I walk right past you
Don’t take if for nothin’ more
Than somethin' simple like I’m tryin’ not to lose my grip
Another one of them mother-fuckers
With nothin’ but drive and the skill
To try and climb up
If I walk right past you
Don’t take if for nothin’ more
I’m tryin’ not to lose my grip

[Outro]

Yeah yeah
Just remember to breathe and uh…
Yeah Doomtree
To hold me down and uh…
I gotta do what I want
Do what I know
Just… All right
Ok, this is fun just remember to breathe
And uh… Yeah Doomtree
To hold me down and uh…
Gotta do what I want
Do what I know and just
Just breathe…
