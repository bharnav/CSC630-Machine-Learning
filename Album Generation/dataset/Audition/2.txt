[Verse 1]
I am P.O.S
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes off this land corporations rape
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
But I guess I'm livin' dreams cause my rent's always a month late
Product of an East German Black
Who kissed the neck, of a pretty woman named Grace
But he left my life just a little too soon
Didn't see me catch the Doomtree fame
As we go a little something like this
Look mom, no protection, now I got a baby boy by the name of Jake
And I been trying to play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
When I think I'm getting' better every passin' day
I'm not an early bird, plus the feathers' all black
So by the time I catch an apple, usually it's rind
But it's a must to decipher one's girl
From the round, sweet apples that are rotten on the inside
I cherish my free time
But I maximize, so my soul needs to unwind
I wanna see the stars be the moon to my sun
(But I'm always on the run, run, run)
I'm fake to all these hard-case kids
I raise a black fist but won't say *nigga* in the things I write
And I don't say *faggot* cause I don't think it's right
I know my boy will struggle with that for over half his life
I guess we got our own lives to live
But I'm stretched too thin, tryin' to build a kingdom to rule
And I think to the past sometimes
And dag man, it's bad, see I kinda acted like a fool
But I've apologized to the lives that I've touched wrong
Pride to the back, move ahead strong
But I can safely say: I've never played a woman without karma catchin' up later on
I try to walk the right side of the tracks
But I've hopped a couple trains, mom would cry if she knew the haps
But I can stand who I am and face the day straight
Knowin' not a thing can change when our beat singin'

[Hook: Greg Attonito and P.O.S.]
No one will ever be, like me
No one will ever be, like me
I know I'm not a bad guy, but when I try to do what's right
Everyone who comes to me don't understand or see my plight
Everything I've ever done, and all the plans I've had inside
I was Mr. Gone Wrong in way, so I gave up and said

(Alright)
So now I do what I can, I'm
(Alright)
Stand up like Mama raised me
(Alright)
I was dealt from the bottom
And pulled a flush
I've been living with my chips all in
And I'm still in, see

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I am P.O.S
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes off this land corporations rape
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
But I guess I'm livin' dreams cause my rent's always a month late
And lookin' back it seems I've always been a step behind
Little off-track and feelin' no one shared the frame of mind
Listenin' to records in my room to escape
Found some things I could relate with, I wore out the tape
We said
[Greg Attonito]
When I lose, every time I win, cause
No one will ever be
Messin' up stuff or doin' things wrong
Quite like me

[Hook] {X2}
No one will ever be, like me
No one will ever be, like me
No one will ever be, like me
No one will ever be, like me
