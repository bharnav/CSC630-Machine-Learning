[Intro]
And it’s a cold winter
Some of us think of this like a Kersey turned to a Kimball
Or like a .22 turned to a .357
Something like that

[Verse 1]
And it’s cold when you’re told he’s got a tag on his toe
Nuh-uh, no Nuh-uh don't let it go
Get the call from your mama. Tears, drama
Didn’t go peacefully, so he was murdered in cold
Blood on the windshield, move like it’s nothing
See, motherfuckers are tough
And could give a fuck about
Nothing ever changes around here
Stand like an ape, and you swear you’re so sorry
But didn’t hit the brakes
You’re a killer
And I don’t mean it like you mean it, you piece of rat shit
I hope you burn for this
And I ain’t talking about fire and brimstone
Hope your murder weapon crashes into a closed Amoco
So it’s you all alone as you go
And it’s real when you peel your fucking face off the wheel
And I can see my own breath
(I can see my own breath)
It gets colder in front of cold shoulders

[Hook]
See, we don’t throw our hands up like we don't care anymore
We throw our hands up like we don’t care anymore
Cause we don’t
And how could we?
Nothing ever goes how it should
We don’t throw our hands up like we don’t care anymore
We throw our hands up like we don’t care anymore
Cause we don’t
I give it all to the bone
My people are not alone
(You are not alone)
(You are not alone)

[Verse 2]
See, we’re cold to the silence
Bow, violins as we stroll hella silent
Like seeking asylum, while sneaking inside a box in the closet
Was locked 'til he got it
Cocked, then he shot it
Amazed by the weight and the way
It made his most famous display
By all of his favorites, he prayed
Practiced at saying its name
Well, okay
They’re shooting
Made you look at yourself just to say
And it's wrong
(And it's wrong)
What you gonna do when your son's gone to a better place
Caught a hot line in the face
Displace anger, lay your flowers down and stand strong
And I can see my own breath
(I can see my own breath)
It gets colder when thrown the cold shoulder
And I can see my own breath

[Bridge]
You ever feel like
(You ever feel like)
There ain't nothing left?
There ain't nothing left
There ain't nothing left
There ain't nothing left
Do you ever feel like there ain't nothing left?
(Cause I do.)
Do you ever feel like there ain't nothing left?

[Hook]
Come on
