[Verse 1: Craig Finn]
I've only walked out on one single movie
It was an action-adventure
It was a blood-sucking summer

And the posters in the lobby of the theater called it "Predator"
I called it weak and unwatchable
Carl Weathers and two future governors
You know, that's really unacceptable
We gotta stop falling for these double speakers from the double features
We gotta keep 'em in the theaters

[Chorus: Craig Finn (P.O.S)]
So put your head up to the speakers
This is what it's like to stop talking and finally hear me
(I'm concerned you're itchin' to burn
I know you're dying to know, homie I'm dying to listen and learn)
So put your head up to the headphones
This is what it's like to drown out the psychos
(I'm concerned you're itchin' to burn
I know you're dying to do it, but homie you gotta see how it's done)
So put your gun in the shoebox
Put the box in the back of your closet and close the door
(Between the kegs and the Maiden CD
I think this party's got about as much heavy metal as it's gonna need)
So put your head up to the speakers
This is what it's like to stop talking and finally hear me
(See, we ain't got time to bleed
We hit the highways, when skating on thin ice the safety's in speed)

[Verse 2: P.O.S]
You ever feel like you're being tricked
Tricked-out, dicked, dicked around with or flat out lied to?
Welcome to Hollywood D.C
Where Reagan youth grew up cowboys off Ronnie's westerns

That shoot em up and steal the bucks
Tell 'em what's love and giddy-up, yeah off into the sunset
Years later we watched the Running Man and two of 'em ran and won
Too star-struck to stick with the plan, huh

I shoulda switched to Marlboros, them cowboy killers
'Cause cowboys are killing Camel Lights
And some mustache punked the evil Jafar
But for a middle eastern guy, I think Aladdin looked kinda white

We open wide and catch a bite of villain image
We swallow it and feed it to the kids if the song's alright
That's just the way it be, eyes wide shut up and sit down
Put your hands up for your turn to speak

[Chorus]

[Outro: P.O.S]
I got my Nikon, let's get our Knife on
And get a couple snapshots of a bad move
I got my Nikon, let's get our Knife on
And get a couple snapshots of a bad move
(X3)

Can you turn on the light?
Cause I forgot the flash
Want these proofs to prove what not to do
