Aaaaaah!! Aaaaaah!
Shut up, I didn't mean it sorry
Uh... S.K.S, cherries
Building Better Bombs, ashes, ashes
Yeah right? Yeah right!

It goes my oh my
We chokin' on borrowed time
Livin' just enough to fall in line
We get off cue and walk on through
Cause stakes is high
So homie get back (get back)

Six minutes to combat
Six minutes P.O.S. you rhyme that
So gimme the gun or gimme the heat
Or get up and run
And give me something
Just to take down

And this cat won't back down
I'd rather be in a box
And underground than stop myself
Prolly somethin' I pump, it's in the blood
It's somethin' I want
Need or better
It's like a drug or somethin'
I CC then bring them the cheat
And get's to me see
To keep the heart beatin'
So gimme the gun or gimme the heat
Or get up and run
And give me something
Just to take down

I wanna see a politician
With callouses and Carhartts
Marked with a heart and slow side
Burnt through your earn charts
Learned with a stern arch
Yearn to break a buck

But these dogs can't look up
It's like these dogs were never pups
Never played, never shared a game play
Just seen with that angel face
Right place and right time
???

It goes my oh my
We chokin' on borrowed time
Livin' just enough to fall in line
We get off cue and walk on through
Cause stakes is high
So homie get back (get back)

Six minutes to combat
Six minutes P.O.S. you rhyme that
So gimme the gun or gimme the heat
Or get up and run
And give me something
Just to take down

Yeah right, Science! Yeah right, Science!
YEAH RIGHT. YEAH, right? Come one now, can't believe how
Well that went. Yeah right. Let me um...
That's how dudes, dudes go, dudes go: YEAH RIGHT!
And girls go: Yeah right... right?
All right, yeah, okay I'm done
