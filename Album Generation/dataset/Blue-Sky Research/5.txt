It seems it's been so long, 'cause it's been way too long
Since we've shared a warm embrace and since I've seen you smile

The wind of misery appears
And takes away from all we have
The cycle just goes on and on and on and on

'Cause only time will tell if we're meant to be
You and I won't know if it's our destiny
Forever endeavor

I am alone again 'cause I am alone again
The choice we have to face, is whether to move on
The urge to right our wrongs, but no fix is long

The wind of misery appears
The cycle just goes on

'Cause only time will tell if we're meant to be
You and I won't know if it's our destiny
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor

Only time will tell if we're meant to be
You and I won't know if it's our destiny
Forever endeavor
Only time will tell if we're meant to be
You and I won't know if it's our destiny
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
Forever endeavor
