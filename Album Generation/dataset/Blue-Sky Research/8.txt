It breeds a one man show mentality self serving force fed and condoned
It takes my breath away to know that no one else believes they're in control

(Save us) From ourselves
We're at a loss of words while preaching that we can't be heard

The image staring back at you is what you hate (you don't)
Truly think forgiveness is on the way
Seven years you lost for breaking one mistake (ingrown)

To bleed for what you own is understanding as the sum for what you've blown
To truly carve your way to where you want to go is smiling while alone

(Save us) From ourselves
We're at a loss of words while preaching that we can't be heard

The image staring back at you is what you hate (you don't)
Truly think forgiveness is on the way
Seven years you lost for breaking one mistake (ingrown)

Wake up
Play dumb
Wake up

The image staring back at you is what you hate (you don't)
Truly think forgiveness is on the way
Seven years you lost for breaking one mistake (ingrown)
