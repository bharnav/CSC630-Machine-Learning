How could you abandon me?
I thought you'd always be there for me
Standing tall, one and one for all
My support modeling, rolling as a team
But instead on our own, enemies of old

Seasons change, the falling rain
Will wash our pain away
Make amends to help understand
How to live today

Fuck

It's not your fault
I understand, now I'm more a man
You needed space to find yourself
And I'm in the same place now
Live in dreams, dreaming new
Springing forward to choose a life
That gets me by, not a life that passes by

Seasons change, the falling rain
Will wash our pain away
Make amends to help understand
How to live today

On we march in our April suits
On we march in our April boots
On we fucking march in our April suits
March in our April boots

Seasons change, the falling rain
Will wash our pain away
Make amends to help understand
How to live today

Seasons change, the falling rain
Will wash our pain away
Make amends to help understand
How to live today
