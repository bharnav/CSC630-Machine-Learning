[Verse 1]
Well I hear a voice of faith
Resonate a belief in choice
With no way to escape
It's a ploy to weaken the sense of joy and bury us
Separates the good of evil
Placing shame on helpless people
Stabbing hate infectious needles
Shallow forces spreading seeds will
Feed the flame of ignorance
Takes away our freedom to say

[Chorus]
I will not fall for you!

No (x2)

[Verse 2]
Well I see a fingers point
But not that use ostracizing noise
With a narrowed view
It's okay the rest of us
Heal the pain
Now we're free to say

[Chorus]
I will not fall for you!

[Bridge]
Separate yourself from all the hating people
Who want to take you down
Say
(I will) I will
(I will not) I will not
(Fall for you) fall for you
Separate yourself from all the hating people
Who want to take you down

Say (x3)

I will not fall for you!
