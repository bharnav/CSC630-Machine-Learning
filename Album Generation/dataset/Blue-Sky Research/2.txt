[Verse 1]
All you'd show is love
Yet all I'd see is hate
You know that something's wrong
I know I can't relate

Wind is blowing pleasure by
And I don't feel a thing
Emotion fills the sky
Erosion clouds my brain

I can't seem to breathe in
I can't seem to see then
Through the deafening silence of pain
(Left all alone again)

Imprisoned by this selfish reign
(With no more rules to bend)
I think I'm breaking down

[Chorus]
And if had just one more day
I'd tell you everything
Everything I had to say
I miss you

And if I had just one more day
I'd show you one last thing
Honesty believes in fate
'Cause fate is what I've gained

[Verse 2]
Strength has come and gone
So now I lie in wait
The void is never long
The core belief in fate

I've been down this lonely road
Before, I know the way
As situations change
The answers will remain

Now I've got a reason
As time has brought new seasons
To carry me from this pain
Living proof of selfless gain

I've been down this road
The answers still the same

[Chorus]
And if had just one more day
I'd tell you everything
Everything I had to say
I miss you

And if I had just one more day
I'd show you one last thing
Honesty believes in fate
Cause fate is what I've gained

[Post Chorus]
I've been down this road
The answer's still the same
