Tonight, I'm freaking out again
Tonight, I'm thinking so low
All I wanted was a friend
All I have got is no one
Tonight I'll sleep alone
I won't sleep at all
My heart isn't alive

Right now I'm sinking further down
Right now I'm breaking inside
A long drive to see you lie in bed
A long ride wishing for your life
Tonight I'll stay with you
And I will get us through

My heart ripped from my chest
Too late, I hope not for this
My heart isn't alive

Nauseous, preparing for the worst
Cautious, repairing open wounds
Yet somehow believing in a chance
It'll turn out to be another test
And you'll come back again

My heart ripped from my chest
Too late I hope not for this
My heart isn't alive

My arms carry the weight
Two hands, folded yet straight
My arms, closed in a prayer for you

I'm lost in the woods
They say
To me

Right now I'm sinking further down
Right now I'm breaking in - side

My heart ripped from my chest
Too late, I hope not for this
My heart isn't alive (x2)

My arms carry the weight
Two hands, folded yet straight
My arms, closed in a prayer for you

Tonight I'll stay with you
