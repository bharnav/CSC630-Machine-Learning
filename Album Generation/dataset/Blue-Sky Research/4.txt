[Verse 1]
Your face is burned inside my brain
I lost my way
Your taste of skin flows through my veins
The cost I'll pay

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ohh, cause you'll never understand me
Oh, you want me to stay

[Chorus 1]
You're ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling
But I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

[Version 2]
The race of slowing down the pace
I found a way
The pace of speaking, so mundane
The sound of gain

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ohh, but you'll never make me happy
Ohh, so I've extinguished the flame

[Chorus 1]
You're ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling
But I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

[Bridge]
And what you want me to say
I'll never say
You're playing the game
That I'll never play
So what do you want from me
Now I've extinguished the flame

[Chorus 3]
You're ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling
But I can't save you
I don't see you anymore
You're ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're fa-fa-fa-falling
But I can't save you
I don't see you anymore
