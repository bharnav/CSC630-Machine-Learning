Tonight's the night in your arms again
Be the one to make me whole and then
Say whatever you have to say to me
On and honestly

Every single thought of you amazes me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me

To find the one with your heart and stem
Freed and mine much more than the rest of them
Seed the chance to grow and be with me
The way I know and see

Every single thought of you amazes me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me
Every single time that you've forgiven me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me

There you are in my thoughts again
Fearing all we have is dead
Taken time as the best of friends
Pleae don't let me down again

Every single thought of you amazes me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me
Every single time that you've forgiven me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me

Every single thought of you
Every single thought of you
Every single thought of you
Every single thought of you
