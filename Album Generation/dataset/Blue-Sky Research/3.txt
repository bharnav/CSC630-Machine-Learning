[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for you
To show your face as a clue
Living disgrace, my eyes are burned
And my ears are tired of all these screams, screams

[Chorus]
So I run
The truth is falling
You're the one sent to kill me

[Verse 2]
Several days in a mood
Since there's no way to elude
What can I say
My skin's a lie, and my heart is broke from all these lies, why

[Extended Chorus] (x2)
So I run
The truth is falling
You're the one sent to kill me
It's so wrong
That death is haunting
Now I'm gone
To self inflicting
