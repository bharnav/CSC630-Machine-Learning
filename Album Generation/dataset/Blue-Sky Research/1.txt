Standing on a land unknown, interpreting the same
Believing in the chance of hope, and see it slowly fade
It's breaking far away, replacing what I'm made of

Looking for a way to show (That I'm)
Searching for a faith who knows (That I'm)
Screaming for a place to go

(Chorus)
Cause I'm drowning in the violent seas
Of being force-fed societies
Shallow end of misery please take me away cause i can't stay
Looking for a way to show that I'm okay
Screaming for a place like home

Treading in the fears I own of ending up ashamed
While cornered in this life and prone by overbearing waves
That steal what I have saved replacing what I gave up

Looking for a way to show (That I'm)
Searching for a faith who knows (That I'm)
Screaming for a place to go

(Chorus)
Away, far away
