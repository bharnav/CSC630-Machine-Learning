[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I don't know if you remember
And I don't know how much you saw
We came in here through the window
But we'll be leaving through the door
I don't remember if you remember, watching me smoking the night
Then suggesting that I should kiss you, know that we were out of sight?

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I wanna dance with you but my hands are on fire!
I wanna dance with you but my feet are too tired!

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
I don't know if you ignored me when I was trying to catch your eye
Being in love with you ain't easy when you always pass me by
I think it's obvious it's broken
The things we love just never last
Collect your thoughts and move on
And let the present become the past

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I wanna dance with you but my hands are on fire!
I wanna dance with you but my feet are too tired!

[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I don't know if you remember
And I don't know how much you saw
We came in here through the window
But we'll be leaving through the door

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I wanna dance with you but my hands are on fire!
I wanna dance with you but my feet are too tired!
I wanna dance with you but my hands are on fire!
I wanna dance with you but my feet are too tired!
