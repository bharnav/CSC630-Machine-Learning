[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You say that you're trying to change but you go at it again
At it again
What can I say?
Sometimes you go out of your way, sometimes
You say that you're trying to change but you at it again
At it again
And now it seems the only way to tell the night from day, is you

[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
You say you just give what you get
So I will try an' forget, try to forget
What did you say?
Sometimes you go out of your way, sometimes
You say you just give what you get so I will try and forget
Try and forget and maybe when we
Both come down then, we can work this out
Or not

[Chorus 2: Matt Bowman]
You've got nothing I can't get from my friends
I'm gonna take your enemies and make them pretend
That we don't get along with you and you've got nothing to hide
Take those feelings, keep them buried inside
You've got nothing I can't get from my friends
I'm gonna take your enemies and make them pretend
That we don't get along with you and you've got nothing to hide
Take those feelings, keep them buried, buried inside

[Chorus 1: Matt Bowman]
You say that you're trying to change but you go at it again
At it again
What can I say?
Sometimes you go out of your way, sometimes
You say that you're trying to change but you at it again
At it again
And now it seems the only way to tell the night from day, is you
