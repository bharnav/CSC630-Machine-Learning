[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I saw you outside
And I know where you've been
No, you'll do it again
What's that you said, "alright?"
Well I know they're your friends
But I can't speak to them

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
You make me say those words
And I know what you mean but still, I hope you'll come clean
Is this the way of the world?
'Cause I just can't figure it out
They're making me go without

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this
What you gonna say about it now?
'Cause I need to know this
Yeah, I need to know this
