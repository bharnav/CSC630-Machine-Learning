[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I never wanted anything from you
Not now I'm going through another change
I always hoped that we could see this through
But now the ends in view, I cannot wait

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You've got a lot of nerve to come around here
Yeah, you've got a lot of nerve to come around here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But, you can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
You can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
I never thought that it could hurt like this
Another hidden kiss and now you're gone
I thought that if I just forgot your name, I wouldn't see you again
But, I was wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You've got a lot of nerve to come around here
Yeah, you've got a lot of nerve to come around here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But, you can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
You can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You've got a lot of nerve to come around here
Yeah, you've got a lot of nerve to come around here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But, you can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
You can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
You can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
You can stay if that's what you like
It's okay, just turn out the lights
When you're leaving
