[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
All these things were done in secret
But you can find out if you come around
It doesn't last long but we can repeat it
And keep our heads buried deep in the sand

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
Things just seem to go in circles
But things are finally coming round
All isn't lost 'cause I hear you say so
Suppose we'll just set back into town

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
Well you can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?
Well you can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?

[Refrain: Matt Bowman]
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
Well you can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?
Well you can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?

[Refrain: Matt Bowman]
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?
You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for?

[Outro: Matt Bowman & The Pigeon Detectives]
You can put my back against the wall
All of these things were done in secret
But you won't take me outside
All of these things were done in secret
What are you waiting for?
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
All of these things were done in secret
