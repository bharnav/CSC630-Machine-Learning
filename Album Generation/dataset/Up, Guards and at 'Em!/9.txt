[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I never thought that this could happen like it used to
Thought I wouldn't miss you, but I still do
Are you still practicing those habits that I gave you?
You weren't that cautious on the first time that I met you
Maybe you were scared I would forget you
So we agreed on doing things we now regret too

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't know you
But there's a look inside your eyes that says I used to
I don't know you
But there's a silence in your voice that says I should do

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
Do you remember all those things that were below you?
And all those different people tried to hold you
But you were only ever happy in your own shoes

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't know you but there's a look inside your eyes that says I used to
I don't know you but there's a silence in your voice that says I should do

[Refrain: Matt Bowman]
Now I will go inside but if you need me, you can reach me when it feels right
Now I will go inside but if you need me, you can reach me when it feels right

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't know you but there's a look inside your eyes that says I used to
I don't know you but there's a silence in your voice that says I should do

[Refrain: Matt Bowman]
Now I will go inside
But if you need me, you can reach me when it feels right
Now I will go inside
But if you need me, you can reach me when it feels right
