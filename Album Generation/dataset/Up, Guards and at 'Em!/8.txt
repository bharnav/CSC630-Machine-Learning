[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
Pick yourself up off the bathroom floor
You know you that you've got a problem that we can't ignore
They're telling you that you don't belong here
Well I'm not saying what you wanna do
But you know something is changing and it must be you
Hey now, girl, it's your life, and you can turn it all around

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
If you go at it completely
Go at it completely
Go at it completely
Go at it completely
You go at it completely
You go at it completely

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
I shaved my face and I feel somehow new
I know it's only a start, but it'll have to do
And they're telling me that I don't belong here
People are saying that it's just a phase
And if you really wanted, you could change your ways
But listen, hey now girl, it's your life, and you can turn it all around

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
If you go at it completely
Go at it completely
Go at it completely
Go at it completely
You go at it completely
You go at it completely

[Verse 3: Matt Bowman]
I don't know what you were talking about
But you're wearing us out
You just keep on complaining
I don't know what you were talking about
But you're wearing us out
You just keep on complaining
Well, I don't know what you were talking about
But yeah, you're wearing us out
You just keep on complaining

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
When you go at it completely
Go at it completely
Go at it completely
You go at it completely
You go at it completely
You go at it completely
