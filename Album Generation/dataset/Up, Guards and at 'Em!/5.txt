[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
Are you still carrying the torch?
Did they forget about your cause?
Are you relieved, that there'll be no repeat?
You're breaking hearts you can't replace
But still you won't give up the chase
There's no relief

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
What you gonna do, when they're coming after you?
And you thought it would be easy
You better join a queue
What you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
You got your hand caught in the till
But still you're firing at will
No retreat
No, there'll be no retreat
You've knocked on every single door
But still they've found you wanting more
You're a thief

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
What you gonna do, when they're coming after you?
And you thought it would be easy
You better join a queue
What you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What you gonna do, when they're coming after you?
And you thought it would be easy
You better join a queue
What you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
