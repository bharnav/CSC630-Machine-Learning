[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I can't seem to get this all out my head
Is it me, is it you, is it me now?
I can't seem to get this all out my head
Is it me, or is it you, is it me now?

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
You don't know what it's doing to me
You don't know what it's doing to me

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down
No, I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
Remember yesterday the streets were running red?
I lie down on the ground hearing noises
Well this city's just a place to rest my head
Sleep it off, coming down, hearing voices

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
And you don't know what it's doing to me
You don't know what it's doing to me

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down
No, I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
And you don't know what it's doing to me
You don't know what it's doing to me

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
But I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down
No, I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down

Now I was never lost, I just got out of here
So now you won't lay me down
