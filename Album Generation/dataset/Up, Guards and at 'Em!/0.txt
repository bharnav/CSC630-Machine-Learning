[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't wanna do anything like you
You got me boxed in a corner
I can't get out of here
I don't wanna play anybody's fool
But I'm boxed in a corner
I can't get out of here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way

[Refrain: Matt Bowman]
What did she expect to get from me?
Before we start it is over then I fall asleep

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't wanna play anybody's fool
But I'm boxed in a corner
I can't get out of here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I don't wanna do anything like you
But I'm boxed in a corner
I can't get out of here

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way
I know what you're gonna say
How much am I gonna take?
She wants me out of the way
