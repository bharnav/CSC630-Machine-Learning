First Verse
I Take A Laser Beam And I Use It Like A Stone Axe Baby
I Take The Present, Past, And Future Mama, And Blast
It Out My Thorax -Hey, Hey, Hey…

Chorus
Call Me Animal, That's My Name
Call Me Animal, I'm Not Ashamed
Call Me Animal, This Is Your Hour
Call Me Animal, You've Got The Power

Second Verse
I Use The Juju Of My Ancestors
To Drive This Piece Of Meat
I Scream The Music Of The Pleistocene
Just Because It's Got A Good Beat, Hey, Hey

Chorus
Call Me Animal, That's My Name
Call Me Animal, I'm Not Ashamed
Call Me Animal, This Is Your Hour
Call Me Animal, You've Got The Power
Animal, Animal, Animal, Animal

Chorus
Call Me Animal, That's My Name
Call Me Animal. I'm Not Insane
Call Me Animal, This Is Your Hour
Call Me Animal, You Got The Power
Animal, Animal, Animal, Animal…..( Repeat To Fade )
