[First Verse]
Sittin' In The Classroom
Feel Your Heart Goin' Boom
You Start To Get The Feelin'
And Your Head Begins To Reelin'
And Ya Can't Hear What The Teachers Say
Because The News Is Going Down
About The Rock And Roll Dance In Town
And You Know I Just Gotta Hear That Band Play

[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight

[Second Verse]
Well, Tuesday Got The Letter
The Army Thinks I Better
Get Myself Down There Right Away
It's Not That I'm Lazy
I'm Just Too Crazy
To Be Goin' Doin' Things That Way
Because The Kids Will Be In Town
And The Jams Will Be Going Down
I Wanna Do Things The Natural Way

[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight

[Bridge]
Every Day You Can Hear ‘em Say
Ya Gotta Get Down In The Usa……tonight
Ok Kids………….It's Rockin' Time

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Every Day You Can Hear ‘em Say
Ya Gotta Get Down In The Usa……tonight
Ok Kids………….It's Rockin' Time

[Third Verse]
Sun Starts Goin' Down
I Call My Girl Up On The Phone
I Said I'll Pick You Up At Eight
At Last We'll Be Alone
I Hop In My Machine
You Know I Gotta Make The Scene
Dancin' Through The Crowd
Say The People Goin' Wild
When The Bands Really Rockin'
Theres Just No Stoppin'
My Girl Begins To Twirl
The Room Begins To Whirl
It's Outta This World
It's Outta This World

[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight

[Outro]
Hey Now Everybody I Gotta Get Movin'
I Gotta Muscle Me Up Some Action
Well I'll See You All Later
Well Bye Bye
