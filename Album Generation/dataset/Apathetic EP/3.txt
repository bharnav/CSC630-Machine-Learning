I think you know what I'm gettin at
I fine it so up settin that
The memories that used to let
They keep the bad but the good youll just forget
And even though im angry i still can say
I know my heart will break the day
When you peel out and travel away
I can't believe this happened
And all this time i never thought
That all we had, would be all for none

CHORUS:
No I don't hate you
Dont wanna fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now i just dont like you
No I don't hate you
Don't wanna fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Cause you took this too far, too far
It's your decision don't you dare think twice
Go with your instincts along with some bad advice
This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all
You blame me
But some of it is still your fault
I tried to move you
But you just wouldn't budge
I tried to hold your hand
But youd rather hold your grudge
I think you know what I'm getting at
You say goodbye and I just don't want to regret it and...

CHORUS:
No i dont hate you
Dont wanna fight you
Know ill always love you but irght now i just dont like you
(repeat)
Waste of always choosings
These black eyes and these bruises
Over the heartache that they say
Never completely goes away
CHORUS
