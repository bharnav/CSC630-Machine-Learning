And I've collected all these thoughts
And I'm dying just to lose them
And if your words are true or not
I'll die trying to prove them

But I'll just have to accept
That my mind is so inept
And the only thing that's left
For me to do is to trust you

Convince me
Because I really need your help
Well, convince me
Because I can't see this for myself

I'll put the emphasis on the evidence
Begging for the proof
Sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth

This is so unnerving
I know you've never lied to me before
But the things you're telling me
I can't yet believe you can ignore

But I'll just have to accept
That my mind is so inept
And the only thing that's left
For me to do is to trust you

Put the emphasis on the evidence
Begging for the proof
Sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth

And since we've placed our lives into your hands
Confide in what you'll do
Sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth

It's a world full of cynics
Who say to stay alive in it
You gotta stick with what you know
But the soul is always aching (the soul is always aching)
For the heart to start taking (for the heart to start taking)
A chance by letting go
So let go
Let go
Sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth
And since we've placed our lives into your hands
Confide in what you'll do
And sometimes when you're trying to sleep
And all your doubts and your faith don't agree
It's cause sometimes the hardest thing to believe is the truth
