I was thinking, over thinking
'Cause there’s just too many scenarios
To analyze, look in my eyes
'Cause you're my dream please come true
I was thinking, over thinking
About exactly how I’m not exactly him
I'll break my heart in two much worse than you could ever do
You're my dream please come true

'Cause I think way too much, on a one track mind
And you're so out of touch, cause I'm so far behind
I can't deny this anymore, the facts ignored all done before
And if there’s one in this world, you let me know you're not that girl

I was sinking, lower sinking
'Cause I lost the things I held on to
They let me think a thought a thought that I would know was not
Of seeing my dream come true
I was thinking, over thinking
About how I could let you know, there's nothing left to say
I know now you're just in the way, of me and my dream come true

'Cause I think way too much, on a one track mind
And you're so out of touch, cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense, out of all of this
Why a fading scent, just slips through my grip
I can't deny this anymore, the facts ignored all done before
And if there’s one in this world, you'll let me know you're not that girl

Don't touch the positive, with the negative end
Don't touch the positive, with the negative end
'Cause after all the sparks you're still alone in the dark
After all the sparks you're still alone in the dark
And while I'm able, I think I’ll label
Experience with you as a mistake
And while I'm at it, I'll say I've had it
Experience with you is a mistake

'Cause I think way too much, on a one track mind
And you're so out of touch, cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense, out of all of this
Why a fading scent, just slips through my grip
