Yeah I'm not angry, and no I'm not upset
It's taken me awhile, but this is what I've learned
Emotional attachment is really not a threat
When i'm simply not concern
The things that I take on, I soon shrug off
Cause I know no one will ever be content
With the way things are
Or with what they've got
So I've given up and now I'm just indifferent

[Chorus]
You all laugh at me like I'm not happy
With anything, anytime, anywhere
And the half of me all about Apathy
And the other half just doesn't care

I must admit all the words you spoke, I hated
Cause I don't see just how I can be motivated
I'm left to break a sweat over a dying race
It seems our fate is something we've already embraced
Yeah I'm not angry, and no I'm not upset
It's taken me awhile, but this is what I've learned
Emotional attachment is really not a threat
When i'm simply not concern

[Chorus]

Yeah, being apathetic's a pathetic way to be
(But I don't care)
What matters to you does not matter to me
(Cause I don't care)

So take a wild guess it's like I just couldn't care less
If all the things you find impressive
Just blew up and made those messes
That you'll frantically repair
Like kissing leopards at the fair
And all the while you're unaware
For this you really shouldn't care
But it's so hard to see the reality
That the end will be the end of things
And our hearts are all we get to bring
So let's go ahead and make them worth something

[Chorus] x 2

I'm well aware that everthing
Is a far cry from all right
I'm well aware that all of us
Can at times, be too uptight
And possibly, the remedy
Is a does of apathy
You point your finger at you
I'll point mine right back at me
