History flies all around me
An angry swarm of mistakes
I ran away but not far enough
I thought they were gone, i didn't realize
I kept them alive in the back of my mind
If i could forget it would starve them to death

Pay no attention to the monsters
That come ahead of their time
They hurt much more before they're real
Their fingers reach from the future
To clutch my throat and play with my mind
Turning away would starve them to death

All that's left in my power
Is trusting or not, in this hour
If i believe it would starve them to death
