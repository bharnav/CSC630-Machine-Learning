It's always perfect always safe
And every place is the same
What more could you ask for
Look it's clean as a hospital

I guess it's ok it's not that bad
She and i could have it worse
We might as well why not i've heard
Aiming high can hurt

A thousand sundays fill a box
Packaged neatly in my head
I'll take what they handed me i guess
That's as good as it gets
I listened carefully i heard
Every word that he said
But the closest i put it to my heart
Is this cross around my neck
----------
With my blinders on
It's all pretty good
I could take them off
But i dont see why i should
