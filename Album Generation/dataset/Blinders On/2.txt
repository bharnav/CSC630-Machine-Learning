So it's my turn now
To say the words I'm sorry
You'd think i'd be an expert
After all the times you showed me how

It pains my heart
To turn and leave you lonely
You'd think i'd be an expert
After all the times you showed me how

So many times i held my hand out
To open the door to my life, you couldn't care less
And so many times you walked away
So i closed it for the last time

It was sad but i
Didn't cry i'm sorry
You'd think i'd be an expert
After all the times you showed me how
Yah you'd think i'd be an expert
After all the times you showed me how
