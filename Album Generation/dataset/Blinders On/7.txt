I've had enough of these gray streets
Endless and empty
It's always dusk and there's no noon
There's no midnight

I can't recall when i arrived
Or how i got here
But i've been in this town for way too long
A graveyard has more cheer

I wandered around looking for life
But i found no one
Save this queue of a nervous few
But i wouldn't count them

I'm not going back to
Those gray streets where there's
No lighted windows
