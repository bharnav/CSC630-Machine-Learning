I wonder should
I pull my courage out and say it
Would you be scared
And think different of me now
Would that break it

Every time you call
Though we talk so long
I say nothing at all

Is it just me
Has my mind been running wild
Through a dreamland
Where you might care
More for me than you show
Am i stupid

Every time i call
Though we talk so long
I say nothing at all

I'm more naive
Than i would like to be
Were you joking
Did i miss cues
Miss my most important lines
Of the whole scene

Every time you call
I'm against the wall
I fight myself

Every time you call
I'm agains the wall
I say nothing at all
Every time i call
Though we talk so long
I say nothing at all
