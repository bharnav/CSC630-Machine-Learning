Please show me there's something wrong
That i don't see in you
Some terrible secret flaw that no one could excuse
I've tried to hide you from my mind
And make myself forget
Please don't try to stay
We'll only make what's clean a mess

Run away girl
Run away now
Run away girl

The way that you smile at me
Isn't helping much at all
Please try not to laugh it only makes me want you more
We both know this could never be
But i can't let you go

Run away girl
Run away now......

What if you thought you saw a ghost
A hundred times a day
What if the thing you wanted most
Was impossible to say

Run away girl
Run away now.......
