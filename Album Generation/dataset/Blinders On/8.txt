Oses never red
Things that won't die when they're bled
I can't live this way
Nothing gets done in my head

Your words they never go
They've made my head their home
Though i often scold
I try to shoo them away
But they always stay
And it's getting old

If there's nothing there
Then why do i spend all the day
Entertaining them
Rewind and play them again

It's funny how i put up with all this
Like i have nothing to do
And nothing to lose
I've said goodbye so many times
They've stayed too long
I've got thoughts of my own
