I've become a hollow man
I blame it all on time
The whipping boy
Who'll never tell
But you know when i lie

I close my eyes
Anaesthetize
It seems to work a while
But every moment i'm away
Is keeping me a child

In the dark when i'm alone
I know that i can call
You will never turn away
You always break my fall
