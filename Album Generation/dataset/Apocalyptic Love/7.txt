[Verse 1]
Blood red sky on a desert road
Got to make my way down to Mexico
For, what I did, I know that it was wrong
The fire in my heart, it will never die
Everything I love will be left behind
No turning back, forever gone tonight

[Chorus]
All my love, Anastasia
Anastasia, this may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

[Verse 2]
All that I need is a miracle
Lawmen got me running now forever more
They'll hunt me down until the end of time
Oh my, mama, now I've got to go
Never love another how I've loved you so
I'm so afraid to leave this all behind

[Chorus]
All my love, Anastasia
Anastasia, this may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

[Solo]

[Chorus]
All my love, Anastasia
Anastasia, this may be our last goodbye
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight
Anastasia, Anastasia
For your honor, took a life
You can't save me, I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

[Outro Solo]
