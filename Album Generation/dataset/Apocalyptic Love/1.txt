[Verse 1]
My life it feels just like a never-ending Monday morning
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
Will it ever end?
No, I don't like it
No color in the sky, the same old tired situation
Stuck in the place I can't escape
I've been here way too long
All this monotony has gotten me nowhere
But doubt I'm reckless and on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I still remember
We did whatever
We had it all when we were young and free
Was never better, those were the best of times

[Chorus]
One last thrill it always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

[Verse 2]
I go to work, the boss is clamoring for my attention
Another monologue I've heard a million times before
No, I'm not lying
I'm bored to death, this life's been draggin' since I don't remember
This nine-to-five is like a suicide I can't endure
And if I don't get any time, I think I'm going to die
I'm reckless and on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I still remember
We did whatever
We had it all when we were young and free
Was never better, those were the best of times

[Chorus]
One last thrill it always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

[Verse 3]
I want to feel what I felt before
I want to know there's something more
Because the Devil down in me, it never dies
I want to revel in ecstasy
I want the good goin' bad in me
Want to live just like I'm dying
I don't want to let this moment pass me by
I wave bye bye bye

[Solo]

[Chorus] [x2]
One last thrill it always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

One last thrill it always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die
