Dirty sunrise creeping in
Broken bottles, gilled within
The room is black
The blinds are drawn
I don't remember anything
What I've done, where I've been
Another night has come and gone

[Chorus 1]
This is not for me, no
This is not for me, no
This life is not for me, no
This is not for me, no
Anymore

[Verse 2]
The devil smiles and laughs at me
Says, "You'll be back, just wait and see
You know I've heard this all before"
And I say
"You can keep your high life in the hills
Your cocaine lies and whiskey thrills
I don't need you anymore"

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
The only thing that makes me whole again
Is to stand right here before you with a song, oh
I'll keep running til the very end
For the life I've lived is not the life I want

Dirty sunrise creeping in
Broken bottles, gilled within
In a place I don't belong

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You can keep your life
I don't want anymore, yeah
I'm going to leave it all behind yeah
I'm going to leave it all behind yeah
I don't want no more, don't want no more
Yeah yeah yeah
