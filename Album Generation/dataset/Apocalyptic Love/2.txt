[Verse 1]
You're the dark to light
You're never satisfied
You only know the things that will fail to be
A pessimistic one
Who sees the end to come
Where every joy is lost to a tragedy
And still you wonder why you cannot find your peace today
Because you were meant to live
So much more than this
Now if only you could see

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
There ain't a cloud in sight
Still your heart beats cold and grey
Every day

[Verse 2]
You know it brings me down
The way you drag around
Your heavy heart just like a stone
Well, keep your misery
Don't put it all on me
Cause I've got problems of my own

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah today

[Verse 3]
And if I could, you know I'd set off a spark
I would burn it out, I would burn it all away
If you're a fire jaded, cold calloused heart
Some day, I'll find a way

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
Someday I'll steal the spark, I will burn your doubt away
I'll find a way
