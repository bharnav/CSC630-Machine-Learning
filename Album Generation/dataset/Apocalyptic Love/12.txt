[Verse 1]
If I could, I'd stand for something
I would turn the bitter tide
I would turn it on the pain I've come to know
And calm the storm that never dies

I'm hearing

[Chorus]
Shots fired
Out of range
They want to see me in a blood soaked grave
But still I live to die another day

[Verse 2]
I can feel it from a distance
All the venom and the spite
It's not enough for though I've given them my all
Impossible to satisfy

[Chorus] [x2]

Another day
For I've heard it all before
It's all in vain
You won't shoot me down

[Chorus] [x2]
