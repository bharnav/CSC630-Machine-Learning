[Verse 1]
I got a real bad feeling
There'll be nothing to say
Whole world's going crazy
Know the end is on the way
But we've got one hot minute
To do anything you like
To do anything you like

[Chorus]
This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight

[Verse 2]
I want to feel you falling right on my side
Apocalyptic love
I want to ride until we die
Until the last night's faded
I just want to see you smile
I just want to see you smile
As we burn the pyre

[Chorus]
This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight

[Verse 3]
We'll dance under the burning sky
Watch it die
No sorrow, no sorrow
Together as the fires rage
And erase tomorrow
Tomorrow
And when it's all said and done
We will have love
Until the very end of time

[Solo]

[Chorus]
This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
Oh my love
This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight
