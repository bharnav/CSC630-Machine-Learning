[Verse 1]
Took a shot in the dark
Though the aim was true
Still it missed the mark
As we wait for a hero we can't find
Now I know, now I realize
It's a hard line
Once you cross, you're on your own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
We can't wait much longer

[Chorus 1]
When your heroes, turn to the enemy
And there's nothing left to hold
When your heroes, give only apologies
I won't deny it leaves me cold

[Verse 2]
Once again, you let us fall
Still you ease our minds and assured us all
"In the end, everything's going to be alright"
But they won't
Now I realize, these are hard times
We can't fight them on our own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
Who will save tomorrow?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Hope we're still alive
Still alive
Oh, oh, oh
Hope we're still alive
Still alive in the end

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now I know
Now I realize, these are hard times
We can't face them on our own
But I won't lie, I'm not satisfied
Who will save tomorrow?

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Chorus 2]
