It was two years lost, so (I) don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
(You know it's true)
You probably wouldn't be alive
Had the Devil on a shoulder
With a death wish on mind
Well, the hounds of Hell
They knew us well
They were never too far behind

We were singing

[Chorus]
"Someday, we'll look back if we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday, we'll get out of this crazy life"

[Verse 2]
You had long black hair
The Devils stare
Oh, you were a mystery
Always come around
To bring me down
Do a little bit for free
You couldn't get your shit together
Couldn't bring yourself to right
Because it's hard to tell
When you're so unwell
If you're in Hell or paradise

We were singing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's hard to see it
When you're sucked down and reeling
So hard to pull back in from the tide
It's a crazy life

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
It was two years lost, so (I) don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
You know it's true
You probably wouldn't be alive

We were singing

[Chorus]
