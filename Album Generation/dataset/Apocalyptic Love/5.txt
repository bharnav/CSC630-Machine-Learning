[Verse 1]
Like a prophet of doom I've come to show the way
I'm the Devil you keep inside
Cause it's all I can do to stay solid and remain
Watching all of your days pass you by

[Chorus]
But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

[Verse 2]
Could be living so high, but you waste your life away
So afraid to be what you are
So I'll beg you to try to start living for today
Cause regret's gonna bury your heart

[Chorus]
But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

You will not obey
You will not obey - defy it
I will lead the way
I will lead the way to burn you down

[Chorus]
But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need ain't in the clouds
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

[Outro]
Put down your halo
Put down your halo
Here it comes, here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo now
