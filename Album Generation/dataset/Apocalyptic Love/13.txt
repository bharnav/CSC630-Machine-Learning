[Intro]
All those city lights
You got mesmerized
You forgot where you were from
And who you are
Such a tragedy
You were young and free
Did you ever think
That you would fall so far?

[Chorus]
Turn it on tonight
Carolina
Till the morning light
Carolina

[Verse 2]
I remember when
You were innocent
I remember what you were;
My dirty rose
Never happy now
You're just selling out
Easy street is drenched in tears
You know it's never paved in gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just leave your dirty little secrets for a while
Just leave your dirty little secrets for a while
Let me make it alright

[Solo]

[Chorus] [x2]
