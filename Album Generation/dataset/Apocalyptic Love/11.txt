[Verse 1]
Across the long last great divide
The distant longing never dies
And all the pain of a dream that was never known
Never fades, no
"That's alright, someday I'll find you"
I tell myself most every night

[Chorus]
You seem so far and away
Another life, another time and place
Oh, oh, if only I could find you
So far and away
There's something lost and never will replace
It seems so far away

[Verse 2]
A love I'll never come to see
You know I tried, can't let it be
My Lord it aches
Oh the longing, it only grows every day
I only bleed when I'm all alone
They said, "in time", "give it tomorrow"
But to me that's just a lie

[Chorus]
You seem so far and away
Another life, another time and place
Oh, oh, if only I could find you
So far and away
I'm waiting on a miracle today
It seems so far away

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
So if you hear this last refrain
I hope you know that I still wait
I can't let go
All I need is a miracle, here today
All I need is a miracle
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
It seems so far and away
Another life, another time and place
Oh, oh, I hope these words will find you
So far and away
It's something lost that never will replace
No, I'm begging for a miracle today
Hey, hey, hey

[Solo]

[Outro]
And I wait so long to find you
And I wait so long to live
And I'm so alone, so alone
