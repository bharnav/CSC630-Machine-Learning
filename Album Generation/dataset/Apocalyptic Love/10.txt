I don't want it
Don't need anymore
You got me lying on the killing floor tonight
I'm on eleven
Been up for days
It's going to bring me to an early grave
That's right
So I've got to go
You won't change my mind

[Chorus]
Cause I can't survive
Another night in the white room
Cause a tiny bit
It always turns to more
And these bloodshot eyes gotta say goodbye
I had my fun
But I can't deny
Living hard and fast
I'll never last beside you

[Verse 2]
My skin is crawling
I'm a shell of myself
He come a rolling like a bat out of hell
That's right
Every fucking time
Well come on lover
Won't you give it a rest?
I'm never gonna make it out of this mess alive

So I've got to go
Got to say goodbye

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
