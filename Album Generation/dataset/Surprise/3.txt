[Verse 1]
I registered to vote today
Felt like a fool
Had to do it anyway
Down at the high school
Thing about the second line
You know, felt like a fool?
People say it all the time
Even when it's true

[Chorus][x2]
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?
Because it sure don't feel like love

[Verse 2]
How does it feel?
Feels like a threat
A voice in your head that you'd rather forget
No joke, no joke
You get sick from that unspoken
Sure don't feel like love
No joke, no joke
Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love

[Bridge]
Yay! Boo![x2]

[Verse 3]
Wrong again, wrong again
Maybe I'm wrong again
Wrong again
Maybe I'm wrong again
Wrong again
I could be wrong again
I remember once in August 1993
I was wrong, and I could be wrong again
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy
So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again
I remember once in a load-out, down in Birmingham

[Outro]
Yeah, but that didn't feel like love
Sure doesn't feel like, sure doesn't feel like, sure doesn't feel like love[x3]
