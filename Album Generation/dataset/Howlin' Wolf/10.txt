She's hot like red pepper
Sweet like cherry wine
I'm so glad she love me
Love me all the time
She's my little baby
Sweet as she can be
All this love she's got
It belong to me
If you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hooee
Every time she kiss me
She make the lights go out
Up early in the morning
She make me jump and shout
This bad love I've got
Make me laugh and cry
Makes me really look
That I'm too young to die
If you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hooee
Every time she kiss me
She make the lights go out
Up early in the morning
She make me jump and shout
She my little baby
Sweet as she can be
And all this love she's got
It belong to me
If you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hoo
Hoo hoo, hoo hooee
She's hot like red pepper
Sweet like cherry wine
I'm so glad she loves me
Love me all the time
This bad love I've got
Make me laugh and cry
Makes me really look
That I'm too young to die
If you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hoo
Hoo hoo, hoo hooee
And if you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hoo
Hoo hoo, hoo hooee
