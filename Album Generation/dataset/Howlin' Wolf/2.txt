You so sweet, you so fine
How I wish, you were mine
Honey, I'll be your love
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You so nice, you so true
I'm so glad, I love you
Honey, I'll be your love
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
Tell me pretty baby, is you gonna try
If you say it baby, hang on baby, till the day I die
It's so true, I love you
I don't care, what you do
Honey, I'll be your love
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
Tell me, pretty baby, is you gonna try
If you say it baby, hang on baby till the day I die
That is true, I love you
I don't care, what you do
Honey, I'll be your love
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
