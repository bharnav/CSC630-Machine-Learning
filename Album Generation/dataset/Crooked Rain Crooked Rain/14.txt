Well, you mesmerize me
Stop criticizing me
You know, I'm solo that way
And I'm heading for the Cape

I'm on a raft, can't turn back
Stimulate the open chords
I'm on a raft, can't turn back

(Louder!)

You're an ocean of honey
Painfully funny, yeah
And the tears that you grow
Are coming up early

I'm on a raft, can't turn back
And you stimulate the open chords
Rats, in the bath, of the shaft...

((indistinct))

You're a Nestea splash
Sunkist two-thousand class
All the towelers of thongs
And a heavy, line, oh...

Down the golden groves
All around this funky place
Damn, damn, damn
All the forty-niners...
