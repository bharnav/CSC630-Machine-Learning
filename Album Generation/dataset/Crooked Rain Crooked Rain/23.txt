In a bucket top of the hill
Overlooking out of time thrills
You think you need some inspiration
And I wouldn?t wanna ask because I don?t mind
If it don?t rhyme

Are a trespasser
Kiss me when I cross the tracks, baby
And I?ll be watching you babe
I?ll be watching you, I?ll be whining too

Just a soiled little filly can't raise the roof
Keep your heart open under your glass
It was given my a maker that dirty, dirty taker
And ya don?t mind because he don?t mind saying

?I feel like a lap dog
You pet me when I beg
Why do beggarsisis
They never kneel??

I?ll be watching for you, too
I?ll be watching for you, too
I?ll be watching for you, too
I?ll be watching you

Who
