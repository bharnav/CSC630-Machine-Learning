I got a leaf
And a spleef
Light that spleef
God bless that spleef in my mouth
Or should I say ja baby
Spin Doctors are crazy
Take it Butch

I got a life complete with my love
I got a wife, she fits in my leather gloves
I got a knife and I keep it above my heart for you
Rock on

It always sets me down
The way you tremble when you're down
And all the lies you tell
Come back to haunt you baby
Back to haunt you down
Come back to haunt you baby
Haunt you down
All right

Look Out

I've been to Christmas in France
I don't wanna have no pants
I've had Christmas in France
Where they don't wear any pants
I've had Christmas in Detroit
How do you think that feels?
I've been married in Cincinnati too
Hold Off

All you need your fill is waiting for your man to come home
All your deets undecided boxes
Are coming out
I'm coming out
I'm hungry for you
I can smell you on my hands
And it smells really good
Oh yeah

Hold me down and love me
Hold me down and love me
Keep that knife above me

I'll teach you how to look my age
If you wanna look old
I'll teach you how to look my age
If you wanna look old
I'll teach you how to look my age
I'll teach you how to act like over age, over age
