[Verse 1]
Silent kid, no one to remind you
You got no heel, no reels to remind you
Silent kid, don't take your pawn shop home on the road, goddamn you
Silent kid, don't lose your graceful tongue

[Bridge]
This is the city life, (this is the city life) come on
Let's talk about leaving

[Verse 2]
Come on now, talk about your family
Your sister's cursed, your father's old and damned, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the grandmother's advice about us, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the rain

[Outro]
Hand me the drum stick, snare kick
Blues call and response
I lose myself in change
Into the spotlight
Ecstasy feels so warm inside
Till five hours later
I am chewin'
Screwin' myself with my hand
