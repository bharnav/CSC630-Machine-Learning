Call, response. Syncopate the prose
Fuck the highs because I live for the lows
Four by four, with activated riff
It's good in my car, so it must be a hit

I know where the heart is(x2)

Giant drinks and waitress indisposed
Ski that jump on the tip of her nose
Forget it
Songs are written but never with a pen
The words will follow but you never know when

I know where the start is(x2)
