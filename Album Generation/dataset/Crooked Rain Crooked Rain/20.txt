Some bands I like to name check
And one of them is R.E.M.,
Classic songs with a long history
Southern boys just like you and me
R - E - M

Flashback to 1983
*Chronic Town* was their first EP
Later on came *Reckoning*
Finster's art, and titles to match
"So. Central Rain", "(Don't Go Back to) Rockville"
"Harborcoat", "Pretty Persuasion"
You were born to be a camera
"Time After Time" was my least favorite song
"Time After Time" was my least favorite song

The singer, he had long hair
And the drummer he knew restraint
And the bass man he had all the right moves
And the guitar player was no saint

So lets go way back to the ancient times
When there were no 50 states
And on a hill there stands Sherman
Sherman and his mates
And they're marching through Georgia
We're marching through Georgia
We're marching through Georgia
G-G-G-G-Georgia
They're marching through Georgia
We're marching through Georgia
Marching through Georgia
G-G-G-G-Georgia
And there stands R.E.M

(Aye Sir, Aye Sir, Aye Sir they're coming, Aye Sir, move those wagons, Aye
Sir, Artillery's in place Sir, Aye Sir, Aye Sir, hide it, hide it, Aye
Sir, run, run.)
