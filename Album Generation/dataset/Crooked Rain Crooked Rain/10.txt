[Verse 1]
I'm up on a hill top where I
Keep you in sight, my little toys
I buried you because the sun
Will melt them
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve

[Chorus A]
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Taking over

[Verse 2]
Taking over your life
I'm taking over your scene
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would hope see my face
I would hope you see my face

[Chorus B]
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down (taking over)
There's no survivors
There's no survivors

[Bridge]
Don't even snow
(We're not that disturbed)
Don't even snow

[Chorus C]
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
No survivors
No survivors!
No survivors

[Verse 3]
I'm taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
All I wanted it all
My little trick
I wouldn't mind just a milligram up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve

[Chorus B (modified)]
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors

[Verse 4]
Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
I'm taking everything
I'm taking over

[Outro]
I've got to melt it
I've got to melt it
I've got to melt it
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors
There's no survivors
