Don't be a toy on the back of a magazine
Don't, don't be a toy, on the back of a magazine
There's a caricature no one reads
I know you've got a lot of special things to do with me, I'm through
I know, it's alright, sing along
Sing along, sing along...

Practice everything you preach you nun
I got none today, expecting none tomorrow, and tomorrow after that release the strings of Nashville, and watch the songs expire
And silence is danger, but its not required here, so why you scared?
I know, you got alot of special things to do, with me I'm through, I know, its alright
Sing a song, get you through the night
