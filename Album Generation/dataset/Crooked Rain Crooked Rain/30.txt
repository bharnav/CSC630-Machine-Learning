Heaven is a truck
It got stuck on the breeze
Asked the driver nicely
I need a lift, I need release
The sand in the boats
On the rose-covered floats
She is the queen of a Pasa, Pasadena thrill
I know auks can't fly
I know the sharks they don't have wings
But lady you need some cold advice
About a few things
Loosen my dress
Tie me up just like all the rest
She is the queen of a Pasa, Pasadena thrill
She is the queen of the Pasa, Pasadena thrill
Queen of the Pasa, Pasadena thrill
Queens, kings
Queens, kings, dress [Incomprehensible]
God, squintin' in the back
Honorary chairman, I want an award
Starring on this planet
Let me on the truck
