Staring down, check out my wheels
Don't know much about it
Staring down, check out my wheels
Don't know much about it

It shouldn't give you any
Cause for alarm
Staring and swearing
Won't cause you no harm

Poor Chester, he was a dog
The kind of dog you live in
Drink a sip of secondhand wheels
Nicer things are left in

Car shifting down
Sh, sh, sh, sh, etc
