[Chorus]
Who is it who
Who is it who
Who is it who
Who is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
Oh baby it's you!

[Chorus]
Who is it who
Who is it who
Who is it who
Who is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
Oh baby it's you!

[Bridge]
Watch out now baby cause I'm in love with you
Watch out now baby cause I'm in love with you
And if you don't love me I don't know what I'm going to do!

[Chorus]
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
Who, who, who is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
What is it
Oh baby it's you!
