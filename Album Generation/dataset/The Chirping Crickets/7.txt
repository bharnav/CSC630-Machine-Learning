Staying at home, waiting for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're through an'

I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

Playing the field all day long
Since I found out that I was wronged now

I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

Drunk man, streetcar
Foot slipped there you are now

I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

Caught myself, thinking of you
You can't love me and an other one too

Well I'm looking for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love
