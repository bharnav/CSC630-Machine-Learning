Take my life, cause it's already over

One year closer to the end of it all
One year closer to the end of it all

Every day I grow weaker
Wrapped up in the arms of fear
All this pain taking it's toll
Even gravity can't keep me here

Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me, just bury me)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me, just bury me put me six feet underground)

One year closer to the end of it all
One year closer to the end of it all

(Solo)

Every second feels longer
Every minute feels lethal
Every hour screams death
Every day I die slowly

Take my life, cause it's already over
(In my mind)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(In my mind)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me, just bury me)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me put me six feet underground!)

(Solo)

When you're closer to the... (x2)

When you're closer to the end

The end of it all

One foot in the grave
Don't torture me this way
There is no escape
We're one year closer, we're one year closer

Take my life, cause it's already over
(In my mind)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(In my mind)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me, just bury me)
Take my life, cause it's already over
(Just bury me put me six feet underground)

One year closer to the end of it all
One year closer to the end of it all
