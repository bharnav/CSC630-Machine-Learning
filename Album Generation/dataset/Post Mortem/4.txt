I'm so damn numb
Nothing else matters
I'm miserable
Yet so invincible

I lost my innocence so long ago
Held on to the things that I should've let go
I wanna wake up on the other side
So I can see the world through clearer eyes

This can't be right!

I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life back again
(Fight til the end)
I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life, take my life
Take my life back from me

I'm laying low
Up on my cloud
Turned to ignorance so long ago
Dying to remember what I used to know

This can't be right!
I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life back again
(Fight til the end)
I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life, take my life
Take my life back from me

I know where this road ends but I can't stop
Speeding, exceeding all the limits that my hearts been given
I know where this road ends and I need to stop
I'm pleading, I'm screaming
Don't want to be another wound left bleeding

I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life back again
(Fight til the end)
I'll fight til the bitter end
(Fight til the end)
Take my life, take my life
Take my life back from me
