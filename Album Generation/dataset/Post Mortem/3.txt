[Intro]
I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that - fire!

[Verse 1]
So after all this time you’re still so blind
Thought I was yours
You must have gone and lost your mind
I took it all, there’s nothing left
That you’re showing me your weakness

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re so naive

[Chorus]
I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I’m that - fire!

[Verse 2]
Nothing’s changed, another days has gone
Full of lies, I only told what you want
You’ve hit the wall and I can tell
Cause you’re giving in to your to weakness

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re so naive
You’re so naive

[Chorus]
I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I’m that - fire!

Fire!

[Guitar Solo]

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that

[Chorus]
I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I’m that

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I’m that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I’m that - fire!

Fire!

That fire!
