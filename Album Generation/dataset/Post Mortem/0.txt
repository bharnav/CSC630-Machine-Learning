Try to forget what I did
Guilt beginning to settle in
Let’s not pretend that it’s alright
I could not stay to watch us fall apart

I left you behind with nothing, no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain (and now)

You are nothing but ashes, left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory
Burning with the truth

Save us both from the heartache
Was it so hard to walk away?
You are innocence at its best
I do not deserve what you offer

I left you behind with nothing, no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain (and now)

You are nothing but ashes, left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory
Burning with the truth

Nothing but ashes [x2]
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh) [x4]
Nothing but ashes

I left you behind with nothing, no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain (and now, now, now)

You are nothing but ashes, left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory
Burning with the truth [x2]

Nothing but ashes [x2]
