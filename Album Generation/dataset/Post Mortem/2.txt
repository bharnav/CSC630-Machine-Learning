Hate!
I’m filled with hate
And you will regret
How did I get so lost?

Fight!
I’ll end this fight
Pull Myself out
Save myself at all cost!

Give me my
My life back
I will take what’s gone

How?
How'd we come this far?
And why did we survive?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes

Scorn!
The Things I’ve done
Have left me scarred!
I broke down every wall!

Disgrace!
A victim of
My own disgrace!
I’ll Rise Above it all!

Give what’s rightfully mine!
It was marks to yours

How?
How'd we come this far?
And why did we survive?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes

My path is clearer through honest eyes
My will is stronger through honest eyes
My path is clearer through honest eyes
My will is stronger through honest eyes

I’m taking my
My life back!
This I say each day!

How?
How'd we come this far?
And why did we survive?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes

I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes
I'd rather live my life through Honest Eyes
I'd rather live my life through Honest
Life through Honest Eyes

I’m taking my, my life back
I’m taking my, my life back
