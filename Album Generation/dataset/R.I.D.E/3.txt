When I fall, I fall hard
Sends shivers through my body, and I lay down my guard
I'm pure devotion and sweet emotion
I feel it all when I fall

When I make love, well, I love strong
I let go of everything till everything I have is gone
It's endless passion, it's everlasting
I feel it all when I fall

If you don't feel the way I feel
An' we can still be friends
But after all that I've been through
I can't go down that road again

'Cause when I hurt, well, it runs deep
An' it's more than just a broken heart or tears down my cheek
I feel like dying; my soul is crying
I feel it all when I fall

(Instrumental Break)
(Oh, when I fall.)

Oh, well I'm pure devotion and sweet emotion
I feel it all when I fall. (I can feel it all.)
Baby, it's your call when I fall
Oooh
