Well, he's been known to lose more than he wins
He falls down just to get back up again
The way he smiles... his face is weathered an' leathered an' lined...
You can tell he's learned to laugh through a lotta hard times
He gets by without shovin'; a drifter and a dreamer
He gets stoned on a roll your own... what you get is what you see here

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground
He wears his freedom like a crown
Let the whole world around him change
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy

She tries to tell him he's runnin' out of time
Oh, but that ain't we you'd see if you were lookin' through his eyes
He's still chasin' sunsets, still tryin' to find
Something better than what he'd left behind
She tries to love him but somehow she understands
That it was over the moment it began

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground

He wears his freedom like a crown
Let the whole world around him change
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy

(Instrumental Break)

He's been known to lose more than he wins
He falls down just to get back up again

Once a cowboy, always a cowboy
Between the blue sky an' unbroken ground
He wears his freedom like a crown
Let the whole world around him change
That don't mean a thing...
Once a cowboy, always a cowboy
Yeah
Let the whole world around him change
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

(To fade)
