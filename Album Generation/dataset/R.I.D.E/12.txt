She used to play poker, late into the night with old friends
She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks, but never got drunk
She stood at that kitchen sink, singin' those great old country songs
She didn't think anyone was home... man she could really sing
She laughed loud;
She laughed deep down in her soul
Her rich blue eyes told us of her heartaches an' pain
But mostly they shared with us the good times...
The times of peace an' unfiltered happiness

See traditions run deep around here
Like the deep red wine grows an' flows all through the valley
Sometimes, they're all we've got to hold on to
But now she's gone an' she's never comin' back
An' I'm here;
I'm here an' not a day goes by that I don't miss Maryann

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain
Oh Lord, take away the pain

Pull me in, Lord, into your arms;
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Don't let me go till the morning dawns

Don't say goodnight, don't say goodnight

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain
Oh Lord, take away the pain

She said: "Don't be sad I'm leavin' you
It's all right, it feels all right
'Cause here He comes, I'll be home soon
I see the Light, I see the Light."

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain
Oh Lord, take away the pain

Oh Lord, take away the pain;
Oh Lord, take away the pain
These tears I've cried, they fall like rain
Oh Lord, take away the pain
