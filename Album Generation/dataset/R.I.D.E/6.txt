I got a job on an assembly line
I used to love them words: "Quttin' time"
I'd hit the door runnin', honey, straight to you
But now there's nothin' left to go home to

It's a sad city when the sun goes down
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down
It's a sad city when the sun goes down
Yeah

I'm all right by the light of day
That sunlight seems to keep your mem'ry away
Everything changes when the shadows fall
I'm dyin' slowly by the clock on the wall

'Cause it's a sad city when the sun goes down
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down
It's a sad city when the sun goes down

Oh Yeah

(Instrumental Break)
(Ahh.)

It's a sad city when the sun goes down
Another heart's breakin' as the world goes round
When that moon comes up, oh, these tears roll down
It's a sad city when the sun goes down
It's a sad city when the sun goes down

Sad city when the sun goes down
Sad city, it's a sad, sad city
Sad city when the sun goes down
A sad city
Sad, sad, sad, sad city
Sad city when the sun goes down
Sad city
