Well, you'd think that I was happy
By the smile on my face
But the second someone speaks your name

Well, like a baby, I cry, cry, cry, all night long
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle
Oh, you oughta be a ashamed
You left a good man in a bad way
You left a good man in a bad way

(Instrumental Break)

The old red Nissan truck
I guess it ain't so rare
'Cause since you left me
Man, I been seein' 'em everywhere
I called up my DJ;
I made my request
I said: "Please, please, don't you play that song
'Cause my baby's gone an' every time that song's on"

"I cry, cry, cry, all night long
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle."

Oh, you oughta be a ashamed
You left a good man in a bad way
You left a good man in a bad way

(Instrumental Break)

All alone an' walkin' in a daze
Thinkin' that your heart would never break
Well, baby, just you wait

Like a baby, you'll cry, cry, cry, all night long
Down, down, down in the bottom of a bottle
Oh, you oughta be a ashamed
You left a good man in a bad way
You left a good man in a bad way
You left a good man in a bad way
You left a good man in a bad way

Hey!

(Instrumental Close)
