One two three, c'mon

I got to say there's something on my mind
I've liked the way you been for a long, long time
You've got your mind set up on what you're gonna do. (What you're gonna do.)
Your Mamma didn't make no fool

You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey, hey
You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey, hey

Listen up now:
My Mamma warned me 'bout a girl like you
She said :" A girl like that's gonna break your heart in two."
"With sexy legs an' hair, : an ordinary one."
Stop right there, Mamma, 'cause you know that's what I want

You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey, hey
You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey, hey

Instrumental Break

You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey, hey
You're my little Señorita
You got it going on
Hey, hey
My little Señorita
You got it going on

Now George, I got one more question for you
What do you think about country music today?

Oh, ho, ho, ha, ha

C'mon, give it to me!

I love Trick Pony
