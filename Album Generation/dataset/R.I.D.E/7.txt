The heat rises off of the highway
My rear-view mirror's a blur
You had me spinnin' in circles
Like the dust devils dance in the dirt
But I fin'lly came to my senses
It's time I blew out of this place
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas
An' tell me you needed some space

You'd stand in the middle of Texas
Oh, in the free an' the wide open range
An' feel like you're hemmed in by fences
An' lookin' for someone to blame
Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin'
You're too dead set in your ways
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas
An' tell me you needed some space

Now you can breath just as deep as you want to...
You won't have to smell my perfume
When you feel the need, you can call me

Like the lonely wolf howls at the moon
But this time, I won't come runnin'...
It took me a long time to face
That you'd stand in the middle of Texas
An' tell me you needed some space

You'd stand in the middle of Texas
In the free an' the wide open range
An' feel like you're hemmed in by fences
An' lookin' for someone to blame
Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin'
Well, you're too dead set in your ways
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas
An' tell me you needed some space

Oh, there ain't no changin' you, darlin'
Well, you're too damned set in your ways
'Cause you'd stand in the middle of Texas
An' tell me you needed some space
