The day is finally here
Theres flowers everywhere
The guests are waiting with sweet anticipation
As I look down the aisle the preacher starts to smile
Church bells are ringing and the organ is playing
Im so overcome that I could cry
Im so happy
Im not the bride

Shes such a pretty thing
She don't know anything
Ain't gonna tell her that shes outta her mind
The preacher asks the question
No, I have no objection
I do, I do, I want him outta my life
Throw the rice and let those white dove fly
O happy day
Im not the bride

I need some morcaine
Throw the bouquet
Pass the champagne
Its time to celebrate
Im gonna dance this night away
O woah ya ya

The groom is getting loud
His new wife starts to shout
O this is perfect
It can only get better
There fighting in the car
Off to a real good start
His mama's cryin, arent they lovely together
Their driving away
We wave them good-bye
Close call
Free at last
Amen
Hallelujah
By the grace of God go wild
Im not the bride
Im not the bride
Im free, Im free, Im free
Im not the bride

Thank God
Mm bye bye now
Good luck girl
Your gonna need it
Ha ha ha
Ta ta
