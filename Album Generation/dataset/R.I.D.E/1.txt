What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?

Green eyes, Levis
Built for speed an' just my size
Sun tan, oh man...
Makes my heart beat double time
Well, I know I'm not alone... he's like nobody else
But I can't help myself

What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?

(Instrumental Break)

(Ha, ha.)
(Uh, oh, pick it son.)

Devil's smile, he's kinda wild...
I wanna hold him like a little child
One look an' I'm hooked
There's no denyin', he's got style
He's the dream, he's the king, he's the angel next door
He's all I could want an' more

What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
What's not to fall head over heel in love with?
If he ain't perfect, he's close enough
What's not to love? (What's not to love?)
Who wouldn't be carried away, swept off their feet?
Hey, you tell me... what's not to love?
Yeah, you tell me... (Yeah, you tell me.)
What's not to love?
Oh, you tell me... (Yeah, you tell me.)
What's not to love?
