It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin' but a fool's game:
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
Ah, nah, nah!

Oh, it ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Ooh

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

(Oh, it's a heartache,)
Oh, it's a fool's game
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Standing in the cold rain
(Standing in the cold rain.)
Feelin' like a clown

(It's a heartache,)
It's a heartache
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Love him till your arms break
(Love him till your arms break.)
Ah, then he lets you down
Oh, yeah, down
