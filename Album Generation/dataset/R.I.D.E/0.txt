Written by Buckie Moore and Wally Wilson

Well, it's Friday night at the Farmer's Daughter
But I'm the only one here drinkin' Bottled water
You left me to drown my broken heart
But this one, I'll get over, well, stone cold sober

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
"Jack Daniels" or "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
You wasted my time, my heart and my mind too:
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
Ha, ha

An' I'll admit, we've lived some on the wild side
We dug our heels in deep an' had a wild ride
Oh but one good shot of you was all I needed
So don't set 'em up, Joe, oh no, I'll stick to H2O

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too: (My time.)
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
Ah ha

Instrumental Break
(Oh, I think we need a little help from our friends.)

'Cause I don't need "Jose", believe me, honey, I'm ok
A "Jack Daniels" or a "Jim Beam" ain't gonna pull me through
An' you wasted my time, my heart and my mind too:
I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
No I ain't wastin' good whiskey on you
