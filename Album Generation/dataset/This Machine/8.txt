It's like a rocket to a caveman
Looking up, attacking by a spaceman
It's life, but not as we know it
We didn't make it, we didn't grow it

Don't look up it's the Wow! signal
Extraterrestrial, now people
Up in the sky
Up in the sky, coming down

Late night for Doctor Jerry Ehman
6EQ and it's bigger than it came in
It's like a rocket to a caveman
Talkin' on a cell phone, staring into space, man

Don't look up it's the Wow! signal
Hovering over the clouds, people
Up in the sky
Up in the sky, coming down

Here we go!

Satellite, Europa has Jupiter
Going round like people getting stupider
Goes through crashes and phasers
Over and over like rats in mazes

Don't look up it's the Wow! signal
Nobody knows if it's good, if it's evil
Towering over the church and the steeple
Up in the sky, up in the sky
