There was a time, I resigned
Resigned myself to a lonely climb
But thinking this was a bad sign
All aboard flight 919
Departing on time
Since you called me

And said your weak and frail heart
So many times had belonged to
Someone that wasn't strong
Yeah well, they're gone
And you belong to me
Just stay here in my arms
Longer than it seems
I travel to your door
Told me that you had a dream
And we stayed the night
And never leave

You said your weak and frail heart
So many times had belonged to
Someone that wasn't strong
Yeah well, they're gone
And you belong to me
Just stay here in my arms
Longer than it seems
I travel to your door
Told me that you had a dream
And we stayed the night

You said your weak and frail heart
So many times it belonged to
Someone that wasn't strong
Yeah, well they're gone
