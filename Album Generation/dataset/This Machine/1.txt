[Verse 1]
You come around to the autumn carnival
It's glowing like a jack-o-lantern on the hill, oh
You should be younger now than you were then
Trading silver for a thrill
You come around to the autumn carnival

There is a fog in the hall of mirrors, oh (oh)
The ghost of [?] has jumped the track, oh (oh)
Like a carousel which is turning back
Create all the things that you lack

[Chorus]
You can go there if you need
And you can surely fix you, guaranteed

[Verse 2]
Ferris wheel unshadows and shatters, whoa-oh
Across the ground into the eyes of the innocent, oh-oh
The carnie spits at the waxing moon
And all that hell that was gone too soon

[Chorus]
You can go there if you need
And it will surely fix you, guaranteed

[Verse 3]
Here comes the rain so you move inside, oh
There is no compass, there is no guide, oh
And there is no mask behind which to hide
You come around to the autumn carnival
You come around to the autumn carnival

[Chorus]
And you can take it with you if you need
Cause it will surely fix you, guaranteed

[Outro]
You come around to the autumn carnival
