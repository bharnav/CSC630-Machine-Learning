Go to sleep the play is over
Left your ticket on the seat
Be redeemed when you're dreaming
Lay your head and go to sleep

Don't you worry till tomorrow
Heaven knows you surely will
Think about it, take one more lap around it
Close the blinds and set your mind at peace

Waste some time, waste some money
Talk about your wasted years
They devastate you, complete and complicate you
Never minding your wasted tears

Don't you worry till tomorrow
Heaven knows you surely will
Think about it, take one last lap around it
Close your eyes and let your mind release...

Love and kindness, pain and sadness
All the stations in between
They will derail you, they will assail you
But rest your head, for I won't fail you

Don't you worry till tomorrow
Heaven knows you surely will
Think about it, one last short lap around it
Close your eyes and set your mind at peace
