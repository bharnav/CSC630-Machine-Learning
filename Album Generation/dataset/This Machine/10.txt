Hey, I've asked you
To help me change
Ain't it strange
How I seem to dive
What a wild changeout
And verve to slide
Oh I know this
You and I
Just let me try
All your lies
And let it slide

Hell, I want you girl
And that you go
Just for a while
Ain't it strange now
For you and I
Let's take a time
Let it go
Just let it go alight

Hell I know you
Behind your smile
Take you can
Passing through my door
The one I find
Hell watch before
Hell I know you
Hell I see
In your eyes
All the whys
And let it slide
