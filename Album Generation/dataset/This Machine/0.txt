[Verse 1]
Then you get me right down to the crawl
And then you get me right down to the crawl
One more lesson now that's all
One more lesson now that's all

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Then you get me right down to the crawl
And then you get me right down to the crawl
One more lesson down it goes
One more lesson down it goes

[Chorus]
I'm on vacation
I'm gonna change the station
I can not fake like I can not hear
Any sound so insincere
Cause the more you stay the same
The more I feel like I'll have to change
So you can watch me walk away
You can beg but I can not stay
No way
No way
No way

[Chorus]
I'm on vacation
I'm gonna change the station
I can not fake like I can not hear
Any sound so insincere
Cause the more you stay the same
The more I feel like I'll have to change
So you can watch me walk away
You can beg but I can not stay
No way
No way
No way
No way
