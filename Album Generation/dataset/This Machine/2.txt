It went by so fast
And now I wanna go back
And that's why I'm living in the past, I
I used to be cool
Used to be a fool
Too cool for rules, man
Too cool for school
I used to be pretty
Pretty like a girl
I was the prettiest little girl in the whole fucking world

So look at yourself
Enjoy your health
Let everybody else be everybody else and really enjoy yourself now

'Cause I used to be tough
I used to play rough
Before the stones to the sticks
I took my licks until I had had enough
I used to be hot
Used to be a little snot
And like it or not I got what I want
And I liked what I got

So look at yourself
Enjoy your health
Say what you mean
Be what you be
And really enjoy yourself now

I used to be shitty
When I used to be pretty
I was the prettiest little shitty in the whole New York City

So look at yourself
Enjoy your health
Say what you mean
Be what you're gonna be
And really enjoy yourself now
