[Verse 1]
I am free there's no one tells me what to be
Cause I know who I am and I am free
Now I'm free at last my darkest past is fading fast
And I can say at last that I am free

My soul is cleansed
This tortured heart
Is on the mend again
I know who I am and I am free

[Chorus]
And when all of my friends forgive me
Of the worst I've been do
They let me back in so I can begin again?

[Verse 2]
I am free I let music get inside of me
Till I know who I am and I am free
I am free there's music deep inside of me
And I can let it out and let it be

[Chorus]
And when they say payback is a bitch
It's a bitch you've got to make your peace with it
And only then can you learn to sleep with it
And when time you see you've got to think twice
Before you do or say anything

[Outro]
And now I am free
I am free
C'mon I am free
Well I am free
