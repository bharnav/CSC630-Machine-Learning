Love gets you in the gut
Takes the top off of your head
And makes you wish that you were dead

Drugs help but not enough
Take the loop off of your mind
And scoop out everything you find

(CHORUS)
Meteor Shower
Meteor Shower

I cannot make light I'm so burnt out
I know where you are
I cannot believe how much it hurts
I'm a fallen star

(VERSE 2)
Time sneaks up from behind
Puts you six feet underground
While the world keeps spinnin' round

(CHORUS)
(Break)

(CHORUS)
Love gets you in the gut
Take top off of your head
And makes you wish that you were:
