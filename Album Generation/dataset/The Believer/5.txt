Although she's none the wiser
Although we've barely met
I can recognize her
From the treatment that I get
So it's my duty to advise her
If she breaks the rules
I've said I'll quit though
I'll admit that hasn't happened yet

I believe she's lying
I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time

As sure as she is sitting here
She's sure that she's awake
And as soon as we're committing
We're admitting our mistake
So of course it's only fitting
That the course we're going to take
Is drawn and whereupon I'm slamming on the brakes

I believe she's lying
I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time
It's a given, given time

The power of suggestion
The element of chance
And the subject now in question
Is the same old song and dance

And the time that we invest in
Setting traps out in advance
So we could spend the weekend staring in a trance

I believe she's lying
I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time
It's a given, given time
It's a given, given time
It's a given, given time
