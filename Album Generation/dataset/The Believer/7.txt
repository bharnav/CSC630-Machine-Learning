[Verse:]
Well you can tell it to the radio tell it to the television
They are not listening they are only machines
I could sit around all day worrying and wishing
I was one of them so you could tell it to me

[Chorus:]
Talking to you girl is like long division yeah
I been trying to find you may I remind you I'm under oath now
I been trying to see you 'cause I can see you want the truth now
I been trying to tell you that I can tell you are
A singular girl singular girl singular girl

[Verse:]
Blame it on the moonlight blame it on plate tectonics
You thought I wasn't listening but I was
Talk about attraction talk about electronics
You are the reason you are because

[Chorus:]
Talking to you girl is like long division yeah
I been trying to find you may I remind you I'm under oath now
I been trying to see you 'cause I can see you want the truth now
I been trying to tell you that I can tell you are
A singular girl singular girl singular girl

[Chorus:]
Talking to you girl is like long division yeah
I been trying to find you may I remind you I'm under oath now
I been trying to see you 'cause I can see you want the truth now
I been trying to tell you that I can tell you are
A singular girl singular girl singular girl
A singular girl singular girl singular girl
