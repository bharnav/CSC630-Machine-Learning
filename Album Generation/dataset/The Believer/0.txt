Love in the asylum is a beautiful thing
Stars when your head hits the floor
Shock therapy loses its sting baby you want more
Sex in war-time is sweeter then peace
Yeah, it's the one sweet thing about war
One of you is worth a million of these
Baby, get out on the dance floor
Get out on the dance floor

Make up your mind, my, my valentine
You say you love me, yet you treat me unkindly
Got to make up your mind, my, my valentine
Give me a signal, baby, show me a sign

"Life During Wartime" is a beautiful song
Where does that highway lead
You'll be glad someday that you brought me along, baby
You will have a need
You will have a need

Make up your mind, my, my valentine
You say you love me, yet you treat me unkindly
Got to make up your mind, my, my valentine
Give me a signal, baby, show me a sign

Make up your mind, my, my valentine
You say you love me, yet you treat me unkindly
Got to make up your mind, my, my valentine
Give me a signal, baby, show me a sign

Operation overload, without a doubt
My, my valentine would you please step out
We got to smoke some grass
We're gonna shake our asses
Right this instant

Time passes
You got to reel against it
Time passes
You got to reel against it

Make up your mind, my, my valentine
You say you love me, yet you treat me unkindly
Got to make up your mind, my, my valentine
Give me a signal, baby, show me a sign

Give me a signal, baby show me a sign
Don't keep it secret baby, I'll show you your mine
