You were sittin' on a gold mine
Workin' in a shop
I was rollin' around in a ghost town
Waitin' on a record to drop

You say you wanna get Happy
In your own skin
Well you shook it up for awhile
And I'm beggin you to do it again

We had a long weekend and then you were gone
Wanted to be one in a million
Baby isn't that wrooooooong?

I've had it up to here with nothin!
I need everything for a change
Ain't that strange? Ain't that strange?
Ain't that Strange? Ain't that Strange?

You got a sad transmission
From deep, deep space
Tried to keep it hid, but I sensed it
And I brought you back to my place

We had love supreme as you could find
I wanted to be one in a million, baby do you mind?

I've had it up to here with nothin!
I need everything for a change
Ain't that strange? Ain't that strange?
Ain't that Strange? Ain't that Strange?

ROCK ON!! YEAH!

Hurry up and figure it out!
Cause I'm only waitin' round for you for so long
And if you want it, and you know it, that you want then you gotta:
Come on, Come On, COME ON!!! OOOW!!

(Uh)

I've had it up to here, I've had it up to here, I've had it up to here with nothin' I need everything for a chaaange!!
Ain't' that strange? Ain't that strange?
Ain't that Strange? Ain't that Strange?

ALRIGHT!!
