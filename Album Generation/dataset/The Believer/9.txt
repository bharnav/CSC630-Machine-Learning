(Verse:)
You had every psychological reason for what went down
You drove your car off the end of a bridge
You told your mom you were comfortably numb
You left everybody over here hanging by a thread downtown
You know I'm getting on a plane tonight
I'm gonna find you and bring you home

(Chorus:)
I was just down I was not over you
I am accountable I can't be held
It's just like you said it's all
Just like you said all wrong
I was in love with you but you were delicate

(Verse:)
You had every emotional reason for what went down
You found a broken glass hotel
You told your mom you were going to war

(Chorus:)
I was just down I was not over you
I am accountable I can't be held
It's just like you said it's all
Just like you said all wrong
I was in love with you but you were delicate

(Verse:)
You know they are not getting any younger in the old hometown
You left a message on my machine
You're not dying anymore

(Chorus:)
I was just down I was not over you
I am accountable I can't be held
It's just like you said it's all
Just like you said all wrong
I was in love with you but you were delicate
I was in love with you but you were delicate
I am in love with you but you are delicate

(Outro:)
If you are my friend then why are you over there
I am accountable I can't be held
