This is a girl
On a different planet
In a constellation faraway
We are in love
And you can't deny

I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la
I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la

Livin alone
Livin all alone in a black hole I call Hollywood
Looking for love, that I could not find
I had a dream
That she would orbit around me
Her heavenly body hovering
We were in love
And I closed my eyes
Now

I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la
I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la

I was underground
I found a whole new world to put my troubles in
You lived miles above the earth
Until you came down to bring me home again

Now I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la
I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la

We will be wed
And we will procreate
And we will examine life on another plane
And we are in love, with the big blue sky

I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la
I'm with her
Sha-la-la-la
[Repeat]
