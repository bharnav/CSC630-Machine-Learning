She woke from a dream
Her head was on fire
Why was he so nervous?
He took her to the park
She crossed her arms
And lowered her eye lids

Someday somebody's gonna ask you
A question that you should say yes to
Once in your life
Maybe tonight
I've got a question for you

She'd had no idea
Started to cry
She said in a good way
He took her by the hand
Walked her back home
They took the long way

Someday somebody's gonna ask you
A question that you should say yes to
Once in your life
Baby, tonight
I've got a question for you
