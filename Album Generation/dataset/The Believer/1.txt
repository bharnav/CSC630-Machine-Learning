Help me Suzanne
I got to figure it out
Why the whites of my eyes are red
What I wouldn't give
For a bed or a fire or a phone
Who could I call?
Or what would I say?
I've been working all week for you
Where would I go to
Even if I could go home?

I've been living on the memory of a dream I once I had
You gave me the reason
For feeling like I do
You gave me the reason
I'd like to thank you

Help me Suzanne I've got to set my sights on the bright sunshiny day
Cause my whole world's gone grey and its going wrong
You got a big heart beat and a body in work you could do me a world of good
Yeah you could and you did and I am begging you to keep on

I've been living on the memory of a dream I once I had
You gave me the reason
For feeling like I do
You gave me the reason
I'd like to thank you
I had lost my way
Like I always do
You gave me the reason
I'd like to thank you
Oh

And I'm living on the memory of a dream I once had
You gave me the reason
For feeling like I do
You gave me the reason
I'd like to thank you
I had lost my head
I had come unglued
You gave me the reason
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you
I'd like to thank you
