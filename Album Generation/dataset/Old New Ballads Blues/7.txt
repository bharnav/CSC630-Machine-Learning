If you could see inside my heart
You'd see a loneliness right from the start
Feels like laughing love has passed me by
These days I need no reason to cry

If you could feel the way I feel
You'd know that every word I say is real
Seems like laughing love can pass you by
These days I need no reason to cry

I always knew I would have to let you go
The years go by and the only thing I know
Is that I love you still

If I could see your face today
Then all the emptiness'd be far away
All the loneliness would pass me by
Then I would have no reason to cry
