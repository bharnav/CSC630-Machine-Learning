Look around, you play the field
Do you know the difference from what's real?
You keep on runnin', fast as you can
All you're gonna get's another man

Because ain't nobody gonna love you like the way I do
Ain't nobody gonna love you all the whole night through

You keep on tryin', do what you can
Try to find yourself another man
Some other time, another place
Thought you'd know I just can't be replaced

Because ain't nobody gonna love you like the way I do
Ain't nobody gonna love you all the whole night through

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the way I do
Ain't nobody gonna love you all the whole night through

Person to person, woman to man
Please can you tell me so I'll understand?

Look around, play the field
Do you know the difference from what's real?
Keep on runnin', fast as you can
Try to find yourself another man

But ain't nobody gonna love you like the way I do
Ain't nobody gonna love you all the whole night through

Listen, I said
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
