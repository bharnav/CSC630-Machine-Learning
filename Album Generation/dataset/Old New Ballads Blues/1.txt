Now, time has passed and much has gone
But this love in my heart has lingered on
When I get worried
I sneak away and cry

You know my love
You know my love
You know my love has never died

You've gone and tried so many things
To pacify your mind
You'll even get merry
Tryin' to have a good time
But all you do, you will never rest
You're gonna fill your life full of emptiness

And when you're down and out
You'll need a home
You're gonna need a friend
And find that he's gone
'Cause when I get worried
I sneak away and cry

You know my love
You know my love
You know my love has never died
