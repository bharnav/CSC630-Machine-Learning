When you're down and out
And you feel real hurt
Come on over to the place where I work
Loneliness I try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

Don't be afraid, come on in
You might run across
Some of your old friends
Loneliness I try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

I ain't no big name
And I ain't no big star
But I'll play the blues for you on my guitar
Loneliness I try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

Yes, I will
Excuse me
