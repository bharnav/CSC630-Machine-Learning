2,3

Outside the sun is shining
It's feeling like the month of May
But inside my heart is pining
And I think it's gonna rain today

Everybody I see is smiling
As they watch the children play
But for me no reconciling
And I think it's gonna rain today

All the clouds have gone
Everybody sees the sun
But for me no going back
The clouds are here to stay

Outside the sun is shining
But ever since she went away
Inside my heart keeps pining
And I think it's gonna rain today
Yes, I think it's gonna rain today
