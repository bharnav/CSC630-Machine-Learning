[Intro: Morse Code]

[Verse 1]
We're more than carbon and chemicals!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
Free will is ours and we can't let go!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
We can't allow this, the quiet cull!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
So we sing out this, our canticle!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!

[Chorus]
We all were lost now we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are all named and we are all known
We know that we'll never walk alone

[Verse 2]
We're more than static and dial tone
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
We're emblematic of the unknown
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
Raise up the banner, bend back your bows
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
Remove the cancer, take back your souls!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!

[Chorus]
We are lost and we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are all named and we are known
We know that we'll never walk alone

[Bridge]
Though all the world may hate us, we are named
Though shadow overtake us, we are known
We're more than carbon and chemicals
Free will is ours and we can't let go
(We are the image of the invisible)

We're more than carbon and chemicals!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
Free will is ours and we can't let go!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
We can't allow this, the quiet cull!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!
So we sing out this, our canticle!
WE ARE THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE!

[Chorus]
We all were lost now we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are all named and we are known
We know that we'll never walk alone

We all were lost now we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are all named and we are known
We know that we'll never walk alone

Raise up the banner, bend back your bow
Remove the cancer, take back your soul!
