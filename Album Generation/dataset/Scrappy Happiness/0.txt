So much sadness on this earth
We get weary, we get hurt
What we need is not for sale
So set your heart down on the rail
Leaving’s just another way
To say the things we never say
Walking in the autumn leaves
Let’s get lost in record sleeves
Sun goes down upon the bay
Looking for somewhere to play
I came here to bring the noise
To the island girls and the harbour boys
Racing to the finish line
We’ve been running, we’ve been flying
Faster as the years go by
Clouds are scrolling cross our sky
If we get held by higher powers
It’s only in the final hours
After that we’ll get some rest
Until then let’s make a mess
Sun goes down upon the bay
Looking for somewhere to play
I came here to bring the noise
To the island girls and the harbour boys
Soaking in a summer night
Let me rage against the dying light
Before the by and by
I stand beneath a devastating sky above me
High above, I’ll lose myself in everything I love
Until the night is through
My friends, I sing it now for you
Sun goes down upon the bay
Looking for somewhere to play
I came here to bring the noise
To the island girls and the harbour boys?
