Side of the road, in the ditch, you rust
A mouthful of mud from a fistful of dust
A heart full of hurt from a head full of wine
I’ll call you back some other time

No way I’m picking up my phone
I’m tired of talking, leave me alone
I can’t run and I can’t write
And I can’t make it home tonight

Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’
Gathering no moss
I don’t know where I’m goin’
But I know what I’ve lost

Talk is cheap but music’s cheaper
Deep in debt and getting deeper
The price is steep and getting steeper
I’m yours to keep, won’t you keep me?
I’m a keeper

Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’
Gathering no moss
I don’t know where I’m goin’
But I know what it cost

Pretty people posing questions
(I don’t wanna answer you)
Where’d you go? D’you learn your lesson?
(I put on my dancing shoes)
Who’d you meet and what’d you buy?
(Couple strangers, pair of jeans)
Just leave ‘em hanging high and dry
Bye Bye

Rollin’, rollin’ rollin’
With my imaginary friends
Imagining I know’ em
Then it’s time to roll again

Why so blue, tired and true?
(Just like that Irma Thomas song)
I’m tired of myself, not tired of you
(You’ve been gone “Two Winters Long”)
They say that good things come to those you roll
(Back to the place where you belong)
Back to someone beautiful

Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’
It’s time to get me gone
The yellow lines are glowing
Oh, highway roll me home
(Blacktop highway)
Highway roll me home
