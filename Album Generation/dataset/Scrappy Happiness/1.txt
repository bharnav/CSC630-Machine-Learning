Let's make a racket for the old and young
For the desperate souls and the lucky ones
If we get lonely, if we get lost
Let's rattle on 'til the wheels come off

Stumbling, fumbling, singing our songs
Get 'em up as we're goin' along
Passing the guitar, passing the wine
Travelling time

We gotta choose a weapon for the town we take
Singing “Celebrated Summer” for the Quarry Lake
Magic's only magic 'til you know the tricks
Yeah, but if this ain't real I don't know what is

Shaking it, faking, never learning my line
Get 'em up for the nickels and dimes
Passing the guitar, passing the wine

The skies will turn from pink to blue
The years will turn to sand
The needle's drop on Hüsker Dü
They were my favourite band
I'm travelling through space and time
To keep my love alive
It's 1995

I am yours and you are mine, mine, mine

Every young band wants to build The Wall
But a real rock record's like a wrecking ball
If anybody asks me why I came back here
I'll say I'm picking up the pieces of a broken year

Wondering, wandering, training my thoughts
Following, connecting the dots
Passing the guitar, passing the wine... lots

The skies will turn from pink to blue
The years will turn to sand
The needle's drop on Hüsker Dü
They were my favourite band
I'm travelling through space and time
To keep my love alive
It's 1995

I am yours and you are mine, mine, mine
You're mine, mine, mine
You're mine, mine, mine
You're mine, mine, mine
You're mine, mine, mine
