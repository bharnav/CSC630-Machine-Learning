Mama, where you going?
I’ve been clicking and clacking my heels
I’ve been reeling, I’ve been rolling
I’ve been spinning un-spinnable wheels
Lately I’ve been wondering
How’d we get so far apart?
I’ve been lightening, you’ve been thundering
Thirty seconds after I start
I’ve been looking for pies in the skies
I’ve been staring at the sun without blinking my eyes
I’ve been feeling the temperature rise
I’ve been thinking oh my, oh my, oh my
Is the right time only the nighttime?
Is my way only the highway?
Is this slow dance my one and only chance
To find me a little bit of romance?
Mama, where you at now?
I’ve been rocking and racking my brain
I’ve been trying, so desperately trying
To stop an unstoppable train
Mama, what you smoking?
Who put this spell on you?
I was chewing but now I’m choking
Whatcha doing while I’m turning blue?
Are you looking for stars in the day?
Are you staring at the sun as it’s sinking away?
Are you casting a lasting goodbye?
Are you thinking oh my oh my?
Is the right time only the nighttime?
Is my way only the highway?
Is this slow dance my one and only chance
To find me a little bit of romance?
Is this passion merely a fashion?
Are their really any questions left worth asking?
Is this slow dance my one and only chance
To find me a little bit of romance?
