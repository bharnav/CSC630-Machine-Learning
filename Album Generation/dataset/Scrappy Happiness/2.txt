Doctor, what happened?
I was the man of the hour
'Til she came along and something went sour
She took me high as the mountains
Left me blue as the sea
'Til she made a wreck outta me

Doctor, you told me 'bout love at first sight
But you never told me I did not see right
Your explanations mean nothin' to me
There's only one diagnosis with which I agree
She took me high as the mountains
Left me blue as the sea
'Til she made a wreck outta me

Doctor, don't worry, ignore my depression
I am alone but within her possession
She's taken my heart and left the incision
Though I'll never heal I admire that kind of precision
She took me high as the mountains
Left me blue as the sea
'Til she made a wreck outta me
