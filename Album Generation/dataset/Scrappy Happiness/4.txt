Send a postcard back from heaven
If the inspiration hits you
Let your love be a lethal weapon
A heart like a handgun standard issue
Sing a song about Pretty Polly
Tell me another bedtime story
Take me somewhere else when I close my eyes
Make it easy for me
Disappear in the wild wood forest
Take me with you if you are able
Falling down from a graceful place
Stacking the wood from a Norway maple
Sing a song for a hundred years
Paint a picture of a thousand tears
Take me somewhere else when I close my eyes
Make it easy for me
