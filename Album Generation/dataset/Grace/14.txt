Perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama , you been on my mind

I mean no trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset
I am not pleading or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet
Mama, you been on my mind

Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow
I don't even mind who you be waking with tomorrow
But mama, you've been on my mind

I am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don't know
Mama, you been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
