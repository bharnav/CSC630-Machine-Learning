Take the blood out of an alligator
Take the left eye out of a fish
Take the skin off of a frog
And put 'em all in a dish, huha

Throw some salt over your shoulder
And count from one to nine
Like a scary can freezer
And you got alligator wine

Alligator wine
Your porcupine
It's gonna make you mine, huha

It'll make your baby bald
It make your toes freeze
It'll make you stare out your eye balls
It'll make you cough and sneeze, haa choo

You'd be wanting for air
But I give you my portion 9
When you drink it, alligator wine, huh

Alligator wine
Your porcupine
Gonna make you mine, huh

Alligator wine, your porcupine
It's gonna make you mine
It's gonna make you mine
Huh, look out, who's that? Huh
