We just kissed and that's about it
I fell asleep, she had to do without it
That's the way it sometimes goes
Under the covers but in yesterday's clothes

Whilst you were asleep
Me, pins and needles
You were asleep
Me, other people

Rubbing ourselves together
We were bound to lose that feeling
Rubbing ourselves together
Staring at the ceiling

I wonder if she suspects
Who sent me that last text
Or that I'm speaking loudly
Waiting for my phone to stop vibrating

Whilst you were asleep
Me, pins and needles
I was asleep
With other people

Rubbing ourselves together
We were bound to lose our feeling
I still can't believe how fast our hearts were beating

Rubbing ourselves together
We were bound to lose our feeling
I still can't believe how fast our hearts were beating

Here's the truth
We just kissed and that's about it
I fell asleep, she had to do without it
That's the way it sometimes goes
Under the covers but in yesterday's clothes
It was sleep that stopped me cheating, not the way you got my heart beating

Rubbing ourselves together
We were bound to lose our feeling
I still can't believe how fast my heart were beating

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

I've lost that loving feeling
We've lost that loving feeling
Gone
