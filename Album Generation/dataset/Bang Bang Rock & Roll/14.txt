Sitting in my bedroom
With my keyboard guitar
Writing pretty songs about renaming the stars
I don't like to stay in
I'm easily bored
I go and tell the newborns in the maternity ward:

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
(Go home and tell your parents)
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
I hope

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
(Right now we're tired and we're emotional, but it's gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
I promise
