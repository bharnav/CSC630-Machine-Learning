It's the twelfth of July
And for seven days
I'm not going anywhere

I told you that I was ....
I gave you content time

And I don't have any back-up
And I have to ... right here
I'm gonna disorientate and I'm gonna fight

I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
Everybody's pushing, everybody come on
...
This is all when I saw all my senses

Procrastination, is easily done in here

Well this room is rusted
Surprised as you fail
And there's no discussing here
Amongst the ....

Oh, and there's no discount in here either
And I've really really really really been looking
And I've been fighting, been fighting and I'm ready to go

I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
Everyone is pushing, everybody come on
...
This is all when I saw all my senses

Everyone is pushing out the way, come on
Everyone is pushing out the way, come on
Everyone is pushing out the way, come on
Everyone
Everyone
Everyone

I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
(I was busy thinking, forgot who I was)
I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
(I was busy thinking, forgot who I was)
I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
(I was busy thinking, forgot who I was)
I was busy thinking, forgot who I was
