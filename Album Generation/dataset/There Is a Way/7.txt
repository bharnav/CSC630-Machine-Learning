So the sun blinds me with snow
And I step on the death-trap ice
Navigate the crossroads
Try not to die

And a source said
I'm happy but be careful
And a source said
You never let go
And a source said
Who cares just run it

Suits and boots snap up
Pull my trusted seed
I just made it up
These fools will eat it up

Wifi hungry man
I found the tunnel
It's cold in the shade

Papers rolls in folds
Black ink
To drink
To think
Extra boys calling
Roll roll roll it up

And a source said
I'm happy but be careful
And a source said
You never let go
And a source said
Who cares just run it

A spider's corpse
Is carried away by ants
Like voluntary coroners

Wifi hungry man
I found the tunnel
It's cold in the shade

This source is a liar
But it's all I've got
And I'll listen if it's bona-fide
Apostrophe turns to a tornado
Sends me running
Running straight to you
