All of this work is making me hungry
I thirst for a sit down, sit down and a think
When I'm not popped, like I need a drink
Well pass me a glass honey, sneak a few words with a clink

I get bored so I go outside
For beer, for a beer
Experience gets us what we need
Like fear, stays as clear
I sing all about how I think
And feel, and I feel
And how does that make you think
And feel, and I feel

Hey, something's calling
And I know I know, I know I've got to go
So here take my drink, and pour it down the sink
I've got nothing to lose
I need a rain check on this booze

I get bored so I go outside
For beer, for a beer
Experience gets us what we need
Like fear, stays as clear
I sing all about how I think
And feel, and I feel
And how does that make you think
And feel, and I feel
