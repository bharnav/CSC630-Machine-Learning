Not for the first time
Blood on the gym floor
Arcs like a rainbow round
Not so appalling
To wring my own neck
Names on the gauze; absent

Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory
Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory

Wisdom
Is clumsy
Enlightened
By stereo evangelists listen
To decode
So badly
The meanings in allegory
Take what seems to get you down
And follow misinterpretations

Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory
Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory

Gracious
But casual
Hang on
To every word transmitted from playlists
And albums
Just knowing
The fawning is just secondary
Left inhibitions at the door
Regrets are met with open arms

Play along
'Cause I know the chords
Play along
Muscle memory

You'd like me better if I liked you less

Clumsy
And awkward
In public
You spill around in stationary motion
Seasick
From speaking
The morals of your influence
Limbs cast fondly to the sea
Remember who you used to be?

Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory
Play along
'Cause I know the chords, muscle memory
