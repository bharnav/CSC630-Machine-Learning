We share a bed
Like .... swimmers in the night
We go to sleep
......
..........
........
.....
......
Somebody wasn't the last
..... wasn't the first
...... stuck to my chest
.....
I'm knocking at the front door
I'm looking under the bed
(But I'm at the front door Calum)
I'm looking everywhere
Somebody wasn't the last
..... wasn't the first
...... stuck to my chest
.....
Temperature rises
Temperature rises
Up and down ....
Up and down ....
Somebody wasn't the last
..... wasn't the first
...... stuck to my chest
.....
Somebody wasn't the last
..... wasn't the first
...... stuck to my chest
