Time capsule
Time capsule
Time capsule that we share
(From another life) Time capsule
Time capsule
Time capsule that we share
From another life

Why won't you hear these words
Why won't you hear these words
Taken from the diary
From another time

When I found this book it was half eaten by
[?] photographs and his excuses for being mean

So it started right from
Page one to god right
My back words and
Photographs and trying to be better

Sauchiehall runs like an artery
Through the place you were born
So I put on my high voice
Like a fist
Sauchiehall runs like an artery
Through the place you were born
So I put on my big voice
Like a shirt, time capsule
Time capsule
Time capsule
Time capsule
