Without ........... (And .... of caffeine)
I object the nights out (Submit it to me)
And I'm not feeling the disco (....)
So conscience pulls in (The downward spiral)
Next the bar is full (With few ambitions)
It beats me downtown (The words will run out)
Sucked out by shots (Of impatience)
T cells fade (...)
Stiff plastic juice feeds
My limbs juices
And you can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
You can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
T cells fade
Glee cells trade
Cables are clogged up, and over running
Liquids don't flow like, they used to run and
Muscle and fluid, send me a freeze of
And follow me under
(The downward spiral)
Into the darkness, I'm most uncertain
...... in winter, inhale the ...
Swallow his ..., ..... knuckles
There's no denying, the closet is the only way
Stiff plastic juice feeds
My limbs juices
And you can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
You can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
(...)
Stiff plastic juice feeds
My limbs juices
And you can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
You can't send the way
A new baby's meant to play
T cells fade
Glee cells trade
