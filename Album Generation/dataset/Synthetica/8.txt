[Verse 1]
Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

[Verse 2]
Nothing I've ever done right
Happened on the safe side
It's the other way
I'm missing everyone I know now

[Chorus]
It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
I was afraid to tell you that

[Verse 3]
Back to that
Photograph
Can you clone me?
I look like everyone you know now

[Chorus]
It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermath

[Verse 4]
Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

[Chorus]
It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermath
