[Verse 1]
All night, like a child
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up
All night, like a fool
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up with you

[Chorus]
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)

[Verse 2]
What can I say?
I stay up to prove
I can keep up
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up with you

[Chorus]
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)

(All night, all night)

[Verse 3]
What can I say?
I stay up to prove
I can keep up with you

[Chorus]
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)
