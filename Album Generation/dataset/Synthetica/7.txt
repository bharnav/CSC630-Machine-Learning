[Verse 1]
Some of us are wild ones
Ever under wanted, I believe
Lining up in the background
Waiting for the crowd shot to be seen
In the shadow of the big screen
Everybody begs to be redeemed

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got

[Verse 2]
We were never meant to
Crawl in for the bait
We never will
I can think for myself
I've got something no pill could ever kill

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got
So hard, hard to resist synthetica
No drug is stronger than me
Synthetica

[Bridge]
We're all the time confined to fit the mold
But I won't ever let them make a loser of my soul

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
