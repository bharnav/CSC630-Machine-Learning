[Verse 1: Emily]
I've been sleepwalking through the railway station
Wake me up when they call my destination
Where I've been, I was bound to leave behind
All device and all disease was mine
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

[Chorus]
[Emily]
I never wanted to go home
[Lou]
The wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
There was nothing there for me
[Lou]
The wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
In a high rise on my own
[Lou]
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
[Emily]
Looking out at a mirror balcony
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
[Lou]
Wanderlust

[Verse 2: Emily]
I'm rolling in for a seven day weekend
Living up again to my old reputation
Can you cover me?
'Cause I got no armor
Keep on moving down the line, keep on going further
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

[Chorus]
[Emily]
I never wanted to go home
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
There was nothing there for me
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
In a high rise on my own
[Lou]
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
[Emily]
Looking out at a mirror balcony
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry, carry, carry us on
[Emily]
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to hide
[Lou]
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
[Emily]
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to be
[Lou]
Oh, wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
Walk fifty city blocks down but they always find us
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
[Lou]
Wanderlust will carry us on
[Emily]
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
