[Verse 1]
Hangman, we played
Rubber soul with a razor blade
Behind the church, hiding place
It was a long joke 'til the punch line came
Can you read my mind?
Read my mind
Follow along to the end of the song

[Verse 2]
Hangman, we played
Double dutch with a hand grenade
Behind the church, hiding place
Apathetic to the Devil's face
Wear the sheriff's badge, put your toys away
They let us go saying, "Let us pray!"

[Hook]
Youth without youth
Youth without youth

[Verse 3]
Hangman, we played
Hide and seek on the fire escape
Through the smoke, we saw the flame
It was a long wait 'til the firetruck came
On the count of three, jump with me
On the count of three
One... two...
One... two... three... Go!

[Hook]
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Go, go, go, go!

Go!
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Go, go, go, go!

[Verse 4]
Hangman, we played
Blind man's bluff with the 9th brigade
Throw the brick through the windowpane
Double dutch 'til they stop the game
'Til the cops show up
Handcuff stunned
They let us go but we lost one!

[Verse 5]
Hangman, we played
Blind man's bluff 'til they stopped the game
Youth without youth
Born without time
Youth without youth
Can you read my mind?

[Hook]
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
My, my, my, my!

My, my, my, my!
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
My, my, my, my!
