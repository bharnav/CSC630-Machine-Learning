The time is right to make a change
To realize it ain't the same
The time is right to make a change
To realize today's the day

In my life I search for truth
What am I supposed to do?

Where am I going to?
Where am I going to?
I tried to leave it
Tried to believe it
Where am I?

This is only a test

The time is right to cross the line
To purify deep inside
The time is right to leave a stain
To make a mark, today's the day

In my life I search for clues
What am I supposed to do?

Why can't you understand?
Times are changing, rearranging
Why can't you understand?
My head is shaking, rearranging

The time is right to make a change
And realize it ain't the same
