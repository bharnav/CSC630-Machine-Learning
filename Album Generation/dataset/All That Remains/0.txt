See the broken man torn and twisted in grief
Screaming to the sky in pain and disbelief
How could it be that any man could allow this
Living in the filth of faded innocence

Through it all the hearts of men grow colder
Numb to the world as the cowards get bolder
Yesterday's success succeeds in tainting the mindset
Still we wonder where the good old days went

And I am nameless
There's no mistaking where the future lies
And I am faceless
In the bed you've made sleeps the failure in you tonight

Take a look around at the hell you've created
Self respect and dignity just memories faded
Each day a little closer to the fate you have made
Life wasted on myself and the stench of my decay

Refuse to accept the role that you would have me play
The call of its master I won't live to betray
Outstretching of your hand you are a man undone
No shame, no pride, no faith, your soul's a setting sun
