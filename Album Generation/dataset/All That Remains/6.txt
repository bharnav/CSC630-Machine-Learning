A silent prayer whispered in the darkness
Without witness words descend and die
I can't understand a world so cold and heartless
And still I'm driven to live this lie

Frozen voice singing winter's song
I live through life at the will of the wind
All the while I wonder where right went wrong
Crying out for the end to begin

Set adrift on a sea uncharted
Under a sky with no stars to guide me
A drowning soul is sinking and departed
While the waves of doubt break forever inside me

I'm holding on to what I once believed
Conviction that builds with time
I breathe life into my heart deceived
Now the truth is of my design

When your truth turns to lie
And the pain makes you cry
And the fountains of faith run dry
Take a look at yourself
And what you've sacrificed

When your truth turns to lie
And the pain makes you cry
And the fountains of faith run dry

When your dream starts to die
And the fire inside
Starts to dim the more you fight
Take a look at yourself
And what you've sacrificed
