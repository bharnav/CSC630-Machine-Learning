Everywhere I look I see disease
Seems like the world was taken from me
Time seems to be tick tick ticking away
Forgive me for all, all the things I say

Will you leave me there
The way I am
Interpretations of the day
The way I am
Deliverered from the gray

Something makes me want to believe
Nothing in life was given to me
Cannot ever stick to this game
Everyday, everything the same

Time has a way and now I see
What happened to all, all of my dreams
Now and then I feel incomplete
But I won't live my life in defeat
