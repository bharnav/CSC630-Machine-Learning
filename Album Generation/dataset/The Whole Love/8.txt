[Verse 1]
How can you tell
You're under a spell
You're compromised
You're miles away
Slow

How can you know
When you're aiming low
There's nothing in your heart
Don't feel it in your soul
No standing O O O

[Verse 2]
Maybe you've noticed I'm ashamed
Of anything that I've done
Maybe you've noticed that I'm not the same
As almost anyone

Why can't you see
You look funny to me
You trip and fall
I catch it all

[Verse 3]
How can you know
When you're aiming low
You're curling up
You're crawling now
No standing O O O

Maybe you're saying no this time
Dance right around my bones
It's okay. I'll be fine
I won't follow you home

[Verse 4]
Instead I turn my mood on a dime
I'm finally off my back
I come from a long, long line
I mope and I cry and attack

How can you tell
You're under my spell
Compromised
Miles away
No standing O O O

[Verse 5]
Maybe you've noticed I'm not afraid
Of everything that I've done
Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same
As almost anyone

Instead turn my mood on a dime
I'm finally off of my back
I come from a long, long line
I mope and I cry and attack

[Outro]
How can you tell[X2]
