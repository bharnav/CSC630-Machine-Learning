[Verse 1]
Was I wrong? Off all night long?
So high, as the stinking sun
I came alive, then I felt, Oh Uh Oh

Some guys have everything I know
It’s alright
I've done a lot of crawling around outside
(and I heard) It’s alright

[Verse 2]
Your sno-cone, and it’s piss and blood
It’s in the cards (oh, oh) 'Get Well Soon - EVERYBODY!'
Do all lies have a taste?
Let it go, I don’t know oh[?]
A cow’s neck, bad shave, in the low blow slo-mo

[Chorus 1]
It’s alright
You won’t set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
OH

[Verse 3]
You come on, sentimental
If the solar car’s coming, I’m home
The Magna Carta’s on a Slim Jim blood, Brutha!
The sunk soul with the coal clean toe, is the mutha!

Yea. That’s right
When you gonna find out
I’m all inside
You still might

[Chorus 2]
It’s all right
It’s all right

[Chorus 1]
It’s alright
You won’t set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
OH

[Chorus 2]
It’s all right
It’s all right
