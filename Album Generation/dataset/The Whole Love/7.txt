[Verse 1]
Capitol city, skyline photo
Skyscrapers shine, the sun's so
Low in the sky
Secretaries at the hot dog vendors
Cabs honk at the bicycle messengers
Rolling by
I can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here, better yet I wish I was there with you

[Hook]
You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

[Verse 2]
Capitol towers radiate a steam vent
Scream along with the clarinets and
Arguments echo down the hall

I can't sleep, I can't wake up
Shaking up, maybe we should break up
I wish you were here, better yet
I wish I was there with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Capitol city, skyline photo
Picture postcards, sad and lonesome, low in the sky
I can't smile when my heart's still broken
Far away, in love and unspoken
I wish you were here
Or I was there with you
