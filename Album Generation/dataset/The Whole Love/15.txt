[Verse 1]
I was always right
About the morning
Okay, I'm an old shoe

Danced above the blaze
Never stopped crawling
Over the black dunes

[Chorus]
And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now, too?

[Verse 2]
I'm always one
Without a warning
Old days re-appear

Lift away, past the gate
Desert keeps forming
Underneath The black moon

[Chorus]
