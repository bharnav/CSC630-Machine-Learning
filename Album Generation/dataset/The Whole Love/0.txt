[Verse 1]
No, I froze
I can't be so far away from my wasteland
I'll never know when I might ambulance
Or hoist the horns with my own hands
Almost
Almost

[Verse 2]
I heard a faint ol' true love
But I had other ways to hurt myself
Like calling I could open up my heart and fall in
And I blame it all on dust, art of almost
Almost
Almost
Almost

[Verse 3]
I hold it up, shake the grail
Dissipate across the waves, tomorrow
I have all the love I could ever ache
And I leave almost with you, art of almost
Almost
Almost
