[Verse 1]
I will throw myself underneath the wheels of any train of thought
Running off the rails I'll sail you through the rogue waves of your brain

If I could bring a light to shine upon the dark and disobeying
Night so young but I still say we're too old for cliches

[Hook]
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we could share if you were so inclined
I would love to be the one to open up your mind

[Verse 2]
I could base my whole existence upon the cherry-strands of your gold hair
I would ask, almost insist upon treating you kind and fair

[Hook]
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we could have if our hearts would be entwined
If you would let me be the one to open up your mind

[Verse 3]
I would still be myself beneath the banks all broken beside the stream
Ready to return your thoughts unlearned so it goes, so it seems

[Hook]
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we could share if you weren't so defined
I would love to be the one to open up your mind

[Outro]
If you would let me be the one to open up your mind
