[Verse 1]
Solar rising red lung
Glisten under the sun
I wonder when it'll part
From the snow

The melody's a mistake
Embrace at the wake
How long does it take
For us to know?

[Bridge]
One whiff that's been blown
There's something unknown
Buried under the mound
Of snow

[Hook 1]
Found a fix for the fits
Come listen to this
As intimate as a kiss
Over a phone

[Hook 2]
And it goes

[Hook 1]
Found a fix for the fits
Come listen to this
It's buried under the hiss
And it glows

[Verse 2]
Like a powerful smile
Car radio dial
As intimate as a kiss
Over a phone

[Hook 2]
