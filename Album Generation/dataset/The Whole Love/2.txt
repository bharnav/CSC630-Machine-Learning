[Verse 1]
I loathe the sun
Sometimes I don't
Know how to love
Anything myself
It's hard
To become
Hold on to it all
But kill my memories
With a cheap
Disease

[Verse 2]
To the sails
Fail
To the bird
And the whale
Remove my misery
It's all or nothing
I see
I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
Goodbye

[Verse 3]
I loathe
The sun
Someday I know
I'll learn
How to love
Anymore is enough
I don't want to lose this fight
I don't want end this fight
Goodbye
