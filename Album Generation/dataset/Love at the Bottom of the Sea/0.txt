[Verse 1: Shirley Simms]
I think I know what you would like us to do
When we have children let's have seventy-two
Until then we must be resigned to our fate

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, but God wants us to wait

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true I should have told you before
And not have waited 'til we're nude on the floor
Though it would be the perfect end to our date

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, but God wants us to wait

[Verse 3]
Now you might like to kiss the dew on my hem
But one male and female created He them
Our Lord intended us forever to mate

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, but God wants us to wait

[Verse 4]
Despite my beauty and the scent of jasmine
Could you be happy in the knowledge of sin?
Although it may not be a crime in our state

[Chorus 1]
I love you, baby, but God wants us to wait
How much more wonderful to anticipate
I love you, baby, but God wants us to wait
