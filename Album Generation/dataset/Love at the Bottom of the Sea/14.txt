[Verse 1: Stephin Merritt]
You want to light your flame in her hibachi
Well brother I can tell you in advance
That all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance

[Verse 2]
Go there and wear your hair like Liberace
Go wear some freakish fragrance fresh from France
Friend all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance

[Verse 3]
So go ahead and hire Saatchi & Saatchi
To advertise the sausage in your pants
But all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance
