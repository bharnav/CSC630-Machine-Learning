[Verse 1: Shirley Simms]
You better think of something quick before I don't love you no more
Quick, before I walk out that door
Quick, before it all ends in jeers
What a waste of all those beers

[Verse 2]
You better think of something quick because my suitcase is packed
Quick, because I'm through being attacked
Are you really prepared to lose
All this just to air your views?

[Bridge]
We're on the brink of something

[Verse 3]
Get me a drink of something quick between your outrageous remarks
Like the mating calls of sarcastic sharks
Quick, before you can't take that back
Just before it all goes black

[Verse 4]
You better think of something quick before the midnight bell chimes
You're living in dangerous times
Torture me for your amusement
About who will pay the rent

[Outro]
Who will pay the rent (x5)
