[Verse 1: Stephin Merritt]
You sigh that I should try your love
I'll never be alone
That you are true, you coo, my dove
But I don't like your tone

[Verse 2]
You were, you murmur, further just a child
But now you're grown
You hiss that this is bliss, God blessed
But I don't like your tone

[Bridge]
What's with all this purring?
Are you a cat?
Why are we whispering?
Love's not like that

[Verse 3]
When near I hear how clear you make
Your so called feelings known
It's queer, my dear, I fear heartbreak
But I don't like your tone
