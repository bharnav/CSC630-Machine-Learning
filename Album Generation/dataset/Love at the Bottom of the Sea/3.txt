[Chorus: Stephin Merritt]
Hey little cutie
I was born for love
Can't count the chains I have worn for love
Killed three men and one unicorn for love
But I won't mind if you just take me home

[Chorus 1]
Hey little darling
I was made for love
Got down on my knees and I prayed for love
Crawled from Tamworth to Adelaide for love
But I won't mind if you just take me home

[Verse]
I know you've been lonely and misunderstood
But I'm yours for the asking
For now or for good
If you want me to leave you just give a shove
But you won't
Because I was born love

[Chorus]
Hey little cutie
I was born for love
Can't count the chains I have worn for love
Killed three men and one unicorn for love
But I won't mind if you just take me home
