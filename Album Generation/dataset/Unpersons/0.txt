[Verse]
Four hundred leagues
Down deep below
This horror breeds
Movin' slow
Six secrets safe
Skulk near my fate
Yeah, right

[Chorus]
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo

[Verse]
Cool apathy
For monstrosity
Will keep me whole
A muscle
The water's depths
Can't kill me yet
Yeah, right

[Chorus]
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo

[Verse]
Trapped safe and sound
It looks around
Till it goes free
You needn't fear
Say you trust me?
My back has wings?
Yeah, right

[Verse]
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo
Whoo-whoo

[Bridge]
Ahh
Ahh
Ahh

[Chorus]
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
Whoo-whoo
Shah!
