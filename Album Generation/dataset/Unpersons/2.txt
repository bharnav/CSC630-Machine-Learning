[Verse]
Place your trust in us
We're so scrupulous
That knife looks dangerous

What's all this fuss?
Don't worry it's only us
So supercilious

[Chorus]
Lights
Lights
Lights

[Verse]
Ack, it was only just
Smoke, it's so cancerous
Try it, it's delicious

Woman in suit, so business
Try it on, oh gorgeous
The mirror is lookin' at me

[Chorus]
Lights
Lights
Lights

[Verse]
Your disorder's on the cusp
Could be almost hideous
You're just ridiculous

I can't get close enough
That bird's androgynous
It's really unnerving me

[Chorus]
Lights
Lights
Lights
Lights
