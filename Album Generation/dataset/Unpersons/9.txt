[Verse]
Making deadlines, I fail
I fail
Making mistakes, I excel
Excel
Faking interest, it's hard
To tell
Such an invalid, oh well
Oh well

[Chorus]
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces, ah-ah
Hold everything to pieces

[Verse]
Hearing bad news, I shrug
I shrug
Caring's there, I guess
I guess
It's hard under duress
Duress
Such a phony, oh well
Oh well

[Chorus]
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces, ah-ah
Hold everything to pieces

[Verse]
Taking the blame, I win
I win
Playing the game again
Again
I tried to run, I fell
I fell
Dust me off, oh well
Oh well

[Chorus]
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces, ah-ah
Hold everything to pieces

Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces
Hold everything to pieces, ah-ah
Hold everything to pieces
