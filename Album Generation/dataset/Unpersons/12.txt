[Verse]
You were tuned out all along
Didn't catch a word, you blink and nod
Say "yeah", but you just stare
No, you don't care
No, you aren't there
You're breakin' up
I'm gonna hang up

[Chorus]
Hear me out
That's all I want
Just hear me out
That's all I want
Hey hey hey
Ow

[Verse]
I got a vision, just listen up
Not binary fission, just a simple plot
Don't shut me out or interrupt
There you go again
You're nodding off
What's your difficulty?
A problem hearing me?

[Chorus]
Just hear me out
That's all I want
Just hear me out
That's all I want
Hey hey
Oh

[Bridge]
You're breakin' up
I'm gonna hang up

[Verse]
Now I've got somethin' for us
A simple plot, and it's glorious
So hear me out before you interject
Or brush me off like an insect
There you go again
You know I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
Just hear me out
That's all I want
Just hear me out
That's all I want
Hey hey hey
Ah oh

[Bridge]
You're breakin' up
I'm gonna hang up
