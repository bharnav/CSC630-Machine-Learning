[Verse]
Maybe I've been down this road
Maybe I've been chasin' shadows
And I've taken on too much blame

We take apart things just to rebuild
Like makin' life just to kill
And they're knockin' down walls again

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't
Be the
One to
Clean up
This mess
When you're
Gone

[Verse]
And you can do whatever you want
Your entire life can be a con
If you just don't go anywhere

We can take safety in a number
And file it all away under summer
But how's it gonna fit when it tears?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't
Be the
One to
Clean up
This mess
When you're
Gone

[Chorus]
I'd rather be seasick
Than stuck in this shit
There's no cure for idiocy
But all the nerve escapes me
And I become mute
And realize the idiot is me

[Verse]
Well none of us are traitors till we are
Maybe our change can be on par
Only some of us come off like stars

I can take part in this tragedy
I don't think it's all you, it's mostly me
It's true, we never knew each other

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't
Be the
One to
Clean up
This mess
When you're
Gone

[Chorus]
I'd rather be seasick
Than stuck in this shit
There's no cure for idiocy
But all the nerve escapes me
And I become mute
And realize the idiot is me

Well I'd rather be seasick
Than stuck in this shit
There's no cure for idiocy
But all the nerve escapes me
And I become mute
And realize the idiot is me

I won't
Be the
One to
Clean up
This mess
When you're
Gone
