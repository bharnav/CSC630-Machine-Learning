Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh

Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

[Verse]
Here you are
At the start
Everythin' is so great
A new house
A new life
So absurdly safe
You got some kids
Stupid kids
And a wife at the gate
But somethin' lurks
Unseen
Maybe somethin' you ate

[Chorus]
I died
I died
I died

I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you

[Verse]
Just like
A bad plot
I won't tell you why
Under floor
Or in a wall
Is where my secret lies
I'll come for
Your family first
So set them free
In some way
You alone
Clearly offended me

[Chorus]
I died
I died
I died

I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you

[Verse]
See I can't
Leave this house
For me it's far too late
If we're gonna live as one
Let's get this straight
I can trip you up
Just by
Movin' things around
And make you
Ethereal
Just like the Hell I found

[Chorus]
I died
I died
I died

Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh

Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh

[Chorus]
I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you
I'll haunt you

I died
I died
I died
