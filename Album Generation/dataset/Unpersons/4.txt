[Verse]
Well I drank two bottles of wine then I threw up and felt just fine
I was only thinkin' of you, and then I thought of you, and I forgot again
You said I climbed in the sink
Well shit, I don't remember that

[Chorus]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

[Verse]
How 'bout I create a mess and then solve the mess and then
I'll be a hero

You said there's no help for you, no, there's no help for you
No help for you

I'm the one to get rid of, it's clear
Let's get rid of me

[Chorus]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Let's get rid of me
That's how it's gonna be
Ah hah, ah ah

[Verse]
I started somethin' new
I think it's new
But I'm still a creep

How 'bout I climb that roof and get on top
You know, then I'll see everything

Finally I get my way, it's nice
'Cause it's my way

[Chorus]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

[Verse]
I can get a new hair do
And a new attitude
But you're still you

I suppose I'm sick and tired of sick and tired
Or maybe just You-sick

Somethin' about an apple tree, it's far...
Whatever I've had it

[Chorus]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Let's get rid of me
That's how it's gonna be

Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Let's get rid of me
That's how it's gonna be

Say ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
