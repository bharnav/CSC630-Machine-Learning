[Verse]
Scars
Don't
Heal
Overnight
Out
Of
Mind
Out of sight

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak, uh huh

[Verse]
New
Things
Always shine
Lose
Things?
Well, that's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak, uh huh

[Chorus]
Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away

Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away

[Verse]
Lights
Make
Traps
For flies
Fools
Buy
Death's disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak
You're such a freak, uh huh

[Chorus]
Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away

Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away

Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away

Go on, get your coat and cover up
Yourself, you're a disgrace
Barely even human body parts
Will give yourself away
