[Verse]
Skittering
You're made of pain
You hide in minds
They writhe, you maim
So charming
Your face a tomb
Hidden horror
You taste so good
Ancient evil

[Chorus]
You cheat, you steal, deny that it's real
And re-open wound so they never heal
You hold the cards, I play the fool
When you ignore the cardinal rule, uh huh
Uh huh

[Verse]
You restless ghoul
You're playing games
You set the traps
They take the bait
So polite
Creating hell
A pitfall
You like to sell
Ancient evil

[Chorus]
You cheat, you steal, deny that it's real
And re-open wound so they never heal
You hold the cards, I play the fool
When you ignore the cardinal rule, uh huh
Uh huh

[Verse]
Ravenous
You feed on skin
You deal it out
They squirm, you grin
So graceful
You're made of knives
Sweet raptor
They all give in
Ancient evil

[Chorus]
You cheat, you steal, deny that it's real
And re-open wound so they never heal
You hold the cards, I play the fool
When you ignore the cardinal rule, uh huh
Uh huh

You cheat, you steal, deny that it's real
And re-open wound so they never heal
You hold the cards, I play the fool
When you ignore the cardinal rule, uh huh
Uh huh
