I don't give a fuck

[Verse]
I've got my art, my books, my life
Your art? Yeah, I don't need that
I think I'm cool but I'm not cool and that guy is
I don't like you, you don't like me
And I like that, but I think that
I want to laugh and make you laugh but I can't tell

[Chorus]
I
Think
Your
Friends
Would
Hate
My
Friends

[Verse]
I could break you, you could break me
We could do that but I think that
My robot can kill your robot with the power of my mind
I know your pain and share your pain, let's have
Soup together
I'll lift a rock and kill the world and then we'll have lunch

[Chorus]
I
Think
Your
Friends
Would
Hate
My
Friends

The key is a code and I locked it at the Etap
There is no manager but Rob thinks he knows
I think that was a joke that only we know
So I'm sorry
Our world is so insular
And I think it shows

[Chorus]
I
Think
Your
Friends
Would
Hate
My
Friends

(Ahh!)

[Verse]
It's 5 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 4 and I remember
You can have a drink on me
But I won't be there
I've got my mind, my drinks, my life
Your mind? Yeah, I don't need that
What is that face? Oh, it's your face
You're cool, it shows

[Chorus]
I
Think
Your
Friends
Would
Hate
My
I
Think
Your
Friends
Would
Hate
My
Friends
