[Verse]
Take my last breath
Something you want
A final charm
Something you want
Take my last word
Something you need
A final spell
Something you need

[Chorus]
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take everything I love

[Verse]
Take my bad heart
Anything you wish
A certain lure
Anything you wish
Take my bad soul
Anything you crave
A certain curse

[Chorus]
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take everything I love

[Verse]
Take me away
Whatever you ask
I've got nothing
Whatever you ask
Take me away
Whatever you do
I've got nothing

[Chorus]
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take everything I love

[Bridge]
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose

[Chorus]
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take (take)
Everything I love
And you take everything I love

[Bridge]
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose
This is the life
I suppose
