(My...)
(Heart...)
(My...heart...)
(My heart...)
(My heart is made of metal)
(But...)
(Still...
I...)

[Verse]
Break down on a mission
From android short-wave transmission
Turn it off, crank it up, and try and start again
I'm your metal monster
Set knob to "Lonely Vision" of
Plans so messed up, I confess it could've been
I'm positronic

[Verse]
Why don't you take my picture?
I've got no emotion, see?
I cannot smile, and I don't pose, because I can't articulate
Your future is uncomfortable
Trapped in your little cars
I dream of shooting stars and re-wiring wires
I'm positronic

[Verse]
I processed a simple query
All about this expedition
Wonder where we're going and what will this lead us to
Here's a programmed answer to this so redundant question:
I was built for reason and though I may be cold
I'm positronic

[Chorus]
(My heart)
(Positronic)
(My heart)
(Positronic)
(My heart)
(Positronic)
(My... soul)
I'm positronic
