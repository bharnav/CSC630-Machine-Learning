[Verse]
You lay around
I lay around
What have you done?
What have I done?
You're like, "It's alright"
I'm like, "It's alright"
Are we havin' fun?
Aw

Let's take your mom's car out for a drive
For a drive
For a drive
She won't notice and we'll drive all night
Drive all night
Drive all night

[Chorus]
We gonna ride
We gonna ride all night
We gonna ride all night
We gonna ride all night
Ow!
Ah

[Verse]
You wander around
I wander around
Nothin' to do
Nothin' to do
You're like, "It's alright"
I'm like, "Let's fight"
Are we havin' fun?
Aw

Let's take your mom's car out for a drive
For a drive
For a drive
She won't notice and we'll drive all night
Drive all night
Drive all night

[Chorus]
We gonna ride
We gonna ride all night
We'll ride all night
We'll ride all night
Ow!

[Verse]
You're still around
I'm still around
You missed the signs
You missed the signs
You're like, "It's alright"
I'm like, "Let's fight"
Are we havin' fun?
Aw

Let's take your mom's car out for a drive
For a drive
For a drive
She won't notice and we'll drive all night
Drive all night
Drive all night

[Chorus]
We gonna ride
We gonna ride all night
We gonna ride all night
We gonna ride all night

[Verse]
Let's take your mom's car out for a drive
For a drive
For a drive
She won't notice and we'll drive all night
Drive all night
Drive all night

Ow!

[Chorus]
We'll drive all night
We'll drive all night
We'll drive all night
