[Verse 1]
I’m on the train that’s pullin' the sick and twisted
Makin the most of the ride before we get arrested
We’re all wasted
And we’re not going home tonight

[Verse 2]
Covered in black we lack the social graces
Just like an animal we crawl out of our cages
They can’t tame us
So if you’re one of us, get on the bus

[Chorus 1]
If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag!
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass!
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out

So shout if you’re a freak like me
You were born to burn
This is no disease you don’t need a cure!
It’s our time now to come out!
If you’re a freak like me!
If you’re a freak like me!

[Verse 3]
We’re underground but we will not surrender
We’re gonna give them something to remember, yeah
So write your name in gasoline
And set that shit on fire

[Chorus 2]
If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag!
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass!
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out

So shout if you’re a freak like me
Don’t apologize
They can’t hold you down
You were born to rise!
It’s our time now to come out!

[Bridge]
If you’re a freak like me
If you’re a freak like me
Are you a freak like me?
Are you a freak, like, me?!

[Outro-(Chorus 2)]
If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag!
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass!
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out

So shout if you’re a freak like me
Don’t apologize
They can’t hold you down
You were born to rise!
It’s our time now to come out!
If you’re a freak like me!
(If you're a freak!)
(If you're a freak like me!)
If you’re a freak like me!
(If you're a freak!)
If you’re a freak like me!
(If you're a freak...)
If you’re a freak like me!
(...Like Me!)
If you’re a freak like me!
