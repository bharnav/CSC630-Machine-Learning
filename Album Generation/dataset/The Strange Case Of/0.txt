[Verse 1]
Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper and get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

[Chorus]
That bitch can eat her heart out!
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites!

[Verse 2]
My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' out the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason, I'm nothin' like the rest
I kiss you in a way, you'll never forget about me

[Chorus]
That chick can eat her heart out!
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I!

[Bridge]
It sucks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
They say it’s blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls and won't let go until you fall
I was down and out, got up, and said
“Hey love, I've had enough!”
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

[Chorus]
Love bites, but so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I!
Love bites, but so do I, so do I

[Outro]
Love bites!
Love bites!
