[Intro]
[Lzzy Hale] Baby forgive me did I do something wrong?
[James Michael] I don't wanna talk, can't we just let it go?
[Lzzy Hale] What could be so bad that you'd leave me hanging on?
[James Michael] I'm not doing time, this is not the scene of a crime
[Lzzy Hale] I lay in bed at night contemplating
[Both] why the hell you gotta keep me waiting?

[Chorus: Lzzy Hale]
Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts

[Verse 1]
[Lzzy Hale] I can't remember the last time that this felt real
[James Michael] I would've cut you out, if I didn't love you
[Lzzy Hale] And how can you blame me for feelin' the way I feel?
[James Michael] I'm not blaming you, I'm just tryin' to figure it out
[Lzzy Hale] I can take a little hesitating
I'll wait forever if its worth the waiting

[Chorus: Lzzy Hale]
Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts

[Verse 2: Both]
They say that silence is gold, but I think that's a lie
You think I already know, but I can't read your mind...

[Lzzy Hale] Baby forgive me did I do something wrong?
[James Michael] I don't wanna talk...
[Lzzy Hale] Show me your private parts

[Chorus: Lzzy Hale]
Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts
