[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
We came to battle baby
We came to win the war
We won’t surrender'til we
Get what we're looking for
We're blowing out our speakers
There goes the neighbourhood
A little scissor happy
Little misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
We can turn you on
Or we can turn on you

[Chorus]
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil
Goes a long, long way
We stand together
No we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness

[Verse 2]
We're all survivors somehow
We just broke out the pack
And I don't need no dogtag
My name is on my back

[Pre-Chorus]
We can turn you on
Or we can turn on you

[Chorus]
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil
Goes a long, long way
We stand together
No we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness

[Bridge]
Never down, never out
Playing hard, living loud
Keeping up with the boys
Making out, making noise
And you better get me home
Before the sun comes up...up...up

[Chorus]
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil goes a long, long way
We stand together
No we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness

[Outro]
We’re the daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
