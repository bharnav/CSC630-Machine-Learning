Headlights, red lights
Got it in my sights
Nothin's in my way
No sound, hush now
Push the pedal down
Got no time to waste

It's a long way home
You just crossed a border line
(You just crossed a border line)
When I say "Go"
You know you better hold on tight

I don't know how to stop
I'll give it all I've got
It's like my brakes are shot
I gotta have too much
I don't know how to stop
It's crazy, but so what?
I know it's what you want
So give it up and don't be scared of
How good it feels

One speed, full speed
That is all I need
They can eat my dust
Hell yeah, rock on
Will you come along?
Do I have your trust

It's a long way down
If you're gettin' this high
(If you're gettin' this high)
When I say "Now"
You know you better hold on tight

I don't know how to stop
I'll give it all I've got
It's like my brakes are shot
I gotta have too much
I don't know how to stop
It's crazy, but so what?
I know it's what you want
So give it up and don't be scared of
How good it feels

Tell me how good it feels
You know you don't want me to
(I don't know how to stop)
Now that I'm here with you
(I don't know how to stop)
Here's what we're gonna do
(I don't know how to stop)
You know you don't want me to
(I don't know how to stop)

How good it feels
Tell me how good it feels
Don't be scared, scared, scared
Scared of how good it... feels!

I don't know how to stop
I'll give it all I've got
It's like my brakes are shot
I gotta have too much
I don't know how to stop
It's crazy, but so what?
I know it's what you want
So give it up and don't be scared of
How good it feels!

I don't know how to stop!
(How good it feels!)
I don't know how to stop!
(How good it feels!)
I don't know how to stop!
(How good it feels!)
I don't know how to stop!
