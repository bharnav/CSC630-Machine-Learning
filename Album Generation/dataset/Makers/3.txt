She swore out the lights when she said that she was
Only in it for the rain
She made of her bed a naive
Nativity
Just in case it became - just in case
Here's
The 1st of many songs you wanted me to write
Just
For you I hope to god you like it
It's as pretty as it
Is cruel
It's as pretty as it is cruel
She swore out the
Lights when she dammed herself to sleep
Her thirteenth
Finger my whiskey drink
And she wept at the scene as
The ambulance drove off
Come circumference, come
Circumstance
Here's the 1st of many songs you wanted
Me to write
Just for you I hope to god you like it
And it may seem pretty cruel but mercy is not my name
And our kids I hope to god you counted them
You're as pretty as you are cruel
You're as pretty as you are cruel
You're as pretty as you are cruel
