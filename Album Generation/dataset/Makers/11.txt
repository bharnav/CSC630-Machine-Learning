Death keeps calling me, she's gonna set me free
No more sunshine sidewalk streets or misery
Like she did for you
Oh Allen how you suffered
Lower east-side apartment
We stayed up late

The bones inside your mind where all broken
The keys that opened any answers were all stolen
Filling and refilling up the glass with makers
We both agreed
The Final Moment!
The sweetest remedy to ever be delivered!
Heaven or heavenless we're all headed for the same sweet darkness

So she came for you, well I guess you wanted her to
Now in the safety of a coffin rest you're through
No more debts or memories
No more heart blood or skin on teeth
Final dosage to set you free
You escaped

The bones inside your mind where all broken
The keys that opened any answers were all stolen
Filling and refilling up the glass with makers
We both agreed
The Final Moment!
The sweetest remedy to ever be delivered!
Heaven or heavenless we're all headed for the same sweet darkness
