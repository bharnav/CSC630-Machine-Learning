There's a hotel in my memory
Pink Flamingos and light flickering
From the TV screen
Come lay down here with me
Your mom and
Dad are right outside
So we climbed up here so we can hide from
Everything
From all the lies that we've lived beneath
Let's pick up
Where we left off
Let's string up everything that we've been afraid of
We've been living under, we've been taught to remember
And let's
Learn how to love
There's a hotel in your memory
Pink Flamingos
And light flickering from the TV screen
Come hide up here with me
Thinking it up is making it real - you create the scene
You've lived in
For years - it's scary to think
What some lies will make you believe
