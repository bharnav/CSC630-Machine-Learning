Please, slow it down
There's a secret magic past world
That you only notice when you're looking back at it…
And, all I wanna do is turn around
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
‘cause I couldn't let go
And the water hit the setting sun

Passing white daisies
Taking turns
Close the door
Walk into the street catching raindrops on your tongue
And for a minute… it all stops
But it won't last me
Just a passing moment gone…

Please, slow it down
There's a secret place that I know
I can dig a grave out
And climb underground for good
And, all I wanna do is turn around
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
‘cause I couldn't let go
And the water hit the setting sun

Passing white daisies
Taking turns
All those evenings on the back deck of our first apartment…
They meant everything
But, the wind just carried them off
And you can't go back now
Just a passing moment gone

Please, slow it down
There's a secret magic past world
That you only notice when you're looking back at it…
And, all I wanna do is turn around
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
‘cause I couldn't let go…
And the water hit the setting sun

‘cause I couldn't let go…
Of the passing moment gone
