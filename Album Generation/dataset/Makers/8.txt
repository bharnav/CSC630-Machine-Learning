Car 5032 of the Union Pacific
Is passing by on the right to bring back all the hopelessness
Of a trailer park in the old mining town
Where the irony's laying thick on the ground
In the dirty streets of Goldfield

If you're searching for silver or an easier fortune
Finding nothing in the way of love or a life of living any better than before
You'll know you've arrived in Goldfield
You've arrived in Goldfield

Car 5032 of the Union Pacific
Is passing by on the right and she's thinking of escaping out to Frisco
From the trailer park in the old mining town
Where the irony's laying thick on the ground
In the dirty streets of Goldfield

Laying roots down to soak up the poison for generations
Finding nothing in the way of love or a life of living any better than before
You'll know you've arrived in Goldfield
You've arrived in Goldfield
Gotta get the hell out of Goldfield
Get the hell out of Goldfield

I'm gone this time, I'm really leaving
I'm gone this time, I'm really leaving
I'm gone this time, I'm really leaving
I'm gone this time, I'm really leaving
