Come along with me now cause there are things I've been
Dying to tell you
The best of the worst things that you never
Needed to know
This is the kind of comedy where no one's
Laughing, cause it's hard to
I'm a punch line who's punch-drunk
With my fist in a broken mirror
There's a party nearby
I can hear
Laughter in the distance and it all comes clear
Sounds to simple
Love is the only answer
Everything else is just a train wreck
I'm gonna stay up all night every night for the rest of my life
Till
The lines around my eyes grow deeper and more defined
You might
Ask me aren't you dead inside and so damn tired
I'll say I have no
Idea I'm not sleeping until after the dying is over
I can hear laughter
In the distance and it all comes clear
Sounds to simple
Love is the
Only answer
When love's a train wreck you're a mistake
