We can go and walk in the darkness
Get relief at each streetlight
I don't know how much it would cost us
Probably more than I've spent in my whole life
On these silly ideas
That waste more time than I had to lose
When I woke up this morning
Seems like I've got so much more to lose now
Than I ever had before
Before

Little beanie-bean with the calculator keys
Can he add it all up
Make it all make sense to me
I've got no idea
How much more time
I've got left if I can't get my mind right
The simplest little melody has got me all
Tangled up in knots
I'm tangled up

We can go and walk in the morning
We don't need streetlights, just a new start
Not paralyzed by appearances
With big ideas and just way too smart
To walk around
On the surface when there's an ocean
Just beneath its blue-green smile
All the while nothing stopping me from jumping in
And sinking fast
I'll sing you to sleep first
