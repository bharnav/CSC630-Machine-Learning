I got the outfit for the party but you’ve taken away the invitation
And I’d like to thank you Rashida for doing this
And giving me a reason to write a song

I guess I’ll have to go a begging for that Vanity Fair connection
And I’d like to thank you Rashida
It’s been a while since I have gone a begging
So very very long

I finally saw you at the party in a dress that was well, quite stunning
And I’d like to thank you Rashida
For giving me a reason to call Miss Portman
And to write this song
