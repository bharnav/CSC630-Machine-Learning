If you’re runnin' from your doorstep
And you don’t know where to go to
Drinking rosé in the rain
Or listening to the same song over and over again

If you’re lost on a strange path
Needin' a gate to turn into
Far from the sun
Or listening to someone happier than yourself

Barbara
Barbara
I’ll be there
I’ll be there

And although you may not see me
The trees they will remember
Speak my name
And rosé will be sweet
Suddenly, inclement weather will retreat
Although you may not see me
Although you may not see me
Speak my name and

Barbara
Barbara
I’ll be there
I’ll be there
I’ll be there
