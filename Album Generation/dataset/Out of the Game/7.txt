Let’s meet in a respectable dive
On the somewhat safe street
And have a beer
We’ve both kept our eyes on the ball
We know the lyrics to them all
These songs of fear

And baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you
But I’m not able to put my cards on the table
And if you only knew of the hand that I’m holding
You would be blushing
And I am so far from bluffing
In this respectable dive

I know that we never play cards or write postcards
When we’re both in the same town
But still I remember some notes on the kitchen counter
Back from work I’ve found

And baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you
But I’m not able to put my cards on the table
And if you only knew of the hand I was holding
You would be blushing
And I am so far from bluffing
In this respectable dive

Baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you
Baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you
