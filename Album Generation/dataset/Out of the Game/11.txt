I tried to do all that I can
But the churches have run out of candles
I tried to give you all I own
But the bankers have run out of loaners

It’s always just that little bit more
That doesn’t get you what you’re looking for

I tried to block the cabin door
But the churches have run out of candles
I tried to lend a helping hand
But the rooms have all run out of pamphlets
I tried to cook it up and turn
The kitchen has run out of canned bits

It’s always just that little bit more
That doesn’t get you what you’re looking for

I tried a beggin on the cabin floor
But the churches have run out of candles
Then one day in the cathedral
I finally lit you a candle
And all along the vaulted halls
The virgins did smile from their mantles

It’s always just that little bit more
That doesn’t get you what you’re looking for
But gets you where you need to go
But the churches have run out of candles

It’s always just that little bit more
That doesn’t get you what you’re looking for
But gets you where you need to go
But the churches have run out of candles

It’s always just that little bit more
That doesn’t get you what you’re looking for
But gets you where you need to go
But the churches have run out of candles
