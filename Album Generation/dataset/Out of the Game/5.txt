One day you will come to Montauk and see your dad wearing a
Kimono and see your other dad pruning roses
Hope you won't turn around and go

One day you will come to Montauk and see your dad playing the piano
And see your other dad wearing glasses
Hope that you will want to stay for a while
Don’t worry I know you’ll have to go

One day you will come to Montauk and see your dad trying to be funny
And see your other dad seeing through me
Hope that you will protect your dad

One day you will come to Montauk and see your dad trying to be evil
And see your other dad feeling lonely
Hope that you will protect him, and stay
Don’t worry I know you’ll have to go

One day years ago in Montauk lived a woman now a shadow
There she does wait for us in the ocean
And although we want to stay for a while
Don’t worry we all have to go
One day you will come to Montauk
