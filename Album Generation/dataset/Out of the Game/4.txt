I will never be defeated
I will never come undone
I will never know the way it feels to be just anyone
I will never fall just as you all fall around me so
I will never know
I will never know

I will never be the one who tells you that I need you more
Nor will I have to be the one who’s walking out the door
When the hour has struck you will receive
A note addressed from me
I will never be
Be the one you see

So baby welcome to the ball
Don’t worry all about nothin' at all
I don’t know how you made it in
But since you have arrived
Let it begin

'Cause somethin' in your eyes has made this room a much more brighter place
The chandeliers and fireplaces all seem jealous of your face
Something in your smile has left a light that has left a trace
Come and take my hand and let you lead me to the promised land
That no one could have ever been promised
I don’t know if you feel it and I don’t really care
'Cause long ago when I was young and innocent they brought me here
Far from my mothers home
I was all alone
I was all alone

So baby welcome to the ball
Don’t worry all about nothin' at all
I don’t know how you made it in
But since you have arrived let it begin
