Sometimes you need a stranger to talk to
Sometimes you need to go to the observatory
Sometimes a movie star’s eyes gets you through the love and the lies
Sometimes you need a stranger to walk with
Sometimes you need to go to the dog park
Sometimes a movie star’s spark gets you through the dark
Sometimes a movie star’s bark bites you hard a birch on a lark
I’m so tired of writing of cities
Guess that you’ve guessed which one this is
Sometimes a movie star’s eyes get you through the love and the lies
Sometimes a movie star’s kiss let’s get lost in Los Angeles
Sometimes you need a stranger to talk to
