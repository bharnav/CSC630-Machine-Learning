Chokin' on my bitter tears
My bitter tears
Only thing I don't fear's you
Don't want you to see my tears
My bitter tears
Only thing I fear is my tears
Heavens how it's going to rain
Is this the same
Heavens with the bright blue skies
Drivin' at the crack of dawn
Lookin' away tryin' to hide my bloodshot eyes

But in discussin' with the mornin'
It's gonna be O.K
But in discussin' with the mornin'
It's gonna be just fine dear

Taxi driver look at me
Oh can't you see
Turn around go back behind
Don't want you take me home
Where I'm alone
Rackin' up my tears and crying
Gotta be another way
Somebody cursed me when I said
"I'll never be there myself"
Gotta be another way
Somebody curse the light
And take me far away from myself

But in discussin' with the mornin'
It's gonna be O.K
But in discussin' with the mornin'
It's gonna be just fine dear

I'm just discussin' with the mornin'
Just discussin' with the mornin'
And it's gonna be O.K

I'm just discussin' with the mornin'
Still discussin' with the mornin'
And it's gonna be just fine

I'm just discussin' with the mornin'
Still discussin' with the mornin'
And it's gonna be O.K
Yeah it's gonna be just fine
