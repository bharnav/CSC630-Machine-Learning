So you want a song
So you want a song
A song just for you
There are many melodies to choose from but there’s only one of you
So I’m gonna fly in the sky so high in the wind
And I’m gonna try really really try so hard not to give in
And find the song of you

So I’m gonna run and hide my head in the sand
And I’m gonna think really really think so hard to try and understand
And find the song of you
The song of you

So you want a song
So you want a song
A song just for you
There are many lyrics to choose from but there’s only one of you

So I’m gonna fly in the sky so high in the wind
And I’m gonna try really really really try so hard not to give in
And find the song of you
So I’m gonna run and hide my head in the sand
And I’m gonna think really really really think so hard to try and understand
And find the song of you
The song of you
So you want a song
So you want a song
A song just for you
