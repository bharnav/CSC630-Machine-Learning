I keep thinking that you are going to change
I keep thinking that you are going to rearrange
But I’m a fool to think something so impossible
You ain’t ever gonna change
You ain’t ever gonna change
Oh no
Jericho
Until I blow

I keep thinking that you are going to rise
I keep thinking that you are going to compromise
But I’m a fool to think something so improbable
You ain’t ever gonna rise
You ain’t ever gonna rise
Oh no
Jericho
Until I take you by surprise

Baby I know that you’re too sad to cry
But my little darling guess what? So am I
Still I believe we ought to shed a tear
The open hearted have no thing to fear
But I don’t even think you hear me at all
Under your medieval ceiling behind your biblical wall
Guess I’ll have to put my trumpet back in the case
And get behind this here canon covered in lace
Covered in lace

I keep thinking that you are going to change
I keep thinking that you are going to rearrange
But I’m a fool to think something so impossible
You ain't ever gonna change
You ain't ever gonna change
Oh no
Jericho
Until I blow
Until I blow
