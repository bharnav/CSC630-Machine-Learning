After another production of "The Flying Dutchman"
I landed in Berlin
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And wonder what state I'm in
Sissi was the anarchist empress of Austria
And I was in the same state that she was in
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where the hell's that fan

After another induction to the hall of famine
I closed the magazine
Thinking over and over it how can I get over it
And be German and mean
Jenny was a pirate and Jane was beheaded and Nina was a sweet nymphomaniac
And with them in my corner I'm sure that it's a tall order
To find that perfect man

I'm doin' all that I can
Tryin' to make all the roses bloom in unison
Say I'm gonna blow you away
Makin' all of the roses bloom so step away
Makin' all of the roses bloom

After another unveiling of the bright red herring
I walked down Rufus Street
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where in the world will I meet
That literary, lean, stripe suited lover
I've read about all of my life
Which I fear is a ruse and explains
All the walks through all the parks of Europe
And why I never will tell you "I love you"
And why there is just but
A vision of perfect man

I'm doin' all that I can
Makin' all of the roses bloom in unison
Say I'm gonna blow you away
Makin' all of the roses bloom so step away
And be dazzled
Makin' all of the roses bloom
