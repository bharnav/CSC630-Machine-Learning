Fate leave on my doorstep
A soldier, a soldier
A fable, a fortune
I long for, I long for

Ever so secret I see
What's in store for me
I won't let it mislead
Oh no. No, it hasn't happened yet

As for the dying
And the fading
And resolve to be
Okay with the natural decay
I'll choose illusion
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived

Let us find perfection
And nonsense in all we are
Save defects for later
We're angels for now

Hide my uniform pride
Your arrogant side
I'm aching already
Hide your taciturn, mundane expressions
Affection will carry us a little while more

As for the dying
And the fading
And resolve to be
Okay with the natural decay
I'll choose illusion
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived

Let us be entertained
Let me believe it ends this way

As for this dying
And as for this rotting
I'm okay with this natural decay
I'll choose illusions
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
Drop this curtain
I'm happy and naive
