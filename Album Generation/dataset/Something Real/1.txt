Turn around, there's those eyes again
Turn around, fake indifference and I
Watch the cold, dark silhouettes disappear
A hundred bodies fill this room
And all their faces overdone
Pain is foreign, foreign to us

I don't even know you
You won't even know I'm gone
Was it something I did wrong?

Roses, roses cold
Roses, roses sold out

Turn around, reds and whites again
I'd sell my kicks for one more low tar
Fevers hand-in-hand with shoelace bracelets
Why are some girls so naive?
He didn't unbutton your blouse to see
A better view of your heart, oh yeah, can't blame you for trying

I don't even know you
You won't even know I'm gone
Was it something I did wrong?

Roses, roses cold
Roses, roses sold out

Roses, roses cold
Roses, roses sold out

Sing it soft
Make it slow
Apples parachute the boys back down
Fill it up
Overflow
A new improved modern way to feel

I don't even know you
You won't even know I'm gone
I don't even know you
You won't even know I'm gone
Was it something I did wrong?
Was it something I did wrong?
Was it something I did wrong?
