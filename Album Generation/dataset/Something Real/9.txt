He saw a lonely girl
She saw a lonely world
It was a canvas, slyly careless
A Florestan lieder

And his was a dying breed
And courage came only from his symphonies
A decorative smile to fade out
His concerto in A

Come on
A second chance at love
The moments dead
Make you feel like it's never staying

Made love to a baby grand
A tempest refined inside his hands
He had one girl and one song
Bona fide wine and roulade

But he had to give it up
His heart was raw but his fingers numb
His first words were his last words
An aesthete since first sun

Come on
A second chance at love
The moments slept
Make you feel like it's never staying

And it burned
The first attempt or two
But I remembered you
I, I need that moment back

Please don't, don't don't
A tremor for death
Ivories that sliced sedatives in half
Relief in the Rhine
Washed away regrets
And let him char before he
Caressed the ground

Dear artist you will rise again
A last arabesque in faint fashion

Come on
A second change at love
The moments dead
Make you feel like it's never ending

And it burned
The first attempt or two
But I remembered you
I need that moment back

Please don't, don't forget

He woke
A final view of blue
Dear cordias wet rouge
Relieve romance to graves
Please, please don't forget
