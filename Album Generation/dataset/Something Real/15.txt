He's got inside my head
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

I am not anymore surprised at your phone calls at 4 in the morning
(Hello, hello)
You try to write me letters like you've transformed into Charles Dickens overnight or something
(Oh, I'm sorry)
And I doubt that you've considered that maybe
Just maybe those genes that you were forced in
Although heavy, are no excuse for your lack of trust in anyone, even you
My boyfriend used my palm, as an ashtray
And that was on his good days
My scar looks like a bear, or a rabbit
They said, "It's just his bad habits."

He's got inside my head
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

I'm not even scared to come cure your past, or try to reinvent it
(Just leave it alone)
I can be your lover, and your mother
And your father who never really had to take you fishing or teach compassion
You used my voice as your spokesman
You couldn't walk on your own feet
Ain't that horrid

He's got inside my head
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

What's the use, I've caught the blindness

He's got inside my head
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

Are you going to tell me that you can't bear this weight that was a present 12 years from this day?
Well this town's on the edge of the dry, dry ocean
And you're thinking you're immune to getting torn or more

Yeah...Yeah...
Come on

He's got inside my bed
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

He's got inside my bed
He's sleeping in my head
He's got hold of my hand

What's the use, I've caught the blindness
