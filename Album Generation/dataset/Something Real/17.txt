[Verse 1: Dia Frampton]
Did you think about what I said last night?
Knowing you, you probably didn't
I could picture your face on the other side
Completely oblivious
Do you really feel like this love is real?
I wish I could join you

[Chorus 1: Frampton]
I'm bored of your love
I'm bored of your face
I'm bored of your random all
Over the place attitude
I'm bored of you

[Verse 2: Tom Higgenson]
So, I thought about what you said last night
Normally I probably wouldn't
But something you said kept me up all night
I tried to sleep but I just couldn't
I hope you still feel like
This love is for real
'Cause I know that I do

[Chorus 2: Higgenson]
I'm in love with your love
In love with your face
In love with almost everything that you say
Yes it's true
I'm in love with you

[Chorus 1: Frampton]
I'm bored with your love
([Higgenson] I'm in love with your love)
I'm bored of your face
([Higgenson] In love with your face)
I'm bored of your random all
Over the place attitude
I'm bored of you
([Higgenson] I'm in love with you)

[Bridge: Frampton]
I wish you put effort in
Trying to make this new
(I would if you asked me, I'd
Do anything for you)
I wish we were strangers
([Higgenson] It's not like we're strangers)
In all the excitement we'd fall in love

[Higgenson]
(Guess that's it then)
Can I take you out just this one last time
We could pretend I never met you

[Frampton]
Well I'd love to, sounds like a lovely time
But I'm sorry, I just can't let you
I'm bored of your love
I'm bored of your love
I'm up to my neck in this mess and I'm sorry

[Chorus 3: Frampton and Higgenson]
I'll remember your love
Remember your face
When it's over and done it
Won't quite be the same
Without you
I'll remember you
(I'll remember you)

I'll remember your love
Remember your face
When it's over and done it
Won't quite be the same
Without you
I'll remember you
(I'll remember you)
I'll remember you
