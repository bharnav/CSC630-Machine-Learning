Setting up Sunday
Watching the winter grow
So old no
Oh we're making excuses
For insecurities
It's not about me
Oh it's never about me

Now I can't go on
I'm lost and alone
Now our lover is gone
I'm lost and alone

Kid I'm right here
And I'm not leaving
There's no way to make you stay
But I'm saving all my worries for the day you don't need me

Selling out Monday
Watching the children grow
So cold no
Oh we're weighing our hands down
Our human frailties
It's not about me
Oh it's never about me

Now I can't go on
I'm lost and alone
Now our lover is gone
I'm lost and alone

Kid I'm right here
And I'm not leaving
There's no way to make you stay
But I'm saving all my worries for the day you don't need me

Kid I'm right here
It's now morning
There's no way
Please stay

Setting up Sunday
Watching their hearts in toil
Grow mold
