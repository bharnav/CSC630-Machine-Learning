I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
Like you

She began to die
Indiana that's not right
Indiana that's not life
Then she began to fight
Indiana make it mine
Indiana make this mine

So pale and white
Determined in rust and ruin
A dew drenched hour
Colonel sir, her name's not yours

I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
Like you

She began to die
Indiana that's not right
Indiana that's not life
Then she began to fight
Indiana make it mine
Indiana make this mine

Frail, gothic eyes
A damsel of somber sky
She faints on isles
Mademoiselle, hold tight your tongue

I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
I can do whatever I want like you
Like you

Is this where the brave hearts hide?
Is this where the brave hearts hide?
Oh no
Is this how the brave hearts die?
Is this how the brave hearts die?
Oh no
