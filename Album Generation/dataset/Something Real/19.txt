I’ve got my same old nose and no cheekbones
I’ve got my stomach rolls, rather bare wardrobe
They’ve got seven floors, one on the east coast
Why they grin so wide, they’ve got their visions no one knows

I think I’m on the bright side
Got my hair cut short, I do my class report on time
I hope I’m on the bright side
What beauty is today is a fake from what’s inside

My teeth are yellow stars sleeping in my jaws
While their lips enlarged, in a constant pout
They’re the types of girls who hide their wedding rings, if it doesn’t match their clothes
They’ve got their visions no one knows
And why we’re patient no one knows

I think I’m on the bright side
Got my hair cut short, I do my class report on time
I hope I’m on the bright side
What beauty is today is a fake from what’s inside

Learn to let go of tired skin
It’s just a fence to hold me in
I ask for a closing statement
I ask for just one prayer that I can put me into
We’re the most modern man machines
Under our masks not what we seem
We must not sleep underneath the slow and steady descent of the fools upstairs

I think I’m on the bright side
Got my hair cut short, I do my class report on time
I hope I’m on the bright side
What beauty is today is a fake from what’s inside
On the bright side
Got my hair cut short, I do my class report on time
I hope I’m on the bright side
What beauty is today is a fake from what’s inside

I’ve got my same old nose and no cheekbones
(I think I’m on the bright side)
My teeth are yellow stars sleeping in my jaws
(I think I’m on the bright side)
They’ve got seven floors, one on the east coast
(I think I’m on the bright side)
They’re the types of girls who hide their wedding rings
(I think I’m on the bright side)
