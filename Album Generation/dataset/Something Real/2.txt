Oh, Play along
She wills it
Oh, Sunday came
Promised you'd tell her
She sat up in bed
Answered your call dear
Smeared purple and red
You're gonna leave her tonight
She sat up with her eyes wide
You fell in love with a girl you knew
You've come to say goodbye
You're gonna leave her tonight
Under a cheap July sky
Tell her
Tell Mary
After the first touch
Her skirt boring
Her voice deep and charming at first
You could make her come back once in a while
If you painted a fresco
There she'd be with her powder half falling off
So perfect from far
Meet me at the pictures Mary
Adam said that he was leaving
Meet me
Meet Me
You're gonna leave her tonight
You're gonna leave her tonight
She sat up with her eye's wide
You fell in love with a girl you knew
With a girl you knew
You're gonna leave her tonight
She sat up with her eyes wide
You fell in love with a girl you knew
And you've come to say goodbye
You're gonna leave her tonight
Under a cheap July sky
Tell her
Tell Mary
