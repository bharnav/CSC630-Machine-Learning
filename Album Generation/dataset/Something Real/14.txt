[Verse 1]
You best be quick, you’ve got to run
They’re coming at you with their guns, yeah
They’re chasing after with their jail bars (Ha ha)
Whoever thought we’d fall so far?
You’ve got to learn to act like God
You rule the world, you give the word
And if someone should fall behind
Just let their suffering slip your mind

[Chorus]
Are there giants too
In the dance?
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death
Are there giants too
In the dance?
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death

[Verse 2]
Help me escape from lonely choirs
Which only hollow voices sing
I wonder who decides who wins
(The judges of mind, art, and skin)
In which we nod in agreement

[Chorus]
Are there giants too
In the dance?
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death
Are there giants too (are there giants too)
In the dance? (In the dance)
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death
Are there giants too
In the dance? (In the dance)
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death
Are there giants too (are there giants too)
In the dance? (In the dance)
’Cause this is about life
And life isn’t about death
