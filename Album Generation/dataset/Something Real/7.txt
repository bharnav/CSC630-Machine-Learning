I saw you with her dear
You tried to hide away
She left through the back door
You always had your secret ways
I acted so serene
I was so drowsy then
My fault
I'm so careless
I gave you one too many pills
My oh my
My alibi
Restore my fate in these
Words so clear
My failure dear
Lies tucked away in me
You wanted to play this game
I'll play it too
Come here baby I will show you what this girl can do
A mattress for a coffin suites you very fine
You'll feel me with my others as you're sewn under the seams
