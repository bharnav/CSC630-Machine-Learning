Never was a navy brat, but my father was, ya...
He warned me not to make friends with weather
My love rests in a shipwreck
With a compass in his head
I’ll wait for him, like vultures wait for bodies
Please send the wind out, I hear his voice now, at the bottom of the blue
I’ll get my coat, it’ll be the second coming outside, when I return with you
I’m a ship like you. One sail. One sea
You and Me
And I left my soul next to the shore
One sail. One sea
Wait with my face in sun
That makes me look less young
I miss your half- Irish grin, and our love is growing upside down
They say you’ll never make it home!
But I will wait, won’t bury your clothes
Please send the wind out, and bring him back now
Because he is to me my life
Think about sinking down
Think about all of it
Think his face drowning out
I think of it all
