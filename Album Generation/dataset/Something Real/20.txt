Your house, the coffee tastes like dirt
Not because I'm hurt, no. That's just what it tastes like
Dirt roads, remind me of my skin
Not because I'm wasting away
With the gravel you grounded, that's what it feels like

I won't be sorry, won't go moping around
In fact I'm doing quite well for now

Let's talk about giving up, it sounds so bitter sweet
Think I'll throw in the towel right now
I'll lay low on the ground and I'll be on my feet
When I can breathe, when I'm good and ready

This tree, lovers heart engraved
Not because I'm lonely, just because I hate it
Sunshine digs underneath my nails
Not because I'm burning all my hopes
Scorching all my faith, as far as I can tell

I'm not bitter, I'm not mouthing out words
Look at my face, believe me now

Let's talk about giving up, that sounds so bitter sweet
Think I'll throw in the towel right now (But fold it nice and neat)
I'll lay low on the ground and I'll be on my feet
When I can breathe, when I'm good and ready

Let's talk about giving up, that sounds so bitter sweet
Think I'll throw in the towel right now
I'll lay low on the ground and I'll be on my feet
When I can breathe, when I'm good and ready
