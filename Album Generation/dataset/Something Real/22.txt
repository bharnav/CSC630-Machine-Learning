I don't care to know, the time on the wall
The placement of my shoes, on the wood floor
The last boat has left. Can't carry you afloat
I fear the empty, wet bed. The empty grey coat
And I won't go till you're asleep
You open your mouth, like an asthma attack, you repeat
"If all that you take from this is courage, then I've no regrets."
I wanted to kiss you goodnight
No longer can pretend, it won't cave in and will be alright
I wanted to save this last light
With dawn comes certainty of what we'll be, for now hold me lightly
I look to the floor
Your hair like cut grass
Your vomit it forms, a gold chain 'round your neck
I won't wake you up. No need for last words
These last idle hours. More than I deserve
"...You take from this is, courage than I've no regrets."
Don't settle for less again. You've become more than I could have become for you
Could have inspired to be. Hesitation will leave dents on the walls and the rail
And your scent will leave me with more faith in myself
I wanted to kiss you goodnight. No longer can pretend
It won't cave in and will be alright
Wanted to tell you I lied
I said I'd make it through this world alright, but I don't care to try
I'd make it through this world alright, but I don't care to try
