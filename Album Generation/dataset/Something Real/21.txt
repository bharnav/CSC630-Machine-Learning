[Verse 1]
When I was younger, I wish that I would have known better
Better love makes a fat romance
That lasts for more than a shoe shine
I’m older, took all the words of my mother, saying
It could be worse, could be born with that disease
Instead of catching it first
So let’s go back, to the first time
That I met you, in your Chevy
With your hands stretched, and me crying
Screaming, “Mercy, mercy”
But I know that, I was put here
To fight Vikings, in the cold war
With my arms out, in the front lines
Singing, “Dare me, dare me”

[Chorus]
But these things take time, love
These things take backbone
And they’ll tell you what you want to hear
’Cause they think it’s better, better
But you better know how to point out the liars
You’ve got to weigh your wars
Make sure you’re not fighting for nothing, nothing
Are you fighting for nothing, nothing?

[Verse 2]
It feels like this world has been growing slowly upside down
Maybe I should move to China, and straighten this mess out
Maybe I’ll be a poet, watch all the sky for falling words
And write about my grandma’s curtains
Or the lady who put the Chinese buffet in her purse
I’ve got my mouth
It’s a weapon, it’s a bombshell
It’s a cannon, I’ve got my words
I won’t give them mercy, mercy

[Chorus]
But these things take time, love
These things take backbone
And they’ll tell you what you want to hear
’Cause they think it’s better, better
But you better know how to point out the liars
You’ve got to weigh your wars
Make sure you’re not fighting for nothing, nothing
Are you fighting for nothing, nothing?

[Bridge]
I’ve got my words, I hope they hurt you
I hope they scar you, I hope they heal you
I hope they cut you open, make you see you’ve been warring
For all the wrong reasons
Make you see that some things are worth bruising for
Make you see that your name is your honor code
Make you see that your hands you’re accounted for
Pick and choose where your sweat and your blood will go
Make you see your life’s not to be lived alone
Run their spit through your hair, you’re worth nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
These things take time, love
These things take backbone
And they’ll tell you what you want to hear
’Cause they think it’s better, better
But you better know how to point out the liars
You’ve got to weigh your wars
Make sure you’re not fighting for nothing, nothing

[Outro]
But these things take time
These things take backbone
And they’ll tell you what you want to hear
’Cause they think it’s better, better
But you better know how to point out the liars
You’ve got to weigh your wars
Make sure you’re not fighting for nothing, nothing
Are you fighting for nothing, nothing?
