I came to see you cause I wanted to speak to you
But when I came around you didn't treat me good
So I am going home with saddened feelings
But I will find me another way?

And I came around cause I wanted to hold you
But when I came around you didn't treat me good
So I am going home with saddened feelings
But I will find me another way

Oh baby this ain't working out
No baby this not what we're about
Baby this ain't working out
No baby this not what we're about

Oh baby this ain't working out
No baby this not what we're about
Oh baby this ain't working out
No baby this not what we're about

And baby this ain't working out
No baby this not what we're about
What we're about
