Seems fine, though it ain't, no no, no no
Seems fine, though it ain't, no
I gotta find me a way to flow
Deep in the heart, I'll seek, I'll find it all

Seek, I'll find it all

Seems fine, though it ain't, no no no no
Seems fine, though it ain't, no
I gotta find me a way to flow
Deep in the heart, I'll seek, I'll find it all

Seek, I'll find it all (I'll find it all)
Seek, I'll find it all (I'll find it all)

Seems fine (no, it ain't)
Seems fine (no, it ain't, no, it ain't)
Seems fine (no, it ain't, no, it ain't, no no no no)
Seek, I'll find it all
Seek, I'll find it all
I'll find it all
I'll find it all
I'll find it all
