I remember you, bird of my heart
Flew in from the west
Your chest so red n' strong
Have you been to war, have you been to war
Lay you battleaxe down
And come around for me
Final nest for you, bird of my heart
Lay down to rest
This song I made for you
Have you been to war, have you been to war
Lay your battleaxe down
And come around for med, and come around for me
