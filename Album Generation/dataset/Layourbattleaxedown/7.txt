You have been waiting long to get over
Some are already gone
Still the walk is hard as hoping
For the only one
And all is you and a free ride back
And all I know there's a rise in the sun in me
If I will love again
Will my heart allow
Still the walk is hard as hoping
For the only one
All is you and a free ride back
And all I know there's a rise in the sun in me

And all is you and a free ride back
And all I know there's a rise in the sun in me
And all is you and a free ride back
And all I know there's a rise in the sun in me
And all is you and a free ride back
And all I know there's a rise in the sun in me
