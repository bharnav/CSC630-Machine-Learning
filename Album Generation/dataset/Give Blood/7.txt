I don't wanna reduce you but you're being useless
You're flicking away the angels that came down to save you now
You've got a blood on your conscience
You're bleeding out of every single one of your pores
Between the dusk and the dawn there's a lot of loss on your hands, sir

I can't stand to stand beside you no more
You keep on doing all the things that you were once so against, sir

Stuck in the revolution
? solutions
You can't find a way out when there isn't a way in anymore
You're been flirting with ruthless
You're been treating danger like she's one of the boys
You say your world could open up
But there ain't enough of you to pull it apart you've forgotten, sir

I can't stand to stand beside you no more
You keep on doing all the things that you were once so against, sir
Lying all the time, you keep on lying all the time
Better sort it out 'cause we're all waiting for an answer

It's hard enough to see you when the lights are out...
It's hard enough to believe in you...
