Oh my lord, she sure looks pretty
Running around in New York City
Look in her eyes, she's a princess in disguise
Oh-ho, get me a pony

Whoop-de-loop-de look at those buildings
Later on lo-da-lo looking for a living
Hey there, little lady, wanna look a little later?
Oh-ho, get me a pony

Well I fell in love and then I fell down drunk
Fell down the stairs of some dim lit bar

Woke up dirty, down in the city
5th and 2nd, not feeling like diddy
Ain't about to reason with six policemen
Oh-ho, get me a pony

Oh my lord, she sure looks pretty
Running around in New York City
Look in her eyes, she's a princess in disguise
Oh-ho, get me a pony
Oh-ho, get me a pony
Oh-ho, get me a pony
