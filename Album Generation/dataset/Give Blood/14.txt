I gave you all I had
I gave you good and bad
I gave it you just threw it back

We won't get on our knees
Don't make us do that please
We've been away and now we're back

Don't be too sure of that
What makes you sure of that?
You've been away: you can't come back

We walked away from you
We hurt you through and through
Oh honey give us one more chance

You sure are lucky girl
Luckiest in the world
You've been away, now you're back

We got down on our knees
And then we begged you please
We always knew you'd take us back
