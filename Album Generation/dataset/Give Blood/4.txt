Some kind of feelings
Don't have an end
Thirty situations come back
To haunt you again

Johnny you are irritating
Like dirt in me eyes
You've got you information
Unleashed

What's in it for me?

You're the spine, you are the backbone
This nation state
Fill up their heads with fear
Or fill their eyes with lust

God save you for getting dressed
'Cause in God we trust
There's a big house on the hill there
What's in it for us?

What's in it for us?
What's in it for us?
What's in it for?

Boxes that you're watching
Day and night
Caught us tagging in here
It's the end of me now

That you be selling amunitions
They backfired on you
You created a warzone
What's in it for you?

What's in it for you?
What's in it for you?
What you in it for?
