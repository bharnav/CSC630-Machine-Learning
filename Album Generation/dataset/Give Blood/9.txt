A hope that sailed straight into a halo of stone
You're so pretty in this light
In the hours between morning and midday
Its kinda like you're dying over again

[Chorus]
You know I trust you girl
Don't fuck me up
You've got the power to

The blood-red water in the sky outside is seeping blue
You're surrounded in its light
They don't know what I've found
As long as we stay out of sight

[Chorus]
