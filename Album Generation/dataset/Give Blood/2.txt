The most fun that I ever had
Was the night the gypsies came to town
Lit up these streets like they've never seen
And have not seen since

Up to that point we were country boys
Snorting speed and surfing cars
Chasing girls and bailing hay
And smashing up our lives

They put up a tent in the pasture fields
And Invited everybody round

I spent two long days and three whole nights
Losing my mind to all that's right
I spent three long nights and two whole days
Losing my mind on a MDMA
It was

After that everything changed
