Why don't you come 'round Saturday?
We'll go out drinking taking cocaine
Try to forget
Get high to forget

We'll go out dancing some place underground
Sweaty walls and sweaty eyes
Try to forget
Get high to forget

Put all past convictions to one side
Your court appearance ain't 'til Monday

I just want to remember you how you are
Old friend you're beautiful but your heart's on fire
Try to forget
You'll have months to regret

Put all past convictions to one side
Your court appearance ain't 'til Monday
?
Saturday night, I'm sure she won't mind
You'll always have a place to stay

Cheney, Cheney, Cheney, Cheney, Cheney
Cheney, Cheney
Stop being such a dick
