Ring-a-ding-ding, oh my head's in a spin
Now there's a cowboy in the court, he's got a monkey on a string
He's singing dance, dance, dance to the monkey macaroni
Had to get out now, it was making me horny

Spent all day trying to ease the pain......of learning. (Don't know the choruses)
Super skipper Sue, now tell me what can i do
I've got a hole in my pocket and a stone in my shoe
I've been-a walking all day and my limbs are so tired
Won't you put me to rest, put me tonight
