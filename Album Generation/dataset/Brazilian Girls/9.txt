This is real, this is glam
This is the real glam electro

Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance

Keep walking down the line
I am waiting for you
I will call to see where you could be

I remember when
I could hear the wind
This time, we will come away as one
As one Come away as one

I am waiting for you and I
To dance till the Morning Sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun

Dance, Dance This is real, this is glam
This is the real glam electro When you start to feel
Love is coming around again
Then you won't run away anymore

Dance Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun

Dance
Sun
Till the morning sun Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance till the morning sun
Dance
