Now that your leave is over
Let's down our drinks and say goodnight
To this illusion

Bell-bottom Casanova
The silhouettes that pass us by

Are ships in the night
Ships in the night
In the night, in the night

When you alight, mein Lieber
Whether its Hamburg or New york
I'll still be sleeping

Look in your wallet all you'll find
A little note I've left behind
Oh, I hope you don't mind

We're Ships in the night
Ships in the night
Ships in the night
In the night
