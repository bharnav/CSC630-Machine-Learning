She's a face in the crowd
Looking right through you
As if she knew you
Better than you know yourself
What does she know about the things that you know?
That you go through only in a day?

Pussy Pussy Pussy Marijuana
Pussy Pussy Pussy

Pussy Pussy Pussy

She caught you walking about in a frozen desert
From the tip of the iceberg, you slip and fall
Falling through the clouds
Of your fata morgana
In the lap of your mama you land
She'll understand

Pussy Pussy Pussy Marijuana

Pussy Pussy Pussy

If you start looking around you
You know there's no pretending
'Cause how you twist and bend it
She's the perfect tout
Leave everyone spellbound when she mixes and blends it
'Cause the message she's sending is:
She's ready to sell out
