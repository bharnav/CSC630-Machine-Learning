The Scary Tale on this day Leads us on
What can I say? How naïve, this cliché
The pulse goes on
The end we anticipate

Some story ends and hurray
Summer begins, what can I say
Call it nature, Call it Fate
How we love to exaggerate

Think of one of your on own reasons why
We are bound, yet alone, just passing by

All we have to give
All we have
All we have to forgive
Swaying to this song

Tonight

Think of one of your own recent tries
We are bound to forget in no time

Think of one of yours gone, for some time
We are to bound to return
Look into my eyes

All we have to give
All we have to forgive All we have to give
All we have
All we have to forgive
All we have, we have
