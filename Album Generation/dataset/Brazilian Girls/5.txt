How long can you be walking on eggshells
And breathe in thin air
Get yourself ready for departure when you're already there

Longer than the wall of china
Longer than longing for love
Longer than your panthomime when the audience is bored

How can you tip toe to the exit with your tapping shoes on?
Listen to yourself when your cell phone rings and the radio's on?

Longer than your hair in the 80's
Longer than the long run
Longer than the longest winter
Longer than long

How can you dance on the battlefield with your Sunday clothes on?
How long can you can you go along with this shit with a straight face on?

Longer than these walls of China
Longer than you know what
Longer than the weakest picture
Longer than long Come on So long
