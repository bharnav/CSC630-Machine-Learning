[Verse 1]
Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

[Verse 2]
Hey, blue
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

[Bridge]
Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it trough these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs

Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you

[Verse 3]
Blue, there is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me
