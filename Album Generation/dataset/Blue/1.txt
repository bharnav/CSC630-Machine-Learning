[Verse 1]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Verse 2]
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay, baby

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 3]
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 4]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues
