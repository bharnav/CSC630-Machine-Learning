[Verse 1]
Knock knock - are you alone?
No one's out here and I was not followed
Love, love - you're already home
Party's over and you don't look so good

[Chorus]
You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear
Please clear the area
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here right here
Right here right here

[Verse 2]
Low light, mercury morning
No need to stay as it's always "nothing"
But your eyes tell a whole other story
And I feel the weight of the world

[Verse 3]
You won't talk you won't talk
You won't try you won't try
Just move, it's too still in your sadness
Cry cry give up give up
It's okay it's okay
You've just got to trust me

[Chorus]
You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear
Please clear the area
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here right here
Right here right here

[Bridge]
Slowly slowly darling darling
Nobody means any more to me than you
If you're in if you're in, baby then I'm in
Into this with you always
Careful careful close to the edge there
You're scaring me
Fall into my arms
Away with it all
Fall, fall into love
Love

[Chorus]
You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear
Please clear the area
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here right here
Right here right here

[Chorus]
You find your way back down
Mmm, way back down
And I'll keep the area clear
So please clear the area
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here right here
Right here right here
