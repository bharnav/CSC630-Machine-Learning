[Verse 1]
Distant flickerings, greener scenery
This weather's bringing it all back again
Great adventures, faces in condensation
I'm going outside and take it all in

[Chorus 1]
You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

[Verse 2]
Wear a different pair, do something out of step
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flied

[Chorus 1]
You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

[Chorus 2]
Afraid to start
How can you lose? How can you lose?
Got your heart in a headlock
How can you lose? How can you lose?
I don't believe any of it
How can you lose?
You say too late to start
How can you lose? How can you lose?
With your heart in a headlock
How can you lose? How can you lose?
You know you're better than this
How can you lose?

[Bridge]
You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

[Bridge]
You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

[Interlude]
You know you're better than this

[Chorus 3]
Can't make a start
Got your heart in a headlock
No, I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

[Chorus 2]
Afraid to start
How can you lose? How can you lose?
Got your heart in a headlock
How can you lose? How can you lose?
I don't believe any of it
How can you lose?
You say too late to start
How can you lose? How can you lose?
With your heart in a headlock
How can you lose? How can you lose?
You know you're better than this
How can you lose?
