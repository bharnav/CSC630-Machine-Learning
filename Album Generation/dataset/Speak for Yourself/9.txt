[Chorus 1]
I am in love with you
I am in love with you baby
I am in love with you, yeah
Live for the moment

[Verse 1]
Right now another please
Right now another please, just like that
Like that another one babe
Kiss me for longer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh hey, baby don't you run away
Oh hey, baby don't you run away
Come here and finish what you started

[Chorus 2]
I am in love with you
I am in love with you baby
I am in love with you, yeah
At least for the moment

[Verse 3]
Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
So wet this fire dry

[Verse 4]
No don't get yourself in situations
No don't get yourself in situations
Darling, that you can't handle

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No, I don't mind if you forget yourself
No, I don't mind
Did you forget yourself, darling?

[Bridge]
Come on into my bed with me
Come on into my bed with me
You know you want to
Come on into my bed with me
Come on into my bed with me
You know you want to

[Chorus 3]
Iâ€™m not in love with you
I'm not in love with you, baby
I'm not in love with you, yeah

[Outro]
Not anymore
Not anymore
Not anymore
Not anymore
