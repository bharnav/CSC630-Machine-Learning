[Hook]
Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Verse 1]
Doing everything by halves
You've got a real flare with excuses
Meeting someone at the bar
Where loose ends still have uses

[Chorus 1]
It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
We're overrated anyway

[Hook]
Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Verse 2]
We're kissing without kissing
And got it down to a fine art
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky
But we grew up and wide apart
Tick-tock, tick-tock

[Verse 3]
Not now, not ever, no, it's never a good time
Tick-tock
How will the good times ever roll on?
Tick-tock
Comparing photos then and now, now and then
Just wondering wondering... where it all went wrong

[Chorus 2]
It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
Nothing to salvage anyway

[Bridge]
Want to? Oh
Need to? Oh
Try to? Oh
None of the above
Want to? Oh
Need to? Oh
Try to? Oh
None of the above
Want to? Oh
Need to? Oh
Try to? Oh
None of the above
Want to? Oh
Need to? Oh

[Interlude]
Liar!
Liar!

[Hook]
Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Chorus 1]
It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
We're overrated anyway

[Chorus 2]
It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
Nothing to salvage anyway

[Outro]
Liar!
Liar!
