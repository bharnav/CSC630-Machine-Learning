[Verse 1]
Inside-out
Upside-down, twisting beside myself
Stop that now
'Cause you and I were never meant to meet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think you'd better leave, it's not safe in here
I feel a weakness coming on

[Verse 2]
Alright then alright then
I could keep your number for a rainy day
That's where this ends
No mistakes, no misbehaving

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was doing so well, could we just be friends?
I feel a weakness coming on

[Chorus 1]
It's not meant to be like this, not what I planned at all
I don't want to feel like this, yeah
No, it's not meant to be like this, not what I planned at all
I don't want to feel like this, so that makes it all your fault

[Verse 3]
Inside-out
Upside-down, twisting beside myself
Stop that now
You're as close as it gets without touching me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh now, don't make it harder than it already is
Mmm, I feel a weakness coming on

[Chorus 1]
It's not meant to be like this, not what I planned at all
I don't want to feel like this, yeah
No, it's not meant to be like this, not what I planned at all
I don't want to feel like this, so that makes it all your fault

[Bridge]
Big trouble, losing control
Primary resistance at a critical low
On the, on the double gotta get a hold
Point of no return, one second to go

[Breakdown]
No response on any level, red alert, this vessel's under siege
Total overload, all systems down, they've got control
There's no way out, we are surrounded
Give in, give in and relish every minute of it

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Freeze or make it forever
I feel a weakness coming on

[Chorus 2]
It's not meant to be like this, not what I planned at all
I don't want to feel like this, yeah
No, it's not meant to be like this, it's just what I don't need
Why make me feel like this?
It's definitely all your fault

[Outro]
Feel like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la - it's all your fault
Feel like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la - it's all your fault
Feel like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la - it's all your fault
Feel like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la - it's all your fault
