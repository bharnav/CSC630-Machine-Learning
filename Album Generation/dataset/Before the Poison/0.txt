When you're not by my side
The world's in two and I'm a fool
When you're not in my sight
Then everything just fades from view
The mystery of love belongs to you
The mystery of love belongs to you
Tell me, have you changed your mind?
Am I a fool because of you?
Tell me, do we still have time
To make this wrong somehow be right?
The mystery of love belongs to you
The mystery of love belongs to you
Show me sweetness, show me summer skies
Show me how to make this wrong seem right
Show me laughter in your pale blue eyes
Tell me, tell me have you changed your mind?
