Desperanto spoken here, today I hear it everywhere
It is the language of despair, it's in your nails and it's in your hair
It's in your mouth instead of air, it's in your house, it's in your heart
It's in your mind, it's everywhere, it's in your heart, it's in your heart
It's in your blood, it's in your prayer, c'mon baby, come over here
It's in your mouth, in your mouth, in your mouth, in your mouth
It's in your mouth instead of air, it's in your breath, it's in your blood
It's in your heart, it's in your blood, it's in your heart, it's everywhere
Everybody loves my baby, everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby now
I know baby, you don't care to speak in desperanto here
And I know you'd never dare to speak the language of despair
C'mon baby, get over here, c'mon baby, get over here
It's in your mouth, it's in your hair, it's in your tiny little prayer
It's in your tiny little prayer, it's in your tiny little prayer
C'mon baby get over here, c'mon baby get over here
It's in your heart, it's in your heart, it's in your heart, it's everywhere
It's in your mind, it's in your heart, it's in your heart, it's everywhere
Everybody loves my baby, everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby now
The desperanto, they are broken here, broken darlin' by despair
The rain it speaks, the wind, the air today I hear it everywhere
It's in your tiny little prayer, it's in your tiny little prayer
It's in your breath, it's in your tears this has been going on for years
It's in your mouth, in your mouth, in your mouth, in your mouth
C'mon baby, come over here, it's in your mouth, it's in your mouth
It's in your blood, it's everywhere, it's in your mouth, it's in your mouth
In your blood, it's everywhere, it's in your mouth, in your mouth and
Everybody loves my baby, everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby now
Everybody loves my baby, everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby now
