[Verse 1]
Charming, someone to fear
Handsome, very much here
Evil, dancing through fire
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

[Verse 2]
Something to charm
Danger, someone to harm
Falling into the mire
Climbing, higher and higher

[Verse 3]
Someone to fear
Handsome, very much here
Evil, dancing through fire
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

[Verse 4]
Ivory tower
Longing for something now
Waiting, hour after hour
Give me some of your power

[Verse 5]
Citadel, a prison of sorts
Only the rich make the laws
Using repression and force
Whore of Babylon, City of Quartz

[Verse 6]
Someone to fear
Hidden and very much here
Hatred summoned so near
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear
