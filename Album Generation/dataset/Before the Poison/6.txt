There is a ghost
And it goes out
On the land
On the land
It's lifted up
It feels and flows
On many hands
On many hands
Oh, my lover
Oh, my lover
Never was there another
Where has my loverman gone
There is a dream
You've had before
And forgot many times
So many times
When you remember who I am
Just call
When you remember who I am
Just call
When you remember who I am
Just call
When you remember who I am
There is a tree
But its leaves have gone
For what it seem
It stands alone
Oh, my lover
Oh, my lover
Gonna, gonna find another
Where has my loverman gone
Away, away
Across the land
Across the land
Across the land
