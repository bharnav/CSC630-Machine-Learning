[Verse 1]
Heard from friends of mine
You been telling lies
How I was wrapped up in you

[Chorus]
But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
I never wanted you that bad
Because I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to
Go and fool after
We had got along so fine?

[Chorus]
But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
There is nothing strange to me
Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes
Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

[Verse 3]
I hope you are proud of
All your chasing round
Thinking I was alone all night

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, baby why did you have to go fool around
After we got along so fine
I knew you was telling lies and telling jive
Yes I did
We got along so fine
But I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was talking jive
I could see it in your eyes
