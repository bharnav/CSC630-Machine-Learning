[Intro]
What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
It seems easy to me that everything can be alright

[Chorus]
What a shame
They always want to start a fight
What a shame
They always want to start a fight

[Verse 1]
Well it scares me so
I could sleep in the shelter all night
Well alright

[Chorus]
What a shame
You all heard what I said
What a shame
Y'all heard what I said

[Outro]
You might wake up in the morning
And find your poor self dead
