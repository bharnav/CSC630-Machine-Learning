[Intro]
I say hey, Mona
Oh, Mona
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mona
Oh, Mona

[Chorus][x2]
I tell you Mona what I want to do
I will build a house next door to you
Can I see you sometimes?
We can blow kisses through the blinds
Yeah can I out come out on the front
And listen to my heart go bumped bump
I need you baby that is no lie
Without your love I would surely die
I say hey, Mona
Oh, Mona
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mona
Oh, Mona
I say hey, hey Mona
Oh, Mona
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mona
Oh, Mona
