[Verse 1]
Lord I swear the perfume you wear
Was made out of turnip greens
And every time I kiss you girl
It tastes like pork and beans
Even though you are wearing them
Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step
You been walking through the cotton fields

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
Every time you monkey child
You take my breath away
And every time you move like that
I got to get down and pray

[Verse 2]
Do you know that dress of yours
Was made out of fiberglass?
And every time you move like that
I got to go to Sunday mass

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
Oh, you are so down home girl

[Verse 3]
I am going to take you to the muddy river
And push you in
Just to watch the water roll on
Down your velvet skin
I am going to take you back to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
I am going to watch you do the second line
With an umbrella in your hand

[Chorus]
Oh, you are so down home girl
I am with you baby
You are so down home
Ow! Yeah, too much
Out off sight
You are so down home girl
