[Verse 1]
I bought a brand new air mobile
It was custom made
It was a Flight Deville
With an outboard motor
And some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing

[Chorus]
Now you cannot catch me
No, baby, you cannot catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know I am gone like a cool breeze

[Verse 2]
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly cause of drizzling' showers
Up come a flattop he was moving up with me
Then come sailing goodbye
In a little old supped up mini
I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll
Moaning sirens, was the state patrol
So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Flying with my baby last Saturday night
Was no gray cloud floating in sight
Big full moon shining up above
Cuddle up honey be my love
Sweetest little thing that I ever seen
I am going to name you Maybelline
Flying with all the things set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two, three hours passing by
Altitude dropped to 505
Fuel consumption way too fast
Let us get on home before we run out of gas

[Chorus]
