[Verse 1]
Pain in my heart
Treating me poor
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart
Will not let me sleep
Where can my baby be
Lord, where is she?

[Bridge]
And one day
My days are getting tough
Will  you come back, come back, come back, baby
Lord

[Chorus]
Pain in my heart
Will not let me be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I wake up restless night in misery
Lord
Will somebody stop this pain
Lord, one day
My days are getting tough
Will you love me, love me, love me, baby

[Chorus]
Pain in my heart
Pain in my heart
Somebody stop this
Pain in my heart
It is killing me baby
This pain in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Pain in my heart
This pain in my heart
