[Verse 1]
I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home
And I believe I've got a message
For every woman and every man here tonight
That ever needed somebody to love
Someone to stay with them all the time
When they're up and when they're down
You know, sometimes you get what you want
And then you go and lose what you have
And I believe every woman and every man here tonight
Listen to my song and it save the whole world. Listen to me

[Bridge]
Everybody wants somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Someone to love
Someone to kiss
Sometime to miss, now
Someone to squeeze
Someone to please
And I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you

[Verse 2]
Oh, sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I kind of get a little little mad
I need you you you
To see me through, babe
When the sun go down
Is nobody else around

That's when I need you baby
That's when I say I love you[x2]

[Verse 3]
When the sun goes down
Isn’t nobody else around
That's when I'm all by myself
That's when I need your loving darling
That's when I need you so bad
You're the one I really need bad [???]

To see me through baby
In the morning time too
When the sun goes down
Isn’t nobody else around
I need your loving so bad
Everybody needs somebody to love
I'm not afraid to be by myself but I just need to be somebody to love

[Verse 4]
