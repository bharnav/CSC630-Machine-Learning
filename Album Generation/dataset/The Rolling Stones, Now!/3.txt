[Verse 1]
There have been so many girls that I have known
I have made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the street
She is all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet
But, she will never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone

[Chorus]
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone
What is different about her? I do not really know
No matter how I try I just cannot make her cry
Because she will never break, never break
Never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

[Verse 2]
Do not keep on looking that some old way
If you try acting sad, you will only make me glad
Better listen little girl
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
Because she will never break, never break
Never break, never break
This heart of stone

[Chorus]
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone
What is different about her? I do not really know
No matter how I try I just cannot make her cry
Because she will never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

[Outro]
Oh, no, no, you'll never break this heart of stone darling
No, no, this heart of stone
You will never break it darling
You will not break this heart of stone
Oh no no no
You better go
You better go home
Cause you will, you will never break this heart of stone
