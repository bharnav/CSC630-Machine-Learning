[Verse 1]
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That’s the way the road dogs do it
Light ‘til dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Bridge]
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

[Chorus]
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride
