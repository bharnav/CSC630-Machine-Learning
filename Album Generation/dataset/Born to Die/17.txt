[Verse 1]
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It’s always been, so it’s no surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on baby
Oooh oooh  yeah

[Verse 2]
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Bridge]
Drugs suck it up like vanilla icys
Don’t treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck
Diamantes ices
Oh come on, come on
Ooooooh, ooooooh, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
Come on baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on baby
Oooh oooh
(My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola)
Oooh oooh aaaahh
(My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola)
Oooh oooh oooh
(My pussy tasther side
