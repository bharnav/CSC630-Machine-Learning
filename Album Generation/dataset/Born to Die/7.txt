[Verse 1]
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can’t bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

[Verse 2]
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A., and it's paradise
I've finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

[Bridge]
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
I've finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
