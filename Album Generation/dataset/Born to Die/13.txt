[Verse 1]
Would you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know it's you that I adore?
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high
Shining like a God
Can't believe I caught you, and so
Look at what I bought
Not a second thought - oh, Romeo

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet
I don't care what they say about me
What they say about me
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say!)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down
