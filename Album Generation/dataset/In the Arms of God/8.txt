[Incomprehensible]

Some people know the order
They're hard to find
And some people roll you over
And then they blow your mind
Some have the will to occupy

Some people can't remember
But that's nothin' new
And some people kill for lovin'
Includin' me and you
Well, I guarantee your time is due
And I guarantee your time is due

Blackfire, illuminate the chosen few
Liars, assassinate what's come for you

Distant winds spread salvation
Beat you down with shame
Once redeemed and gone forever
Never be unchained
The future steals what once remained

Some people speak the truth now
But there's no one else to blame
Then they try to beat you down, boy
If you don't do the same
Choose me or choose eternal flame
Choose me or choose eternal flame

Blackfire, illuminate the chosen few
Liars, assassinate what's come for you

Beware, backsliders
You need to know just why we were
'Cause I might be losin' your mind

Deception of your mind
Chasing what once was inside
Onward for the truth absurd
I think we'll find and know just why
We were alone, alone, alone

Nobody knows the answer
They never question why
And blind faith will lead you nowhere
It happens every time
Spirit shines and now it's time to die

Light's dim and you can't remember
You pray, you're homeward bound
Kill the dream, forget the memories
That was so profound
The revolution dies without a sound
The revolution dies without a sound

Blackfire, illuminate the chosen few
Liars, assassinate what's come for you

Beware, backslider
You need to know just why we were
'Cause you might be losing your mind
