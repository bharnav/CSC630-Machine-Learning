Rising sun revealed an angel
My burning heart was overthrown
She came to take away this pain, boy
But what I felt was never shown
So much left unknown

I found the road but I can't turn back
Overlooked out of time
So much left behind

Drifted away reality, follow the heart no better
Future dreams will never be, never means forever
And the path is hard to find, when there's
So much left behind

So much left behind

Beauty flows just like a river
Drowns my soul, purifies
Drift away into forgiveness
Now I'm left to wonder why
No more tears to cry

Words to you were long overdue
Stormy skies are overhead
So much left unsaid

Drifted away reality, follow the heart no better
Future dreams will never be, never means forever
And the path is hard to find, when there's
So much left behind, yeah

So much left behind

Gonna' keep on rollin'
Weâ€™ve gotta move on
Gonna' keep on rollin'
(gotta move on)
Gonna' keep on rollin'
Gonna' keep on moving
(gotta move on)
