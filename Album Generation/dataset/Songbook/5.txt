[Chorus 1]
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Verse 1]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Chorus 2]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die

[Verse 2]
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look and see

[Bridge]
And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
Because you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I am glad

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Ooooh[repeat until fade]
