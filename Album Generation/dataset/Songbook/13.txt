[Verse]
I come from far away
My boots don’t know this ground
But they know it’s real
It doesn’t take too long
For this road to become
A battlefield
And before I let one more fire go out
Understand that I won’t give one inch of ground
From beneath yours and my feet
Whatever the price happens to be
I may not be the keeper of the flame
But I am the keeper
Beauty and truth collide
Where love meets genocide
Where laughter meets fear
Confusion all around
And as I try to feed these mouths
That have never known singing
And before I let one more tear hit the ground
I will be the one standing between you and the sound
Of the rounds echoing out
Out of the dark
The smoke and the spark
Aimed at the heart of the flame
I am the keeper ooooh
I cannot see the light
At the end of the tunnel tonight
My eyes are weary
And before I let one more life get erased
From the ashes I will rise for you and the ghosts
Of the names the faces and frames
The love and the pain for you I remain
Though I’m not worthy of being
The keeper of the flame
I am the keeper yeahhhhh
I am the keeper
