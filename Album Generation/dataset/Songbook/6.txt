[Verse 1]
You and I went gently, you and I went far and wide
You and I went deeply, you and I went for a ride
But somewhere in the ashes of this burning lovers' game
Somehow you decided you would find another flame

[Chorus]
And as you lay sleeping with your eyes softly shut
I'll be cleaning my gun[x2]
When heaven or hell takes this life
I'll be done

[Verse 2]
You never lied to me, never said you'd be around for long
But somehow I believed that you would be my only one
Because you know where I'm going, and
You know where I'm coming from
But now this train is slowly coming to its final destination

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And as you lay sleeping with your eyes softly shut
No it ain't me that you're dreaming of
Mother always told me love would save me from myself
Daddy always said that love would take me straight to hell
Sometimes they were right and sometimes they were oh so wrong

[Outro]
Because I'm cleaning my gun
Cleaning my gun
When heaven or hell takes this life
I'll be done
Cleaning my gun[x2]
When heaven or hell takes this life
I'll be done
When heaven or hell takes this life
I'll be done[x2]
