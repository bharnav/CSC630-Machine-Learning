[Verse 1]
As I fall I leave this scar upon the sky
A simple note for you, I'll wait for your reply
And in your answer I'll regain my will to try

[Chorus]
So hover in the diving light
We will rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun one more time
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky
And over the dumbstruck world we will run

[Verse 2]
In these hills they wash the golden grains away
To the valley under all of this I lay
And may you dig me out unearthed and saved

[Chorus]
So hover in the diving light
We will rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun one more time
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky
And over the dumbstruck world we will run

[Bridge]
We can rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun
A blood red feather leaves a scar upon my hand
No longer scrounded like a painted bird on a fan

[Chorus]
So hover in the diving light
We will rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun one more time
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky
And over the dumbstruck world we will run

[Outro]
We can rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun
Out of the arms of the sun
Out of the arms of the sun
