[Verse 1]
You call me a dog well that's fair enough
Because it ain't no use to pretend you're wrong
When you call me out I can't hide anymore
I have no disguise you can't see through
Well you say it's bad luck
To have fallen for me
Well what can I do to make it good for you
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold

[Chorus]
But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

[Verse 2]
You call me a dog
You tell me I'm low because I've slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers & wolves
You threw me out because I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And when its my time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone
You call me a dog well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
Bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and you drag me along

[Chorus]

[Outro]
But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone
You call me a dog
