[Verse 1]
I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in a parking lot
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
I like driving backwards in the fog
Because it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus]
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget

[Verse 2]
I like gypsy moths and radio talk
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
Because it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bend and shape me
I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly
Like never before
Calm and sleeping
We won't stir up the past
So discreetly
We won't look back

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
Because it doesn't remind me of anything
I like playing in the sand what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything
