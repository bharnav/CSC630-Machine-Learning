[Chorus]
As hope and promise fade
And the sun forgets to rise
I’m lonely and I’m thirsty
But it’s better I stay dry
No more than two drinks away
From crying

[Verse 1]
Stare into the glass
And wait for the time to pass
And thank you for the offer
But you know I must decline

[Bridge]
Never more than two drinks away
From crying

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time
When I could hold my head up high
My life laid out before me
Rivers flow with wine
I had my love beside me
And everything was fine
But now the ride is over
It’s hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
As hope and promise fade
And midnight turns to day
Well I’m lonely and I’m thirsty
But I can no more tell a lie
Never more than two drinks away
From crying

[Outro]
From crying[x3]
