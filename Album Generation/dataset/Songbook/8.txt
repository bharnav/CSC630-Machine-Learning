[Verse 1]
She motioned to me
That she wanted to leave
And go somewhere warm
Where we'd be alone
I do not know, what's going on
But I'm guessing it's an all night thing

[Chorus]
If it's an all night thing
Nobody is going to make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offense
And if it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling to the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing

[Verse 2]
I walked along, I was feeling at ease
And falling like rain into her scheme
She won't let on what that will be
But I'm guessing
I'm guessing it's an all night thing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If it's an all night thing[repeat until fade]
