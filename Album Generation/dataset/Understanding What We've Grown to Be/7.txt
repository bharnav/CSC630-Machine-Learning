Why have we been so reckless?
Acting like we don't know right from wrong
And it's not like we didn't expect this
When we've really known all along
It could only be so long until we really felt it
We've been digging our way down instead of digging our way out

We can't keep living the way that we have been
It'll catch up to us and destroy everything else as well
I know we were never perfect
But it was more than worth it
And we don't deserve it
The strain that give with the way that we live

It's taken too long for this realization
But I'm hoping we will have so many more
I never want to stop trying to make things better
No matter how good I think they are

Why have we been so complacent?
Accepting everything as good enough
With all the effort we never put in
Convenience was the priority to us
Taking the first step is the hardest part
After we've been digging our way down instead of digging our way out

We can't keep living the way that we have been
It'll catch up to us and destroy everything else as well
I know we were never perfect
But it was more than worth it
And we don't deserve it
The strain that give with the way that we live
It's taken too long for this realization

We're all sorry for the lost time
But will we take a step in a new direction?
I don't want to waste any more time
But I can't do this without you
Will you take my hand? (Will you take my hand?)

We can't keep living the way that we have been
It'll catch up to us and destroy everything else as well

We can't keep living the way that we have been (that we have been)
It'll catch up to us and destroy everything else as well

I know we were never perfect
But it was more than worth it
And we don't deserve it
The strain that give with the way that we live
