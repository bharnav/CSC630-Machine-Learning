Woah...

I've been going down this path since this choice was mine
Vices and curses have all defined
The man I've become, the man I could be
Not in my eyes, but my conscious sees

This world is filled with selfishness
Violence and chaos created from it
It's hard to remember the person you are
The further you get from the start

Everyone gets lost sometimes
Stand up you may find
Its not as hard as you think
Cause no one is born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out
Born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out
Don't let it hold you down
Be true to who you are!

Sometimes in this life the world may not be with you
Sometimes you must fight yourself leave your fear behind you
You can't feel on top of the world with the weight of the world on your shoulders
You can't feel on top of the world, with the weight of the world...

Everyone gets lost sometimes
Stand up, you may find
Its not as hard as you think
Cause no one is born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out
Born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out
Don't let it hold you down
Be true to who you are!

The King Of Silence!
The King Of Silence!

Cause no one is born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out!
Born the King Of Silence
So choose your voice
So speak up, don't back down
Don't wear that crown
Let your voice scream out
Don't let it hold you down
Be true to who you are!

Be true!
Yeah!
