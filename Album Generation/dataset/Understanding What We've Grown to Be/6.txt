I'll cast the first stone (first stone, first stone)
I'll cast the first stone (first stone, first stone)
Just to take the attention away from me
Anything to protect my reputation
Because I feel like that's all I have, all I know

What do I look like in their eyes?
Is it something desirable?
Or am I nothing?

What do I look like in their eyes?
What do I look like in their eyes?

I'll cast the first stone
Like I am the last one to blame
Just to shift their condemning eyes away
I'll cast the first stone
Like I am the last one to blame
Just to break their denouncing gaze

Why should I wait to hear their verdict?
Why do I care about who they think I should be?
Why should I wait to hear their verdict?
Why do I care about who they think I should be?

I have been bending over backwards for every reason but the right one
I have placed value on things that don't deserve it

Now what do I look like to those who matter?
Why did I waste all this time on the temporary?
It's too easy to take the wrong things to heart
Especially from those who seem to have misplaced their own

I won't say that I'll never cast another stone
Or that I am the last one to blame
But I want to stop living like anyone else's opinion
Of who I should be is a regulation in my life

I shouldn't forget there's a difference
Between living for other's approval and just living for others
