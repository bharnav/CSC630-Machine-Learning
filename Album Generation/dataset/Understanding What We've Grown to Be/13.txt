I've led a horse to water
But he turned and ran as soon as I turned my back
It seems as if the way here
Wore worse on me than it did on him

I feel like my words have only given way
To brief intentions but no intent for action
I've waited, I've asked, I've hoped
For you to show me I've thought wrong

Prove to me that I've thought wrong
And it will fill me further than being right
I wish you'd prove to me that you want to
Live life as much as I want you to

I swear my hopes are selfless in this
I only want you to feel whole
I swear my hopes are selfless in this
I only want you to feel whole
But I can't make your decisions for you
But I can't make your decisions for you

I feel like my words have only given way
To brief intentions but no intent for action
I've waited, I've asked
I've hoped for you to show me I've though wrong

I've led a horse to water
But he turned and ran as soon as I turned my back
It seems as if the way here
Wore worse on me than it did on him

I can't make your decisions for you
I can only be a guide
I can't make your decisions for you
I can only encourage action

I hope that my words have only given way
To real intentions with pure intent for action
I've waited, I've asked, I've hoped
Now show me that I've thought wrong
