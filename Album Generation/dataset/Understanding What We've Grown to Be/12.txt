I just want to feel something
I just want to feel something new

I feel like I'm stuck in this routine
Every day is decided before I wake
Every dream that I've dreamt I don't want to chase
All the people I've met, I start forgetting their names

The whole day just blurs into one picture
And months later, there are collections of copies
Everything looks the same
Everything feels the same

I feel like I'm stuck in this routine
Every day is decided before I wake
Every dream that I've dreamt I don't want to chase
All the people I've met, I start forgetting their names

And they forget mine and I give them no blame
I'm so disconnected I don't feel the same
That I did when we started
When I knew what my heart held

So what does my heart hold now?
Is it something else or am I too blind to see I'm still the same?
I know I still hold close the same things I always have
But this world crashes down on me and I can only think about the weight
Instead of those who were always there to help me hold it up

You have always been there to help me hold up this earth
Every time it weighs me down

I need to break out of this routine
Everyday is decided when I say
Every dream that I've dreamt I am gonna chase

All the people I've met in every different place
I hold them all close and support their dreams
I feel so connected, now I am the same
That I was when we started
When I knew what my heart held

Everything looks the same
Everything feels the same
You've always been there to help me hold up this earth
