[Chorus][x2]
She says she's babysitting tonight
She says come over, it's alright
On the couch with my special one
But don't tell me what we won't have fun[x3]

[Bridge]
Yeah, you know we'll have the TV on
Aren't we glad that the folks are gone[x2]

She went to see if the kids were asleep
She says they're quiet expect for one little creep
We can't start kissing and I'll tell you why
We can't start kissing because the kid's a little spy

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
All right
