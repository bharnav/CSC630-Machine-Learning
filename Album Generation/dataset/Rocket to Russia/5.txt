[Pre-Chorus]
Well the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now they got their surfboards
And they're going to the discotheque a- go-go
But she just couldn't stay she had to break away
Well New York City really has is all oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus][x3]
Sheena is a punk rocker[x2]
Sheena is a punk rocker now

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x6]
