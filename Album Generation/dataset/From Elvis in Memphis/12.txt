[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
(With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
(With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Bridge]
Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say

[Outro]
Don't you know
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby...
