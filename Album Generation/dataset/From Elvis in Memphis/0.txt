[Verse 1]
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carrying on

[Chorus]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shop, Shop, Shop, Shop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look

[Verse 2]
The ash trays are all full of ashes
The floor needs a touch of the mop
There's a man downstairs with a long bushy hair
He said your party was a three day rock

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby, if you ever loved me
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law
Well, a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie
And trees won't grow in Arkansas

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carrying on

[Chorus][x2]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shop, Shop, Shop, Shop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shop, Shop
