I find I'm humming the songs of Paul Simon
In my cap and raincoat
Are we just a pile of hearts
With the staggered starts and bones that wander
Over roads have been used
Now the highways are bruised and cars get tired
So I could be jobless and nameless
Well thank goodness for singing in the city

We could be twins
Everybody looks like my friends

I find I'm naming the trees as we're passing
Like Richard, king of captains
All the things that we make
With the functions that fake us out with fiction

Until we are twins
And everyone looks like my friends

We could be twins
Everyone looks all pretend

We could be twins
Everyone looks like my friends

Yeah we could be twins
Everyone looks so pretend

Yeah we could be twins
Everyone looks like my friends

And we could be twins
We could be twins
