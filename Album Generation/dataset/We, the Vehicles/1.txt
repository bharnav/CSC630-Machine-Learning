If you drink enough water will i fade
When i'm out of your system forget things that i said
Then the scenery changes
Cars have no remorse they take the world by force
We wish we could travel so relentlessly
Even in our sleep we surrender

You can do anything
I should be so lucky
Tearing up the oxygen to find one another

So now i chase my bags someday they'll take me home
My clothes are worn so thin they accent my bones
The sleep i've lost could rest me
But clocks keep slippery time
They paint the salt stained lines
Of the best and the worst and the maritimes
When your eyes are off me, i'm alone

They could be anywhere
I should be so lucky
Tearing up the oxygen to find one another
