We are lost in the folds of one another's topcoats
And medicine makes us move inside a little slower
And in those hours nobody knows our ends or beginnings
The way I've come to ignore we keep colliding faces

Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering

I confess I've overdressed the mess I've made of my life
But isn't is so unlike us, come now
Frankly, Jeremy

Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering

Hell bent stomachs planning greater insurrection
Strange speech dirty human elements to question
The broken car parts in enemy desires

Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering

Are we strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering
