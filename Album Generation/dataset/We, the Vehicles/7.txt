Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't say you don't love me
My beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beating heart could stop
This hemisphere in your company for forever
Or for now

And don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't say you don't need me
My limbs are hinged on that responsibility
And I know, I, I know I need to be lucky
Because the day is too short to become any good

There's no night to fall in
Where the sirens calling
We are up all hours

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't say you don't love me
My beating heart would stop
This hemisphere in your company for forever
Because the day is too short to become any good

There's no night to fall in
Where the sirens calling
We are up all hours

Here caught in our jackets
Our primitive clothing
There are burdens extending around us now

But I would ride my bicycle
Into a silver stone wall
There are bodies extending around us all

There's no night to fall in
Where the sirens calling
We are up all hours

And there's no night to fall in
Where the sirens calling
We are up all hours

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't say you don't
