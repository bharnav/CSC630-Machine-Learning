I think we can fly and swallow fire
Blow smoke and hold our breath for as long as it takes
Every hello is goodbye
As we exchange strangers and lies
For estranged lovers and time all love ones get held up
So i can stop running and the air can hum
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
By the infinite parade of punk rock t-shirts on
When you can't break through
With the one that you want

If we survive, are we free of the dumb luck
That surrounds us and we get stuck between the places i messed up
So i can stop running and the air can hum
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
By the infinite parade of punk rock t-shirts on
When you can't break through
With the one that you want
No you can't you can not know you can't
You can not
Should i feel flattered that you hate everything but me
When you can't break through
With the one that you want
No you can't, you can not know
