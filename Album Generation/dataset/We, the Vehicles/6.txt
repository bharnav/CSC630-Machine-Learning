Young alumni
Dance the night to pieces
Wearing all your panic inside out
And then to have someone like you
Like you

Made of broken glass and famous haircuts
We see your heartbeat in a cup of tea
The morning scratched with static loud
We've worn our hesitations out
We're made of destinations now

But love is no big deal
It's falling you feel

Young alumni
Modern cocktail drinkers
Strappy shoes don't match the Thursday drunks
Phones will come alive
Cause they are tired of being tied inside the night
And now the future's wired

But love is no big deal
The falling you feel

Love is no big deal
The falling you feel
