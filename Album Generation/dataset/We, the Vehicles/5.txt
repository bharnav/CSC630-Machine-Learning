Men in white undershirts tend to their endings
Get as tired as the suburbs that they're defending
We were dying to get out

God knows our neighbors, walks under the floorboards
Heckles with suggestion that we're all souls
But he's sold out

No one will remember you tonight or ever

In the maze of barns we search the silos
Is it so strange that we find no islands?
We are exposed

We see some company holding their horses
Continents are everywhere of course and
Nobody can be alone

No one will remember you tonight or ever here
No one will remember you tonight or ever

Goodbye means nothing
Words that we are after often
And it just blows the dust around until we settle down

Nature is bitter, wants us to be together
Kicks up the wind until I see you better
It feathers your hair

Bones get broken, our skin turns into leather
Naturally it is a disaster
But is it unfair

No one will remember you tonight or ever here
No, no one will remember you tonight or ever
No one will remember, no one will remember
No one will remember, no one will remember
