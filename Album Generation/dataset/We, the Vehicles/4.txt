There is ice inside the hourglass
Frozen, we are statues in our own secret pose
Between you and me, there are scratches in the quiet
If we turned out the lights then we'd really know

There's a record playing somewhere down the hall
We are caught inside it, bouncing off the walls
We dont think we need it, we know

All the days are just packed
And we're asleep in the trees
We could be blowing in the wind
That's why we come from all over
To find the crowd and share a common heart beat
Beat aloud

There's a record playing somewhere down the hall
We are caught inside it, bouncing off the walls
We don't think we own it, we know

But chances are the day will come
When you are caught alone
You were warned

We don't think we think so, we know
