I am you in me
Our panoramic eyes
They don’t focus
So they become homeless

No, my clothes don’t change
My blood’s the same
I’d chase you straight through heaven
To keep your name

Food and water dissolve
Into energy and light revolves
Sure the room is alive for an evening

With wine and hurricanes
The country’s quiet, though bombs remain
It’s scary
Your body it dares me

Protein and poison we won’t be again

I am you in me
Our panoramic eyes
They don’t focus
So they become homeless

Now my clothes don’t change
My blood’s the same
I’d chase you straight through heaven
To keep your name

Protein and poison we won’t be again
Protein and poison we won’t be again
Protein and poison we won’t be again
Protein and poison we won’t be again
