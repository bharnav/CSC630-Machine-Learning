Daij≈çbu! Zenbu umaku iku yo!

Ballads laugh at everyone
Worse than silence is their song
And you are too far away to love

Shortened by the blasphemy
When the sun would warm the sea
The Canary Islands are chasing me
We are powerful despite our injuries

We've got to swim out away from the sinking
It's pulling everybody down and everybody
And it's a sin to know
That we are powerful

Blessings always beg for calm
In spite of their silvery arms
We aren't sure but we always want
We are powerful despite our injuries
