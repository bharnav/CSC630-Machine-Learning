Sloth is the enemy of greatness
Reflection a scalpel to my mind
We strive as you leisurely criticize
A free ride 'til you find that you've dug your own grave
Lie by lie

Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan

You've dug your own grave
With your spite
You've dug your own grave
Lie by lie

A cancer that needs to be cut out
Sweet slander the razor to your throat
Trim the fat
A loose end to be tied up and cast aside
Left to find that you've dug your own grave
With your spite

Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan

Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan

A relentless imposition by a self-fulfilling travesty
From one who is just rotting there
In slut's wool and zero history
Aesthetic condemning
Erratic condescending

An empty barrel always makes the most noise
And I begin to feel my hands
My hands around your throat
Your throat!

Erratic condescending

You've dug your own grave
With your spite
You've dug your own grave
Lie by lie

Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan

Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan

You've dug your own grave
You've dug your own grave
The number six
Leviathan

You've dug your own grave
Your running mouth
You've dug your own grave
With poison words
You've dug your own grave
Will be your wrath
The number six
Leviathan
