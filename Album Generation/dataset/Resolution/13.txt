I saw the world through the lens of a pinhole camera
I saw nothing
I was blind
In between a black hole and supernova is where you'll find me
Imploding and expanding simultaneously, no longer alive

I've been running away for so long
When I finally caught myself
There wasn't much left
The script's last page is blank
And the medicine is gone...

A sick bastard
A twister of dark matter
On a heavier trip than you can comprehend
A tornado
Trying to mend the life that's shattered
Waiting for nothing to begin

A fine line, my insides are turning out

King me is killing me
King me is killing me

I keep walking past the places I was born in
And now the faces are blank, shiny, and dead
I don't recognize a thing, I can't recall them
A closed book, that I can never, never read again

A flat line, my insides are turning out
Now the lights fade, this final war starts now

King me is killing me
King me is killing me
King me is killing me
King me is killing me

Killing me!

All of that is ending now, for I have arisen
Survived myself somehow, dead and imprisoned
I'm fighting to live, if I aim to see the day
I swear I'll never sleep again, I am no man's slave

I wanted the fog to lift, but I was living in a cloud
Nostalgia is grinding the life from today
The present always dies in future memories
And king me is killing me
Cut wide open and bleeding to death for all to see...

King me is killing me
King me is killing me
King me is killing me
King me is killing me

He's killing me
He won't kill me
I won't let him killing me
He won't kill me!
