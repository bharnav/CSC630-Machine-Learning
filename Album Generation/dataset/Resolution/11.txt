I've held the hand of God
And I've sang the Devil's song
And when it comes my time
No tears are gonna fall
But some will light the fire
And some will mourn the one
Left longing for the ire
Of their departed son

Oh lord have mercy, thank God you're gone
Here's to the end, thank God you're gone

They finally shoved you in the box
They could never fit you in
An empty cell forever locked
So much for best intentions
But some will load the gun
And some will hone the knife
Some will raise the fist
As they recall your life

Oh lord have mercy, thank God you're gone
Here's to the end, thank God you're gone

We've waited for so long
Waited for so long
Thank God you're gone
You're gone

I've held the hand of God
And I've sang the Devil's song
You'll never erase the past or regain what's lost
You're finally gone

Oh lord have mercy, thank God you're gone
Here's to the end, thank God you're gone
Thank God you're gone
So far gone
