There's nothing new under the gun
Cognitive dissonance
Wallow in sardonic fear while your will breaks like glass
Throw on the blinders, ignore the signs
Sink ever deeper, swallow the lie

How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
As life passes you by

Outside the fishbowl looking in
Clarity to bear witness
Oblivious and obstinate
And you're a fucking mess
Seal all the exits, tie your own hands
Burn all the bridges, head in the sand

How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
And it's all
It's all coming down now
As the clock ticks on
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by

Awaken
Awaken
Awaken

Singing the same tired old song
Predictable and somnambulant
Suffering from terminal uniqueness
When will you awaken?
Awaken?
Awaken?

How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
And it's all
It's all coming down now
As the clock ticks on
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by
