[Verse 1: Randy Blythe]
Spoken sideways and indirect
Without a single word left unchecked
And by your own admission
No one is ever above suspicion
Defenses never to be let down
The lies readily abound
Gaping jaw tightly wound

[Chorus]
In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere

[Verse 2: Randy Blythe]
Smoking gun, cause and effect
Paradise lost, a beautiful wreck
And to you I solemnly swear
All I ever wanted was away from here
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
I only took what was rightfully mine
Seek and you shall find

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The dying man might take you with him
Until then I'll split the difference
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
I'm gonna take what is rightfully mine

(Desolation) x2

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
The dying man might take you with him
I swear to you I'll split the difference
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
