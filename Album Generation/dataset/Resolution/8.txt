So inevitable another lie
Another reason to justify
Tearing it down
Honesty such a novelty
So we king ourselves with a plastic crown

Casualty of a daydream nation
Close acquaintance, no relation
Search and destroy
Dignity we left laying along the way
To everyone's dismay
Predictable clich√©
Kindred enemies

The walking dead
Living a lie
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?

So unavoidable another fight
Sell the ticket and crash the ride
Burn it down
A legacy of brutality
So caught up in the process of weeding out

The chopping block starving for a neck
Pointing fingers and stabbing backs
Never question, conformity
The big take over under way
Much to our dismay
A lucrative display
Perpetual decay

The walking dead
Living a lie
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?

Left to destroy themselves
Yet somehow still alive
Battling for the best position
Posturing for recognition
The best days thrown away
In an age of quarrel
Butcher the memories

The walking dead
Living a lie
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
Ever get the feeling you've been..
