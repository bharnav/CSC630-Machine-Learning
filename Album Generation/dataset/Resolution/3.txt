Never fear the truth
Or a lie correctly used
When everything you do
Comes back three times to you
By any other name
The guilty still remain
Suspended in the feign
Pawn to his own intentions

Still hidden in the fold
The story bought and sold
Commodified indoctrinate expendables
Into the splendid lie

Bound by the chain of lies
You've wrapped around you
You're trapped in regression
Dying in the face of the truth

Stoic in silence we're blind inside the void
Ruins remind us of all we've destroyed
Dead rail
No way back from here
The mainline to nowhere

Still hidden in the fold
The story bought and sold
Commodified indoctrinate expendables
Into the splendid lie

Bound by the chain of lies
You've wrapped around you
You're trapped in regression
Dying in the face of the truth

You're just gluing your amber eyes shut
As the world keeps spinning around your cage
While you're waiting for the ghost
Waiting for the ghost to bite
Wait
Waiting for the ghost to bite
Wait
Waiting for the ghost to bite

Still spinning in the veil
Locked in beyond the pale
Internalize and fabricate escapable
Into the deadly lie

Bound by the chain of lies
Filled with aggression
Watch you die in the face of the truth

Bound by the chain of lies
You've wrapped around you
You're trapped in regression
Dying in the face of the truth
