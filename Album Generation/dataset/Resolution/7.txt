Unconquered

Life is born of agony's strain
Manifested in suffering
Most live crippled by fear
I'd rather walk it off on bloody stumps until I've bled dry
Yeah, we're all gonna die

You brand it a crisis
I name it an honour
To face what arises
To remain unconquered

All the worst that I feared has come to pass
And despair is in an endless supply
I dug my way to bottom of the bloody truth
Buried beneath a spotless lie

I'm sworn to stay the course that I alone have chosen
There's no way out
Because we're all gonna die

You brand it a crisis
I name it an honour
To face what arises
To remain unconquered

I'm cauterized
I'm cauterized
I'm gonna heat the blade (unconquered)
I'm gonna ride this pain (unconquered)

Life's a fatal disease without a cure
But as it kills me I'll stare right in its eye

There's no way out
I'm sworn to stay the course that I alone have chosen
There's no way out
So how will you die?

You brand it a crisis
I name it an honour
To face what arises
To remain unconquered

There's no way out
There's no way out
Unconquered

There's no way out
There's no way out
Unconquered
