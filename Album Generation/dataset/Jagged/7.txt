Here in this room
I'm a slave to your voice
I wait in the dark
With a cold metal choice
Here in this room
Where desire will bleed
And no-one can help you
No-one but me

OOh OOh
Here's something to remind you
OOh OOh
Here's something to remind you

Do you remember
The last time you cried?
Need I remind you
How innocence lied?
Here in the dark
You're a secret untold
A helpless obsession
So perfectly cold

OOh OOh
Here's something to remind you
OOh OOh
Here's something to remind you

Cry for someone, something, I'll laugh at you
Beg for someone, something, I'll laugh at you
Scream for someone, something, I'll laugh at you
Pray for someone, something, I'll laugh at you
