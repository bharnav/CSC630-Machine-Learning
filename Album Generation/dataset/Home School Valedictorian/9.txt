[Verse 1]
I wanna be the one that's catching all the luck
Sitting on a mountain of a million bucks
It's time I get a taste of the hollywood life
Sleeping all day and getting drunk all night
Can I be the one getting all the free shit
Hanging out with Hef, got my house on cribs
If I could have a chance to be living this way
I would show you all that I'm not the same

[Chorus]
Famous for nothing
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the one with hundreds in my hand
Slipping right by the bitch doorman
It's time I start seeing things go my way
Sipping on some Jack and a bottle of Grey
Can I be the one with thirty-two cars
Sitting backstage with all the rockstars
I wanna be the one that told you so
Middle finger up screaming fuck the world

[Chorus]
Famous for nothing
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone

[Bridge]
Famous for shit
Why don't you quit?
You got it all so why can't I?
Famous for shit
Why don't you quit?
You got it all so why can't I?

[Chorus]
Famous for nothing
You're not above me
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
Famous for nothing
Loser got lucky
You're gonna come and go
Come and go then you're gone
