[Verse 1]
What if I told you that I think you're perfect?
Beautiful sky in your eyes, it's so worth it
I know you make me feel alive

[Verse 2]
What if I told you that I'm in forever?
Nothing to hide, yeah, I'll go wherever you will go
You make me feel alive

[Verse 3]
And I'll be hanging on every word you say to me
Hanging on a feeling that I get
'Cause you make me

[Pre-Chorus]
Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder

[Chorus]
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time is something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life

[Verse 4]
What if I told you that I'd never hurt you?
Always be there for you to hold on to
I dunno, you make me feel alive

[Verse 5]
And every single second's a lifetime memory
I'll be holding on each moment
'Cause you make me

[Pre-Chorus]
Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder

[Chorus]
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time is something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life

[Bridge]
And I feel alive when I'm with you
When I'm with you

[Chorus]
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time is something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life
