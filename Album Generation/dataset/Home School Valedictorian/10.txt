[Verse 1]
I know we've seen some better days
But I never thought it got that bad
You told me love dies, people change
But I never thought you'd light the match

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you every time that I'm alone
I feel you, please don't go

[Chorus]
And I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again
I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
Let's do it again

[Verse 2]
And now we go our separate ways
In a story that seems so sad
Am I a distant memory?
Like a stranger you never even met

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you every time that I'm alone
I feel you, please don't go

[Chorus]
And I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again
I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
Let's do it again

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again

I know you like to hurt me
Say that I'm not worth it
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again
(I know you like to hurt me)
I know
Let's do it again
I pop another pill
I take another hit
So let's do it again
