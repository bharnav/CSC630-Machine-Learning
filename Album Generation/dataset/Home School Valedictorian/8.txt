[Verse 1]
Creeping slowly like a spider on the wall
Rolling heavy like a cannonball
Crawl beside me, won't you tell me where you've been?
Don't let them tell you that it's in your head
I'm the one, I'm your friend, let me in

[Chorus]
Move, you wanna start it up?
Move, you gotta roll it up, just one is never enough
Move, are you feeling it?
Move, you wanna take a hit, just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down from above

[Verse 2]
Light me, try me now, the smoke can clear the air
Take it all till there's nothing left
Can't deny me 'cause I know you feel the hit
Close your eyes and you're still seeing red
I'm the one, I'm your friend, let me in

[Bridge]
Move, you wanna start it up?
Move, you wanna roll it up?
Move, you wanna light it up?
Just one is never enough

[Chorus]
Move, you wanna start it up?
Move, you gotta roll it up, just one is never enough
Move, are you feeling it?
Move, you wanna take a hit, just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down from above

[Outro]
Just one is never enough
Are you feeling it?
You wanna take a hit?
Just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down from above
Just one is never enough
Sweet sounds coming down
