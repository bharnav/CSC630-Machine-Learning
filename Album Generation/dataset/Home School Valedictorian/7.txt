[Verse 1]
Paralyzed and you don't know why
Feeling like somebody's fool
Try to find some peace of mind
Maybe you're hiding the truth
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold
But I want to tell you what I've been told

[Chorus]
Life ain't that bad
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

[Verse 2]
In your eyes I see the fight
Of someone with nothing to lose
Change alone is not set in stone
'Cause I see a lot left in you
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold
But I want to tell you what I've been told

[Chorus]
Life ain't that bad
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

[Bridge]
Live for it
Go for it
I know that you want it
Life is good
Run for it
Try for it
Live for it
Die for it
It's the only shot you have

[Chorus]
Life ain't that bad
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you
