[Verse 1]
I saw you get it when you wanted it
Then I gave it to you when you wanted it now
I know you're feeling that it's close to the end
Staring at me with your back on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your world is in my hands
You know I pull the strings
I like to see how tall you stand
'Cause if I wanted I could take it away

[Chorus]
Get laid out
Or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down
Or I'm gonna keep you down
I want it to break, I want it to burn
I wanna bury you until it hurts
And I'll take, I don't ask
This breath will be your last
Do you feel the collapse?

[Verse 2]
You feel the pressure as I'm pulling you in
You're crumbling under the weight of the game
Before you let it all just go to your head
Now you're praying that you're walking away

[Pre-Chorus]
You know your world is in my hands
You know I pull the strings
I like to see how tall you stand
'Cause if I wanted I could take it away

[Chorus]
Get laid out
Or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down
Or I'm gonna keep you down
I want it to break, I want it to burn
I wanna bury you until it hurts
And I'll take, I don't ask
This breath will be your last
Do you feel the collapse?

[Bridge]
I want it to break
I want it to burn
I want it to break
I want it to burn
I want it to break
I want it to burn
I want it to burn
I want it to burn
Get laid out or I'm gonna lay you out
So stay down or I'm gonna keep you down
Get laid out or I'm gonna lay you out
So stay down or I'm gonna keep you down

[Chorus]
Get laid out
Or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down
Or I'm gonna keep you down
I want it to break, I want it to burn
I wanna bury you until it hurts
And I'll take, I don't ask
This breath will be your last
Do you feel the collapse?
Do you feel the collapse?
Do you feel the collapse?
