[Verse 1]
I can tell by the way
When I'm holding you tight
Something is wrong
No it's never been right
I can see by the way
That you stare in my eyes
It's empty to you
And there's nothing inside

[Pre-Chorus]
What if I told you
That I've been thinking
I've been dreaming of you?
And all the things I always thought that we'd do
But it was never enough

[Chorus]
I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now
So why'd you tear me down?
I'm faceless in the crowd
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heartache

[Verse 2]
Can I make you feel
Like you've never been kissed?
Like a picture you paint
Will I ever be missed?
Would you stay if I told you my love wouldn't change?
If your hair turns grey
If you gain a little weight

[Pre-Chorus]
What if I told you
That I've been thinking
I've been dreaming of you?
And all the things I always thought that we'd do
But it was never enough

[Chorus]
I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now
So why'd you tear me down?
I'm faceless in the crowd
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heartache, ooh
I'm heading for heartache, ooh yea

[Bridge]
I'm not giving you up
I'm not giving you up
(I'm heading for heartache)

[Chorus]
I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now (you don't love me now)
So why'd you tear me down?
I'm faceless in the crowd (you don't love me now)
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heartache
