I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be free
I'm as sure as the moon rolls around the sea
But I like watching you undress
And I think we're at our best
By the flicker by the light of the TV set

Cause I can't remember why I hated you
Can't remember why I still do
But I'm as sure as the moon rolls around you
That I could be happy, happy
Oh, so happy, happy
Oh, so happy, so happy

They warn you about killers and thieves in night
I worry about cancer and living right
But my mama never warned me about my own
Destructive appetite

Or the pitfalls of control
How it locks you in your grave
Looking for someone to be saved and not restrained
So I could be happy, happy
Oh so happy, happy
Oh so happy, happy
So happy, so happy

I'm as sure as the moon rolls around
