It wasn't me, I wasn't there
I was just watching from over here
And besides, I couldn't afford the bus fare
In Hollywood and Washington
They shake and smile through the harm they've done
But it's your little red wagon and you gotta pull it

It'll take a lifetime to clear your name
Under the bridges of fame it's always nighttime
It wasn't me, I wasn't there
I was stone drunk, it isn't clear
And it doesn't count cause I don't care
The years transform my memories
Of all the countless decades of greed
It was cut and run in '91

Put yourselves in a straightjacket
But when you plead insane
It's no cheaper than humiliation
That's free
That's free
That's free

I've gone and quit my worshipping
Of the false gods and golden sins
Cause we've made love in the Tower of Babel and it fell down

It wasn't me, I wasn't there
That was not my love affair
That is not my lover, that's not even my friend
It wasn't me, I wasn't there
I was stone drunk, it isn't clear
And it doesn't count cause I don't care

But I'll use a pop song to clear my name
Under the bridges of fame it's always nighttime
I'll end with a closer and say goodnight
