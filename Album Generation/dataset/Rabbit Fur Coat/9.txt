I was born secular
And inconsolable
I heard that he walked
He walked the earth

God goes
Where he wants
And who knows
Where he is not
Not in me

It's the way
Mothers greet their sons
When it's a moment too late
It's the law of the land
That sometimes the dam just breaks

God works in mysterious ways
And God gives
And then he takes
From me
From me
