Take a look inside
The warped and the sick
Forever born again
Just to die so quick
The floodgates of the damned
Shall crash and burn once again
Nuclear obsession
The fall of the weak
Atomic demolition
Destroy all you seek
The flood gates of the damned
Shall crash and burn o nce again

Down down down
Forever down

Terrified reflections
That rip through the sky
Apacalyptic birth
The screams and the cries
Floodgates of the damned
Shall crash and burn once again
The reverend of the grave
The mother of the end
The wings of the bastard
Shall spread once again
