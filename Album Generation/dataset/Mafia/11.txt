Destroy this world
And all it is
This rain that falls
Just kill it dead

Bring your pain and
Bring all your hate
Lord, I'll kill it all again

Oh yeah
Spread your wings now child
Never return
Hell before heaven
'Fore we all get burned

This poison that bleeds our souls
Drown in yourself
Can't you see what's going on?

Bring your pain and
Bring all your hate
Lord, I'll kill it all again

Oh yeah
Spread your wings now child
Never return
Hell before heaven
'Fore we all get burned

-Solo-

Spread your wings now child
Never return
Hell before heaven
'Fore we all get burned
Spread your wings now child
Never return
Hell before heaven
'Fore we all get burned
