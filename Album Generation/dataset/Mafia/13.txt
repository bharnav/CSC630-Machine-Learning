Ashes fly, ashes burn
The sun is black, ain't no return
Ashes fly, ashes burn
Over and over, ain't no need to learn

It's all dust on dust, it's all dust on dust
It's all you and me, it's all you and me
Outdone, completely outplayed
Just shovel some more dirt on the grave

The choices you make
And the choices that are
When Hell is so close
And Heaven's so far
Ashes fly, ashes burn
Over and over, ain't no need to learn

It's all dust on dust, all dust on dust
It's all you and me, all you and me
Outdone, completely outplayed
Just shovel some more dirt on the grave

It's all dust on dust, all dust on dust
It's all you and me, all you and me
Outdone, completely outplayed
Just shovel some more dirt on the grave
