Crawl through the flames
That eat your flesh
Drowned in the waters
That know you best
Step inside
I've been waiting here for you

On your knees where you shall crawl
Flying so high, you never fall
Step inside
We've been waiting here for you

Bow down, you chose your maker
He never gives, he's always a taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Bow down, you chose your maker
He never gives, he's always a taker
Electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Walk through the streets
That know your name
All that's pure is now insane
Step inside
I've been waiting here for you

Another trip, another lie
Life's hand of doom
You're feeling fine
Step inside
We've been waiting here for you

Bow down, you chose your maker
Never gives, he's always a taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Bow down, you chose your maker
He never gives, he's always a taker
Electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Bow down, you chose your maker
He never gives, he's always a taker
Bow down, you chose your maker
He never gives, he's always a taker
Electric burns that fuel the fire
