[Verse 1: Zakk Wylde]
Step inside this nightmare where I live
The madman roams inside my head
Step inside this nightmare where I live
The madman roams inside my head

[Chorus: Zakk Wylde]
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?

(Verse 2: Zakk Wylde)
Helter Skelter running through my veins
Satan's coming on his way
Helter Skelter running through my veins
Satan's coming on his way

[Chorus: Zakk Wylde]
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?

(Guitar Solo)

[Chorus: Zakk Wylde]
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
Oh, what's in you now?
