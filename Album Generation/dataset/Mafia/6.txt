Where have we gone?
What have we done?
Where have we gone?
Nowehere left to run

Pray for war
Pray for death
Pray for hate
Pray for all
That you know
All these year
Ain't nothing's changed
And you know
And you know
Yeah

Spiral of darkness
As the booth awaits
Peace through destruction
Has sealed our fate

Pray for war
Pray for death
Pray for hate
Pray for all
That you know
All these year
Ain't nothing's changed
And you know
And you know
Yeah

-Solo-

Pray for war
Pray for death
Pray for hate
Pray for all
That you know
All these year
Ain't nothing's changed
And you know
And you know
Yeah
