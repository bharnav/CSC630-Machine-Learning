I've been around this world
Yet I see no end
All shall fade to black
Again and again
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

In this river
All shall fade to black
In this river
Ain't no coming back
In this river
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

Withdrawn a step away
Just to find myself
The door is closed again
The only one left
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

In this river
All shall fade to black
In this river
Ain't no coming back
In this river
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

In this river
All shall fade to black
In this river
Ain't no coming back
In this river
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

In this river
All shall fade to black
In this river
Ain't no coming back
In this river
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

In this river
All shall fade to black
In ths river
Ain't no coming back
In this river
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
