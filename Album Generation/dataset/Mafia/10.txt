I am the god of
Electric hellfire
And I bring you...

Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher

You've got a suicidal death wish
That's plain to see
Suicidal death wish bring it to me
Have you ever met Jesus?
Soon you will see
You're gonna meet Jesus
If you're messing with me

Electric hellfire
Higher, higher
Electric hellfire

This hand of doom
That is holding you down
Say your prayers son
You're gonna drown
Stormtroppin' Jesus
You're gonna see
You're gonna meet Jesus
If you're messing with me

Electric hellfire
Higher, higher
Electric hellfire

-Solo-

Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
High..

I'm still the god of
Electric hellfire
