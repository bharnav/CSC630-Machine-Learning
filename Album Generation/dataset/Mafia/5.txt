Take a look for
You'll never see
Inside my realm
Of mass insanity
I feed off fear
Inside a world that's wrong
Take my hand now
Won't you come along

Pure psychosis
In this madhouse
Which I call my home
Degradtion in its
Purist form
You're not alone

You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind

Another trip inside
The acid bath
No salvation and the
Grave is coming fast
Synthetic dreams are
My drug of choice
Embrace confusion all
Is gone and lost

Pure psychosis
In this madhouse
Which I call my home
Degradtion in its
Purist form
You're not alone

You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind

-Solo-

Pure psychosis
In this madhouse
Which I call my home
Degradtion in its
Purist form
You're not alone

You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
You must be blind
