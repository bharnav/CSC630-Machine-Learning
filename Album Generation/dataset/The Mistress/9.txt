If you go we can stay outside
You can find a new place to hide
On the beaches of Italy
There is something you wanna see

I know you're comfortable where you are
I know the hallway's a bit too far
But if you trust me I'll lead the way
You've never seen such a lovely day

So come out from where you are
Come out from where you are
