To go away for quite a while
If that is what will make you smile
Is something I would gladly do
Because I am in love with you

To go without a piece of bread
Because of something that I said
If that is what it's going to take
Then that it is what it's going to take

To go away for quite awhile
If that is what will make you smile
Is something I would gladly do
Because I am in love with you

To go without a piece of bread
Because of something that I said
If that is what it's going to take
Then that it is what it's going to take

Brother won't you sing a song for me
Sing along and then follow me
Take your chance to bring the news to me
Tell me how she'd look if I could see

Brother won't you sing a song for me
Sing along and then follow me
Take your chance to bring the news to me
Tell me how she'd look if I could see
