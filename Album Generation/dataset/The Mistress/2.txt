You're gonna hate me soon if you don't understand
That what we're doing here has got no long-term plan

You're gonna hate me soon if you do not desist
From when I kindly term as your neverending kiss

You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon

I'm gonna love you soon if you do understand
And then you leave me for a better kind of man

I'm gonna love you soon when you are out of reach
And when I see you 'round, you never want to speak

I'm gonna love you soon
I'm gonna love you soon
I'm gonna love you soon
I'm gonna love you soon

So why don't we just skip ahead and leave this behind?
We can hate or we can love or we can let it unwind
Your father says that you are near
So let's get together in a couple years

You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon
You're gonna hate me soon
