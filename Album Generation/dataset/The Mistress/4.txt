Let me take your words from you today
Tell me what you've always yearned to say
Sing about the trials
You have known
You have known
You have known

'Cause there will be a fire here today
All you see will slowly fade away
Into ashes, shadows
And the mist
And the mist
And the mist

Make it quick don't try to understand
Trucks and hoses soon will be at hand
Tell all that you know before you go
Before you go
Before you go

And I will write it down here in my book
I promise you that I will never look
'Til the day has come when the fire starts
When the fire starts

Libraries burn fast
When they're in the past
Once you leave all your stories will be gone
Libraries burn fast
They weren't built to last
Flames of memory burn brighter than the rest

Libraries burn fast

Should we try to save them
Should we try to save them
When will they be missing
When will they be missing

Libraries burn fast
When they're in the past
Once you leave all your stories will be gone
Libraries burn fast
They weren't built to last
Flames of memory burn brighter than the rest
