See things are going slowly
See things are going slowly

Take time, take time deliver it
Take time, take time deliver it

If you see a letter bearer
Tear off her mask and tell her
That Â“You can't! You can't deliver it!
You can't! You can't deliver it!Â”

Send all the swallows up to the moon
Semipalmated sandpipers, too
This is a campaign

Ready the ships for one more attack
Ration the bread and cover your tracks
This is a campaign
