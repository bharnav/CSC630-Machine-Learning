When I was a boy of seventeen
I know it's mean but I
I told my friend to give up on her dreams
She hated me but I
I knew the dreams were for the best of us
And for the rest of us
And I
I didn't wanna share with anyone
I need a way to see my greatest dance
And make 'em laugh
I could win the wars or lose the battles, too
Whichever's true
I can live in other people's lives
I can't stop putting on other peoples' clothes
I love them 'til I leave
I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air balloon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home
If I'd learned to float
So take my trash
Just take my earthly life
I'll try to cry
I will live without the things I love the best
So hold them to your chest
I lose my face
Just lose my stolen wigs
The heads of kings
I run until I know what to believe

[Bridge]
I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air ballon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home
If I learned to float
I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air ballon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home
If I learned to float
