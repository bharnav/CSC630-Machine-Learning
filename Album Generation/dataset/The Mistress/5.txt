If you see a butterfly will we hear dramatic cries?
Or will you just laugh with the rest of us?
Can you let your bonnet down?
Will it hurt to see you frown?
Why have you decided to hide from us?

‘Cause I think we’ve got a chance
And I think we’ve got a chance

Can you break your silent vow?
Send a bird, don’t wonder how
Things will find their way to me anyway
Spend a night with just your glass
Thinking of adventures past
While you slowly fall into deeper thoughts

I think we’ve got a chance
I think we’ve got a chance
I think we've got a chance
