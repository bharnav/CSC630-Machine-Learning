Whale, swim with me whale
We will go far into the sea
You will take me onto your back
Never look back, never look back

Whale, sing to me whale
Sing me a song
Tell me that things will never go wrong
Hide me away
Don't let them stay, Don't let them stay

Whale, come with me whale
We will go far into the blue
I will take you
Listen to me, then you will see
Then you will see

Whale, don't worry whale
Just do as you please
I will accept if you'd rather leave
I'll open my heart if you open your heart
Open your heart

I've been swimming for a thousand years
And I've seen more than you can realize
I accept that you will never understand
So I will gladly take your hand

Whale, come with me whale
We will go far into the sea
You will take me onto your back
Never look back, never look back
Never look back, never look back

Whale, don't worry whale
Just do as you please
I will accept if you'd rather leave
I'll open my heart if you open your heart
Open your heart
