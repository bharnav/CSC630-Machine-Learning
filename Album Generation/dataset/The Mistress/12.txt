Mary says it's okay
She can see the future:
Everything turns around; dnuora snrut gnihtyrevE
Terrors may be coming-
They are only games
Everything turns around; dnuora snrut gnihtyrevE
Sirens may be sounding
Roads are closing down
I am a true believer; I am a true believer
So grab your pills and pillows
Take what you'll remember
Everything turns around; dnuora snrut gnihtyrevE

Mary, you are doing drugs
Don't you think we know?
You always seemed a little too happy, Mary

Mary

Mary...
