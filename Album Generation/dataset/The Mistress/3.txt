Now that we've started
Sad to see it end
But I'll try to make it
As long as it's alright for me to pretend

And I'll hold on
I'll hold on for you
For you

And I'll hold on
I'll hold on for you
For you

I will still love you
As long as we stay in this bed
Cause we've hit the trigger
There's nothing left to do but wait for the end

Walls will be crumbling
Walls will be crumbling outside
Outside

So let's stay forever
Let's stay forever inside
Inside

And I'll hold on
I'll hold on for you
For you

And I'll hold on
I'll hold on for you
For you

(Please let me stay, let me stay, let me stay)
