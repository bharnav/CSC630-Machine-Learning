Sandy, I don't recognize you So much has changed in your face I dream at night, you managed to take me home And you could not get over my place And you say, "Hey, what you doin' here? I think that you would rather be there... And your love is like a broken bottle."

Oh, Jesse, what you done with yourself? I don't think you have to recognize me But we was walking alone, and we had fun, fun, fun

I'm gonna buy you a new ride, baby Gonna buy you a new line, baby Something inside just walks me home

Oh, Sally, I've seen you before You managed to take me home What were we doing? What was it about? I guess it was the thought that counts

And lovers bruise each other No, I don't wanna be like that And there's a courage in what you ask

I'm gonna buy you a new ride, baby I'm gonna buy you a new line, baby Something inside just walks me home Yeah

And lovers bruise each other No, I don't wanna be like that And there's a courage in what you ask

I'm gonna buy you a new ride, baby Gonna buy you a new line, baby Something inside just walks me home

I'm gonna get you a new ride, baby Gonna get you a new line, baby Something inside just walks me home Something inside just walks me home
