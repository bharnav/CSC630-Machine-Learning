Ask yourself
What do you think about us?
I was in the station
Working on something for us

You say your empty mind
Is easy when it's drugged
I watched you fall out of bed and scrape up your back
Well, maybe
This life is like the drug
This life is like the drug

(Yeah)

Ask yourself
What do they say about us?
I was in the station
Cooking up something for us

You say your empty mind
Is easy when it's drugged
I watched you fall out of bed and scrape up your back
Well, maybe
This life is like your bed
This life is like your bed

I've seen you fall between
Everywhere we go
They want to love you, baby
More than you know
I've seen the storm inside you
All through the day
I know it never leaves you
Not in that way

(Yeah)

I've seen your empty mind is easy when it's drugged
I've watched you fall out of bed and then scrape up your back
Well, maybe
This life is like your head
This life is like your head
This life is like your head...

Ask yourself
Ask yourself
Yeah, ask yourself
