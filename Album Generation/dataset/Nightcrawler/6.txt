Shame, pass the ticket along
Are you outside or inside?
You are in

So what you want to know?
That everybody wants you?
You're old enough to say what's really on your mind

Shame has to take it alone
Are we not far between us
We are here

So what you gonna do
When everybody loves you?
You're old enough to know what's really on their minds

They wanted the same thing
In love with the same thing They wanted it all

So what you gonna do
When everybody hates you?
You're old enough to have known
What was really on their minds

They wanted the same thing
In love with the same thing
In love with the same thing
They wanted the same thing
In love with the same thing
Wanted the same thing
They wanted it all
