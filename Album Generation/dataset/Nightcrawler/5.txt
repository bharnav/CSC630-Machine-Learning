Cadillac Boy And all he wants to do is work How can you make him feel? I was let down in your photographic whirl I was in love with it

It's so much harder Than this So much harder Than this

I was in the door Didn't feel like doing work We're staring out We're starting now You see me go You feel like doing work We're starting now We're starving now I let you go, you never put me out Stop it now Just stop now... And say, "I will." Say, "I will."

Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm right on, right on, right on

You see me go and you feel like doing work We're staring out We're starting now I let you go, you never put me out Stop it now Just stop now And say, "I will." Just say, "I will."

Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm right on, right on, right on

I said, "Hey, baby, baby, I'll take you tonight. And I'll see you on the other side, sugar Your pleasant face, your crooked smile Maybe tomorrow is a lifetime away..."
