In the beginning
They had valuable traits
Just don't mention anything to him
All we ask of you
Is to break both his legs
For the troubles
Caused as vampyre

They don't even care about us
In the backs of their cars
It's too hot to handle
Too cold to shovel

In the beginning
They had positive traits
Just don't mention anything to him
All we ask of you
Is a stake through the heart
For the troubles caused as vampyre

And they don't even care about us
In the backs of their cars
It's too hot to handle
Too cold to shovel

They don't even know about us
In the backs of their cars
It's too hot to handle
Too cold to shovel
Too cold to shovel
Too cold to shovel...
