Eighteen men went into the house And burned it to the ground Two men came out from the house Never went to town Everyone knew who the carpenter was Breaking everything Nathaniel was a lucky one He had to get his things Georgie Boy, oh, Georgie Boy

Sister Anne-Marie and a 12-year-old They left the burning town Rode for miles on a subway train That's how the legend went down And, yeah, now you've been fooled And now you can see that Nothing's gonna change It's the witches who know They only do what they want And then like to have someone explain

Georgie Boy, oh, Georgie Boy Now you can move and now you can sing Georgie Boy (Georgie Boy)

Now it's over when you can't ascribe You say now's the time for a different try But you have to tell Does running make that sound?

Twenty years on It's a mission accomplished And everyone's feeling great He says, "No one's ever gonna trap me down or make me make mistakes." So now what you do And now what you say Means nothing to the rest And you make a rich bitch And you know what you are Yeah, you find yourself in a purple dress

Georgie Boy, oh, Georgie Boy (And now you can move and now you can sing) Georgie Boy, oh, Georgie Boy
