When winter comes
Along these shores
Old Hollywood
We're knocking down
We're sifting through
We are the actual tigers
When winter comes
They leave behind us

Throw your arms around my neck
And hold me tightly
There's a lot that we will get
I'm asking you...
Let your diamond bracelet fall
Over the Ice Age
Over the Ice Age

Those summer years
We'd follow them
In light of day
In light of us
We'll see it through
When they're playing our song
Those summer years
Have long since gone

Throw your arms around my neck
And whisper softly
Of a thing that we will get
I'm asking you...
Let your diamond bracelet fall
Over the Ice Age
Over the Ice Age

I want to go back
I want to go back

In future times
We'll hold it closer
Imagining
We weren't older
Yet, through it all
They'll be playing our song...

Throw your arms around my neck
And whisper softly
Of a thing that we will get
I'm asking you...
Let your diamond bracelet fall
Over the Ice Age
Over the Ice Age...

(I want to go back)
