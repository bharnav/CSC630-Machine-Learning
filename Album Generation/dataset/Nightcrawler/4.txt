[Verse 1: Pete Yorn]
Outside there's a box car waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

[Pre-Chorus: Pete Yorn, Liz Phair]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus: Pete Yorn and Liz Phair]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Verse 2: Pete Yorn]
Big shake on the box car moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

[Pre-Chorus: Pete Yorn, Liz Phair]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus: Pete Yorn and Liz Phair]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Bridge: Liz Phair]
Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Pete Yorn, Liz Phair]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus: Pete Yorn and Liz Phair]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
