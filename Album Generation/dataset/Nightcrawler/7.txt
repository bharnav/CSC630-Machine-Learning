Sometimes it's pain
Sometimes it's hollow
Never the same
It'll change you tomorrow
The sadness
Doesn't matter when it's gone

Girl in a red dress
Passes you by
A hurried deception
Gleam to her eye
Like the weather
Will not hurt her when she's wrong

You say you feel all broke and discarded
What's on your mind, baby?
You know you'll get on well once you've started
Over again

This day is alive
This day is alive
This day is alive

Take another chance if a turn for disaster is the best thing for you
Oh, the difference is the lies I've told are true
Do not tell your father the thoughts you've been thinking
They'll burn him too long
After all, it's the dream that holds up the sun

Yeah, you want to have something that's real
Well, give it some time, baby
You're all wrapped in the words you're repeating over again

This day is alive
(This day is alive)
This day is alive
(This day is alive)
This day is alive

So now you tell me what you're gonna do to me
You got a lot on your mind, baby
You got so much that'll get through to me
Without telling me lies

You say you wanna stand up for something, alright...
What's on your mind, baby
Oh, you could stand here for nothing
Or start it again Start it again

This day is alive
(This day is alive)
This moment will pass you by
This day is ours, don't let it die (Die)
Don't let it die (Die) Don't let it die
