I think you're old enough to know it better
But I'm old enough to remember
(Don't even trip)
I won't use that stupid word forever
(Cross your heart and hope to die)

Don't even trip
Don't get too big for your britches
All these bones been jumping out of your closet
(Get out of your closet)
So blasé, don't turn and look the other way
You wanna be a star, you're oh so near yet oh so far
(Don't even trip)

You'll be flyin' south before the winter
On that long, long trip of the sinner
Don't be throwing stones at the mirror
(Look in peace and close your eyes)

Don't even trip
Don't get too big for your britches
All these bones been jumping out of your closet
(Get out of your closet)
So blasé, don't turn and look the other way
You gotta have it all, you're oh so near yet oh so far

And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm here to trim the leaves
And I'm afraid that you're still my friend
And you're just a piece of shit
But I can overlook it today
Cause you're still my friend

(Don't even trip)
Drop that gun, you ain't my fucking hero
You think it's cool to be a fucking zero?
Can't believe I called you 'mi amigo'
(Take a deep breath and you'll be fine)

Speak up now
And one of you is a hundred loud
When you preach
They'll join you on the roofs and streets
(Like Crystal clear)
Crystal clear
I'm hanging like a chandelier
Watching over you
I'll move you from song to tears

And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm going to trim the leaves
And I can say that you're still my friend
And you're still a piece of shit
But I can overlook it today
Cause you're still my friend

And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm here to trim the leaves
And I'm afraid, are you still my friend?
And you're still a piece of shit
But I can look the other way
Cause you're still my friend

Don't even trip
