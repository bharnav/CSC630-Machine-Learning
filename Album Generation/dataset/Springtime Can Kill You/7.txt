Moonshiner, moonshiner
Pass it here one more time
Moonshiner, moonshiner
Pass it here one more time
You've got that good, hard stuff that always gets me high

You can break that ground and plant that field
Hole up in the backyard and work that still
You know we're gonna miss you around here
You've got that good, hard stuff,that always gets me high

Moonshiner, moonshiner
Why don't you come back home?
Now I got to drink this store-bought stuff and go to bed all alone
Moonshiner, moonshiner
Why don't you come back home to me?
By the time you get back, there's no telling where I'll be

I loved you in summertime, when we kissed goodbye
I loved you in the fall and I missed you all the time
I loved you in the winter, when you were far away
And the springtime almost killed me
With hot blood in my viens

Moonshiner, moonshiner
I know you're comin' back again
Moonshiner, moonshiner
Oh it's probably a sin, 'cause I'm down in the alley with my old drunk friend
Yes I'm down in the alley, with my old drunk friend
