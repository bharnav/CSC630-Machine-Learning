Adieu false heart, since we must part
May the joy of the world go with you
I've loved you long with a faithful heart
But I never anymore will I believe you

I've seen the time I'd have married you
And been your constant lover
But now I'll freely give you up
For one whose heart's more truer

My mind is like the constant sun
From the east to the west it ranges
Yours is like unto the moon
It's every month a-changing

When I lay down to take my rest
No scornful morn to wake me
I'll go straight ways unto my grave
Just as fast as time can take me
