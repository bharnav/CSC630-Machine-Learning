No you're not satisfied with me
Still you call me your dearie
Oh you had your way but someday you'll pay
For the heartaches you brought to me

Oh we'll say goodbye forever
And I'll be a rolling stone
Oh sweetheart you know that I love you so
Though you're not satisfied with me

Oh we'll say goodbye forever
And I'll be a rolling stone
Oh sweetheart you know that I love you so
Though you're not satisfied with me
