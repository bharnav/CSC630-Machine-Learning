Crazy dreams been calling me
Steam Whistle, state line
Wind did howl

Crazy dreams been calling me
Got caught in the thistle
Someone stumped on my pride
But I won't throw in the towel
I can't throw in the towel

Crazy dreams been calling me
Got my wooden pistol
I got my lucky dime
And I was bown a night owl

These crazy dreams been calling me
