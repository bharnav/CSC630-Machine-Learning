The sun's too bright
And the mountains are too far
And there's nowhere in town
I can get to in my broken car
I've got nowhere to go but to sleep
I would shut my eyes but I've got promises to keep
I can't go crazy and I can't get sane
And I don't want to leave-I'd just have to come back again
I've got nowhere to go but to sleep...
I remember, I remember something about who we were
I remember, I remember something about who we could be
I've had nothing to do for years but dream
I got reckless
And I broke my baby's rule
And I'm sick and restless
With the wandering blues
Cause most of my friends are gone down the line
And I'm sitting in town on the proceeds of my crimes
I've got nowhere to go but to sleep...
I took my sister to the river and I came back alone
And this sickness that's on me is settling in my bones
And my Daddy is suspicious but I know how he does
He won't find out about it till she's safe down in the mud
With nowhere to go but to sleep
I would follower her down but I've got promises to keep
I remember, I remember something about who we were
I remember, I remember something about who we could be
I've had nothing to do for years but dream
