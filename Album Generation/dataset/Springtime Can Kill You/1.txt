Feeling my blues
I tear myself away
He will never have to hear
What I had to say
My little words
Are lost in the wind
With no where to go
And I am just like them

There's a voice in the alley
In the cold bare arms of a tree
When the moon sails high, a ghost ship
In a dark and lonely sea
Mockingbird, your song burns right through me

Like that little mockingbird
High up in the pine
All I do is worry, all I do is cry
We're lost in the shadows of a beautiful spring
Empty-handed lovers, all we do is sing
