The twelfth day of never came faster than ever
For the likes of you and I
I used to adore you but now I implore you
To quietly pass me by

It's unseemly how I hate myself
I don't want anyone to see
Least of all someone like you
Who knows so much about me

Oh please don't tell 'em what you know about me

I can never be beholded to you
Our affairs are our own
Most of all for someone like me
Who is always alone

Oh please don't tell 'em what you know about me
