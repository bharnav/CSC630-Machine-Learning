My sullen songs have taken me
Far down this darkened road
I have seen the campfires burning
I have heard the drunkards howl

I'm silent in my solitude
I'm quiet as a theif
I have stolen all these hours
I have gotten no relief

My crazy dreams and tragedies have taken me for a ride
But I can see strange glory on the other side
Oh this has been my misery and the source of my pride
But all along I'm thinking I've been taken for a ride

Why don't you take me when I'm willing
Why don't you take me when I'm willing

But like a stubborn beast when the barn is on fire
I might resist you when you try to save my life
I might resist you when you try to save my life
When the flames rise around us and I can't see the door
This is still my home and it has never burned before
This is where I've taken my solace and my peace
The walls are caving in but I am still a stubborn beast

Why don't you take me when I'm willing
Why don't you take me when I'm willing
