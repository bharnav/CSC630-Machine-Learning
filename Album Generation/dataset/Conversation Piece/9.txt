Save your arms and legs cause you're the mother and no one will hold us up for so long
We will always resort to fodder. We crawl in the crack, falling through your limbs
If she was here, she'd say be careful but she'd already let it go
Do as I say, not as I've done. Just trust in me. Believe in me
When you left me, you didn't leave me a trail to follow
No, you just swallowed all the crumbs along the way
So you could feed all the ghosts that hide inside your bones
Cause maybe if their mouths are full they'll stop whispering that you're better off alone
It wasn't nice of you to go out without saying goodbye
So I think I'll hunt you down and punish you. Good luck trying to hide
My temper's a teacher with a hell of a lesson plan
You might know this but I've got a rifle and stifling manners
You control this and any consistency scares me from progress
I don't show it but I'm catching on and can see through the pattern
Don't talk! Read this! Your strong upper hand will get lost in the process
Got matters to attend to and methods to convince you to stay right where you
Are you ready to apologize? I won't believe you but it's worth a few tries
Don't look down! Look in my eyes! Go on and feed me some lies. Lie to me!
I make this into what you always keep from me
Although your secrets are locked away
You forget that you left me a key on a day that's just memory;
When we were young and were happy
When lying on the bed with not a thing to do and words unsaid
We were certain that things were perfect
Of course I'm bitter thinking things would never change
I can't let go and this is why I always make this into what you keep from me
