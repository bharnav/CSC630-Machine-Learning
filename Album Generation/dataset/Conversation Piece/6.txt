Let me down easy. There's no reason to tease me
If you don't need me, please let me go
Playing with my dreams? Not anymore
Time is dancing on my chest and it's casting stones
It's casing parts, each one of them antagonist
And I'm trying to feed the wasp inside my mouth
It's dying! I'm not sure that it wants to live. Oh well
Hail the insane and deranged! It wasn't my embrace
It's yours. Now I'm trying to walk the straightest line
Now it's time! I wanted you forever and ever
Now it's never again. Never
I wanted you forever and ever
Now it's never again. Never
Oh, how your hands used to shake
Tremble and threaten to break if they weren't encased in mine
Telling you that it'll be just fine
I could have had it forever and ever
Now it's never again. Never
I could have had it forever and ever
Now it's never again. Never
I would have thrown it all away for you and actually did
It's all around me but I can't pick it up
Because I gave you all what was left of my strength
Love's a many splendored thing; an often vendored thing
If love was just a movie about war, it's the surrender scene!
You think you've got it figured out?
I didn't say that! I've got doubts!
I said I've lost my faith in love
There's still a way to find it! How?
I might've cared for it at first
Now that I've buried it, my thirst
Is met in bars and not the fake embrace of needy arms
That isn't true! I've seen your heart!
You didn't see that it was charred?
There was a fire, that's a start
The fire's gone and now it's dark
Please turn on the lights
Please turn on the lights!
I think I'm still fucked up!
Time didn't heal me! Oh god!
You were a fever dream but you never broke or went away
