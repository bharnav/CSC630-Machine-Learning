Oh, the motor in the back of your neck
Is begging and calling for sex
And the lizards are laying some monstrous eggs
In an entropic tropical mess
While you're sleeping, I'm crawling
I've crept to the edge of the bed
Where you've slept for a thousand nights alone
In a cavern you call home
I'm here so let's do this
Your hands on my legs
You say the things I want to hear
Let's please just keep touching
I don't wanna think
Please keep me from thinking
I missed your name! Can I hear it again?
I missed your name! Can I hear it again?
While you were talking my eyes kept walking
Down the walkway of your neckline
So I didn't hear you begging. Can I hear it again?
So many dreams have left me tired, waking up and shaking on my own
I ignored a ticking clock to call you and made a weapon of my phone
Poor judgment and bankrupt morals!
A girl without a penny for her thoughts!
I guess I like you cheap
I guess that conscience long since rot has sent me spiraling
So lost into the planet of your skin
There's a fear that we will end that just won't let me begin
And though I have no qualms with lust
Your body is a howling, haunted petting zoo that I really shouldn't touch
And as I'm walking out the door for good
I turn around to look at you and you're...
You're already undressed!
If I draw near, do you disappear?
If I stay away, will you call my name?
