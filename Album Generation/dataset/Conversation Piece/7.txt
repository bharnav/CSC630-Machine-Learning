I'm starting to think that maybe I'm wrong
It's easy to forget what you're fighting for and what matters more
But maybe I'm not. What if only time can tell?
Well, until then we'll try this again
I feel colder without you
But I've learned to embrace the chill about you
I can't tell if I lost or found you
Am I making sense or do I confound you?
Oh what to do? Nothing is new
Now I must deal with my true form of reality
They like to tax me drastically
Still learning to heal fantastically
Hearing you talk makes me want to shut my mouth
I wonder who taught you to whisper with a voice so loud
Oh wow! You've got opinions to share?
So just keep yelling through the door sending your four-letter prayers
Get lucky once if I care!
Use all your luck if I'm really even there!
I'm so exhausted with noise
You give me options but don't give me a choice
"Let's get rich quick," my invitation to the cynics
"Well, I can't do that. I'm saving up for the day that I get sick
So run away with your teenage schemes."
What you've got in smarts; I've got ten times in dreams
I feel colder without you
But I've learned to embrace the chill about you
I can't tell if I lost or found you
Am I making sense or do I confound you?
