Il Ã©tait une fois
When learning how to crawl became a substitute for walking
Biting my tongue a fair exchange for talking to myself
Knocking pictures off the shelf and swallowing the frames
Spilling wine to comment on the stain

I need a mind erase option, less air to the brain
If God was alive he would've amended us
But then again no one has it as bad as I have or ever will
To the extent that if I have to finish this
I might have to leave everything else undone
And it's all numb anyway

I can see our life before my eyes and it looks real
Sunrise; an easy thing to steal
I'll drive! I'm best behind the wheel
Besides, I get confused and I'll need you to navigate
The complicated courts and lanes that crowd this place
I swear to God the street signs change when my eyes close
They're not the same
They're not the same
I get lost easily
I get lost easily
Help guide me home please
Help guide me home please

I always take the fall! Why are you always getting sick?
The complications won't solve itself!
I always take the fall! Why are you always getting sick?
The complications won't solve itself!

We used to sing our song and what it meant to us and it's gone
And every emotion, that all went along with it's gone
I shared it all with you, you said you'd love me too
So love me too

Are you crawling away or is it time to go through?
Were we always this way or was I too fucked up to know?
I sang your favorite song. You told me it was too long
I asked you what was wrong. The list goes on and on...
