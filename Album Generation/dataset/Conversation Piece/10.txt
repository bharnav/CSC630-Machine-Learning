This is my body at war!
No hesitation, this is entrapment entangling me
Where's my attorney to defend or keep my mind from indulging?
I've failed! And my nerves have lost their touch
My eyes can't see so much and if my heart is the next to go
How my brain will scream and let my body know!
My tongue is drafting treaties that my stomach can't hold
My throat's been fed lies that it's finding too hard to swallow
And my liver? Oh god, how it knows that I'm poisoning it
So it grows and exposes it's fangs. And it's good friends
The veins, feel exactly the same;
Abandoned, lost, clogged with smoke and ashamed
But as for the blame? No, the blame's not with me
It's with you. Is it true you're less girl than disease?
If this is it, let's make it a big one!
Let's just seize until our blood starts dancing with fire and our bones explode
The marrow will drip slowly through whichever wounds are open
Taking my skin by surprise. Oh, you're wrong!
You think your body is so fucking strong
It's not! You're just a flesh-wrapped present for a graveyard
With intestines ribboning around you as knots
Can't you see I'm spitting out my taste? You did the very same
And when we are through, will the worms even want us
Or will they take bites of our skin and decide we'd make terrible dirt?
To tell you the truth and be crushingly honest:
I know I've heard that bodies are temples but when temples sink into the ground
They lose all their worth. Life's a dance? Well, death takes out the grace
