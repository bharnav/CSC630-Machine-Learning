She thinks, "Another day I'm left to drag my broken soul
Through the streets, into work and school, then back home"
Not a man in her life that makes her feel whole
Because it's the men in her life that filled her with those holes
"What have I done to deserve this?"
To face a racing fist that screams, "You think I like this bitch?!"
Don't you worry my darling, mommy just tripped
She can feel her sanity starting to slip
So she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun
Where no one lives but me
Help me
Help me

Entangled in a web of complete misery
Complete misery

Her cries are stifled by a fear of what he might do to the kids
"If I just stick it out this might end soon"
"This is all my fault
If I had just done what he said, I could have avoided this all"
And still she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun
Where no one lives but me
Help me
Help me

Beyond the sun
Help me
Help me

Beyond the sun
Help me
Help me

How can we let this be?
Our sisters and mothers are dying
How can we let this be?
Our mothers are dying

How can we let this be?
How can we let this be?

"If someone is gay, you can’t force them to be straight. If they’re straight, you can’t force them to be gay. You can’t force people to be something they’re not. But some people try anyway. Now, we've got a church in Connecticut who's going to try to drive the gayness out of someone with an exorcism. Wow, is this a stupid idea!"

"There's a story I want to talk about here, Lewis. It’s the 21st century and we live in the United States, and a 70 year old man has been stoned to Death because the Bible says that you should stone gay people."
