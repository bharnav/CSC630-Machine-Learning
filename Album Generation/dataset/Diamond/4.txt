We still believe!

I'm sick and tired of all this giving up
All I hear is talk and I've had enough
Single-minded, overwhelmingly one-sided
Refusing humanity does not award morality
Hope's not dead, so we'll forever scream
Until it's deafening

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe

You opened the gate and what came rushing out
Is far too powerful for you to hold down
If there's a better way, someone please tell me now
But there's not, this is it!

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe

From here on out, I will live
Deliberately!
I can't sit back, to watch the world die
I must fight back!
Or I'll pay the price, there's more to this
Not just me!

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe
