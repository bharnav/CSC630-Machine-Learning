My friend, what has you so troubled?
Why have you turned life into such a struggle?
I see it in you no matter how hard it tries to hide
The war in your heart, the fire in your eyes

I can't follow, trust me I've tried
My path is lit by a brighter light
So I will always sing humanity's song
We may fall, but we will carry on

We may fall, but we will carry on
May these words ring loud
We may fall, but we will carry on
May these words ring loud

We may fall, but we will carry on
May these words ring loud
We may fall, but we will carry on
May these words ring loud

We may fall, but we will carry on
We may fall, but we will carry on
We may fall, but we will carry on
We may fall, but we will carry...

"You see, we have made life into a hideous thing, living. Life has become a battle, which is an obvious fact, constant fight, fight, fight. And to go into this question of what is death, what lies beyond death, becomes rather meaningless if you don't know how to live."
