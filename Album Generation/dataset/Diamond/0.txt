Intro:
"In this there is no teacher, no pupil; there is no leader; there is no guru; there is no Master, no Saviour
You yourself are the teacher and the pupil; you are the Master; you are the guru; you are the leader; you are everything. And to understand is to transform what is."

“You have to be a light to yourself–not a light of a professor, or a historian, psychologist, or the light of Jesus or the light of the Buddha–you have to yourself. In a world that is impossibly becoming dark.”

I know that what's in front of me
Is a reflection of what is inside of me
And I see I need to be myself
Cause it's so lonely in the eyes of someone else
And I feel, oh how I feel
Yeah I feel and I always will
I starve to live free from fear
To free myself before I disappear
I am forever more than just surviving
This is my life and this life is my diamond

My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
