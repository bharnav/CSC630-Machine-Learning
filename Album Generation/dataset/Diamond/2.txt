"People's need to protect...
People's need to protect...
People's need to protect...
People's need to protect...
People's need to protect...
People's need to protect...
...their own egos knows no bounds. They will lie, cheat, steal, kill, do whatever it takes."

"There is no such thing as an external enemy,...
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you
...no matter what that voice in your head is telling you."

I don't think I could ever let you go
But if you stay I know that I'll lose control
And all the things that we've been through
I can't believe all I've done just to protect you
Suffocated by the thin line I walk between
Who I am and who I think I should be
Pointed every finger I could, still nothing's right to me

I am the enemy

Such pain
Climbs like ivy
From my feet to my face

Such pain
Climbs like ivy
From my feet to my face

My only enemy is me
My only enemy is me
My only enemy is me

"Your greatest enemy is your own inner perception, is your own ignorance, is your own ego."
