There passed a summer
Where our children went to war
With conviction without cause
Furnaces in the borough I was born

Dreaming echelons
Above my station

The corners I walked in
I waited and watched
On the corners
I dreamt on in my youth
In my youth

Heartless
Heartless

Now I dream of orion
Sword by side
Sword by side
Protect the night

Hearthless
Hearthless
Sans coeur
Tout sans coeur
