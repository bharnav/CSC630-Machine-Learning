That first night
I near died in your arms
You said " no more your self
I'll let you harm
Over your years
Fear and pressure ill depart
I know it's hard to believe
The languages conceived
Between us
Yes I see how you've travelled
Through deceit and betrayal
You say strong
I say frail
And what I give now
I don't for to receive
But to restore
The strenght you need
And the innocence
To trust my words
Thrust their meaning
To trust when love you are receiving
To lever hope out of the darkness
Of abyss of the cheated heart"

But then I ran away onto my career
Panicking, forecasting
Weather warnings
Severe
I never should have listened
To the fortune teller
Or the prophecies of all mt friends
I should have just
Disappeared that day
Taken time to alone to face
What you dared of me
Intimacy
Intimacy
"and to trust my words
Trust their meaning
To trust when love you are receiving"
To lever hope out of the darkness
Of abyss of the cheated heart"

As you lever hope out from the darkness
Of abyss of the cheated heart

Vertrauen
Vertrauen

"and when you lose
This trust
Remember must
Two fugitives
From the winter months
Rewriting all
The rules of love
Renegades from
The world around
Us"
