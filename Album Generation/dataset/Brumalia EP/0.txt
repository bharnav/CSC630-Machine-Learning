Nunca se olvida
Que siempre viva

Lucy's bitten
Neck is bleeding bad
The teeth have long departed
Yet the desire burns strong
On in desire for destruction
One on which she'll depend
One that ceases to deepen
Into near bitter end

Treasures buried soul deep
And crossed under crack
Now there's no voice
Choice or any road back
Black through the mountains
She turns her loosening ring
Guardian angel sings
"I think you've lost your wings
But you're still yours

Don't give up now
You've still a little will left
Will you be strong
Give song
Fulfill the promises you made
Slave to yourself
Your health and your growing debts
Keep thinking...
"I know I can flourish still
Rewrite these wrongs
Make a home
Make a child
Belong"

Soul deep
Treasures buried
Crossed under crack
Now there's no voice
Choice or any road back
Black through the mountains
Take off your loosening ring
Guardian angel sings
"Come home now find your wings
You're still yours

And now you must love yourself
Like you've never hurt before
Like we've never known hurt before
I think we've lost our wings
