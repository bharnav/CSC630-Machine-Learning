Caught in the drifting years
Between my youth
And adulthood
Must I slow down now?

Between the breaking wave
And the ghost of this town glory days
And the pelican suspension

Here to refuel the passion spent
On our loves tournaments

Into the arms of adventure
Into the arms of combustion
Into the arms of open air

I long to be as careless as I once was
But how do I vapour this pressure off?

This pressure off!

Pe√≤icans go where they dare
There let this be
The shortest day now of my year
Pelicans go where ever
Where 'ere they dare
Into the arms of adventure
Pelicans go where ever
Wehere 'ere they dare
Into th arms of adventure
Pelicans go where ever
Wehere 'ere they dare
Into the arms of daytona

Into the arms
Of the love he's giving
And wade into the salt
The salten air
Open air
The morning mist
Clears... open air
