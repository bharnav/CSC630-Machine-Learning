Every time I go downtown I think I might find you around
I take your picture just in case, anybody's seen-
A girl who's had her better days, just like the last place that you stayed
Where I can see you tipping back the curtains, looking for me

You say. "Baby do you have to go away
Just before the deal gets real sweet
Just before my trouble finally pays off
Can you cover for me?"

I see you coming down the hill
You smile at me like I'm a worn out thrill
As if I have some endless well of dignity
You cut yourself like a high school kid-
I did it once, everybody did
Just to feel the emptying of everything

Just to watch it all go away
Every time the deal gets real sweet
Every time our trouble finally paid off
We said, "Cover for me, cover for me."

It's 2 years of depravity for every year of recovery
And you'll lose eventually, if that's what you need
Of all the friends that make me sad
You're the one I just can't have-
All the numbers that you left me
They just ring and ring

I said, "Baby do you have to go away
Just before the deal gets real sweet
Just before my trouble finally pays off
Can't you cover for me, like I covered for you
