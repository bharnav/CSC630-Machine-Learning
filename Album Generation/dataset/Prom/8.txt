She comes down to Georgia to dance across my kitchen floor
Leavin' black marks on linoleum, a country song on the radio
I am just a rodeo calf with tender feet and sewn on horns and
Love is a kindness that I've never known before
I've never known before

She say's "I'm bound to Carolina to join the kids in 'Truth or Dare'."
And she laughs and says its just a game when I tell her that I'm scared
I am just a dog waitin' at the kitchen door
Love is a kindness that I've never known before
I've never known before

Make it last, make it stay
Can you hold on long enough to make this pay

She said," My daddy was a grifter and I was in my momma's way
So I drifted for a while, because I could not stand to stay."
And she said, "Love is a kindness that I've never understood."
I said, "I'll give it to you willingly, its something you deserve
Its something you deserve."

And I'll make it last, I'll make it stay
If you can hold on long enough I can make this pay

'Cause I am just a calf with tender feet and sewn on horns
