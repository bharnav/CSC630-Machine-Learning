I hear the rock show winding down at the high school
Kids out on the sidewalk, waiting for a ride
All the punks and the queers and the freaks and the smokers
Feel like they'll be waiting for the rest of their lives

All right, I hear what you're saying to me
All right, I hear what I just can't do
But I got this spark, I got to feed it something
Or put it out for good
Or put it out for good

The stadium lights were breaking through the bleachers
I spent all day pushing tissue roses into chicken wire
Hey S.G.A., I'm an overachiever of the wrong persuasion
A pep rally kid, a new gender nation with a new desire

All right, I hear what you're saying to me
All right, I hear what I just can't do
But I got this spark, I got to feed it something
Or put it out for good
Or put it out for good
Or put it out for good
Or put it out for good

Rub up against it 'til it gets inside you
And rub up against it 'til it's understood
Those aren't your friends talking shit about you
Well, we've had it bad, we're gonna make it good

All right, I hear what you're saying to me (rub up against it 'til it's all right)
All right, I hear what I just can't do (rub up against it 'til it's all right)
But we got this spark, we got to feed it something (rub up against it and)
Let it burn for good
Yeah, let it burn for good
And let it burn for good
Yeah, let it burn for good
