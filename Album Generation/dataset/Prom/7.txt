Putting pennies on the track, shiny and flat
It was the best we could be, sexy and free
I grow away from myself with each passing bell-
With all these new accessories, I just stumble and bleed

For a moment I feel the coldness
At the end of a Fall day
I put my hands down deep in my pockets
As my body awakes

So I'm heading back to school all brilliant and new
Trying hard to fit in and not to walk like a man
A girl that I never noticed asked me to hold this-
A secret too hard to tell and I never will

For a moment I feel the coldness
Of everything that's been taken away
I put the phone back in the cradle
I can't make this okay

The damage she'll survive
But damn the sacrifice of
Every life we've lost
Damn all the cost of the assault

You tied a knot and you dared me
The stem of a cherry
To find my own humanity
And just let it breathe

Hold my head up in this moment
Keep myself from fading away
Pull my hands out of pockets and
