In a sea of white faces
I heard the latest version of The Clash
Still no ticket for the races
And the sisters still get the shaft
We got a punk rock problem
I'm tired of playing shirts and skins here
How do we sing against the system
When we're a main offender?

Put it in a blender and let me get the hang
Of how it fits together
And how we came to be

I'm a child
Of the M to M Program
Bus em out to the suburbs
But we never got to know em
I had a sex education
Without a word for my gender
All these half-hearted tries-

Put em in a blender
Let me get the hang of
How we can fit together
And still keep our identity

Now the kids are hip hip hopping
And everybody's co-opting
The straight girls are slumming it
At The Suicide Queers' gig
Yeah, we're all assimilatin'
But we're still segregated
And its all for the market man
He says "Put em in a blender and
See where the money lands."

Put em in a blender and let them get the hang
Of thinking that they've been here
