You ride your John Deere down to the pond
Just to watch me struggle along
You say you got your daddy's seed in you
And you think you're bored with anything there is to do with me

You wipe your hands across your bare chest
And rub your fingers through your crew cut hair
"Expelled from school," you tell me with a grin
"I copped a feel from an ex-girlfriend."

I know you want to break the rules-
We were made by nature's fools
And so you ride all day long, all by yourself
'Til you feel strong-

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything I see

You wanna know why I had to go
Down to the baseball park to see you blow it
All the balls just fall from your hands
And your daddy asks me, "When is he gonna be a man?"

I know you want to change the truth-
We were made by nature's fools
So you ride all night long
With your boys in those muscle cars
And you go down to the city
And laugh at the faggots
Until the girls look pretty and until you feel strong-

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything that you could see

I'm just a magnet for the rural faggots
They come and knock on my door
Just to find they're running out of time
To figure out what they come here for

I know you want to know the truth
And I'm the dyke who will give it to you
By this time next year
You'll know you're queer
It'll all be okay
It'll all be clear
And you'll run away from home
But not to be alone
And you'll go down to the city
Where the boys are pretty

And where you feel strong
Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
