Come a little bit closer
Closer than you are
Cause anything worth it now
Is just gonna be hard
Come a little bit cleaner
Get a little bit mean
Just give me the honesty and
Give it back to me

When I know what's mine
I can put it aside
And give in

Don't give me a reason
Don't give me a break
Just give me the loneliness
Of my own mistakes
And if it falls like a judgment
On everything that we are
Then it's just useless
Something we should discard

What's yours what's mine
Lets put it aside
And give in

Are you afraid
Does it get in the way
Of everything that wants to last
Everything that wants to stay
With all your might
Could you put it aside

And give in
With all my might
I could never put you aside
