I'm a Sober Girl, not for any good reason
I found myself on this road I'm on
It felt a lot like treason
To my last girlfriends, who could never understand
When it comes to love, I wanted purity

I felt the loneliness of the world, in the city so I got out of there
I found myself at the end of a long dirt road
It felt a lot like nowhere
To my last girlfriends, who could never understand
When it comes to life, I wanted purity

When I was young, in every camptown song I sung
I was aching just to be
With someone, who could lay me down where the rivers run
Who was able, who was free

Free of this manmade world and all the bargains we made with fear
That slowly whittle us down to nothing
It felt a lot like despair
But I found someone, who was still standing when it was done
And with the purest heart, she said these words to me-

When I was young, in every camptown song I sung
I was aching just to be
With someone, who could lay me down where the rivers run
Who was able, who was free
