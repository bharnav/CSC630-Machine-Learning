If you need water
I'll be your river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be your river
And my love will carry you through

You like the flame and you are drawn by desire
Watchin' and waitin' in line for your turn
I've learned to walk with my back to the fire
I like the heat but I don't wanna get burned

And if you need water
I'll be your river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be your river
And my love will carry you through

Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence
Ready to crumble at the slightest word
Findin' the right one is becomin' a science
I'd like to scream but I ain't gonna be heard

And if you need water
I'll be your river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be your river
And my love will carry you through

What if all these fears that we both buy into
Melt away and disappear

If you need water
I'll be your river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be your river
And my love will carry you
My love will carry you
My love will carry you through
