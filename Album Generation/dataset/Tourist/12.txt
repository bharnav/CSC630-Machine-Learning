It's the simple things like the robots Stevie G draws
And the ease with which we seem to pull those tricks
There are moments of escape for every one of us
And the beauty in the times that we create

I saw you smiling....
And I need my vehicles and animals
And I will be alright
Take me back to nineteen seventy nine
So I can find my open eyes

He can play all by himself for many hours
I have never seen a kid who's so content
There is nothing from the outside that can touch him
'Cause he's just learning how to be alone with one

I saw you smiling....
And I need my vehicles and animals
And I will be alright
Take me back to nineteen seventy nine
So I can find my open eyes
And I need my vehicles and animals
And I will be alright
Take me back to nineteen seventy nine
So I can find my open eyes

Lying down on my bed
I just got another kick to the head
Oh yeah you're a part of me
Yet another branch on the family tree
Salt on my fingers salt in my cuts
Salt on my face and salt in my guts
It's been a battle but we've come through OK
Stop what you're doing and play

'Cause we've got our vehicles and animals so
We're gonna be alright
There's no need for us to go back in time
Because we've found our open eyes

We've got our vehicles and animals
So we're gonna be alright
There's no need for us to go back in time
Because we've found our open eyes
