Lives in Edinburgh
Just across the road
Sometimes my stereo
And in my aching bones
It's on the sugar hill
And in your ring tone

Shake those windows
Sums and songs and
Beats and rhymes
And I like this blackout
It just helps to
Love those clear night skies

Just let the record play
And bring it back again
You can't appreciate
What we were into then

In two seconds
The beat was recognised
And all the old school heads
Nodded back in time
And though we just met
I've known you all my life

Shake those windows
Sums and songs and
Beats and rhymes
And I like this blackout
It just helps to
Love those clear night skies

Just let the record play
And bring it back again
You can't appreciate
What we were into then

Just let the record play
And bring it back again
You can't appreciate
What we were into then

Just let the record play
And bring it back again
You can't appreciate
What we were into then

Just let the record play
And bring it back again
You can't appreciate
What we were into then

Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go

Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go
Just let yourself go
