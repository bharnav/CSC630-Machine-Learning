Oh, no
Gone and put my foot in it again
Think back
Can't believe that it was me who said that
Last time
I promised I would bite my tongue until I
Counted to 10
(5, 6, 7 and 8 and 9 and 10)

I said, oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, we could be laughing about it
Making the most of the true British climate
Oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've seen
The tension on the high street growing lately
Seems that
You have to be careful who you look at
Sometimes
I can't see things the way you see them
But this is our home

I said, oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, we could be laughing about it
Making the most of the true British climate
Oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, you got the style
And we got the style
And they got the style
And everybody's got it

And you got the style
And we got the style
And they got the style
And everybody's got it

And you got the style
And we got the style
Oh, oh

Oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, we could be laughing about it
Making the most of the true British climate
Oh, it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Spoken:
Playing some good old-time revival music, Eddie
But, Eddie, you're playing some good old-time revival music, Eddie
But, Eddie, you're playing some good old-time revival music, Eddie
But, Eddie, you're playing some good old-time revival music, Eddie
