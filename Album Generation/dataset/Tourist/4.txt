[Refrain]
You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin

[Verse 1]
You got tears making tracks
I got tears that are scared of the facts

[Chorus]
Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I've seen Christmas lights reflect in your eyes

[Refrain]
You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin

[Verse 2]
There's dry blood on your wrist
Your dry blood on my fingertip

[Chorus]
Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I've seen Christmas lights reflect in your eyes

[Verse 3]
First night of your life
Curled up on your own
Looking at you now
You would never know

[Bridge]
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
Alright

[Chorus]
Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I've seen Christmas lights reflect in your eyes
