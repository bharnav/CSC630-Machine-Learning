[RA Nate v/o]
Welcome to Mirrielees orientation.
My name’s Nate, and I’ll be your RA for this year
Today we’ll be moving into our dorms and building community
So go get your keys from the main office, come back
And get ready to meet your roommates…alright??

[MC Lars]
He was the roommate from Hell!
He was the roommate from Hell!

[Verse I]
Satan was my roommate, so junior year was Hell
He lacked social skills and had a pungent smell
When your roommate is the devil it can be extremely whack
Putting posters on the wall of Trapt and Nickelback
Until the break of dawn he’d be mutilating sheep
“It’s 4 am Satan, can you please go to sleep?”
I can’t have girls over when the dorm smells like Sterno
When did room 56 become Dante’s inferno?
He likes death and destruction I like radio and art
He likes holding down Christians and reading Jean-Paul Sartre
While I’m going to class studying my notes
He’s eating baby fetuses and sacrificing goats
He tricks the freshman girls into eating apples
Holding black masses down at the campus Chapel
Should have never moved in, wish I were dead
Should have found a place off campus on Craig’s List instead

[Hook x2]
He was the roommate from Hell, his name is Lucifer
Someone call a priest, and bring the crucifer
He was the roommate from Hell leaves his pitchfork in my bed
I’m in a satanic panic cause he is messing with my head

[Deep Voice v/o]
Yo pass that giant balloon of helium over here, yo

[MC Lars]
Okay but, wait, Satan…that’s too much!

[Verse II: mc chris]
Boy you need a bitch slap
Not my fault we’re mismatched
You geek out over Beakman’s world
I dig on world of Witchcraft
You’re thinking that I’m riff raff, huffing on a dishrag
I am just a player, playing Slayer then I kick back
I know I reek of sulfur, leave the shower curtain open
I come home drunk, make crank calls
To Queens and then Hoboken
But college is like Salem, all these bitches be so smokin’
If you’re thinking that I’m leaving that I’m thinking that you’re jokin'
I gotta share my bunk with this post punk chump
Calls this place a dumb says, “You’ve been through my stuff”
I wish you’d go to Hell I say, Hey that’s where I’m from!
Blasts Death Cab and Devo he’s too emo to get crunk
I was a very nice boss down in Paradise Lost
I had very nice bling cause my minions mind floss
To hell with college, this is knowledge at a very high cost
Gotta go do some blow with that ho…Kate Moss!

[Hook x2]

[Outro: mc chris]
Lars you’re causing laughter when you call yourself a rapper dude
How many Dead Milkman albums are there named after you?
I always got beer. I always got weed. Best roommate ever if you’d ever ask me!
