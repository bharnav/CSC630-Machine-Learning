You can take away my spaceship
You can take away my space suit
You can even take away my space lasers
But you can never, ever take away my space game

I broke through the carbonite that’s how I got free
Jabba, back up, because there’s no stopping me
Post-modern player, sample-tastic
Flow’s ekphrastic, I get drastic
Hey, watch the plastic, yo, I name check
And leave you drowned in space oobleck
Player of the future, watch me go!
Sith girls scream when they hear my flow
These alien chicks reproduce with spores
So I go where no MC has gone before
Hey Fry, look, we can still be friends
I won’t ask Leela out again. Sci-fi, I try, I fly solo
Shoot your landspeeder up just like Bolo
“What’s with Lars, and what’s with his name?”
Never mind that ish, ’cause I’ve got space game!

[Hook]
Darth Maul can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Boba Fett can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Vader can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Space player bowling up like dynamite
Dr. Smith can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Q can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Even Hal can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Because I’ve got space game and it feels all right

In 2112, all the players play on
Everyone bumps Rush and that “Tom Sawyer” song
I took the red pill and high fived Neo
Hey, what should I sample? “If it sells pick Dio!”
Yo Morpheus, look, you’re a real cyberpunk
But your friend Trinity has junk in the trunk
And I’m from Mars, and she’s from Venus
She has ovaries and I have a light saber
‘Cause I get more play than Captain Kirk
He found out and went berserk like a jealous jerk
But no puny Vulcan death grip can paralyze me
I said beam me up Scotty, and then I got free
Princess Leia said that my flows are tight
So I said I supposed she can spend the night
A long time ago in a galaxy far away…
MC Lars got some space age play!

[Hook]
T1000 can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Magneto can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Even Zod can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
It’s tight, don’t even try to bite, the sci-fi style I incite
Mr. Spock can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
The Wrath of Khan can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
The Borg can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Because I’ve got space game and it feels all right

[MC Lars:] Yo DJ Hal! Bring that beat back
[Hal 9000:] I’m sorry Lars, I’m afraid I can’t do that
[MC Lars:] So what can you do?
[Hal 9000:] I can play this awesome guitar solo

This song is futuristic, so hardcore
Hey T.S. Eliot! Please shut the door
Because modernism is so passé
The postmodern revolution is here to stay
In the house tonight because of Frank Lloyd Wright
The bass goes “boom!” like dynamite
“Yo, Wright was a modernist!”
Yeah I know that, all right
But you can’t rhyme “Bob Venturi’ with “dynamite”
See it’s Guernica Part II when I storm the stage
I draw fans like Warhol draws soup cans on the page
Did I say postmodern? Well, that was a lie!
I’ve been post-postmodern since junior high

[Hook]
Ezra Pound can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Virginia Wolfe can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Joseph Conrad can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
I excite the modern mind like a ray of light
Franz Kafka can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
Wallace Stevens can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
E.E. Cummings can’t stop me (I’m on fire tonight)
I’ve got postmodern game and it feels all right

Yes I’m an alien, I come from outer space
Yes I’m an alien, I came to rock this place
