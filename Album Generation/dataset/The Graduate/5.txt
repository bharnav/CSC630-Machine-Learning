(Lars you're on in ten minutes, you ready?)
I guess but I still gotta write some lyrics
(Aiight, just remember, it's crunk night)
In that case, I guess it won't be a problem

This popular subgenre is brought to you by materialism
We'd like to thank Bentley, Alize champagne and Sean John clothing
We'd like to thank the record industry for
Marketing hip-hop stereotypes to 12-year-olds
And a pop culture that unquestioningly consumes vapid, superficial entertainment
