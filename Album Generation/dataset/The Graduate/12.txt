Move over Kevin Bacon, 'cause I've got a new game
It's called "Six Degrees of Kurt Cobain"
The man was an icon of Generation X
A sound between Joy Division and NOFX (what?)
Let's dissect this album called "Nevermind"
Produced by Butch Vig of Garbage not Sublime
Butch toured with U2, who wrote a song called "Bad,"
Just like Michael Jackson, this next part is rad
"Weird Al" made fun of "Bad," and Nirvana too
It brings us back to Kurt (here we go) (round two)
Kurt was in a band with Mr. Dave Grohl
Dave was in Scream, that's the band not the movie
Courtney loved to scream for a band called Hole
She married Kurt Cobain and had a troubled soul
Some people said she killed him, but that could be a lie
Kurt wrote a song called "I Hate Myself and Want to Die"
Courtney Love landed "Man on the Moon"
Where Jim Carrey sang a song
From the Mighty Mouse cartoon
Danger Mouse not Mighty Mouse worked with the Beatles
He mixed them with Jay Z the whole thing was illegal
Speaking of illegal Jack White did some time
He hit another guy and assault is a crime
So "Get Behind Me Satan" was loved by Rolling Stone
Which leaves us with a cover... Kurt Cobain all alone
Issue 897... check the cover
