The following is an entirely fictional account
Any similarities between people living or dead is entirely
Coincidental… just kidding

She fell from the sky on a black October night
She wrote these funny songs and every one was tight
She asked me for advice on jump-starting her career
But I’m staring in her eyes as she’s talking in my ear
Suburban rap queen, I wrote this song for you
Suburban rap queen, what’s an MC to do?
Suburban rap queen, every Biggie needs a Kim
Suburban rap queen, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win

[Hook]
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, I like you a lot
You’ve got what it takes to rock that Lars emo spot
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, now tell me what to do
When the playback is too quiet and the
Song’s already through

This is called a breakbeat!
It’s the musical element hip-hop
Was founded on back in 1969
That’s educational

She fell from the sky with a superhero icon
We battled in the studio like, “Hey, yo, is this mic on?”
I went down for the count, she went up on the beat
I told her she was hot because stuff like that is sweet
She attacked me with her similes like killer bees at a park
I came back with a metaphor, an angry great white shark
The bass line that she struck threw me flat on my back
So I came back with a track in a lyrical attack

[REPEAT Hook]

Because girls are so confusing, and I guess they’ll always be
I should just become a monk, resign to celibacy
Then I’d never have to worry about what a hug might mean
See these girls who want to be your friend
May be just what they seem
We had burritos in your dorm and talked about Dizzee Rascal
We wrote a song together, recorded it, and that’s all
Romantic love is fear of waking up alone
In Redwood City with platonic voice mail on your phone

[REPEAT Hook]

Rapgirl, Rapgirl (Rapgirl, Rapgirl)
Suburban rap queen
I wrote this song for you
Rapgirl, Rapgirl (Rapgirl, Rapgirl)
Suburban rap queen
What’s an MC to do?
