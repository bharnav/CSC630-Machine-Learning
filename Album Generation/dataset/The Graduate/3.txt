[REPEAT Hook]
Hot Topic uses contrived identification with youth sub-cultures
To manufacture an antiauthoritarian identity and
Make millions.
That $8 you paid for the Mudvayne poster
Would be better spent used for seeing your brother’s
Friend’s band
DIY ethics are punk rock!
Starting your own label is punk rock!
GG Allin was punk rock!
But when a crass corporate vulture feeds on mass consumer culture then spending Mommy’s money is not punk rock!
