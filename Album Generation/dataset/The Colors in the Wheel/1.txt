Something has to come out
Is it words is it not
S'posed to come from my mouth

Is it pen is it blood
Is it ink must it be
What I think?

It's my guts
It's my all that i am
I can tell one more story
Four score and then and then
Once upon an old time
And then do it again
And then do it again

Let your no be no
And your yes mean yes
My no means no
My yes means yes
Yes yes yes
Yes
Yes...

Something has to come out
Is it words is it not
S'posed to come from my mouth

I must speak
I must move
I must sing
It's a compulsive thing

Is it fear
Is it deep down beneath
I have something to say
Some trash amongst the golden things
Here's a diamond for you
An alluminum ring
An alluminum (???)

Let your no be no
And your yes mean yes
My no means no
My yes means yes
Yes yes yes
Yes
Yes...

And so the story goes
Bite down until it hurts
In a dried up fashion
Diamonds out of dirt
And so the story goes
The truth will be told
There's a (comb???) in my mouth
I can feel it (???)

Let your no be no
My yes mean yes
My no means no
My yes means yes
Yes yes yes
Yes
Yes...

And so the story goes
Bite down until it hurts
In a dried up fashion
Diamonds out of dirt
And so the story goes
The truth will be told
There's a (???) in my mouth
(???) i can't handle the pressure
Darling i can't handle the pressure
Darling i can't handle the pressure
Yeah it hurts
(???)
Yes it hurts
