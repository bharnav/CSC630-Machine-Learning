Try to go to sleep
Try, try baby
Try to go to sleep
Try, try baby

Try to go to sleep
Try to slow your breathing
Try to go to sleep
Try to slow your breathing

This burden that has followed you
Has fallen now into the sea
Just lay your head upon my chest
And listen to my heartbeat

Try to go to sleep
Try to slow your breathing
I'll rock you on my knee
Sing you through the morning

This burden that has followed you
Has fallen now into the sea
Just lay your head upon my chest
And listen
And listen to my heartbeat

Try to go to sleep
Try, try baby
Try to go to sleep
Try, try baby
Rock you on my knee
Sing you through the morning
