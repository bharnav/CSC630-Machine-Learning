Feeling really so social, i'll ride the bar car for a while
The Chat Man is conversational, but soon we'll both be so tired
The Character catches my "I say"
He's a long song on a summer night
He shoots me down with his green gaze
I'm in love with his lullaby

I see all the girls waltz by
That wish that they were with you
I must say we're all quite surprised that you're so good and so cool
I see you looking at me
Oh, how I hate to admit that I've been looking at you
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on

I'm Sipping Straight and you're Pink Champagne
You're the man in white in a big glass house
I like a mess in 1962
And I just like you around

I see all the girls waltz by
That wish that they were with you
I must say we're all quite surprised that you're so good and so cool
I see you looking at me
Oh, how I hate to admit that O've been looking at you
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on

I'm Sipping Straight and you're Pink Champagne

I see all the girls waltz by
That wish that they were with you
I must say we're all quite surprised that you're so good and so cool
I see you looking at me
Oh, how I hate to admit that I've been looking at you
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on!
