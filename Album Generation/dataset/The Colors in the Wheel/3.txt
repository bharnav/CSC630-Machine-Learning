Do you want to fight me
With your one good leg?
And do you think you can beat me?
Why don't you wait until you get out of bed?

Well you're throwing frantic punches at the rate of snow
If you'd break in half then you could let it go
You're eighty pounds of wreckage in a mason jar
You're a bit combustible, don't break

So you want to fight me
With your one good eye?
And do you think you can beat me?
Hm, well come on, come on

Well you're holding back the candy like a one year old
If you'd break in half then you could let it go
You're eighty pounds of wreckage in a mason jar
You're a bit combustible, don't break

Something wicked this way comes
Is it God's or is it yours?
It's a bit uncomfortable
Oh, don't kill the messenger

Well you're throwing frantic punches at the rate of snow
If you'd break in half then you could let it go
You're eighty pounds of wreckage in a mason jar
You're a bit combustible
Don't break my heart

So you wanna fight me?
Well, you said you want to fight me?
Come on, come on
