Mood perpetuates mood
Tune perpetuates tune
One line touches the other fine

Fear perpetuates fear
Tears perpetuate tears
One line touches the other fine

The ground is grown
The blue stars are blooming
The seeds are falling out
The problem is the ground is on the side
And the sky is on the down
Turn me around

Calm perpetuates calm
Songs perpetuate songs
One hand quietly touches mine

Blue stars are blooming
The seeds are being thrown
The problem is the ground is on the side
And the sky is on the down
Turn me around

The ground is grown
The blue stars are blooming
The seeds are blowing by
The problem is the ground is on the side
And the sky is on the down
Turn me around
