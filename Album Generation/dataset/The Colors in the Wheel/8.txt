It's always the same
Don't you wish that something would change?
It's always the same
Don't you itch for something to change?

Have hot chocolate in June
Put something wild in your tea
For it's a crisis I agree
It's constantly 72 degrees

It's always the same
Don't you wish that something would change?
It's always the same
Don't you itch for something to change?

Have a bath in your swimsuit
Open your hand, you'll get something for free
For it's a crisis I agree
It's constantly 72 degrees

Ahhhhhh

It's always the same
Don't you itch for something to change?
It's always the same
Don't you wish
Don't you wish that something would change?

It's always the same
Don't you itch for something to change?
It's always the same
Don't you wish that something would change?

Ahhhhhh
