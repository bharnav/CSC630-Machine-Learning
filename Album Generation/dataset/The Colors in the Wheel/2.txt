I saw the one go out the window
I saw the one go up the dam
And come back down
And come back down again

What is this?
If not to know and be known
To share your plate
This seemingly impossible obstacle
Oh, it's been a dark time

I remember it well
It is in me still
I have seen that I can die
I'm reminded and I wave my own flag

I saw the one go out the window
I saw the one go up the dam
And come back down
And come back down again

School of fish
One's lending me hope
Who share their plates
Fighting for truth, joy, justice, or
Just try again
Or lend a kind eye
I could just give up
Maybe sleep all day
Turn the TV on
Or wave my own flag

I saw the one go out the window
I saw the one go up the dam
And come back down
And come back down again
Again, again
I'll try again
