Wait as all the signs swirl around
I've been in this bed four months now
Falling out of the sky
I can look at myself from the ground
Well, hello

Is this how it is?
You separate the coarse from the loud
You break me down
You wear me out
Asleep with all the lights on
You're seeing me doubt
Oh, what was once a lion is just a bird to me now
Oh, help

Is this how it is?
You separate the red from the brown
You forget what it is you were going to say
It doesn't mean much now
It doesn't mean much now
You break me down

Wishing all the bricks untied themselves
Rode in on the broken back of my health
Oh

Is this how it is now?
You separate the quiet and the proud
I think I'll stay in, but it's so nice outside
There's a war I'm losing
Of pins to lightning strikes
I'm found out
You wear me out
Asleep with all the lights on

You're seeing me doubt
What was once a lion is just a bird to me now
I need you now
