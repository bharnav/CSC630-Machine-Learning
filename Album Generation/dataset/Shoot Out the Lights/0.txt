[Verse 1]
Remember when we were hand in hand
Remember we sealed it with a golden band
Now your eyes don't meet mine
You've got a pulse like fever
Do I take you for a lover
Or just a deceiver?

[Chorus]
Simple is simple and plain is plain
If you leave me now you won't come back again
When the game is up
Ah, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
No, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
Ah no, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love

[Verse 2]
Well give me just an ounce of sympathy
Give me my chains of liberty
There's a rope that binds us
And I don't want to break it
If love is a healing
Why should we forsake it?

[Chorus]
Well hunger is hunger and need is need
Am I just another mouth to feed?
When the game is up
Well, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
No, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
No, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love

[Chorus]
When my heart breaks it breaks like the weather
If you leave me now, it'll thunder forever
Oh, don't give it up
Well, well, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
Ah no, don't renege on our love (don't renege on our love)
No, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love
