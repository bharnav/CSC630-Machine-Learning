In the shuffling madess
Of the locomotive breath
Runs the all-time loser
Headlong to his death
He feels the piston scraping --
Steam breaking on his brow --
Old charlie stole the handle and
The train won't stop going --
No way to slow down
He sees his children jumping off
At the stations -- one by one
His woman and his best friend --
In bed and having fun
He's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees --
Old charlie stole the handle and
The train won't stop going --
No way to slow down
He hears the silence howling --
Catches angels as they fall
And the all-time winner
Has got him by the balls
He picks up gideons bible --
Open at page one --
Old charlie stole the handle and
The train won't stop going --
No way to slow down
