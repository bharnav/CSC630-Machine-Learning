[Intro]
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, all I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 2]
I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 2]
I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 1]
All I need is my baby
Get back home, care for all my needs

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Bridge]
Well, the doctor said I need rest
He put me on the critical list
Keeping me safe from harm
All I need is her sweet charm

He gave me a medicated lotion
That wouldn't do, ooh yeah
My emotion

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor (Ooh yeah)
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

(It's just my neurosis)
(I, I, I got my own diagnosis)
(I see you)
(You see me)
(At full health)

[Bridge]
Bring it, bring it now, come on
Well, the doctor said I need rest
He put me on the critical list
Keeping me safe from harm
All I need is her sweet charm

He gave me a medicated lotion
That wouldn't do, ooh yeah
My emotion

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor (Yeah)
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor (No doctor)

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor (No doctor)

[Outro]
I don't need no doctor
Oh yeah
It's been a gas, baby
Get that out of my face!
