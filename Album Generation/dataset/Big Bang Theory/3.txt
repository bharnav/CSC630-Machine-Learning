[Verse 1]
You have made great planes that span the sky
Gave sight to the blind with other men's eyes
Why you can crush any country in a matter of weeks
So it don't make sense that you can't make peace

[Verse 2]
You take one man's heart and make another man live
You even go to the moon and you come back thrilled
You make a deaf man hear and a dumb man speak
So it don't make sense that you can't make peace
No it don't make sense that you can't make peace

[Verse 3]
You can make a transfusion that can save a life
You can change the darkness into broad daylight
You make a submarine stay submerged for weeks
So it don't make sense that you can't make peace

[Bridge]
(If you can't make peace)
You know it don't make sense
I know it don't make sense (If you can't make peace)
We know it don't make sense
That you can't make peace (If you can't make peace)
No it don't make sense (If you can't make peace)
It don't make sense
It's supposed to be a peaceful world
Peaceful world

[Outro]
(It don't make sense if we can't make peace)
You know it don't make sense (If you can't make peace)
You know it don't make sense (If you can't make peace)
You know it don't make sense (Oh, if you can't make peace)
(It don't make sense if we can't make peace)
You can't make peace, oh (If you can't make peace)
(It don't make sense if we can't make peace)
No (If you can't make peace)
It don't make sense that you can't make peace
(It don't make sense if we can't make peace)
Oh, it don't make sense (If you can't make peace)
Oh, it won't make sense (If you can't make peace)
