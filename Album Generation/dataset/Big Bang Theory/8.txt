Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. Over
I'm in orbit around the third planet from the star called
The sun. Over
You mean it's the Earth? Over
Positive. It is known to have some form of intelligent species. Over
I think we should take a look
{intro slowwed down talking ends}
Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?
{start slowwed down}
Strange beautiful, grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?
{end slowwed down}
Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
And you'll
Never hear
Surf music again
{start slowwed down... Rough guess at lyrics}
Secret
Oh, secret
Oh
Shhhh...
{end slowwed down}
