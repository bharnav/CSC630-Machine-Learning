[Verse 1]
Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin' dirty-'n'-gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people lookin' half dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match-head

[Refrain]
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be all right
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

[Verse 2]
Cool town, evening in the city
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat, looking for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
'Til I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Runnin' upstairs, gonna meet you on the roof top

[Refrain]
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be all right
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

[Verse 3]
Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin' dirty-'n'-gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people lookin' half dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match-head

[Refrain]
But at night it's a different world (oh yeah)
Go out and find a girl (find a girl)
Come on, come on and dance all night (all night)
Despite the heat, it'll be all right
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

Oh yeah

[Outro]
Hot city
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
In the city
