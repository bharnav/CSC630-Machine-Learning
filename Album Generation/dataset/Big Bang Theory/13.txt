[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, I'm gonna be a blue collar man

[Verse 1]
Give me a job, give me security
Give me a chance to survive
I'm just a poor soul in the unemployment line
My God, I'm hardly alive
Mother, father, wife and my friends
I see them laugh in my face
I got the power, and I got the will
I'm not a charity case

[Hook]
I'll take those long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my eye to the keyhole
If it takes all that to be just what I am
I'm gonna be a blue collar man, yeah
Gonna be, yes I am
A blue collar man

[Verse 2]
Make me an offer that I can't refuse
Make me respectable, man
This is my last time in the unemployment line (Hey hey)
So like it or not I'll take the

[Chorus]
Long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall (Wanna be a blue collar man)
If it takes all that to be just what I am (Hey hey hey)
I'm gonna be a blue collar man

[Bridge 1]
Keeping my mind on a better life (Yeah yeah)
Where happiness is only a heartbeat away (Do the best I can)
A heartbeat away
Paradise, (Yeah) can it be all I heard it was
I close my eyes (Oh yeah) and maybe I'm already there, hey hey

Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take the long nights, (Yeah) impossible odds
Keeping my eye to the keyhole (Wanna be a blue collar man)
If it takes all that to be just what I am (Hey hey hey)
I'm gonna be a blue collar man

[Bridge 2]
Oh, yes I am
I'm gonna be
Blue collar man
Come on
I am what I am

[Chorus]
And I'll take the long nights, (Yeah) impossible odds
Keeping back to the wall (Wanna be a blue collar man)
And if it takes all that
All that (All that) to be just what I am (Hey hey hey)
I'm gonna be a blue collar
Gotta be a blue collar
Gonna be a blue collar man

[Outro]
Hey, hey
I'm gonna be (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Do the best I can
Gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Hey, I'm gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Yeah, I'm gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Every time I look at you, I see something I could do (Uh-huh)
Gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Yeah, gonna be a blue collar man (Gonna be a blue collar man)
I am what I am (Gonna be a blue collar man)
Gonna be a blue collar man
Oh, I told you when I look at you
Something I just wanna do
Hey, blue collar man
