Talkin about the good times
Talkin about the good times
Talkin about the good times

She had sun in her face
Her lips kiss the sun
Arrest the sun
Fields of light we found the place

She had sun in her eyes
The clouds crossed the sun
Without the sun
The evening shadows in her eyes

Takin about the good times [4x]

She had breaded her hair
The grass jumped through the rain
Reach to the rain
Tears of mystic rain in the air

She had tears in her eyes
The skies turned to gray
Melt away
Shining streaks in rain that day

Talkin about the good times [4x]

Good times [4x]
