Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you not goin' anywhere
Running around town singin' your blues
You know you ain't goin' anywhere
You've always been a good friend of mine
But just keep saying farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And one day the sun will shine through
You've always got somethin' to hide
Somethin' you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

But I know what you're wishing for
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you keep saying farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well
In the wishing well
In the wishing well
Everybody's got a dream and they take it to the wishing well
Everybody's got a dream, hah
Wishing well
