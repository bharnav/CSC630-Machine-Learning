A knock at the door means
Hello, Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara Falls
Daddy, don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you
A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But I would rather take you
For a test drive
Daddy, don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you
While I look out on the passing fields
The sun through the bugs on the windshield
Makes me feel like I don't matter
A knock on the door means
Hello, Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara Falls
