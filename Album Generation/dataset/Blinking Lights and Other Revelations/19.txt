Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out till you got no more?
Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world?
Hey man, now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what this life is all about

Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill (hey)
But hey man, now I'm really living

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch?
Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh-cut grass
And thought about the moment and when it will pass?
Hey man, now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what this life is all about

Now what would you say if I told you that
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat?
Hey man, now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out till you got no more?
Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world?
Hey man, now you're really living

People, sing
(Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out till you got no more?
Hey man, now you're really living)

Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill
Hey man, now I'm really living

People, hey
