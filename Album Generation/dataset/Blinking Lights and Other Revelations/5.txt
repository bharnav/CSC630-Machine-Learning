You think you'll get under ol' monsieur's lid
And try to imagine all the things that he did
You don't know where I'm gonna go
You don't know where I'll go

I'll go none too bravely into the night
I'm so tired of living the suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Wake up in the night and think of all the years
Falling from the ceiling and covering your ears
You don't know how you're gonna get out
You don't know how you'll get out

I'll go none too bravely into the night
I'm so tired of living the suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Call up your best friend and tell him a lie
You've got to be kidding, I'm not really high
I don't know where I'm gonna go
I don't know where I'll go

I'll go none too bravely into the night
I'm so tired of living the suicide life
That ain't no reason to live
