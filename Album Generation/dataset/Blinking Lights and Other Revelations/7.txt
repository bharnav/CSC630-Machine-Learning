I feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues
Not much to see and not much left to lose

And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer
But I'll know how to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood

And I guess I may never understand
The times that I live in
Are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now and this train is just too slow

And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer
But I'll know how to find my way back
