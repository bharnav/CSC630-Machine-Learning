Ten pounds and a head of hair
Came into without a care
What they thought were cries were little laughs
Only looking forward and moving fast

The little bundle had arrived
And I was happy to be alive
In a magic world

Long days and dreaming nights
Wide eyes take in all the sights
A little wonder goes a long, long way
Learning where to go and what to say

Say hello to your new son
Well he sure is having fun
In a magic world

Every moment's built to last
When you're living without a past
In a magic world
