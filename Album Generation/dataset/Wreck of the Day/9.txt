[Verse 1: Anna Nalick]
L.A. lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
Still wanna go?
Cause something here
In the way, in the way that we're constantly moving
Reminds you of home

[Hook 1]
So you're taking these pills
For to fill up your soul
And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that you're making
But me, I'm the catalyst

[Verse 2]
When you say love is a simple chemical reaction
Can't say I agree
Cause my chemical, yeah, left me a beautiful disaster
Still love's all I see

[Hook 2]
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul
And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making
But you, you're the catalyst

[Bridge]
You'll be the vein, you'll be the pain, you'll be the scar
You'll be the road, rolling below, the wheels of a car
And all of my thoughts on God, don't know if I'm strong enough now
You'll be the vein, you'll be the pain
You'll be the
Catalyst

These L.A. lights, no no
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco
Do you wanna go?
Still wanna go
