Well it's been almost a year to the moment
When I finally realized it was over
And I knew that love wasn't good enough of a reason for me to stay
Well I saw you yesterday, you were driving
And I'd tried so hard to forget you were alive
And as you passed by I began to cry
Over things that I did not say

*And hiding beneath my blankets and sheets I'm finally fine
I'm killing the ghost of you and I'm close to awakening me

So I'm taking my heart and I'm getting me out
And love's something that I wouldn't wanna live without
So I'm taking my heart and gettng me out on my own

Well it takes all of my strength to be stable
And I force your insults under the table
And if you were wise you would compromise
And allow me to live my way
'Cause I am not a force to reckoned with
And you don't have a clue what you're messing with
And you can't see to the best in me
'Cause it's more than your heart can take

*

I'm taking my heart and I'm setting me free
And baby now you're just another song to me
And the edge of your sword isn't sharp enough
For me to bleed
