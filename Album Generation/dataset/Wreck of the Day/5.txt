On the ground
With my world
Upside down
I got a vision of your face
And I must get me out
For so many memories we've yet to make
God don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again

Forever love
Say your love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so
I can hold you in my soul
If I go
I know

When you smile
With those eyes
Baby it's like
You place a finger on my heart
And your lips next to mine
Make me think that maybe heavens where you are
God don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again

Forever love
Say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so
I can hold you in my soul
And if I go
I'll know

La la la la...

Forever love
Say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so
I can hold you in my soul
And If I go
I know
Forever love
Say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so
I can hold you in my soul
And if I go
I'll know
