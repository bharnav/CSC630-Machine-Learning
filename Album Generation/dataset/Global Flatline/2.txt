This virulent strain, by man created
Begotten by pestis and mentally devolved into procreation
We spread disease
Pathogenic choul, a miscreation
Bland farce perceived

Foul pathogenic properties
Man is the origin of disease
We are uncreation spiritual devastation
This virulent strain, by man created
A prolific game of shock and awe, meticulously orchestrated
And we are left to weep
Procrastinatinour epidemic

Let it be known that we are death
The bastard offspring of selfish filth
What man has created man shall destroy
Our legacy is the biggest joke of all

Istochnik bolezni [источник болезни]
The origin of disease
Istochnik bolezni [источник болезни]
Rapture forlorn
Istochnik bolezni [источник болезни]
The origin of disease
Istochnik bolezni [источник болезни]
The end of it all

This virulent strain, by man created
Begotten by pestis and mentally devolved into procreation

We spread disease
Pathogenic choul, a miscreation, global termination
