Al shall fall for my clerical hallucinations
Reallity distorted, a murderous trance
3 million dead, 3 million entombed
Misanthropic insanity

A clear path to become god - relentless bloodshed

Deprecation, aberration, hysteria
Maniacal urge to mruder the world
My path to become god
By the saw and blade I will cleanse
The world from all the walking filth
End of an age, maniacal rage
Rabid thrist for death
Foul carnal corruption
A sack of flesh coming to its end
A divine modulation, the ending of an age

I did thy bidding, I did thy killing you gave me purpose
I follow the voices inside my head

The Kallinger theory - 3 million dead
A task fulfilled with great rancor
Emissary of the dead
The path to enlightenment
Emissary of the dead

I did thy bidding, I did thy killing you gave me purpose
I follow the voices inside my head
The Kallinger theory - 3 million dead
The Kallinger theory - entranced and depraved
The Kallinger theory - 3 million dead
The Kallinger theory - entranced and decayed
