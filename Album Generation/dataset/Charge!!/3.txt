Deep in the mountains
Beyond the jungle
Lies a secret cave
Where the tigers roam
There is a rider
The thunder-bringer
He waits upon his throne
Until he's ready to ride

Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger

The super-villian
He's so cartoonish
His fiendish plots and plans
Have been put to action
He is Time Sprinkler
Defrigerated
He's launched an army of creeps
And now the rider must ride

Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger
Ride
Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger

Grab ahold of the lightning bolt and ya
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
What!

Ride
Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger

His name is Mik Lik
That is translated
To mean the champion of hope and glory
He will bring justice
Destroy the evil
Pull down the lightning bolt
From the sky as he rides

Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger
Ride
Woah
He rides
Ride the tiger

Grab ahold of the lightning bolt and ya
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
Grab ahold of the lightning bolt and ya
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
Pull down the lightning
(Ride the lightning)
Slash all those who do oppose
What!
