Well here I am underground
Waiting in my metal fortress of sound
Lets get it on
But its all ready now
Robot gorilla's how
A million pounds of steel
Fuzzy dice and steering wheel
Woah, I know a way to make an escape
And get away
Woah
There can be no mistake
About the greatest ape of all
One man stands as the lone magician
Sending in plays to the ape transmission now
Who can face
Who can face
Who can face the unbelievable
Mechanical Ape?
Who can face
Who can face
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape?
And I say, woah
Oh-oh-oh(Mechanical Ape!)
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!)
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!)
You cannot deface the
Mechanical Ape
Woah-oh-oh-oh
So flip a switch, turn it on
Make it run through all the fire and guns
And make it punch some- wha!!
We will fight our way out
Monkey bit our way out
Point the mouse, render
And never surrender!
W-w-w-way to go!
N-n-n-Not too slow!
Get up get up get
Lets go!
Get up Get up get
Lets go!
Oh oh oh oh
