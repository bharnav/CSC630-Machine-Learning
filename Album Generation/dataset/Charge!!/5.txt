There is a girl she is brand new
So shiny vinyl-y
So finally we know what to do
And she is toxic what I hear
And just like plasticine
I want to squish her
Because she's perfect
She's plastic
She's perfectly plastic
Everybody wants to kiss her
Perfect plastic lips
They said to get away
But I can't give her the slip
It makes me wonder if this world is plastic
A-woah-woah you're really artificial
It makes me wonder if you might think
That I may be artificial myself
It makes me wonder if this world is plastic
A-woah-woah you're really artificial
It's officially official!
You know that girl she's out of touch
So squeaky, freaky, and I'm thinking
That she may be too much
And she's a genius did you know?
And yeah, I'm sure she really cares about you
It's officially official
Kiss those plastic lips!
