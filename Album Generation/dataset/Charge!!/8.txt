I am just a man
I do the things i can
There is capacity for I am a human
Cars and radios
Television codes[?]
Noisy animals jam transmissions
I will go to work
Just like captain Kirk
I will hear the noise
[The standard?] feedback
[I will smell Chee-tos?]
That is how it goes
[And then the nachos in my?] head explode, yeah!

And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
He didn't wanna
He didn't wanna have a meltdown
But he had one
And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
Well he was tryin'
Really really tryin' not to have one
But he had one!

I cannot control
I am overload
So many of these things
Can control me
There is Murphy's law
There is Newton's law
Things go wrong
And then they fall down on me
Why do many things
Change around me?
What? my comfort zone
Has been invaded
It has come to this
And now I must
And now I must surgically remove myself!

And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
He didn't wanna
He didn't wanna have a meltdown
But he had one
And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
Well he was tryin'
Really really trying not to have one
But he had one!

[Sample:]
I suggest you double the intensity!

And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
He didn't wanna
He didn't wanna have a meltdown
But he had one
And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
Well he was tryin'
Really really tryin not to have one
But he had one!

And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
He didn't wanna
He didn't wanna have a meltdown
But he had one
And then he had a meltdown
He had a meltdown
Well he was tryin'
Really really really really really really really really
Trying not to have one
