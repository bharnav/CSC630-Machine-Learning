Found myself on the run again but my motorcycle crashed into a barbed wire fence
I could’ve sworn you were following me in a run away soviet submarine
I saw your face in the rearview mirror, I turn around and your not there
Now I'm trapped in a building and I'm tied to the top
An I'm trying to make it out before the bomb goes off

I think I know, its like id seen it all before
And I think I know
So please keep quiet don’t spoil the ending

I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie

Coming after you and its getting dark
Your fumbling your keys and your car won't start
There’s a kid down your back with giant crazy words
There’s a kindly old wizard on the wings of a bird

I think I know, its like id seen it all before
And I think I know
So please keep quiet don’t spoil the ending

I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie

Is this a tragic end for me?
Or will the sequel set me free?
If you want to know if this is imitation or something real
If you want to be here in my feature film
Then take your plane and sail off

Oh oh oh oh o ohoh

I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
I'm stuck (stuck) in a movie now
Feels like I'm stuck in a movie
