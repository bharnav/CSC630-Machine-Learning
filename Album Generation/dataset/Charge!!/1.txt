See them creep out to nightlife
You see them walk the streets
These children of the undead look
Dressed for the endless Halloweens
And this horror like production
Takes so little dedication
Of black clothes and pale complexions
Rock jet black hair to match their makeup

And who can blame them?
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions-
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me?
Can you get hip to what I'm saying?
These fashion zombies don’t walk this world alone

So lock those doors and windows
They crawl the malls to shop
For tight black jeans and spiky belts
And scissors for the Zelda cut
And there is no explanation
These creatures are just victims
Dressed in expensive fashions
To look like they crawled out of coffins

And who can blame them?
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions-
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me?
Can you get hip to what I'm saying?
These fashion zombies don’t walk this world alone

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To accessorize their black zipper hood
And monster children with monster faces
Are looking for love in all the wrong places

And who can blame them?
They walk through asphalt cemeteries
Zombie fashions-
They must have been born that way
So can you hear me?
Can you get hip to what I'm saying?
These fashion zombies don’t walk this world alone

So can you hear me?
Can you get hip to what I'm saying?
These fashion zombies don’t walk this world alone
