Summer's easy feeling for you flows
The western sky's a blue kaleidoscope
The city's fine, but I don't really care
If I can stretch an arm and find you there
Summer's easy feeling for you flows
We'll make the sky a blue kaleidoscope
The city sighs, the wind takes hold of cares
And I just stretch my arm and find you there
