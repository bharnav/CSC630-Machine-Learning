Mystery come to me, can't you see that I am free for you now?
Birds and bees, shady trees
Liberty, just a word to commandeer
Liberty coming into focus here
Mystery, can't you see I am here for you now, I feel it
Ocean roar, misty moor, paint has peeled from the door
Mystery, live with me, I can't sleep till you're revealed
