We got walls and prank calls
Hey you know who that's coming from
Some old lover who ain't getting none

We got flowers by the bed
We got a silverleaf hanging over our head
That we painted for Yoko Ono

I have you, you have mem
You know while love may never truly be free
Hey it's cheaper than the price of gasoline (yes it is)

Love each minute, live each hour
Embrace them all like a meteor shower
Believing the sky is doing it just for you, and you and you too

In our walls, prank calls
You know who that's coming from
Some old lover who ain't getting none (x3)
