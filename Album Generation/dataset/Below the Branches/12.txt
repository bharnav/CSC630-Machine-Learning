Ain't no world like the world that we got here, ain't no place I'd rather go
Ain't nowhere I'd rather be, dear, I close my eyes and I am home
Ain't no world like the world that we got here
Not to say there's not trouble by the pound
But I hear it's clear through the atmosphere and it's beautiful spinning around
You're gonna miss your lover when she leaves you
And you'll miss your water when it's gone
Sometimes some things here deceive you, sometimes a life seems too long
