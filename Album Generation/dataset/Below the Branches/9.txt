The river is the holy ghost
Aquatic master of the theory of flow
And well well, when my well had gone dry
Hey then you come along
And lift a cup up to my teary eye
Ain't it a shame how the rain got stuck up in the willow tree?
And it never found it's way on down to me

I think of a scenario of you and the stereo
And now the sun pours through the window to the right
And now the sun pours through the window and it's all right
Hey now the sun comes through the window and it's all right

Ain't it a shame how the rain got stuck up in the willow tree?
And it never found it's way on down to me
You come at me in stereo
I took you in and let her go
And now the sun comes through the window to the right
Hey now the sun comes through the window and it's all right
Hey now the sun comes through the window and it's all right
Hey now the sun comes through the window and it's all right
