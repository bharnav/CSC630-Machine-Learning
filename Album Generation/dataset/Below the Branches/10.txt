Welcome to the winter girl
No fields of evergreen now
You wanted to have all seasons worth
And like the trees
You've gotta lean now
And oh it's awfully cold
It's gotten awfully cold here
Oh if the truth be told
You've got a snowflake on your cheek dear

Or was that just a tear
At the thought of being here
Every day and every night
You must be missing your sunlight
Oh but don't ya let it stress ya
The barometric pressure
It is just a measure
So use it at your leisure

Good days bad days
Any day it'll be okay
Sunny days rainy days
If they don't make the grade

Welcome to the winter girl
The evening's coming fast now
I guess you can't predict it
But the future is in the past now
And oh it's awfully cold
It's gotten awfully cold here
Oh if the truth be told
You've got a snowflake on your cheek dear

Ooooh
Ooooh

Good days bad days
Any day it'll be okay
Sunny days rainy days
If they don't make the grade
