Living within and living without, you got to lay your fears right down
Out of the cage and up from the ground, you know, the rabbit hugged the hound
'Cause everything it remembered had finally been unlearned
You know how a memory lingers until the tables, they are turned
And a dream is a jigsaw, and every face, it's a trickster
And yes, I'm still in the picture, my eyes gone strawberry brown
Just some permanent fixture that you must carry round
And as you explore your dementia and give it up, or else
You should pay some attention to someone other than yourself
And your dream, it's a jigsaw, and every piece, it's a trickster
If living within means living without, you got to lay your fears right down
Come out of the cage and up from the ground, you know that rabbit dug the hound
And everything it remembered has finally been unlearned
You know how a memory lingers until the tables, they are turned
