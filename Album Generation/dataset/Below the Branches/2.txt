Jesus Christ, what you been doing all this time?
The clouds are nice, you know, I enjoy them on my mind
But if you ever thought of coming back, well, now is the time
And all my trials, I thought I'd left them all behind
And all those miles in every direction, there's a sign
But I never felt you coming back, I think it's a crime
That just when the stars above you, they offer their light to love you
They're already gone, a new day begun
But don't let words mislead you, if you need someone to believe you
As sure as the sun, I'm already one
Bad advice, we been listening to it all this time
Let's make up nice, we should be talking down that line
Yeah, if you ever thought of coming back, well, now is the time
Yeah, if you ever thought of coming back and blowing a mind
Yeah, if you ever thought of coming back, well, now is the time
Yeah, if you ever thought of coming back, well, now is the time
