I heard so many words today, don't know what there's left to say
In my way, I would explain, encapsulate a hurricane
That's with me every night and day, in my fingers and my brain
The pressure that these words contain
To love you is the highest high, higher than the highest high
To look you right into the eye, my black-haired girl
She knows I love her conversation undercover
We'll pay no mind to pouring rain, below the branches make our way
Insects tumble, we can fumble for words
While the silence winds its lazy way into another day
And I don't know what there's left to say
