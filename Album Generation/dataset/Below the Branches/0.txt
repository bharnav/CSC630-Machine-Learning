Find a thing that makes you happy
Find a thing that gets you high
Pack your worries in a suitcase
Send them off and wave goodbye

There's a choir that is singing
There's a song that must be sung
There's a rock and I'll be clinging
Until all my days are done

Find a thing that makes you happy
Find a thing that gets you high
Pack your worries in a suitcase
Send them off and wave goodbye

There's a bell that won't stop ringing
There's a bell that must be rung
There are words here so I sing them
Until all the music's done
