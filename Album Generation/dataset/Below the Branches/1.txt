Oh little lords, oh my good name
When will the sunshine pass this way again?

Kneel down, take your place
Merry go round in time and space
Once more with a feeling
Carve out your own dominion

Out on the tiles, don't make no sound
The trees so quiet dressed in their evening gowns

Kneeling down, take your place
Merry go round in time and space
Once more with a feeling
Carve out your own dominion

The little lords on your good name
When will the sunshine pass this way again?
