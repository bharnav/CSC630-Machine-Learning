Crazy superstitions on my mind
Could they help me get you back for good
Such a striking combination, gone away
Could I save it if I knocked in wood

Did I have a chance and fail to keep it
Lose my dream and let it slip away
Will my destiny remain a secret
Well that's okay, yeah

Everyone should have a reason to believe
So I still believe that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I find the feeling's gone in me
Suddenly I see that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sitting down to read the stars again
Maybe they can tell me what's in store
Now I'm mixing up a magic potion
That's gonna get you banging on my door

Did I have a chance and fail to keep it
Lose my dream and let it slip away
Will my destiny remain a secret
Well, that's okay, yeah

Everyone should have a reason to believe
So I still believe that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I find the feeling's gone in me
Suddenly I see that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'm working on a siren song
Oh baby, oh baby
Gotta feeling that it won't be long
Oh baby, oh baby

Well don't you know that
Everyone should have a reason to believe
So I still believe that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I find the feeling's gone in me
Suddenly I see that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
