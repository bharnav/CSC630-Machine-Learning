Tony leaves the depot late
Seventeen years with the Unigate
Drives his float down Goswell Road at twenty-five to eight

Number nine, Mrs. Doris Brown
Pulls on her quilted dressing gown
Shuts the fridge and boils the kettle
Wipes the table down

La la la la la la
Just as she pours the tea
She's whistling randomly
A milk bottle symphony

Milk bottle symphony

Number twelve, there's Amy Chan
Writing down a line for the candy man
About the time she saw Tom Baker
Drinking down the Hat and Fan

The man next door is Gary Stead
Shuffles downstairs with a heavy head
Scans the paper, takes a pill
And stumbles back to bed

La la la la la la
Didn't get home 'til three
Singing appallingly
A milk bottle symphony

A milk bottle symphony

Emily Roe's at thirty-one
Twenty minutes left to get her homework done
Leaves her corn flakes on the sofa
Says goodbye to Mum

La la la la la la
Jumps on the 43
Humming unconsciously
A milk bottle symphony

Milk bottle symphony
