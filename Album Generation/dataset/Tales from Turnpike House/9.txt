I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

In the morning when I wake up
The very first thing I think of
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

Did he see me standing there?
Did he see me standing there?
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

No matter how lost I feel
No matter how cross I feel
He'll see that I'm special
Somebody out of the ordinary

I watch him from my window
As he walks down to his car below
Does he know that I exist?
One smile, one kiss

That thing I did was wrong
Now I'm free about crying alone
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for a stranger

If only I could meet him
He'd understand my feelings
Call his number, call his number
I stumble, words won't come out

(Just close your eyes, be still, don't cry
The time is right for love tonight
I love to dream, I dream of you
Please see inside my dreams of you)
