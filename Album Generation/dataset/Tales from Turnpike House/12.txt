Day's over and night must fall
Shadows creeping up the garden wall

Goodnight (Goodnight)
Goodnight, goodnight
(Goodnight)

Will you sing me to sleep
And stroke my hair
I'll close my eyes if I know that you're there

Put the bike in the alleyway
Shine of streetlights and a fuzzy grey

Goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Will you sing me to sleep
And stroke my hair
I'll close my eyes if I know that you're there

Draw the blinds on the yellow moon
A dark apartment and a distant June

Goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Will you sing me to sleep
And stroke my hair
I'll close my eyes if I know that you're there (goodnight)
