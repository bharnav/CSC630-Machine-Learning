You're a dream lo-o-o-over
It's a deep ri-i-i-iver

And the clock in the hallway
It goes tick, tick, tickin' away, 'way
Ah, ah

I, I'm gonna dream a little longer now

In the late su-u-u-umer
Could it be for-e-e-ever?

And I know that a phone call is going to
Take, take, take me away, 'way
Oh, oh

I, I'm gonna dream a little longer now
Bye, I've gotta dream a little longer now

And the clock in the hallway
It goes tick, tick, tickin' away, 'way
Ah, ah

I, I'm gonna dream a little longer now
And I, I've gotta dream a little longer now

I, I'm gonna dream a little longer now
(I won't let you go)
