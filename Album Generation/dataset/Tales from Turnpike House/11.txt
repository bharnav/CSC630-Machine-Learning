Amy checks the shopping list
Pedal bin, washing-up rack, Sandtex
And she goes to the baker's to buy a loaf
Ah, she keeps forgetting it's changed into the Tropicana tanning salon

And in the charity shop
Mrs. Brown sits at the counter
Pricing down some old stock
The Moon's a Balloon, two copies of Every Loser Wins, Noel's Blobbyland, deluxe edition
There's not much left on the doorstep recently
Something to do with eBay, Johnny reckons
He's bidding on it now, for a Subbuteo catalogue, '81-'82
He'll win it, put it in a drawer, and forget he ever bought it

Holding on...
To something...
And not knowing...
Exactly what you're waiting for

[sung]
Now...
Teenage winter's coming down
Teenage winter throws a gown
Over every place I've been
And every little dream
Forever...

Phone rings in Gary's flat
"Can I speak to Mr. G. Staid, please"
He hangs up and takes Tony the milk
"See you in the Hat and Fan at seven"

Gary can't believe the Claremont Road pitch is going to be covered in executive housing
He talks about the Newcastle game, Boncho's debut, but
Tony can hardly hear him

They took the jukebox out, and the Aussie bar staff are playing the Red Hot Chili Peppers
He tells him what he thinks
He manages to keep it clean
Buys another round

Holding on...
To something...
And not knowing...
Exactly what you're waiting for

[sung]
Now
Teenage winter's coming down
Teenage winter throws a gown
Over every place I've been
And every little dream
Forever

Now
Teenage winter's coming down
Teenage winter throws a gown
Over every place I've been
And every little dream
Forever

Now
Teenage winter's coming down
Teenage winter throws a gown
Over every place I've been
And every little dream
Forever

Now
Teenage winter's coming down
Teenage winter throws a gown
Over every place I've been
And every little dream
Forever

[spoken word]
Mums with pushchairs outside Sainsbury's
Tears in their eyes
They'll never buy a Gibb Brothers record again
Their old 45s gathering dust
The birthday cards they couldn't face throwing away
Teenage winter coming down
Teenage winter coming down
