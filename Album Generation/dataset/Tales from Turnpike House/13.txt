Sarah
You lie on the sofa
It's like I don't know ya
Now we never talk
We never walk
Outside
It's the city outside

I look out the window
And see the streets below
Cars and the people
Lonely church steeple
Surrounded by grey
We need to move away

Essex
Here we go, over and over and over
You're talking about it again
"Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen"

Sarah
We need some open space
We need a change of pace

Essex
So life here in town, girl
Is getting you down
And you long for a change
But won't it seem strange
With fields all around
We won't hear a sound

The grass may be greener
The air may be cleaner
But I love the city
I know it's not pretty
But at least there is life

Sarah
You call this "life"?

Essex
Here we go, over and over and over
You're talking about it again
"Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen"

Sarah
We need some open space
We need a change of pace

(Stars shine bright in the country...)
(Life feels right...)
(Won't you trust me...)

Essex
Hand me the remote
I'm not sure that we'd cope
In the middle of nowhere
Surrounded by fresh air
I'd miss my mates

Sarah
This place is a state

You'd do your work from home
Online or on the phone
I could grow vegetables...

Essex
Sounds like a load of balls...

Sarah
Let's relocate

Essex
I said I'd miss my mates!

Here we go, over and over and over
You're talking about it again
"Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen"

Sarah
We need some open space
We need a change of pace
