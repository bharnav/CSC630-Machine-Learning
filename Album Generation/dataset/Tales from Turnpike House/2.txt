Rays of light upon the counterpane
Grace the dust that settles on the balustrade

I, I'm opening my eyes
To find
Sun in my morning...

Sun in my morning
This is what I see
Ooh

Sun in my morning
Shining down on me
Ooh

Made a list of things to do today
What a shame
The morning breeze just blew it all away

I, I'm opening my eyes
To find
Sun in my morning...

Sun in my morning
This is what I see
Ooh

Sun in my morning
Shining down on me
Ooh

Sun in my morning
This is what I see
Ooh

Sun in my morning
Shining down on me
Ooh
