Take a message, let me know
Put on her shoes before she goes
Hazel eyes and auburn hair
How could she tell it's all for nothing

Far away from what you want
Another night to spend alone
And now you really know
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone

You know it was a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
Looking all the way back

It's a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

A small caf√© across the street
I heard you meet there every week
Got your favorite necklace on
How could you tell it's all for nothing

Pack your bags and move along
Before your feelings get too strong
'Cause I can tell you now
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone

You know it was a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
Looking all the way back

It's a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

He looked away, pretending not to see her
She tried to say something, but nothing came out right
He's lost the best thing
One day it'll hit him
One day....

It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

You know it was a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
Looking all the way back

It's a good thing
The best thing
Last thing you should have left behind

Out of nowhere
Out there
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
