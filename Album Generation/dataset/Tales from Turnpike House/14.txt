You can judge a book by it's cover almost always
You can judge a book by it's cover almost always

I still remember the day that we met
Just holding hands on the library steps
You quoted Keats and I very near wept

Now my savings all got spent
Then my birthday came and went
And the rent is in arrears
'Cause you spent it all on booze

But I love you, yes I do, almost always

Went back to yours and you paid my train fare
You even offered to give me your spare
First edition of 'Hanover Square'

Oh, if only I could see
What the future held for me
Every night with Sky TV
Every pub in West 14
With the jukebox playing Queen

You can judge a book by the cover almost always
You can judge a love by the lover almost always
You can judge a book by the cover almost always
You can judge a book
