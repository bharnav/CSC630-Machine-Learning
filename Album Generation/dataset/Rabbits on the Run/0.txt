[Verse 1]
For all you broken hearted lovers lost
Go find another one
Cause you know time won't wait and you'll be late
White rabbits on the run
It's hard to know what's good for you
I know she'll let you down
But the fever breaks when it's too much to take
So you can put your weapons down

[Chorus]
And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend

[Verse 2]
It's never too late to change the pace
When days creep up on you
But the goodness is something you don't have to chase
Cause it's following you...

[Chorus]
And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend

[Bridge]
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
Under...

[Chorus]
And all I hear is the music
And beauty stands before me
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend
It's in the music
And beauty stands before you;
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, a carousel
It's a carousel, my friend
Time won't wait, so don't be late;
White rabbits on the run
