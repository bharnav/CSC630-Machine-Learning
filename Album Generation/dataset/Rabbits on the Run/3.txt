[Verse 1]
Say you see through the folly
But, you do it for the fame
And, I'm fighting the jet stream
Drinking cheap wine on airplanes
You're in L.A. not Chicago
Key under mat, I walk the dog
Order in home alone

[Verse 2]
Found your letter on a full moon Sunday night
Some other girl in your spell, casting plans for her life
Pour the vodka and it dulls sharp lies
Breathe the words of diamonds on rings

[Chorus]
And, you didn't mean to do it
So, I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really mean it
Then, magical thinking gets us by

[Verse 3]
Sing for the aftershow
Those candy-colored lips
Your age is showing and you've gotta harder for it
It's always easier with freshmen
I'm not as clever, it should bring you to life

[Chorus]
And, you didn't mean to do it
So, I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really mean it
Then, magical thinking gets us by
My fairweather friend
Fairweather friend

[Bridge]
Live for the folly, but you did it for the fame
Now, you're fragile as porcelain
Drinking cheap wine on airplanes
Did I ever leave Chicago?
I got your message
Glad you're doing well

[Chorus]
And, you didn't mean to do it
So, I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really mean it
Then, magical thinking gets us by
My fairweather friend
Fairweather friend

Gets us by
Gets us by

Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame

My fairweather friend
