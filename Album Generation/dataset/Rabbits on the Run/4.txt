[Verse 1]
Stealing glances through the keyhole
In a brick wall's wooden door
Chains are keeping quiet secrets on 200 year-old folklore
There's a graveyard on Elizabeth where no one ever goes
Kneel and pray to the gravestone
But the gravestone never tells

[Hook]
Hear the bells
Hear the bells

[Verse 2]
December
Crossing arms in Chinatown as the wind starts to cut through
Always, always on the look-out but the poison's
Running through you
My stomach aches, try to concentrate
Walk the stairs to the 3rd floor
Now I'm asking a witchdoctor
But the witchdoctor won't tell

[Hook]
Hear the bells
Hear the bells
Hear the bells
Hear the bells

[Verse 3]
Floating on the sea, stars are watching me
Current takes me out, what will be will be
Floating on the sea, stars are watching me
Current takes me out, what will be will be

[Hook]
Hear the bells
Hear the bells
Hear the bells
Hear the bells
