God rest his head Sunday afternoon, and
The wicked in me is surely the wicked in you
We pray to a ghost that we'd never met
Time turns for a cure from the scientists for

Madness, madness of the heart
But you knew it, you knew it from the start

And Hawking will tell us no tall tales this Spring
No minds hold the chaos that started everything
Maybe it's fate, and the sadness takes hold
Still stars through a window, will they ever know this

Madness, madness of the heart
But you knew it, you knew it from the start
There's a madness, a madness of the heart
But you knew it, you knew it from the start

Stare a sleepy smile into a sunbeam
There's nothing more than a daydream

Colored stained-glass cathedral
Confines the past that won't let you go

God rest your head Sunday afternoon
And the wicked in me is surely coming through
Now pray to a ghost that I'd never met
Still searching for someway out of this mess

It's the heart
It's the heart
And a madness, a madness in the stars
