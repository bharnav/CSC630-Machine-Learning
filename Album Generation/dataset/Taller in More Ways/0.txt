[Intro]
Push the button
Push the button
Pu-push the button
Push the button

[Verse 1: Heidi]
I'm busy throwing hints that he keeps missing
Don't have to think about it I want a kiss
And everything around it but he's too distant
I wanna feel his body, I can't resist it
I know my hidden looks can be deceiving
But how obvious should a girl be?
I was taken by the early conversation piece
And I really like the way that he respect me

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
I've been waiting patiently for him to come and get it
I wonder if he knows that he can say it and I'm with it
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Catch this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

[Chorus: All]
If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

[Verse 2: Mutya]
I'm busy showing him what he's been missing
I'm kind of showing off for his full attention
My sexy ass has got him in a new dimension
I'm ready to do something to relieve this mission

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
After waiting patiently for him to come and get it
He came on through and asked me if I wanted to get with him
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

[Chorus: All]
If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control
If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

[Middle 8: Keisha]
I've been dropping so many hints
You're still not getting it
Now that you've heard everything I have to say
Where we gonna go from here?

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
After waiting patiently for him to come and get it
He came over and asked me if I wanted to get with him
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

[Chorus: All]
If you're ready for me, boy (for me, boy)
You'd better push the button and let me know (let me know)
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna' miss the freak that I control
If you're ready for me, boy
(Push the button, baby)
You'd better push the button and let me know
(Push the button, babe)
Before I get the wrong idea and go
(Push the button, baby)
(Baby) You're gonna' miss the freak that I control (I control)
If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control
