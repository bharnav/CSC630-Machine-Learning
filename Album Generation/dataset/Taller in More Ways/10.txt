World, where I am drowning I sink so slow
The under tow
Dragging me down just like all my fears
Trying so hard not to disappear
There's nothing clear
Want something to believe in

Nearly crushed my soul (my soul)
Nearly lost control (control)
I knew I had to find some peace of mind on my own

This is the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
No falling apart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Right from the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow

In dark there's no believing
You're only left with fear
Talk me out of right from wrong
Make me sing a different song
No time to hide, I'll move on...

Nearly crushed my soul (my soul)
Then I found a goal (a goal)
I knew I had to find some peace of mind on my own

This is the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
No falling apart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Right from the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow

Now I know (uh-uuuhh)
Cause now I know I'm right (uh-uuuhh)
You could be here with me (uh-uuuhh)
I'll meet you now to tell you things are gonna be alright (alriiiight)

This is the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
No falling apart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Right from the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow

This is the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
No falling apart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Right from the start (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...)
You have to look it in the face
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow
