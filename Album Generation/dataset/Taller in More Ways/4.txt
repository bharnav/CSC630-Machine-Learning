Amelle:
'Cause I'm cooler than the red dress
'Cause I'm cooler
'Cause I'm cooler
'Cause I'm cooler than the red dress
'Cause I'm cooler
'Cause I'm cooler

Keisha:
A girl's entitled to flaunt
To get what she wants
Can't say that it's wrong
No baby
A man's world, but boy can't you see
We're pulling the strings
We're taking the lead

And when you're sure
You'll never let her play you again
She'll put on your favourite smile
Unplug the phone to get you alone, Dirty dance
Her hips will send you into a trance

All:
'Cause I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
Cause what you see the man gets
And if he don't I'm better off here alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Amelle:
Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now, baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
I'm giving it up now maybe

Heidi:
(To you)

I've played the desperate lady
Jumped through all of the hoops boy
Instead of constant craving
I'll leave the chasing to you
And if you don't respect it
Ill pick with Jimmy Choos
'Cause boy if you don't love me
Then I've got nothing to lose

Keisha:
'Cause I've been down this road before
I should have known that I was to blame
Won't put on your favourite smile
Won't unplug the phone to get you alone, dirty dance
That's not the way I get my romance

All:
'Cause I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
'Cause what you see the man gets
And if he don't I'm better off here alone

'Cause I'm cooler than the red dress
I'd rather catch a guy on my own
'Cause what you see the man gets
And if he don't I'm better off here alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Amelle:
Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
I'm giving it up now baby

Don't need candlelight to make you stay over
I'm giving it up now baby
If that's what I gotta do just to own you
I'm giving it up now maybe

Heidi:
So don't call me baby
(All:Cooler than the red dress)
Heidi:
So don't call me baby
(All: Cooler than the red dress)

Heidi:
So don't call me baby
(All:Cooler than the red dress)
Heidi:
So don't call me baby
(All: Cooler than the red dress)
