[Intro: Keisha (Mutya & Heidi)
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Mutya]
By answering one simple question
Am I really gonna relieve your tension
Put it all in another dimension now
As I'm facing your sidewalk trauma
Why do you have to punish your neighbour?
I must confess the prospects, they are foul

[Bridge: Heidi (with Mutya)]
I don't know why, feel like I'll give you just one more good lesson
I ain't just some piece of meat sitting in a delicatessen

[Chorus: All (with Keisha leading)]
Boy, do I turn you round
When I turn you down
Oh, isn't this profound?
I know I turn you on
You'll never be the one
So why you hangin' on?

[Verse 2: Heidi]
Can your wife and your kids really be a
Part of your uncut speil and
Do you actually think that you're getting mine?
Can you make me a street map of the wheel
You're chasing a ball of string through
Enters at the head office in your mind

[Bridge: Heidi (with Mutya)]
I don't know why, feel like I'll give you just one more good lesson
I ain't just some piece of meat sitting in a delicatessen

[Chorus: All (with Keisha leading)]
Boy, do I turn you round
When I turn you down
Oh, isn't this profound?
I know I turn you on
You'll never be the one
So why you hangin' on?

[Middle 8: Keisha]
Is it really a coincidence
Or is it just a wind-up?
Do you really think you'll shake my confidence?
Are you scared you'll get blown up then?
You gotta face the prospects when
You try to eliminate the trends that bend
Never emulate just stimulate your mind

[Break: Keisha (Mutya & Heidi)
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Oooooooooh) yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: All (with ad-libs from Keisha)]
Boy, do I turn you round
When I turn you down
Oh, isn't this profound?
I know I turn you on
You'll never be the one
So why you hangin' on?
Boy, do I turn you round
When I turn you down
Oh, isn't this profound?
I know I turn you on
You'll never be the one
So why you hangin' on?
So why you hangin' on baby?
