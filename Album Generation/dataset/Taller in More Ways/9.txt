[Verse 1: Mutya]
See my love is all I can give you
Nothing more 'cause life is how I want it to be
With you and me
Staying together, yeah
Take it all, I'm here boy
I got what you need here, talk to me
And help me breathe
I wanna hold on to sweet memories

[Pre-Chorus: Mutya]
'Cause wasting time
Until your heart and mine realises I am the one
I won't disguise my love
For you, it's true, I can't
Wait for you to be there
All my life, I need
Someone to make me feel good
And I wish that it is you

[Verse 2: Keisha]
Every journey, another sign
Images always pass me by
Feel like leaving the walk behind
When I think of you
Every moment I'm frightened is
Had to erase all your messages
Couldn't handle the things we said
Still I'm feeling you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Keisha]
It's driving me crazy, baby
Lately you've been slipping away from me
I try to keep holding on
I cannot be wrong
There's something I didn't see

[Chorus: All (with Keisha leading)]
We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Everytime a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes and I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together
We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Everytime a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes and I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together

[Bridge: Heidi]
You turned down the light in me
I think our time is over
And ain't it funny how sweet I dream
But the bed keeps on getting colder
Sometimes when I close my eyes
It feels like I'm living by numbers
Cos I've been holding you so damn tight
I gotta stop cos it's pulling me under

[Pre-Chorus 2: Keisha]
It's driving me crazy, baby
Lately you've been slipping away from me
I try to keep holding on
I cannot be wrong
There's something I didn't see

[Chorus: All (with Keisha leading)]
We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Everytime a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes and I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together
We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Everytime a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes and I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together
