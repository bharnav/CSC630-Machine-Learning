Don't recognise what I see
Who is this looking back at me?
I just can't tell
I see a pale reflection of myself
Can't cover up the way I feel
These nights will never never heal
What can I do?
Am I supposed to just forget you?

I'm torn up got my fingers burning
Now I'm, so lost got a lot to learn
I wanna free myself as someone else
But there's no where left to turn

Tell me who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
If there's nothing left inside
Tell me who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever?
Or am I stronger now you're gone?

Wish I could change who I am
Be someone who don't give a damn
It's too much to take
Cause my heart is set to break down
I can't pretend anymore
That things will be like they were before
Why can't you see?
It's just a faded memory

I'm torn up got my fingers burning
Now I'm, so lost got a lot to learn
I wanna free myself as someone else
But there's no where left to turn

Tell me who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
If there's nothing left inside
Tell me who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever?
Or am I stronger now you're gone?

What can I do?
To make it through
It's only me
Why can't I see?
I'm not too well
It's such a shame
It's only me

Who are you gonna run to?
Where are you gonna hide?
There's so much you gotta undo
If there's nothing left inside
Tell me who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever?
Or am I stronger now you're gone?

Why can't I feel, yeah

There's so much you gotta undo
If there's nothing left inside
Tell me who's gonna make it better?
When there's so much going wrong
Will I feel this way forever?
Or am I stronger now you're gone?
