I throw my hands up
Yes there's salt in tears
Like a tipsy baby
And I'm going crazy without you you you
I'll make my mind up
And let go my fears
If you're not forever
I'll take whatever without you you you

It's not worth living

I think I miss a bit of bliss when you're not here
I need your kiss and all of you
And I remember every little thing about ya
And I will keep hold of you

I throw my hands up
Yes there's salt in tears
Like a tipsy baby
And I'm going crazy without you you you
I'll make my mind up
And let go my fears
If you're not forever
I'll take whatever without you you you

It's not worth living

I will enjoy the time we had and you'll move on
And I'll feel ready, I'll break down
But I'll get up, I won't give up cause life goes on
I'll wait till my luck turns around

I throw my hands up
Yes there's salt in tears
Like a tipsy baby
And I'm going crazy without you you you
I'll make my mind up
And let go my fears
If you're not forever
I'll take whatever without you you you

It's not worth living

Oh oh oh
Guess I'm sucker for what you've got there
Without you
Guess I'm sucker for what you've got there
Oh oh oh

I throw my hands up
Yes there's salt in tears
Like a tipsy baby
And I'm going crazy without you you you
I'll make my mind up
And let go my fears
If you're not forever
I'll take whatever without you you you

It's not worth living [x3]
