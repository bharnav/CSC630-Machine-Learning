I'm pouring my heart out, leaving almost nothing for myself
You're looking in my eyes why do I feel your mind is somewhere else?
Our love is delicate as butterfly wings
But still we fight about the silliest things
I hate it when we do, so I'll keep forgiving you, over and over again

And we're flying on paper planes, hoping it don't rain on my parade
When I'm with you it's strange, I'll make it everything
Hoping that the wind don't change
Oh oh oh ohâ€¦

It's danger when you fall out, I never learned to walk before I run
It's too easy to fall out I'll push away the clouds to see the sun
Oh oh oh
As beautiful as a song a nightingale sings
It's nothing compared to the joy you bring

This river that love is
I tried swimming
And I went over my head

'Cause we're flying on paper planes, hoping it don't rain on my parade
When I'm with you it's strange, I'll make last all day
Hoping that the wind don't change
Oh oh oh ohâ€¦

I'm scared to fall 'cause we're so high, and it's a long way down from here
But if we're strong, if we try
We can touch the sky

And we're flying on paper planes hoping it don't rain on my parade
When I'm with you it's strange, I'll make it everything
I hope your wind don't change
Oh oh oh oh...
