You know I'm tryin' to make it happen for us right now, I gotta do what I gotta do for me and you

[TOP]
I remember, we were living like kings and queens
In a little tiny castle made of hopes and dreams
It was destiny, it was meant to be
We were so complete, the perfect team

[GD]
And suddenly, there's a glitch in the system
And in between us is a big strip of distance
They say it's supposed to make the heart grow fonder
From what I can tell, man, they couldn't be wronger

[PIXIE]
A little bit more goes a long way
[TOP]A little bit of right goes the wrong way
I keep giving, you keep taking

[GD]
I'm tryin' to make a living, be patient

[Hook]
All dressed up, nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own
I’ve been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2)
But you’re not coming home
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2)
But you’re not coming home

[GD]
I don’t want you dancing by yourself
And I don’t want you picturing yourself with someone else
I know I made some promises, and honestly, I wanted this to work out
I didn’t know the shining star I found was ‘bout to burn out
So what now, we’re going ‘round like a record
I’m feelin’ disconnected and you’re feelin’ disrespected
I don’t know how this gon’ wrap up
‘Till I’m home, you should turn that track up

[PIXIE]
And that’s all I get from you
But I give my all to you
[GD]
And that’s all I hear from you

[Hook]
All dressed up, nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own [GD: come on girl, please listen to me]
I’ve been waiting way too long [GD: I don’t want you dancing alone]
Dancing on my own
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2) [GD: come on]
But you’re not coming home [GD: I’m coming home]
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong [GD: I’m coming home, I told you I’m coming home]
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2)
But you’re not coming home

[TOP]
I always think about her
Try to not even think about her
I always dream about her
Try not to dream about her
I’m feelin’ so lost without her
I-I-I-I-I try to come home
It’s so hard bein’ out on my own
It breaks my heart to leave you alone

[PIXIE]
That’s all I get from you
But I give my all to you

[TOP]
And that’s all I hear from you
[Hook]
All dressed up, nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own [TOP: dancing]
I’ve been waiting way too long [GD: I don’t want you dancing alone]
Dancing on my own [GD: uh-huh]
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2)
But you’re not coming home
Play one more so-o-o-o-o-ong
So-o-o-o-o-ong (x2)
But you’re not coming home

[TOP]
I told you I’d be home, I told you I’d be back
[PIXIE]
One more song ‘till you come home
[GD]
I told you I’d be home
I told you I’d be back
I told you I’d be back, girl
I told you I’d be home
