Woo, oh, oh

Woke up with a feeling, it's got me up on the ceiling
And you're not gonna not gonna knock me down
I wanna go where the sun shines, I wanna go where the good times
Where they're not gonna not gonna get me down

So keep saying what ya say it's gonna make me stronger anyway, oh, oh
When you say I'm not good enough just keeps me climbing to the top, oh, uh-uh, oh
No, no, no, you're

Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out
Nothing's gonna swing me round
Not gonna wait for no-one, can't stop me now
The words you say don't work cos they don't hurt
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out

Don't need to act like I don't care
Because the truth is I don't care
I'ma keep I'ma keep on keeping on
Ever since I got over I got the weight off my shoulders
I'ma keep I'ma keep proving you wrong

So keep saying what ya say it's gonna make me stronger anyway, oh, oh
When you say I'm not good enough just keeps me climbing to the top, oh, uh- uh, oh
No, no, no, you're

Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out
Nothing's gonna swing me round
Not gonna wait for no-one, can't stop me now
The words you say don't work cos they don't hurt
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out

Dancing, keep dancing, till the sun comes out
I'll keep dancing, keep dancing, till the sun, till the sun
I'll keep dancing, keep dancing, till the sun comes out
I'll keep dancing, keep dancing, woah

Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out
Nothing's gonna swing me round
Not gonna wait for no-one, can't stop me now
The words you say don't work cos they don't hurt
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out
Keep dancing, woah
Gonna keep on dancing till the sun comes out
