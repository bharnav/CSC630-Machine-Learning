[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
Yeah
Step steadily, deal with reality
Then wonder why we feel so cold, bitterly
Singing from the heart but not one of them was hearing me
Left us in the back drown dry, harmony
Done a bit of dirt now I'm clean take a look at me
Wasn't over night, nope, never happen suddenly
Finally I think I see, bright lights dazzle me
Killed the games heart beat-crime-felony and
Now it's a new day, they snap snap pics
A lot of them I pose in my new shades
London night life they say money can't buy time
Watch cost the whole case
You ain't got to rewind time
Still got my roughspot family ties
Yeah, from the ground to the sky
And it wasn't over night
I am Cloud nine Strydz

[Verse 2: Pixie Lott]
Feels like my clocks run out
I can only see when I'm looking down
Trying to find a way to get out of this guillotine
I can't go through another day
Wishing my whole life away
I'm starting to lose my faith in reality, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Pixie Lott]
This time I had enough
I'm putting my hands up
I hate the way I feeling lost
In my own city
Everybody's hustling
Trying to find where I fit in
But I know, yeah I know the end is where it begins

[Chorus: Pixie Lott]
'Cause flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the sky light won't let me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow something's gotta change
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Pixie Lott]
So close but it's still so far
I figured out what's in my heart
I took a step out of the dark
Now I'm on my way, yeah
Moving on to better things
Cutting off my puppet strings
To unleash my readied wings
And fly away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Pixie Lott]
This time I've had enough
I'm putting my hands up
Never gonna be feeling lost
In my own city
There comes a time we all fall down
Get knocked by London Town
But I know, yeah I know that this is where it begins

[Chorus: Pixie Lott]
'Cause flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the sky light won't let me lose my way
Cause I know somehow something's gotta change
(Ya-ay)

[Bridge: Pixie Lott]
Oh, oh, it's going be alright
Oh, oh, not gonna sleep tonight
Oh, oh, until we see the lights that bring us hope
Oh, oh, it's gonna be alright
Oh, oh, we're gonna touch the sky
Oh, oh, I know the city lights will guide us home

[Chorus: Pixie Lott]
Flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the sky light won't let me lose my way
Cause I know somehow something's gotta change

[Outro: Pixie Lott]
Oh, oh, it's going be alright
Oh, oh, not gonna sleep tonight
Oh, oh, until we see the lights that bring us hope
Oh, oh, it's gonna be alright
Oh, oh, gonna touch the sky
Oh, oh, something's gotta chance
Oh, oh, oooh
