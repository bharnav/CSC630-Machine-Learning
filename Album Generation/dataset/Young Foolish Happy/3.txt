We've been working all week
And no we're not gonna sleep
We wanna go somewhere
And I hope you'll be there
I tell you nothing competes
When we're running the streets
I gotta go somewhere
Yeah you wanna be there

Working working working
Working working working
Working working working

Just for tonight no one else will be telling you
Where to go, who to be
You can be who you want to
Every beat has a voice and it's calling you
No one else feels the way, the way we do
Centre of the universe
Everything spins 'round us
No matter where we go, yeah you know

We start and the whole world stops
Everyone is watching us
We're doing it just because
Nobody does it better
Get up, get up feel my heat
We're losing it to the beat
All of us is all we need
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better
Nobody does it better

Smiling faces erase every trace of blue
See the boys watch the girls
As we start to move
Nothing's as good as being here
With the ones you love
Nothing wrong what we can do
We got'em outta stress
Centre of the universe
Everything spins 'round us
No matter where we go, yeah you know
We start and the whole world stops
Everyone is watching us
We're doing it just because
Nobody does it better
Get up, get up feel my heat
We're losing it to the beat
All of us is all we need
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better
Nobody does it better

Bring your body here
Run your hands up through my hair
I don't care if people stare
Oh, your touch will take me there
Well I love the summertime
But it's leaving us behind
Don't you wish we could rewind
Bring it back one more time
We start and the whole world stops
Everyone is watching us
We're doing it just because
Nobody does it better
Get up, get up feel my heat
We're losing it to the beat
All of us is all we need
Nobody does it better
.
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it
N-n-n-n-n nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
