I wish I was a little more clear headed
So I could paste the pieces of last night
I try not to regret it
Sifting through the laughter and the lies

I guess that's just the story of my life

I was born in a 60's winter
My mom was young and my dad had an appetite
A saint and a sinner
Wrestling with what's wrong and what's right

I guess that's just the story of my life

When they roll me down the last long highway
You won't find me putting up a fight
If I could have things my way
They'd all be there just soaking up the light
