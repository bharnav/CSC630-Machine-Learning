I can't ignore the voices in my head
The things we never said hunting me down
I fell like I've found myself in pieces on the floor
More broken than before I let you down...

You can lose someone in a heartbeat
You can lose yourself in a memory...

CHORUS
Look at me now, I'm going insane
I'm looking back at what remains
What have I done, was it in vain?
Can you forgive me once again?
Say you'll do that, and I'd take it back
In a heartbeat

I can't avoid the will to fall apart
To stop before I start living again
I try to pretend I'm not afraid to set you free
To push you out to sea to wait for the wind...

You can lose someone in a heartbeat
You can lose yourself in a memory...

REPEAT CHORUS

What have I done, was it in vain?
Can you forgive me again?
I'd take it back, if you'd say you'll do that
In a heartbeat
