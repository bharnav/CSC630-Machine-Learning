I wish I could give you the love you deserve
I wish I could be your servant du jour
I wish I could tell you the things that I'm not
I wanna show you what I've got
And I wish you would love me anyway

Chorus
I wanna be the girl you left me for
I wanna be the one that you adore
I wanna be the girl you left me for

I'm gonna treat you more like a king
Make me a puppet without any strings
I want your perfume on my pillowcase
She's gonna turn you inside out and I...
I'm gonna love you anyway

Chorus
I wanna be the girl you left me for
I wanna be the one that you adore
I wanna be the girl you left me for

Bridge
You've got me on my knees
Don't break my heart again
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want to be your friend

Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I wanna feel you on my fingertips

Chorus
I wanna be the girl you left me for
I wann be the one that you adore
I wanna be the girl you left me for
I wanna be the one that you adore
I wanna be the girl you left me for
