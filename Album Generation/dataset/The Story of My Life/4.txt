Katie likes to run around
In cotton panties and a crown
She driving all the boys insane
Suckin' on a candy cane...
She likes to play the tambourine
Her favorite color's Army green
She's a vegetarian; she's a lovely loaded gun...

CHORUS
Katie has a way of seeing things
That everybody else is just afraid to dream of
It's funny how it seems, but when you look at her
I swear, you see love

She wears diamonds oh her toes
She lets her belly button show
She puts perfume in her hair
You don't look at her, you stare...

CHORUS
