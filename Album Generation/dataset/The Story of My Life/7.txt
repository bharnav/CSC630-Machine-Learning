I can't help but wonder how
This fire keeps going out
Even when we try to keep it burning
It's hard to let you go
And that's because I know
That holding on is worth a little hurting...

CHORUS
I don't wanna write a love song
Not another love song
I cannot take another painful melody
I don't wanna write a love song
Not another love song
Until I know you're coming back to me

I wish that you could stay
I wish it everyday
Even though our love is slowly dying
What's a heart supposed to do
When wishes don't come true
It hurts so much it's hard to keep on trying...

CHORUS
