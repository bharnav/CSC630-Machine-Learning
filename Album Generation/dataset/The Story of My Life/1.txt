I've got a friend who wears go-go boots to Sunday School
We used to sit and drink pink champagne on a tin roof
Ridin' it out in a Thunderbird
Singin' out loud every single word of Jack & Diane
Tryin' to pretend there was no rules
Kissin' on boys and sneakin' in bars
Tryin' to get a glimpse of who we are
We weren't wild, but we weren't far

She said Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me
And you can tell ol' James Dean to get in line
Thanks to Elvis and Kurt Cobain, the world will never be the same
You gotta make history one day at a time

She graduated in 1987
We were gonna make a break for it together
Headed out to Hollywood
Where the stars are bright and the weather's good
But she changed her mind and went back to the 7-11
She went and married the football star
Had few kids and works real hard
It ain't wild but it ain't far

(Repeat Chorus)
Hey, Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me
And you can tell ol' James Dean to get in line
Thanks to Jesus and John Wayne the world will never be the same
You've gotta make history one day at a time

Like John Lennon and Kennedy
I'm with them, yeah, 'cause I believe
You gotta make history one day at a time
