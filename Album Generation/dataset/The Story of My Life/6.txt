She parks her car on Woodland Street
She's got a job at the meat-n-three
She's kind of pretty in a perculiar kind of way
And I try hard to like her
Yeah, I try hard to like her...

CHORUS
Because she's good for you
She's so good for you
You say she's good for you
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad
For me

I saw her at the grocery store
Her stuff was obviously yours
It may sound silly but it made me want to cry
I try hard to hide it...

You say she's good for you
She's so good for you
Well if she's good for you
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad
For me

BRIDGE
It's torture
The thought of you touching her
Remembering the way we were...

REPEAT CHORUS

TAG
Even if that's true
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad
For me
