I'm in a hotel room in California
Giving it my best to give you up
I'm leaving on a jet plane to New Orleans
You and me, we didn't see it coming

Chorus
But somewhere between Atlanta and Birmingham
We fell in love with just one touch
It was out of our hands
I'm holding on to every word you said
Somewhere between Atlanta and Birmingham

I gotta pick up the pieces of my lonely heart
I want you to know it's not your fault
You got to go to love that's waiting
I hope that your green eyes say what you aren't saying

Chorus
Somewhere between Atlanta and Birmingham
We fell in love with just one touch
It was out of our hands
I never thought that my whole world could end
Somewhere between Atlanta and Birmingham

Somewhere between Atlanta and Birmingham
We fell in love with just one touch
It was out of our hands
I never thought that my whole world would end
Somewhere beteen Atlanta and Birmingham

I'm in a hotel room in California
Giving it my best to give you up
