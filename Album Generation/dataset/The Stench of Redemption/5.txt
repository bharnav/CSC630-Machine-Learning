Bound from the light to the end of eternity
Fighting for rights for the realm of antiquity
All that is evil and right hand of god
Trinity bound and defying his cross

Homage for Satan, cursing dissension
Forced isolation to the lake of fire

Will and free thought you have brought to the edge of eve
Nothing to stop what they thought was the truth to be
God without Satan, no one would believe

Homage for Satan, sworn to the Devil, unholy master
Destroy the heavens
Homage for Satan, the invocation, rule the unwanted
Armies of the dead

Skinning the Christians and the lost and not forgave
Punishing priest for the lives that they wouldn't save
Waiting rebirth of the Christ back upon the earth
Given temptation to wipe out the world

Homage for Satan, God cannot find you
Hell is your heaven
Jesus ripped apart
