Not Of This Earth, Unknown and forgotten by time
Evil in nature with power of flight
Not Of This Earth Lurking the shadows for flesh
Sent from the heavens descending with death
Snatching the weak from this world, gone from the night and to never be heard
Ominous figure of blood upon us feed
Creeping the darkness unfurl, venting it's self with a murderous thirst
Abomination of birth
Not of this earth...

Not Of This Earth, Unseen by the science of man
Of it's existence they don't understand
Not Of This Earth, nowhere will it ever be found
Patiently stalking and hunting us down
Demonic prophet of doom, waking from death with a hunger in sue
From hibernation of time released to feast
Into the night it will search, spreading it's wings and expelling it's curse
A silhouette of the perverse
Not of this earth...

Not Of This Earth, all those who fail to believe, likely succumb and become the unseen
Not Of This Earth, Heed not as you look in the sky, you may be next in a long line to die
Stink of the relents of death, stripping the bodies of all of there flesh
Regenetaing inside the vile beast
Mutilate what it has left, drained of the blood and discarded for dead
Kill you and speak not a word
Not of this earth...
