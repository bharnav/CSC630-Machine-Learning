Children of Satan it's time to bring pain
Stand by your side when the Christians engaged
Angelic pastures is where we will war
Once and for all we will settle the score

In the presence of God, Holy crosses inverted
Retribution for what has been done by the churches
With no warning the word of the lord is in question
Preservation of life ever more
Desecration

Holy men tremble insight of dismay
Temples on fire and graves are displaced
Wreck and defile their realm of disgust
Christian religion is turned into dust

In the presence of god, Holy crosses inverted
Retribution for what has been done by the churches
With no warning the word of the lord is in question
Preservation of life ever more
Desecration

Worship the devil and vanquish thy role
Destroy the vision of God you were told
Call on ones who invoke his disgrace
Cast out his spirit in Lucifer's name
Christian religion lies dead in decay
Killing and conquered and turned into slaves
What does it matter and what is it worth?
Killing for Jesus to unify the earth
Stand in the shadows and forced to believe
Willingly die for the light of the weak
He has forsake you and left you to rot
Mass destruction the killing of God

Jesus defeated and followers fled
Heaven in ruins impaling the dead
Holy Lord vanishes to where he knows not
No more religion or go to begot
