Where is your god in the hour of need, caught in their light and the scheming of things
Prey to a lord of assumption you heal, what will you find when you see he's not real
Baptized in lies and deceit, what is so hard to believe

When was the last time you gave of yourself, not pushing bibles and preaching of hell
Looking for souls in this world to possess, no reservations are promised in death
Manifestation is pulling you in, Never to be seen again

Once it is known that god don't exist, undo the fist of hypocrisies grip
They will all pay for the lies, DIE

Heaven unseen when you fall to dead dreams, call unto god he won't answer the screams
Feel like a fool when your laid to your rest, now and forever resented in death
No where around in my circle of friends, never to be seen again

Once it is known that god don't exist, undo the fist of hypocrisies grip
They will all pay for the lies, DIE
