[Chorus]
When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

[Verse 1]
Is this forever?
This feeling I got
Not enough and too much
So free and so caught up
In something and nothing
Both at the same time
I'm either out of my head
Or I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Is this forever?
This feeling that I'm not
Moving at all
But I just can't stop it
Its like I'm dreaming
And I'm wide awake too
Will you remember me
Cause I won't forget you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I guess I was saving my life for later
When maybe I should've been givin' myself to you
Now I will, but I got to find out who I am before I do
Before I do

[Outro]
When I find out who I am I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again I know, I'm gonna give myself to you
I'm going to give myself to you [x2]
