[Verse 1]
How many lives must I live
How many lies must I hear
How many times must I, feel so blue
How many times must I, lose you

[Chorus]
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart breakin' down
Or losing ground

[Verse 2]
How many bridges must I burn
How many lessons must I learn
How many times must I ask you to stay
How many times will you push me out of your way

[Chorus]
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart breaking down - losing ground
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart losing ground - slowing down

[Verse 3]
Maybe somebody will show me - a better way
Maybe somebody will know me - someday
How many times must I, hear your voice
Inside my dreams, your answering machine
You're always there and everywhere in between

[Chorus]
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart slowing down
Can ya hear the sound
All I hear now
Is the sound of my heart leaving town, breaking down
Slowing down, losing ground, breaking down and stopping here

[Outro]
All I hear now [x2]
