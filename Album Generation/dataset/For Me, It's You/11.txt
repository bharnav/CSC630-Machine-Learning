[Verse 1]
All alone or so It feels
Where are you going
Finally knowing
That nobody knows
And if you ever need my hands
To carry you through heavy times
Or look in to your wondering eyes
To remind you what you are

[Chorus]
Skyscraper
You define the skyline
Opposite the grapevine
Where crows and rumors fly

[Verse 2]
And if you ever need my hands
To carry you through heavy times
Or look in to your telling eyes
To remind you what you are

[Chorus]
Skyscraper
Half way to the show
Giving every sunrise some connection
Protection from a bitter sun

[Outro]
Skyscraper
You define the skyline
Opposite the grapevine
Where crows and rumors fly
Skyscraper
