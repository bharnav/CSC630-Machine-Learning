[Verse 1]
You were my ticket outta here
And I was your dream come true
You gave me everything I ever wanted
Except for you
I convinced myself that over don't mean over
And I convinced myself that I could fix it all
Two dreams collided maybe we got too excited for our own good

[Chorus 1]
No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the words all break it
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

[Verse 2]
Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away
And I convinced myself that we'd look back and laugh at this one day
Two lives collidin' baby
We got too excited for our own good

[Chorus 1]
No more, hold on we can make it
No more holding our breath while the truth all breaks it
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

[Chorus 2]
Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the whole thing went wrong
Hey wait hey don't you wanna hear what I have to say
Hey wait hey don't you know this is where the strong will go on

[Bridge]
And all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you

[Chorus 1]
No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the world tries to break us
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

[Chorus 2]
Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the whole thing went wrong
Hey wait hey don't you wanna hear what I have to say
Hey wait hey don't you know this is where the strong will go on

[Outro]
All I ever wanted
And all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you
