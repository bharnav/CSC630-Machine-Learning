[Verse 1]
Would you believe me
If I said My head is spinning without you
Would you believe me
If I just want to let you know how I feel about you
Now I want to know what I can do to make you stay with me tonight
Because I do
Would you believe me if I leave you, cause here I go

[Chorus]
Am I reaching you now
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed now that you've started, I'm going to finish it

[Verse 2]
Would you believe me
If I held on too tight to make it without you
Would you believe me
If I just got to let you know I can't live without you
Would you believe me if I leave you cause here I go

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now I don't mean to test your faith
Or make you think that I won't wait for you
Because I will
But baby this is all I got
So I'm going to give it one last shot
I would give you more than enough
But baby I got to let go
Let you go
Would you believe me

[Outro]
Am I reaching you now
I was trying to tell you I was letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm going to finish it
(am I reaching you now)
Got to finish it[x2]
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm gonna finish it
