[Verse 1]
I know you turned your back on Mother nature
For everything she puts you through
She wakes up everyday and tries to greet you
I’m hopin’ that you’ll make it through
I caught every morning
Tried to reach you
And waited for your Saturday
With sunshine, divine, I come running
I’m a change a’ heart away

[Chorus]
Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Morning break in you
Get Out
And I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m running after you

[Verse 2]
Thought that he would be a high-class mover
Well, he’s high now mover
But his class ain't new
You were born to be a ballerina
So you danced your way to Hollywood
Well dancin’s what you got
But not like you wanted
Not like you wanted anything

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
On the big sky, nothing at the top
So stop and get a good look... at this miracle
On the big line, nothing up above, just love
So get a good look at this miracle
Because this miracle’s you
This miracle’s you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Get out (Get out)
Get out
Let the Morning break in you
Get Out
And I won’t (Get out) run unless I’m running after you
(Get out) And I won't (Get out) run unless I'm running after you [x2]
