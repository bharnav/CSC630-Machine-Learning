[Verse 1]
Always remember I'm by your side
Such a shame that you had to go
So much more that I'd like to know
So many things you forgot to show me how to do
When times are hard I forget your gone
I go to call you before it dawns on me
That you won't be there now
But I still have these words that you gave me

[Chorus]
Always remember I'm by your side[x2]

[Verse 2]
I got two kids of my own now
They grow up so fast
And how I wish you did not miss that part of who I am
But I keep doing all that I can do
And I will smile when they ask about you
And I will sing to them every day
With voice and the words that you used to say
Will change the world one day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And while they grow up you will show up
In things they do and say
Like a reflection to a connection
Of who they'll be one day
They will learn to get their wings
And fly through the changes life will bring
So on
And it will go on
And you will go on

[Outro]
And they will sing with the voice that you gave them
Always remember I'm by your side [x2]
I'm by your side [x2]
