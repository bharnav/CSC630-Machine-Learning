[Verse 1]
When I go on airplanes
I listen to your voice
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a choice

[Chorus]
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
Feel right

[Verse 2]
And all the things I'm taking
Are making me insane
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a change

[Chorus]
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
Feel right

[Bridge]
My mom was right
I don't want to die
I want to live my life

My mom was right
I don't want to die
I want to live my life

[Outro]
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
