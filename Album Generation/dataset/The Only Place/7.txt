[Verse 1]
I wake up to the morning sun
When did my life stop being so fun
Wish I could care about someone, the way I used to
When will this be done

I'm always crying on the phone
Because I know that I'll end up alone
Lord please forgive me for my sins
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end

[Chorus]
Do you love me like you used to
Do you, do you, do you

[Verse 2]
I have no reason to complain
My feelings change, they melt away in my brain
I keep myself awake at night
Sleep with the lights on, always ready to fight

I'm always crying on the phone
Because I know that I'll end up alone
Lord please forgive me for my sins
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end

[Bridge/Outro]
I'm always running down the street
I don't remember what it means to be me
I left all of that shit behind
But still I seem to lose my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
