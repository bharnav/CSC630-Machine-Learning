[Verse 1]
If I sleep on the floor
Will it make you love me more
If I pack up my things and leave
Can I still be the queen to your king

[Hook]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Know that you don't mean to say things
That hurt me and drive me to my knees
Been around this crazy world
But I still want to be your girl

[Chorus]
Cause there's no one like you
No one like you, no one like you
No one like you, no one like you

[Hook]
No, no, no. no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
