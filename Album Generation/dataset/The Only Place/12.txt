[Verse 1]
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work

It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything but you

[Chorus]
But you
Yeah, I love you, yes I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you

[Verse 2]
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work

It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything but you

[Chorus]
But you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you

[Outro]
You, it's true
I love you, I do

Oooo, ooo, ooo
Oooo, ooo, ooo
