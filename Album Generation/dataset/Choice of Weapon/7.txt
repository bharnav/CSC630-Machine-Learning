You're working hard for the devil
You're sucking on the crack
You're hard for the devil
You got no name

You are my Lucifer, your animal bones cry nature
You are my Lucifer, diamond teeth dog on a sabre

Power
You got the power
You blowing lights
Yeah, you
Yeah, you are a slayer
You got the power
All the power
You blowing lights
Yeah, you

You are my Lucifer, you're blowing minds and you a slayer
You are my Lucifer, yeah, you a slayer

You’re working hard for the devil
You’re picking up the slack
Hard for the devil
You got no shame

You are my Lucifer, getting high from a paper bag
You are my Lucifer, sucking crack, living on your back

You got the power
You got the power
You blowing lights
Yeah, you
Yeah you, you a slayer
You got the power
Well, all the power
You blowing minds
You blowing lights

You are my Lucifer, you blowing minds and you a slayer
You are my Lucifer, you blowing minds and you a slayer

You working hard for the devil
You are my Lucifer
Hard for the devil

You are my Lucifer, your animal bones cry nature
You are my Lucifer, diamond teeth dog on a sabre

You are my Lucifer, getting high from a paper bag
You are my Lucifer, sucking crack, living on your back

In the hall of the crimson king
In the height of the poison pig

You got the power
Well, all the power
You blowing lights
Yeah, well, you
Yeah, you, you are a slayer
You got the power
Well, all the power
You blowing lights
You blowing minds
You a slayer

You are my Lucifer
You blowing lights
You crashing minds
You blowing minds
You are my Lucifer
