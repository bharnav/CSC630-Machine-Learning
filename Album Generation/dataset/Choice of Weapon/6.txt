I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me
I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me

Raise your fist high
Sun tear the sky
Night's legions fly forever and ever

Through the terror and the hate
I see your blackest eyes
Killing all the young men
Dissolve, destroy the night
Witches and the slaves
Riots and the protest lines
Sacrifice the fatted calf
Kali

I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me
I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me

Raise your fist high
Sun tear the sky
Night's legions fly forever and ever

Kali, kali, kali
Money, money, money
Kali, kali, kali
Money, money, money

I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me
I can’t wake from this dream
Death walks right beside me
The light shines bright behind me
