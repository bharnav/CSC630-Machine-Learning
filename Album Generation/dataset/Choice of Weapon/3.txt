You break the man, leave his shell on the ground
What have you done, with your own life, your world?

Shared everything I've been, speak everything I’ve seen
So kill your jealousy, and what you believe

You can’t destroy them, the beauty and the youth
You’ll never beat them, you'll never hide the truth

You can’t destroy them, the beauty and the youth
You’ll never beat them, you'll never hide the truth

I lay down, with the beasts on the ground
The prophets cry, in every tear a prayer forever

Shared everything I've been, speak everything I’ve seen
So kill your jealousy, and what you still believe

You can’t destroy them, the beauty and the youth
You’ll never beat them, you'll never hide the truth

(Can you feel it?)

Destroy, destroy, destroy it all, what I don’t understand
Why you destroy everything, so beautiful in your hand
Come home

And hate strips it away, the essence of a man
We'll weave a golden noose, and hang you from the stars

Hey now, can you make it right?
Hey now, the lightning and the fight
And hey now, the power and the glory
And hey now
Hey now
Hey now, can you make it right?
Hey now, the lightning and the fight
And hey now, can you make it right?
