Who do you think it’s for? For the animals
What you trying to prove? To the unchained
Who you gonna burn? The uneducated
It's not for you

Who you trying to screw? All the animals
Where you gonna turn? To the untamed
What you trying to prove? You not participating
It's not for you

Dark cities, you crawling in
Dark prisons, you're living in
You losing millions, millions of cells
You spit your mantra, you go to hell

I, I came to you with love in my heart
And I, I came to you with love in my heart

Who do you think it’s for? For the animals
What you trying to prove? To the unchained
Who you gonna burn? The uneducated
It's not for you

Dark cities, you crawling in
Dark prisons, you're living in
You losing millions, millions of cells
You spit your mantra, you go to hell

I, I came to you with love in my heart
And I, I came to you with love in my heart

For all the fucked up children
Staring down the barrel of a gun
For all the fucked up children
Staring down the barrel of a gun

For the animals
For the untamed
The uneducated
It's not for you

I, I came to you with love in my heart
And I, I came to you with love in my heart
With love in my heart
With love in my heart
