I was running down Lafayette
My bloody shirt soaked through
(She got me running)
I was beaten and confused
On a New York City ruse
(She got me running)

My filthy hands and feet
On a dirty city street
(She got me running)
Like a banshee, no one cares
With a heart of a beaten dog
(She got me running)

My wild Indian heart was pounding, I was running so fast
My wild Indian heart was pounding, I was running so fast

We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here
We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here

All the children loving the camera
Turn their face into the light
(She got me running)
Can you take the pace much faster
Licking honey from a knife
(She got me running)

My wild Indian heart was pounding, I was running so fast
My wild Indian heart was pounding, I was running so fast

Let the water, let it all out
Yeah, I'm drowning, get me out of this place
Let the water, let it all out
Well, I'm drowning, get me out of this place
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let the water, let it all out
Yeah, I'm drowning, get me out of this hell

We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here
We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here
We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here
We got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs, the drugs in here

Call it, own it
Fucked up children
