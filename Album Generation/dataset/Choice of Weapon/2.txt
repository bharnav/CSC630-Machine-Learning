Black hearts and devils in the night
Mean streets raised me up to fight
I’m a lover but I’ve been known quick to strike
You think you know me, oh, but you’re never right

Don’t be decided by the liars
Caught in the jaws and the flame
I’ve been consumed by the trials
These wicked teeth that hold my name, that hold my name, that hold my name

Pages burn, I watch the words ignite
And my heart feels beyond this strife
Look into the black jaws of the night
Take back what I lost and

I give my heart to the heavens
I give my heart to the light
Yeah, to the light

Don’t be decided by the liars
Caught in the jaws and the flame
I’ve been consumed by the trials
These wicked teeth that hold my name, that hold my name, that hold my name
