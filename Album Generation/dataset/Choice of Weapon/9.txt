All my friends are drunk
Their innocence a flame
Will I see them again?
I dream of dreams to come
And temples built with love
I’m not a slave

This city lights of fame
Call to me again
Like diamonds in the rain
Where prophets tag their name
Her rivers filled with shame
Few faces stay the same

The time will never end
The lords of truth ascend
My scars I'll show again
My fireworks ignite
The spirit now takes flight
And how the glory came

I don’t mess around
Throw your weapon to the ground
My witches gather round
They laugh but make no sound

I am running in the black night
My skull in flame in the night
Pull out your knife
Pull out your knife
We can make it right

Black skull in flame
Power and the glory
The glory and the power
We can make it right
