You don't want me anymore
So I'll just walk right out the door
Played a game right from the start
I trust you, you used me
And now my hearts all torn apart

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on
Well I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

Try to see if I'll give up
But there wasn't any luck
It's a fact, fact of life
That's the games, games of strife
Everything is all stride

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on
Well I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on
Well I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

There's too many years
Whit too many tears
And too many days
Whith nothing to say

And how will we know
When there's now here to grow
And what's the facts
For life to show
