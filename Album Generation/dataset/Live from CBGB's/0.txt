[Intro: Malcolm X]
And during the few moments that we have left, we want to talk, right down to earth, in a language that everybody here can easily understand

[Verse 1: Living Colour]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you wanna be ohhh
I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

[Hook 1: Living Colour]
Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free

[Verse 2: Living Colour]
I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face of your T.V. ohh
I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you; still you love me
I tell you one and one makes three ohh
I'm the cult of personality
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi, ohh
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

[Hook 2: Living Colour]
Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a leader speaks, that leader dies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set you free

[Verse 3: Living Colour]
You gave me fortune, you gave me fame
You gave me power, in your God's name
I'm every person you need to be
Ohh, I'm, the, cult, of, per, so, na, lity
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
Personality

[Outro: John F. Kennedy (& Franklin D. Roosevelt)]
Ask not what your country can do for you
(The only thing we have to fear is fear itself)
