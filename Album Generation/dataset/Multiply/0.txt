So many reasons to stick around
Just as many to go
I guess I could see my days slippin on by
But you got me up
That's why I get up
Eh

No one else will call me
To get me out of bed
And no one else
Seems to work inside my head
Like you do
And you do
Yeah you do
Yeah you
Do it daily
You mmm
Do it daily
You
You're my cup of tea
That's just how I like to be ye
I just wanna thank you
Since you got me up
Since you got me up
