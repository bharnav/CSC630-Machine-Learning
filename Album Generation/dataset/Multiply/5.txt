You are so rarely
Rarely removed
Just left to move
With these tones misunderstood
Fresh tears leaving nervous on me
Time to repay
Back those eyes
Take those waters and settle 'em down
Just maybe
Next to you
See those tears clear as we separate
All this noise that you remove just
Calm your ears
Calm your ears baby
Music will not last
Even music music music will not last
I said
No no no
Music will not last
Said no no no baby music cannot last

Four of these fingers set to see
A clear ground division
Our division
Knows
Knows no lines
Clean these fingers clossing the line
Lines left nervous
Now to see
Can you see
With green removed
Once clear together now one's passing
And it's gone
Gone gone
Music will not last
Even music music music will not last
I said
No no no
Music can not last
No no no baby music cannot last
