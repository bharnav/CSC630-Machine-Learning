The city it don't like you
No never did
Never did
Won't stop
Won't stop
Till it got you on your knees
Give you a stack of beggar memories
Sends you on your way

Yeah
Get out
Get out
Of your boxes
Running running running with the gases
The city like you know
Don't want you around
Discovering suspicion at the bus stop
You're not one of our kind
You're not our kind
Said you're not our kind

The city it don't like you
No never did
Never did
Won't stop
Won't stop
Till it got you on your knees
Give you a stack of beggar memories
Sends you on your way

Running with the flocks
To get by
