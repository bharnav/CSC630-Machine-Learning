(a little bit more a little bit more)

I hope you understand what I'm saying to you
We never had a relationship
And now I'm telling you we're through
There ain't no easy way to get out of here
Got so good at hiding
I never made my feelings clear
Let me take a moment now to spell it out
When all this is over
I trust there'll be no doubt
All I want is the best for you but
There's only so much I'm willing to do
And the rest?
You gotta find someone else

Cuz with you
It's always
(a little bit more a little bit more)
Cuz with you
It's always
(a little bit more a little bit more)
I said cuz with you

Don't make it harder than it already is
Cuz it already is quite enough for me
I can take it for a little while
But a little while ainâ€™t gonna be
What you had in mind
Cuz what you had in mind
You know you'll never find
In a fella like me
It ain't no mystery from my history
I'm the kind of fool that can't see
In front of me

And all you ask from me is

(a little bit more a little bit more)

Got so complicated after we touched each other
I must admit it felt so good but you have another
You've been fighting so long how could you forget it?
We could do a whole lotta things but you're sure to regret it
With us it's over before it's begun
You got a good thing
So keep it going on
With us it's over before it's begun
You got a good thing so keep it going on
All I want is the best for you but
There's only so much I'm willing to do
All I want is the best for you but
There's only so much I'm willing to do
And the rest?
You gotta find somewhere else
