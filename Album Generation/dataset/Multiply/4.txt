It's a fine day
Just escaped from a bad dream
Asking what's the use of figuring it all out?
I'm not starting again
Just continuing the same
Asking what's the use of figuring it all out?

I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark
I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark
I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark

But what is the question again?
Ooohhhhwah
What's the use of figuring it all out?

I guess a man alone
Always talks too much
Can't start again
So he's just continuing the same
Asking what's the use?

What's the use?
What's the use?
What's the use?

Now we know where we're going
And who we are
Doesn't seem to get us
Too far
Cause everything else is still a mystery
And that mystery is

Life
I just wanna live

Life may sometimes be sad but it's always beautiful
Life may sometimes be sad but it's always beautiful
Life may sometimes be sad but
But it's always a question mark

A walking talking question mark
I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark
Oh
I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark
What is the question
I'm a question mark
A walking talking question mark
I'm a question mark
Baby I'm a question mark
But what
Is the question again

What's the use?
Yeah
What's the use?
What's the use baby
What's the use baby

Ooohohh

Figuring it all out
