What, what, what is it this time?
Could it be something I said?
Or maybe something I never said?

What, what, what is it this time?
Could it be something I did?
Or maybe something I never did?

What, what, what is it this time?

What, what, what is it this time?
Could it be, could it be
That actions speak louder than words?

It's either one thing or another
The same thing day after day
It's either something I didn't do
Or something I just didn't say
Oh i'm so tired of trying, trying, trying
To read your mind
Cuz baby what is it this time?
Oh baby, whoa

What, what, what is it this time?
Could it be, could it be
That actions speak louder than words?

But I'm tired of trying to read your mind
What?
Yeah
