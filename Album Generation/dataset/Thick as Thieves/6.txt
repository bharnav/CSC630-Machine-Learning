The sign on the wall was the same before
The words are so loud, as they fall from your mouth
And I know them miles are sure to come

You needed an out, I needed a change
I know that inside you feel the same

And now, I've been waiting here so long
I wish I could let go and just move on
Doesn't matter this time
Who's right and who was wrong
Cause it's never gonna hurt like this again

I know it was wrong, we changed so much
You said it was time, you had enough
I stare at the wall, for the old lights to come

You needed an out, you needed a change
I know that inside you feel the same

And now, I've been waiting here so long
I wish I could let go and just move on
Doesn't matter this time
Who's right and who was wrong
Cause it's never gonna hurt like this again
It's never gonna hurt like this again

I've been everywhere to find you here
Waiting at my door
I've done all I can, but somehow you want more

And now, I've been waiting here so long
I wish I could let go and just move on
Doesn't matter this time
Who's right and who was wrong
Cause it's never gonna hurt like this again
I'm never gonna hurt like this again
