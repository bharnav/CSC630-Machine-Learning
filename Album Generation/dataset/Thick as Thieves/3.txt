Sitting in a dark room
Falling in pieces
Try to find the right words
So you can sing along

Wear it like a tight noose
I don't wanna feel this
Might of made a wrong move
Now I'm all alone

I never know which way to go
A million thoughts I can't control
The city sleeps, but I can't close my eyes
In California
In California

Drowning in a bright room
Faking the feelings
Wonder if the right words
Are even here at all

I'm living through the hardest part
In a city full of fallen stars
A million dreams I can't close my eyes
In California, California
In California

How many miles until I lose myself
How many miles until I lose myself
How many miles until I lose myself
How many miles until I lose myself

In California, California
In California, California
How many miles until I lose myself
In California, California
How many miles until I lose myself
In California
How many miles until I lose myself
In California, California
How many miles until I lose myself
In California, California
California
