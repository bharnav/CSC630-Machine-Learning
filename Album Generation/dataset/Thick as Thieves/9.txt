I watched you fall to pieces
I let this whole world come undone
How would you know
You left me all surrounded
You left this broken by the sun
Look what you've done

You see what you wanted to see
Just take what you want from me

I'm running for my life
I'll run until the end
The only life I've known

You kept this all inside you
You kept me blinded by the light
How would you know
The weight that pulled you under
The fire inside you won't burn out
Look what you've done

You see what you wanted to see
Just take what you want from me

I'm running for my life
I'll run until the end
The only way I'm safe from falling
Leaves me crawling
You're running for your life
You'll run until the end
The only life you've known

I'll never be what you want me to be
I know that you see me
Feels like I'm coming apart at the seams
I know that you see me
I know that you see me

You see what you wanted to see
Just take what you want from me

I'm running for my life
I'll run until the end
The only way I'm safe from falling
God I'm crawling
You're running for your life
You'll run until the end
The only life you've known
The only life you've known
