A million miles away, from where you are
How did I let you get away under these stars
A thousand bridges burned I won't look back
A hundred lessons learned
And I won't let this moment pass

What would you say what would you do
Who would you hold onto
Where would you go with nothing to lose
Would you change
Who would you love, would you do it all the same
If today was your last day

These memories are scars from my past
No room for broken hearts cause they don't last

What would you say what would you do
Who would you hold onto
Where would you go with nothing to lose
Would you change
Who would you love, would you do it all the same
If today was your last day

Last day, your last day
Last day

What would you say what would you do
Who would you hold onto
Where would you go with nothing to lose
Would you change
Who would you love, would you do it all the same
If today was your last day

Last day
Last day
