We are the left behind
Lost on the roads you followed
We are the compromise
We’ve opened up our eyes
Fight the hand that feeds you lies
This time we make it right
Don’t need a reason tonight
So sick of waiting for something to change my life

Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling
Hey hey the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling

We’ll never fall in line
And walk the roads you followed

We are the ones who rise
Just open up your eyes

Fight the hand that feeds you lies
It’s time we make it right
Don’t need a reason tonight
So sick of waiting for something to change my life

Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling
Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling

Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling
Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling

Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling
Hey hey, the soul lives for the feeding
Hey hey, thick as thieves we are the feeling
