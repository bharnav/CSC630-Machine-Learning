With a southern smile she don't seem cold
Drive right through to the Midwest storm
There's a broken heart across the field
Where the sun don't shine and the wounds won't heal

With a sober smile I can't sit still
Gonna leave this life and you know I will
With all I've lost and all I hold
There's a need in me to lose control

Till I see you, but you don't see me
I bleed you, but you won't heal me
I scream you, but you don't hear me
I dreamed you, but you don't see me

Gonna cross that line, I won't look back
Gonna save myself from the things I lack
With all I've lost and all I'm told
There's a need in me to lose control

Till I see you, but you don't see me
I bleed you, but you won't heal me
I scream you, but you don't hear me
I dreamed you, but you don't see me

With a southern smile she don't seem cold
Drive right through to the Midwest storm
