I'm a vein that you opened
A fire in the night
A flame that you can't burn out
I remember you said: "You're the voice in my head"
And the feeling is gone from your eyes, far away
Away, away, away, away, don't let it kill you from the inside

Breathe it in, breathe it out
Let it all fall down
Let it go, let it go, whoa
Give it away, let it go
Just give it away, away, let it go

You're the last one to blame
You're the first one to lie
The words that you can't drown out
I remember the day, when your moment was changed
And the vanity is gone from your eyes, far away
Away, away, away, away, don't let it kill you from the inside

Breathe it in, breathe it out
Let it all fall down
Let it go, let it go, whoa
Give it away, let it go
Just give it away, away, let it go
Give it away

One last time, one last kill
No more lies, say you will
One last time, one last kill
No more lies, say you will

Breathe it in, breathe it out
Let it all fall down
Let it go, let it go, whoa
Burn it up, burn it out
Watch it all fall down
Let it go, let it go, whoa
Give it away, let it go
Just give it away, away, let it go
Give it away
Just give it away
Give it away
