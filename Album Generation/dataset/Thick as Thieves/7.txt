A million to one
A father, a son
Waste of life
With all these years gone by
I still feel the same

I'm trying to change
You left this like
A thief in the night
Run out of ways
And changes to make this right
And I don't need the same
And I don't blame you

And I don't really wanna change your mind
Cause it's all run out

The hardest way to start is over
Medicate till I feel sober
Lifes like war within
The silent lies that pull me under
Tell myself I don't belong here
Lifes like war within

The edge of the knife
The fear on the rise
So many lost
What too many gave away
It wasn't mine to take
Somebody failed you

And I don't really wanna change your mind
Cause it's all run out

The hardest way to start is over
Medicate till I feel sober
Lifes like war within
The silent lies that pull me under
Tell myself I don't belong here
Lifes like war within

Feel alive again
Breathing out the sin
Miles away they're calling out
And I'm alone again

The hardest way to start is over
Medicate till I feel sober
Lifes like war within
The silent lies that pull me under
Tell myself I don't belong here
Lifes like war within

The hardest way to start is over
Lifes like war within
The hardest way to start is over
Lifes like war within
Within
