Tulsa yesterday, tomorrow forever
Today I think I'll take my own sweet time
You can tell by my blues that I am no beginner
Or just look into my eyes

I learned my lessons in the days back in the dogwood
Left some footprints in the deep red clay
Found my way past the temptations of plenty
Let the sound take me all the way

It's a low down restless sorrow
To know the real pain of love
Some things you own and there's some you borrow

Till you let it go
Find a garden and let it grow
And what you find, let it shine
Let your chariot swing low

West wind blow
My blood runs cold from to much trouble
West wind blow
Howl thru my bones tonight

Tulsa yesterday, tomorrow forever
Today I think I'll take my own sweet time
You can tell by my shoes that I am a believer
Or just look into my eyes

It's a low down restless sorrow
To know the real pain of love
Some things you own and there's some you borrow

Till you let it go
Find a garden and let it grow
And what you find, let it shine
Let your chariot swing low
