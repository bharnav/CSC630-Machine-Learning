Tomorrow blues, you know I got them today
I can't believe what my baby say
Her lips are movin' all I hear is goodbye

Been on the road so long, my shoes turned to sand
I'm looking for a good time girl who understands
I'm looking for a rose in a garden of thorns

You been begging for what you owe
And baby that ain't right
It's time for the truth be told
Time to shed some light
And let it flow tonight

And let me see you, feel you
Be you before I head out down the line

Tomorrow blues, you know I got them right now
If you've been inside my footprints you'd know that I'm down
Staring up at the moon from a bottom of a well

Tomorrow blues, you know I got them again, you see
I remember when we were best friends
I held her hand she held my tremblin' heart

You been begging for what you owe
And baby that ain't right
It's time for the truth be told
Time to shed some light
And let it flow tonight

Let me see you, feel you
Be you 'fore I head out down the line

You been begging for what you owe
And baby that ain't right
It's time for the truth be told
Time to shed some light
And let it flow tonight

Let me see you, feel you
Be you 'fore I head out down the line
