Pacific Standard Time
Georgia state line
Thread the needle, riddle my rhyme
Come knock on my door

The fools finger wears the crown
Time to tie your ribbons 'round
Around the sun, around the moon
Around our love

A hundred days of rain in front of me
I’ve been through this storm before
Blow a kiss and wave goodbye to me
Oh, soon I’ll be outside your door

Pick an apple, bruise a peach
You can’t learn what you can’t teach
This ain’t dinner, it’s a feast
Just like old Levi

Hanging on to the hanging on
You can't make right unless you know wrong
Can't join the band less you sing the song
So let bygones be gone

A hundred days of rain in front of me
I’ve been through this storm before
Blow a kiss and wave goodbye to me
Oh, soon I’ll be outside your door

Fair and tender lady, take my mind and wander
Lay with me until the stars refuse to shine
Be my dream through sweet silver slumber
Beyond this morning past the gray walls of time

There is what we’re given
There is what we gave
What you lose, what you gain
There is what must be broken
What must be saved
And what’s already gone
And what’s already gone

A hundred days of rain in front of me
I’ve been through this storm before
Blow a kiss and wave goodbye to me
Morning comes like it has before
The ocean always finds the shore
So let it be forever more
