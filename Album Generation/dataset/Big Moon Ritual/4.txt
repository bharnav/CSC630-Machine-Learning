Big gun powder and the Glasgow girl
Our lady of the highway with a string of pearls
Well I ain't no modern masterpiece
A new surrealist movement in the key of G

Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh

Well, my baby loves me like an autoharp
Well, she plucks my mind and she strums my heart
Yeah, but we’re both victims of gravity
She shall never fly away from me

Well you can tell by looking I’m not like the rest
Sometimes a broken mirror reflects back the best

So won't you look inside my Chinese box
Where you hold the key to every lock
It’s made of old chestnut and a lacquer top
Yeah, but once you start you can never stop

Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh

Well you can tell by looking I’m not like the rest
Sometimes a broken mirror reflects back the best

A vagabond child has come back home
A walk through the clouds in a sky the color of stone

Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh

Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
