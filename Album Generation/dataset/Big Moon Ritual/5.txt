To you I'm just a memory
Something lost among the leaves
Something found along the way

And so begin these empty pages
At the end of a dream
Watch it slowly fade away

The slight of hand, the bait and switch
All the parlor tricks have been played on me
I've seen 'em come and I've watched them go
Into the night down a road of stone
Beware, oh take care

I guess it takes a thief to know one
And liars live for broken things
Traitors just smile and smile

The actor has his black mirror
The poet, a poison throne
To rule his kingdom alone

But I'm still singing the blues
Dancing that old soft shoe
I'm still driftin' from cloud to cloud
Never looking to come down

From hell to high water
Over that angel bridge
Out into the wilderness

Beware, oh take care
Beware, oh take care
Beware, oh take care
Beware, oh take care

Oh, beware, oh take care
Oh, beware, oh take care
Beware, oh take care
