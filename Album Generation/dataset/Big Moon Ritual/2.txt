I was thirteenth at the table
When the wine was passed around
Amid an air of suspicion
My glance was met with callous frowns
If I was superstitious
I'd be the black cat nobody wants hangin' 'round

Dark whispers in the hallway
Accusations out of bitter mouths
Strange figures in the doorway
A dog barks a drunkard's laugh
There's screaming in the kitchen
A glass breaks just then that the lights go out

So let the winter chase butterflies
Let the child believe his lies
Let the road run past my door
I can't stay here anymore

And I won't, I won't turn back
To see my dream burning on the side of the road
'Cause sometimes it just goes like that
Falling or flying, star or stone

Close the window I just can't hear the highway anymore
Lay beside me and let our fire burn until the dawn
Ooh
Ooh

Telephone was ringing
A heavy price on the line
Outside a window
A comet shoots across the sky
Between love and hope and money, there's loss and pain and honey
So take a spoonful every time

And if you don't like what you see
Don't come running to me
'Cause I'm bound to my own way
I'm one million miles away

And I won't, I won't turn back
See my dream burning on the side of the road
'Cause sometimes it just goes like that
Falling or flying, star or stone

No I won't, I won't turn back
To see my dream burning on the side of the road
'Cause sometimes it just goes like that
Falling or flying, star or stone
