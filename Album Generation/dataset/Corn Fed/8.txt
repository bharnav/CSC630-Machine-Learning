We'll I've kissed a cowboy on a sawdust floor
Shot tequila with him till we couldn't dance no more
Ran a hundred miles an hour with a Harley man
Stuck to him tighter than his sexy biker tan
Sailed with a boy on his big ole yacht
Drank Dom Perignon while we island hopped
I like preacher sons
And hell raisers, guitar pickers
And wave surfers

(Chorus:)
No I've never really had a type
I just like a man who'll treat me right
As long as they got a good heart
Big or small
Short or tall
I love 'em all

And them city dudes in there tailored suits
Make me wanna do things that I shouldn't do
But, you know what really drives me nuts
Are the George Strait ringers with there wrangler butts

(Chorus)
I've met a lot of fellows from North to South
Sweet clean talkers and dirty mouths
I hope someday I'll find someone
That'll be all of them wrapped up in one

(Chorus)
It ain't who they are or who they wanna be
It's all about how they treat me
As long as they got a good heart
Big or small
Short or tall
Long hair or bald
I love 'em all
