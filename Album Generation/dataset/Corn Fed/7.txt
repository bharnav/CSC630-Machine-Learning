There's a Stetson in the back of the room
And he's movin' to a hip hop groove
And he's doin' it like a country boy do, yeah

And there's Jenny givin' it all she's got
She's dancin' with a bombshell blonde
They're shakin' it up on the table top
You don't have to worry what your mama said
Just check that baggage at the front door

(Chorus:)
Welcome to the good ole days, get here early stay up late
If you get funky it's okay
There's something goin' on in here, it's not your average atmosphere
Everybody's so glad you came, welcome to the good ole days

We got a D.J., we call him Dreadlock Jones
And he's mixing Haggard and Stones
Keeps it bumpin' all night long
You can two step, you can bust a move
Be a redneck or you can just play it smooth
Well it's all about finding your own groove

Forget about tomorrow and your yesterdays
Just let it go and live for tonight

(Chorus x4)
