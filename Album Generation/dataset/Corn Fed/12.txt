I live on a hill overlooking the skyline
With a breathtaking view of the big city bright lights
A hand full of stars and a heart full of dreams
Brought me down this road that's never what it seems

Here I'm just another face and just another voice
Just a wanna be that's gonna be if I have a choice
The woman I am ain't the one that I was
You say I've come to my roots long enough

(Chorus:)
I can't run from the past that's given me wings
If I had to choose between this and what's left of me
Then I choose me
I guess I've come a long way for a small town girl

There was a time I would have done anything
Trade in my soul just to play in the game
Put my pride on the table, put my name on the line
It's a job that I love but it's not my life

(Chorus x2)
I'm proud to be a small town girl
