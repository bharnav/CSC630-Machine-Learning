It's 3 am and you finally say
You're sorry for acting that way
You didn't really mean to make me cry
Oh baby, sometimes I wonder

(Chorus:)
Why does it always have to come down to me leaving
Before you'll say 'I love you'
Why do you always use the words that cut the deepest
When you know how much it hurts me
Oh baby why, do you do that to me

I know you'd never let me walk away
So why do you push me till I break
Why am I always on the verge of goodbye
Before you'll show me how you really feel inside

(Chorus)
Why do you always use the words that cut the deepest
When you know how much it hurts me
Oh baby why, do you do that to me

Why do you do that to me
Why do you do that to me
