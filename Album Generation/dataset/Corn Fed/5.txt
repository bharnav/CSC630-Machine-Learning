I don't feel hung over I don't feel strung out
Could I be clean and sober, did I finally lay it down
The drug of his love
Is out of my blood

It's a revelation, like be born again
Have you ever had that feeling, when you wash away your sin
Your soul is set free
Does anybody know what I mean?

(Chorus:)
Can I get an amen
Can I get a witness
Tell me are you with me
Holla' if you hear this
Can I get an amen
Amen

This freedom that I'm tasting, is such a better buzz
After all the time wasted, things are looking up
There's a light that I see
Does anybody know what I mean?

(Chorus)
No more tears, no more heartache, no more, no more, no more pain!

(Chorus)
Can I get an amen

Come on throw your hands up
Shout a hallaluyah
Everbody sing
Let the spirit move ya
Can I get an amen!

(Chorus)
Come on throw your hands up
Shout a hallaluyah
Everbody sing
Let the spirit move ya
Can I get an amen
