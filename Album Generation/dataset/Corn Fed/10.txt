These pearls from my mother, passed down from her mother
Of everything they gave me, I treasure them most
Can't wear them, can't hold them, don't come from the ocean
Oh, they're way more precious than anything I own
They're written in my soul

(Chorus:)
Remember who you are, and don't forget to pray
Make sure he's your best friend
When you give your heart away
Be kind, be strong
Be someone everyone can count on
Yeah, someday
I'm gonna give my little girl
These pearls

I'll teach her about make-up, boyfriends and break-ups
I'll share all the wisdom I've ever learned
Like beauty's on the inside, give it your best try
I'll pass down the same words I've always heard
And she'll carry them with her

(Chorus)
Bridge She'll tell her daughter, and she'll tell hers too
I've saved these pearls just for you

(Chorus)
