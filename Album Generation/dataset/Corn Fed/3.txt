Everybody knows that Shania ain't country
That's what they used to say about Johnny Cash
And Garth Brooks shouldn't be smashing those guitars
But a hundred million records ain't bad

And all the girls say they wanna be like Dolly
Pardon me but I think it's Sheryl Crow
If you ask me I say screw all the boundries
Cause it's all about whatever moves your soul

(Chorus:)
And I think it's time we climbed off our high horses
Who's to say whose right or wrong
I think it's 'bout time that we all get together
Raise our glasses and sing along

Well I love Patsy and I like Bob Marley
He sang about one love, one love
And sometimes I fly like an eagle
With Steve Miller playing in my pickup truck

And the country boys like that Kid rockin' in Detroit
Cause he's got about as much southern soul as ole Hank
And who'd of ever thought that Mr. Kenny Chesney
Would be laughing all the way to the bank

(Chorus)
Well everybody's got their little opinions
It's either too much of this or not enough of that
Why can't we just live life the way we want to live it
And got off each others backs

(Chorus)
Everybody knows that Shania ain't country
That's what they used to say about Johnny Cash
