Written by Shannon Brown / Vicky McGehee / John Rich

He walked up
All buff
In his cowboy cuts
Bringing on his best come on lines
His words of choice
Of course
Would you like to save a ______
And ride a cowboy tonight
You know he thought he had me raring to go
Like some kind of ho
Whoa
But what he didn't know

Chorus
It takes a big man
It takes a big, big man
It takes a really big man
To love a little woman like me

Daddy Mac
Lots of cash
In his long Cadillac
Thinks he can have his way with anyone
He thinks
With a wink
He can buckle my knees
And my heart will just come undone
But I'm the kind of girl
Who don't like to rush
Into a touch
If I'm gonna get serious
