One look and you know what's coming
Storm cloud is moving in
Ain't no use in running
Just take it like a man

Oh Lord what have you started
Cold front is settin' in
Shelter no you can't find it
Judgement day is here again

(Chorus:)
Oh you better find some cover
Ooh when you hear that rumblin' sound
Mmm cause there ain't no warning
Oh when your woman comes unwound yeah
She brings the thunder
She brings the lightning down

The straight line that you've been walking
Lately is wearing thin
You can't help but cross it
Every now and then

(Chorus x2)
