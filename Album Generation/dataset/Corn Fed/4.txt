Baby that look on you face
Seems to say it all
I've never seen you acting this way
It's like you just hit a wall
So put your keys back on the table
Leave that bottle on the shelf
Please don't look for comfort somewhere else

(Chorus:)
If you're gonna turn to something
Baby just turn to me
I'm listening
You can tell me anything
I know you want to find yourself
An easy remedy
But if you're gonna turn to something
Baby just turn to me

Crying and coming undone
Don't make you less of a man
You know everybody needs someone
Every now and then
Baby I know you're hurting
You want to make it go away
But don't let some brand of bourbon
Take my place

(Chorus)
Bridge
Hey it's ok if you want to fall apart
There ain't no better place, then right here in my arms

(Chorus)
