[Verse 1]
A day once dawned
And it was beautiful
A day once dawned
From the ground
Then the night she fell
And the air was beautiful
The night she fell
All around

[Chorus]
So look see the days
The endless colored ways
And go play the game
That you learned
From the morning

[Verse 2]
And now we rise
And we are everywhere
And now we rise
From the ground
See she flies
And she is everywhere
See she flies
All around

[Chorus]
So look see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game
That you learned
From the morning
