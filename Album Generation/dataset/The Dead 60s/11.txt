The dysfunctional family
Take the kids away on access day
To the seediness beside the sand
It's a disgrace, a total wasteland

The industry's dead and it's a tabloid town
The crowds of people don't want you around
Drinking holes, lonely arcade doors
It's a disgrace on the concrete shore

I got a room in the last resort
I got a room in the last resort

Driving down your motorway lights
Drinking boys wild for the night
The industry's dead, packed up and gone
It's nobody's home, they left the lights turned on

I got a room in the last resort
A misery on the concrete shore
The haunted faces won't understand
A weekend break in disgraceland
