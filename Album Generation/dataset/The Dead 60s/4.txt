We get high
Before we get low
And I was walking down in a frosty street
I was looking back for home

We get high
Before we get low
And I was drenched in heat in the city tonight
You pull me back and go
We get high

Well it beats being a rent man
Or when you're down in the roulette mine
And as the city casts its shadow
We commit the perfect crime

We get high
Before we get low
And I was drenched in heat in the city tonight
You pull me back and go

When you're stuck inside your bubble
And people, they're saying it's great
But like so much before us
You'll never escape the fate

We get high
Before we get low
And I was walking down in a frosty street
I was looking back for home
We get high

And I've seen you all down on them drinking signs
With all your money, your money, your money, your money, your money
We get high
The only crime I can never commit on them a street
We got low
Is trying to make all the ends meet
We get high
Now hear this!
Hey fellas!
We got low
