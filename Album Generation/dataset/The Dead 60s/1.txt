You don't wanna cross me or try to get in my way
We'll give them back their glossy scheme and end that holiday
The thought of violence a relief the action brings you grief
There's crooked walks on tilting floors
It's been like this for years

All this time I never knew
You're reading from a different page
All this time I never knew
You're reading from a different page
Or just the same page
In a different age

This suits you down to the ground, I bet you've met your goals
We'll counteract the words beyond we keep no track of scores
Caught up in an empty high could you identify
Stories of a conquest only seen in a mind's eye

All this time I never knew
You're reading from a different page
All this time I never knew
You're reading from a different page
Or just the same page
In a different age
