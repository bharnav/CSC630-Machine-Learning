I guess I'm pretty happy, ah with my lot
I paid my way to get what I got
I strive, I strive for something else
But these four walls, my prison cell
There's something else that I don't need
Add extra hours to the working week
I tried to steal, but I lost it all
I wanna be, I wanna be horizontal

I guess I'm pretty bored at the present day
I'm even getting bored at the things I say
I strive and strive for something more
I count loose change for my last call

Theres something else that I don't need
I'm stuck inside a teenage dream
Hang around, staring at the wall
And I wanna be, I wanna be horizontal
Oh yeah!

Well don't count seconds, I wanna be horizontal
Well don't count seconds, I wanna be horizontal
Well don't count seconds, I wanna be horizontal
Well don't count seconds, I wanna be horizontal
