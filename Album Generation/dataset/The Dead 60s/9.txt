There's something shaking from my head to my feet
I watch the house lights going off in my street
Real night vision, my only desire
And as it fades to nothing we go

Down in the heart of the nation
Out cause the weekend is calling me in
But I'm trying to follow
The tick tick tick at the heart of the nation

There's someone watching on CCTV
24 hours I'm stuck on a screen
Lost in the shadow they follow me round
And I will fade to nothing as we go

Down in the heart of the nation
Out cause the weekend is calling me in
But I'm trying to follow
The tick tick tick at the heart of the nation

Down in the heart of the nation
Out cause the weekend is calling me in
But I'm trying to follow
The tick tick tick at the heart of the nation
