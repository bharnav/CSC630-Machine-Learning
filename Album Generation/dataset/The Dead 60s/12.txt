I never knew what a good time was
Till I had a good time with you
When I see the green light you see the red one
The better days to come on through
Oh you know I can't stop
Oh Lord! You know I won't stop
Cause all that I give is all that I've got

Heading down in the Avenue District
Caught a glimpse another boy in blue
Red faces painting a picture
Of better days to come on through

Oh you know I can't stop
Oh Lord! You know I won't stop
Cause all that I give is all that I've got

You're not the law
And I'm no fool
You're not the law
So don't shoot!

Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me, shoot me down

You know I can't stop
Oh, you know I won't stop
Cause all that I give is all that I've got

You're not the law
And I'm no fool
You're not the law
So don't shoot!

Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me, shoot me down
Cause you're not the law
Down in the Avenue District
You'll see me painting a picture
