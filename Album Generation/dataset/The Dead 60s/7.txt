You gotta fight some time
On a dead end line
When your time has come
Don't be crying for another son

There's time to dry your tears
You've got fifteen years
Learn your game
They'll never forget your name

So won't you control this
Cause I don't need this

Before you meet your fate
Let's interrogate
Never set your sights
On cashing in the bill of rights

There's time to dry your tears
You've got fifteen years
Learn your game
They'll never forget your name

So won't you control this
Cause I don't need this

So won't you control this
Cause I don't need this
And won't you control this
Cause I don't need this
