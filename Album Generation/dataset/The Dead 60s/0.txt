Airwaves beam from the light on the tower
Get my kicks from your eleventh hour
Won't you gimme some more
Riot on the radio
Burning up say my mind's on fire
A talk talk speaker on the end of the wire
You know it cancelled it out
Riot on the radio
You know it's turning me on
Riot on the radio

Yaow ow ow aow

Airwaves beam from the light on the tower
Get my kicks from your eleventh hour
Won't you gimme some more
Riot on the radio

You know it's turning me on
Riot on the radio
Riot, Riot!
Won't you gimme some more!
Riot, Riot!
