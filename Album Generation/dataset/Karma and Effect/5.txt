[Verse 1]
Trust all the things
I tell you are true
Dress up in your best
So I can be proud of you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you

[Chorus}
You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

[Verse 2]
How I wish I could be rid of this ennui
Make you regret and make you afraid of me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And never believe I do this for me
And never believe I'll do this gently

[Chorus (x2)]

[Bridge]
Can't believe in broken promises
And render conscious all of me
I'll tell you it's all for you
Then deny it

[Chorus (x2)]

[Outro (x2)]
It's all for me
