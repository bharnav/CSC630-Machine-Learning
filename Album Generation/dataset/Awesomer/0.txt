Hey boy, where ya goin'?
Don't you wanna stay and play
Hey boy, where ya goin'?
Don't you wanna stay up late

Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay up late
Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay and play

Oh - I caught you lookin'
There no mistakes
Oh - I caught you lookin'
Don't you wanna stay and play?

Hit me one, two and three times
Oh i see your light shine
Hit me one,two and three time
When we stay up late

Hey boy, where ya goin'?
Don't you wanna stay and play
Hey boy, where ya goin'?
Don't you wanna stay up late

Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay up late
Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay and play

I see your light shine
When we stay up late

Tell you a tale
Tell you a story
Do you hear the knock on door?

Come here and tell
I'll tell you a story
Do you hear the ocean roar?

Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay up late
Good boys don't go to bed early
They like to stay and play
