[Verse 1]
If you want my heart
You have to promise not to tear it apart
Cause my heart has been hurt a lot
And it always seems, love is not sweet like in dreams
Something falls through
But I don't want that to happen to me and you

[Hook]
So be, careful, warning, fragile heart
So be, careful, warning, fragile heart

Last Saturday
We ate dinner at you parents place
Last Saturday you said
"How you feel will not go away"
All the fishes in the sea
They could not be happier than me

[Hook]
So be, careful, warning, fragile heart
So be, careful, warning, fragile heart

[Bridge]
Only fools believe that
Nothing changes, nothing leaves
But I need to believe that we at least weÂ´ll have some dignity
Cause everything changes, nothing stays the same
But thats no excuse to be casual or to place the blame
You have to be careful with me

[Hook]
So be (so be), careful, warning, fragile heart
So be (so be), careful (careful), warning, fragile heart
So be (won't you be), careful (careful), warning (warning)
Fragile, fragile heart (fragile)
So be (won't you be), careful, warning, fragile heart
