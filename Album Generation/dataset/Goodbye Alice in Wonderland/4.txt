[Verse 1]
Babies on beach blankets headed for Mars
Cute boys with crew cuts in [Day-Glo surf bars?]
There's a pretty lady in a bikini
Her eyes are bright
But her teeth look like smashed out window panes
Trying to fix her dreams
With sushi and facials and carrot juice

[Chorus]
There's a wide wall
That we can't see over now
And that's OK
We're still learning mistakes
They are allowed
If you're a satellite
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Yoga classes so you can look good
In your singles bar
California is sure lovely
It's the home of the stars
And everybody is a nice body, but souls are like shadows
Hollow inside, chocked and hiding behind
Volleyball's and Valium
Power Bars

[Chorus]
There's a wide wall
That we can't see over now
But that's OK
We're still learning mistakes
They are allowed
If you're a satellite
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
We understand a lot of things
About modern technology, but not about dreams
Our hearts are on the shelves, we can't fix ourselves
But we can fix a satellite
Cause in Hollywood, the hero's are strung out on grace
And half skin gypsies are crying "leaving this place"

[Chorus]
There's a wide wall
That we can't see over now
But that's OK
We're still learning mistakes
They are allowed
If you're a satellite
Oh, oh, oh
We can fix a satellite
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
The pope can't fix my broken heart
Rock N' roll can't fix my broken heart
Valium can't fix my broken heart
Miss Cleo can't fix my broken heart
But will you fix my broken heart?
Oh will you, fix my broken heart
Cause' I'm gonna give ya

[Outro]
Satellite, satellite, satellite
Satellite
Satellite, satellite, satellite
Satellite tonight
Fix my broken heart
Fix my broken heart
Satellite
Satellite, satellite
