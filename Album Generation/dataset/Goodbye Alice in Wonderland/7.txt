[Verse 1]
Tonight I have the strangest feeling
Searched for answers on a hotel ceiling
When did my heart first feel this way?
Being alone used to be just fine
Now life without you is just passing time

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard you call my name
Reached for your hand, it was in vein
When you're not here, it feels like a hole in my chest
Get dressed, look in the mirror, say, oh god
I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight
I couldn't leave you even if I tried
Your heart beats inside of me
Like a star in the dark of night
Like birds lost in flight
Like clouds in the sky of blue
I belong with you

[Verse 3]
I've been together, but felt alone
I've made love without love being shown
I've seen sorrow in a pair of dice
All things that came in two's made me cry
Until tonight

[Chorus]
So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight
I couldn't leave you even if I tried
Your heart beats inside of me
Like a star in the dark of night
Like birds lost in flight
Like clouds in the sky of blue
I belong with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop, won't stop
Love is what we've got
I know I've reached the top
When I put my arms around you
Can't stop, won't stop
You are all I want
So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight

[Chorus]
So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight
I couldn't leave you even if I tried
Your heart beats inside of me
Like a star in the dark of night
Like birds lost in flight
Like clouds in the sky of blue
I belong with you

[Outro]
I can't stop, won't stop
Love is what we've got
I know I've reached the top
When I put my arms around you
I can't stop, won't stop
Love is what we've got
I know I've reached the top
When I put my arms around you
I can't stop, won't stop
Love is what we've got
I know I've reached the top
When I put my arms around you
