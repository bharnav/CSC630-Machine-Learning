[Verse 1]
Housewives told to recapture their youth
By wearing floral print and suede
Fixing their hairdos with PC, chemical-free hairspray
Martha Stewart taught them to make on TV
I was raised a farmgirl
I'm too far from home, all alone on the road
Trying to figure out who I am now that the stardust has turned to sand
And the sand has turned to stone on the starmaking machine

[Chorus]
I'm 31 years old
That ain't the end, but it sure ain't where I began

[Verse 2]
And my daddy, he wrote songs and he broke colts
And went back to school to get a degree
Now he teaches music to kids, he taught music to me
And this Alaskan girl has been living in Stephenville, Texas, that is
Yes, you guessed it
I moved here because I fell in love with a man
I moved his ex-old lady's things out of the closet
The same closet I moved my things back in
No, it did not make me feel that great
As if to demonstrate everything's temporary
If you give it enough time


[Chorus]
I'm 31 years old
That ain't the end, but it sure ain't where I began


[Verse 3]
But hey, I'm just a kid, I've got nothing to lose
I'm a singer of songs, I'm a player for crowds
Hey Mom, look, I'm an entertainer
I'm a modern day troubadour
Trying to find justice with six strings
Trying to make the world make sense out of me
Trying to be loved completely, trying to love honestly
Trying to find a decent high noon cup of tea
In another hotel
I'm trying to listen to the leaves speak
Trying to steal secrets from fishes in the creek
Trying to figure out who I am
A pretty mediocre cook, an even worse mathematician
Maybe a mother one day
What will it be?

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to figure out who I am
But there's no hand to hold, no Doctor Martin Luther King
There's just sycophants
And the mindlessness on TV
We all read magazines for the latest ways to behave
So hey, why not follow me, the blond bombshell deity?
I'll sell you neat ideas without big words
And a little bit of cleavage to help wash it all down
You know, everybody thought Godard was a clown, man
That ain't gonna be me

[Chorus]
I'm 31 years old
That ain't the end, but it sure ain't where I began

[Outro]
Guess that just makes it Stephenville
Texas
