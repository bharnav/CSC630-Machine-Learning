[Verse 1]
I called you late last night
Said you didn't feel like talkin'
Had to blow off a little bit of steam
Said you were tired of feeling so uptight

[Chorus]
You make me so blue
Oh, I get so lost inside of you, but
I cannot always find my way
To where you are

[Verse 2]
Oh, used to be so easy
Use to be so much fun
You say (yeah) that was back when you believed in my love, but that

[Chorus]
Things are not so simple now
Oh, I've turned off the lights somehow, and
In the darkness you cannot always find your way
To where I am

[Verse 3]
Please don't
Take your lights from me
'Cause if you did
I would no longer be able to see
Please, can't you see
I need, you

[Bridge]
I am a princess and I'm locked inside this stone tower of song, and I
I'm trying to write messages on the window baby, God I just wanna belong

[Chorus]
Choose me
Choose me
Pick me, take me, oh, I need to believe
Oh, no one else exsits for you now, and
No one else exsists for me
Oh, you are my home, and I have
Finally found my way
To where you are
