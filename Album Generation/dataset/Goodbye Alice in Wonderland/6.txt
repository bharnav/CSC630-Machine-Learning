[Verse 1]
Come here buttercup
Let me fill you up
Can't you see I'm the blue in your skies
You can tell by the stars in my eyes, oh
Dawn always comes too soon
It hurts me like a bruise
There's a hole in my pillow
Where you used to be
It feels like a hole in the middle of me

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh just take my hand
To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you're still my man
I'll try to find the words to say
That I want you always to stay
To wake up with you every single day
But words get in the way
Words get in the way

[Verse 2]
Tell your boss you're dead
And let's go back to bed
You make me wanna break out in song
But everytime I try, it just comes out wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh just take my hand
To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you're still my man
I'll try to find the words to say
That I want you always to stay
To wake up with you every single day
But words get in the way
Words get in the way

[Bridge]
I leave a message on your answering machine
I try to say what I really mean

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh just take my hand
To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you're still my man
I'll try to find the words to say
That I want you always to stay
To wake up with you every single day
Oh, oh, oh just take my hand
To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you'll be my man
I try and find the nerve to say
That I want you always to stay
To wake up with you every single day
But words get in the way
Words get in the way
