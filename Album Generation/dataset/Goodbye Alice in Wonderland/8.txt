[Verse 1]
Your lungs fill up with concrete
Her voice is all you can hear
Red lips and a screwdriver
Wrapped around some mink-clad queer
And you know that she's no diamond
In this damn jukebox hell
'Cause only fools gold fools fools
In two-bit hotels
But she's cooler than all that
A real high-class cat
Queen of the last dance rodeo

[Chorus]
But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of a soul
'Cause you know...
All you need is a heart to call home
All you need is a heart to call home
That's all

[Verse 2]
Light bulbs, and nylons
And plastic chandeliers
Objects are only objects
They can't feel when you're near
And tangerine lips
And lily-white breasts
These things are eternal
Inside them humanity rests
The skin is like a seashell
You listen to the soul
Like an old-time radio show

[Chorus]
'Cause under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of a soul
'Cause you know...
All you need is a heart to call home
All you need is a heart to call home
That's all...

[Bridge]
Don't wander too far
On one constant star
Darkness exists, except where you are
My feet are filled with wandering
They follow your own
'Cause everywhere you are feels like home
So search all you miners
Your hunters of dreams
Look in the alleyways
For what you know is not what it seems
And fame, all you maidens
But don't resist too long
At least look behind you
And see your own shadow's gone
Don't you know it's the last rodeo
You gotta find yourself a cowboy
Or someone to keep you warm when it's cold

[Chorus]
Cause under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of a soul
'Cause you know...
All you need is a heart (to call home)
(All you need is a heart)
To call home
All you need is a heart
To call home
All you need is a heart
(All you need, all you need is)
Call home
Is a heart, that's all
That's...
