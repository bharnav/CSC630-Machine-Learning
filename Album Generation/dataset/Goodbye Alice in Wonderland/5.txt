[Verse 1]
I am talking, but you can't quite hear what I say
I come closer
But you push me away
I should leave, but I don't have the strength
I can't think
Please, can't you see that I am down on my knees?
My heart's in your hand
And you squeeze
I want the whole thing, but you give me a part
It's time you start
So I push and I pull
And I don't know which way to go

[Chorus]
Stop me, stop me from falling
'Cause I can see
See where this is going
If you love me
Then why do you leave me?
If you need me
Then I'll love you only
When I am the only one, too

[Verse 2]
I just can't make you understand
I want your heart, but you hold up your hand
You say space is what you need
But you want me
To be true
To just you
While you get to do whatever you want to

[Chorus]
Stop me, stop me from falling
'Cause I can see
See where this is going
If you love me
Then why do you leave me?
If you need me
Then I'll love you only
When I am the only one, too

[Bridge]
You'll never stop
It's gotta change
You don't want a lover
You want a world of slaves
I can't resist falling into those arms
Those boyish charms
You think I won't leave
Yes, you're good, but not so good I can't see

[Bridge]
Stop me
I can see, see where this is going
If you love me, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Stop me, stop me from falling
'Cause I can see
See where this is going
If you love me
Then why do you leave me?
If you need me
Then I'll love you only
When I am the only one
Then I'll love you only
When I am the only one
Then I'll love you only
When I am the only one, too
