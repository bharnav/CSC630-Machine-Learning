[Verse 1]
I say to myself
Self, why are you awake again? It's one A.M
Standing with the fridge wide open, staring
Such a sight, florescent light
The stars are bright
Might make a wish, if I believed in that shit but
As it is, I might watch TV
Cause it's nice to see people more messed up than me
I say to myself, as I smile at the wall, just let myself fall

[Chorus]
It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see
It's gonna be alright, cause I'm alright with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gotta be

[Verse 2]
I shiver, shut the door
Can't think standing here no more
I'm alone, my mind's racing, heart breaking
Can you be everything I need you to be?
Can you protect me like a daughter?
Can you love me like a father?
Can you drink me like water?
Say I'm like the desert, just Way Hotter
The point of it all
Is that if I should fall
Still you're name I'll call

[Chorus]
It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see
It's gonna be OK, cause I'm OK with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be

[Bridge]
As long as we laugh out loud
Laugh like we're mad
Cause this crazy, mixed up beauty is all that we have
Because what's love but an itch we can't scratch, a joke we can't catch
God, but still we laugh
Get back in bed, turn off the TV
You say "It'll be alright baby, just wait and see."

[Chorus]
It's gonna be all right, it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be all right, just wait and see
It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day, just wait, just see
It's gonna be okay, cause I'm okay with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be okay...

[Outro]
Uh oh, I'm awake again
It's one A.M
Staring
Such a sight
Well, at least the stars are bright
