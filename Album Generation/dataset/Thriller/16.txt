*Now a Behind-the-Scenes treat from the Original Voice Over Session for "Thriller", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the full unreleased second verse written by Rod:*

[Voices - Vincent Price, (Michael Jackson) & Quincy Jones:]

--

(Okay, Say "Thriller" any-anytime you want.)

[Intro]
(Hi, this is Michael Jackson.)
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is-
(The Thriller!)

--

*Vincent laughs.* (Do We both say it?)
Say it together? Yes. I say "inviting you" too? Alright. Yeah...

Anytime. Tape's Rolling.

[Intro 2]
(Hi, this is Michael Jackson.)
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to-

“The Thriller.”
(“The Thriller.”)
[Rap]
Darkness falls across the land
The mid-night hour is close at hand...
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighbourhood
And who's whoever shall be found...
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpses shell!

The demons squeal in sheer delight
Its you they spy - so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet!
You try to run, you try to scream...
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you with its icy grip

The foulest stench is in the air -
The funk of forty-thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom...
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver!
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller!

Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...

...Hmmph, that's great fun! Spare taker, cut. Okay-Alright!
