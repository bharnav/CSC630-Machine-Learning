[Verse 1 - Michael Jackson]
Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams
Since I Met Her From The Start
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One
Who Is Special In Her Heart

[Chorus - Michael (will.i.am)]
The Girl Is Mine (She Mine, She Mine, She Mine)
The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)
I Know She's Mine (She Mine, She Mine, She Mine)
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)

[Verse 2 - Michael]
I Don't Understand The Way You Think
Saying That She's Yours, Not Mine
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams
Really Just A Waste Of Time

[Chorus - Michael (will.i.am)]
The Girl Is Mine (She Mine, She Mine, She Mine)
The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)
Don't Waste Your Time (Your Time, Don't Waste Your Time, Don't - Your Time, Don't)
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)

[Bridge]
I Love You More Than He (Take You Anywhere)
But I Love You Endlessly (Loving We Will Share)
So Come And Go With Me
Two on the town
But We Both Cannot Have Her
So It's One Or The Other

[Verse 3]
Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time
That She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind

[Chorus - Michael (will.i.am)]
The Girl Is Mine (She Mine, She Mine, She Mine)
The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)
Don't Waste Your Time (Your Time, Don't Waste Your Time, Don't - Your Time, Don't)
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine (She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock)

[Verse 4 - Will.i.am (Michael)]
She Love The Way I Love Her Low
The Way I Love Her High
She Love To Say Hello
And Never Say Goodbye
I Call Her Mommy
And She Call Me Papa
I'm Sorry Mike But
She Love The Way I Rock Her
And You Know, You Know, You Know I Really Care
(You Know, You Know, You Know I Care, Oh, Girl)
And She Know, She Know The Love Is Right Here
And I Know, I Know The Love Is Real True
And Now They Know, They Know Just How The Willie Do

[Outro - Will.i.am (Michael)]
They Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock
The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock
The Way I Roll With It
The Way I Rock With It
The Way I Rock With the King Of Pop, Non- Stop With It
The Way I Rock, The Way, The Way
The Way I Rock, They Way, The Way, The Way I Rock, I Rock, I Rock
Will.I.Am None Stop - Rollin With The King Of Pop
MJ, Make It Hot (Ah!)
Yeah, You Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock
