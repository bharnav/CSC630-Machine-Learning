[Intro]
Tell all the dreams that you have let slip right through your hands
Do you feel lost inside of someone else's life

[Chorus 1]
And we're not going to live forever
Can you tell me is it now or never
I'm not going to make up your mind

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna live without you
And I don't wanna live a lie
We'll never know till we try
Yeah we'll never know till we try

[Bridge]
Failure is the only way to learn till you've come undone
The rest will never find out what they might have been

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
So don't tell me sometime just where did we go wrong, yeah

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
