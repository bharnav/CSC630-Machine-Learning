[Verse 1]
All the stars are out tonight it feels as though I might
Make some sense out of this madness will it turn out right

[Chorus 1]
Who's to say where the wind will blow

[Verse 2]
Time will tell us if we're out of answers when it stops
Climb back down to the beginning
Take it from the top

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground
Do you pick up the pieces all around
And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
Take your chances turn around and go

All the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray
Strange our life coincides with the seasons of today

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
What happens when everything is lying on the ground
Do you pick up the pieces all around

[Chorus 3]
And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
Take your chances turn around and go

[Verse 4]
Carry on you say
Bring the best of today
All I see is struggling on the way
Maybe when the sun crashes through the gray
I can find the strength to make it through the day
Through the day

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
