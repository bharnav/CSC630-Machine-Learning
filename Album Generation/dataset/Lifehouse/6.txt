[Verse 1]
It's been a while since you last saw me
One breaks down and the other ones fade
These eyes can see the days break
Too late for the other's mistakes
Sit down laugh thinking what have we done
Let me inside
Is it all over before it's begun
Please give me some time

[Chorus]
Cause we are running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun

[Verse 2]
I never meant to let you go
Why did I leave maybe we'll never know
But I'm a man now broken on the ground
I'm in need and I think that it shows

[Bridge]
All this time we're going nowhere and we know it
I was so blind
All the lights are leading to where you're going
I'm not far behind

[Chorus 1]
And now we're running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun

[Chorus 2]
Into the sun
Into the sun
Into the sun

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
