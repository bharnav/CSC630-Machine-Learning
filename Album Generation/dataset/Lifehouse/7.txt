[Verse 1]
I can see it your eyes you're hurting
But pain is part of learning who you are
All these truths can sometimes be deceiving
When your whole world comes crashing to the ground

[Chorus 1]
Tell me everything you need now anything at all
And I will be the one who's waiting anytime you fall

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, When you come undone
When you come undone

[Verse 2]
You know I can't be like everybody
Cause I can't tell you what you want to hear
I don't know if I can make it better
All I know is I will be around

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
When all your plans are made out lying on the floor
And all your dreams are turning into nothing more
When all your hope has left you know you're not alone
Just hold on
Hold on

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
