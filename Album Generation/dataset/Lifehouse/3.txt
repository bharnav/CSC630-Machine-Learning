[Verse 1]
Standing on top of the edge it feels like it's going down
Everything stays in my mind feeling in a daze on the ground
Feels like it's going to give life's too hard to live anymore
I think I've had enough things too tough
I'm out the door

[Chorus 1]
All in all it's just another day now
You're falling down
What you gonna do
Standing on top of the world tonight
No ones looking back at you

[Chorus 2]
Stand tall
It's going on
It's going on
It's gonna be just fine
You're holding on
Holding on today

[Verse 2]
Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on
Salt & tears in the minds in the mouths of a bad decision
Too late for another mistake it's bringing me down
With all your faults it isn't your fault
What's going on

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
So you lost yourself
So you lost your way
Found life through someone else
But you threw it all away

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Times rolling on
Rolling on today
It's going on
Going on today
