I was handed a second chance
From the gods of true romance
If I screwed up I would have to pay
With my soul each and everyday

Time was once on my side
Time was once on my side
Days went by in a whirl of confusion inside

Zeus spoke to Oden about my case
He said this man needs to reject the human race
He seems to thinks that he is above the law
There in lies his fable floor

Time was once on my side
Time was once on my side
Days went by in a whirl of confusion inside

I was told not to open the box but
They left me alone without changing the locks
(What could he do )
I just needed to know
Now I wish I was on a boat going real slow

Time was once on my side
Time was once on my side
Days went by in a whirl of confusion inside

You'll have to pay ferry men one day
And when you do you'll find yourself in summered lands
And you'll be walking in Elysium
