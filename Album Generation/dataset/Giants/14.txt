When I thought I had lost control
Returned to scenes of crime
Asked someone there if they'd seen something pure
It was a friend of mine

Walked around with bad thoughts in my mind
Didn't feel quite whole
Asked a big issue seller on the underground
Have I lost control

I hear voices everywhere
Voices in my head
Have I lost control

In a jam going nowhere fast
On the Euston Road
My life is ticking away in a car
Think I might explode

I hear voices everywhere
Voices in my head
Have I lost control

There's one way traffic and it's going nowhere
I am bruised and battered but I just don't care
People always telling me to go with the flow
People always telling me what I already know
They say what matters are dollars and cents

I hear voices everywhere
Voices in my head
Have I lost control
