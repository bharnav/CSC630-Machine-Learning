I've been beaten around my head
I've been beaten nearly dead
Been beaten till they thought they had me broken
I've been shamed before my peers
I've been old before my years
Even been confused about my orientation

You can try you can try to make cry
You can try you can try to make die
But I've been different because I've been tried
I need nothing from you

Ooh ooh baby slap my thigh
I wear these suspenders if it gets you high
But don't tell my mummer you'll make her cry
Unbroken

I've been skinned by those I love
I've been favored from above
Even had to face my limitations
Seen my self
Before a false someone
I didn't no at all
Now I don't have to meet your expectations

You can try you can try to make cry
You can try you can try to make die
But av been different because av been tried
I need nothing from you

Ooh ooh baby slap my thigh
I wear these suspenders if it gets you high
But don't tell my mummer you'll make her cry
Unbroken

Some think hit me right since the place he left
And we still made it to erol
Every night hes on your tv screen
Getting you to sell him your soul
Getting you to sell him your soul

Ooh ooh baby slap my thigh
I wear these suspenders if it gets you high
But don't tell my mummer you'll make her cry
Unbroken
