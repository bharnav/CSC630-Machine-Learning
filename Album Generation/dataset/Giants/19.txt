I Can Sign For 1 2 3 or 4
Get 3 Weeks off In A Year Or More
Save Up And Get My Very Own SLR
'Cos I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank

Can You Seen The bullet's high velocity
It Can Blow A Man's Arm Off At The Count Of Three
If I Get My Hands On One Of Those
I'm Something To Watch Out For
I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can
Yes I Can

I don't care where They Send Me Now
Send Pictures Postcards To My Ol' Mother And Father
So When I Come Home They'll Have someone to be proud Of
I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
Yes I Can Drive (Drive) My Very Own Tank
