[Verse 1]
Don't you like the way I move when you see me?
Don't you like the things that I say?
Don't you like the way I seem to enjoy it?
When you shout things but I don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Something's happening and it's happening right now
You're too blind to see it
Something's happening and it's happening right now
Ain't got time to wait

[Chorus]
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change

[Verse 2]
Don't you like the way I dance? Does it bug you?
Don't you like the cut of my clothes?
Don't you like the way I seem to enjoy it?
Stick my fingers right up your nose

[Pre-Chorus]
Something's happening and it's happening right now
You're too blind to see it
Something's happening and it's happening right now
Ain't got time to wait

[Chorus]
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
Yeah, take it Hugh

[Guitar breakdown]

[Chorus]
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
Something

[Keyboard progression]

[Chorus]
I said something better change
I said something better chaaaaaange
I said something better chaaaaaange
I said something better chaaaaaange

[Outro]
I said something better change
Change change change (something better change)
Change change change (something better change)
Change change change (something better change)
Chaaaaaaaaange
Change!
