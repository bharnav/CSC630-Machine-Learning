[Pre-Chorus]
We've already said goodbye
Since you got to go, oh you better
Go now, go now, go now, go now
Go, before you see me cry

[Chorus]
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
Because how many times do I have to tell you darling
I'm still in love with you now
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse]
We've already said so-long
I don't want to see you go, oh you better
Go now, go now, go now, go now
Don't you even try
Telling me that you don't want me to end up this way
Because darling, darling, can't you see I want you to stay, stay

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I don't want to see you go but darling, you better go now
