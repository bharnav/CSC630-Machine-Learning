[Intro]
Cat's foot iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
Twenty first century schizoid man

[Verse 1]
Blood rack barbed wire
Polititians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
Twenty first century schizoid man

[Chorus]
Twenty first century
Twenty first century
Twenty first century
Twenty first century schizoid man

[Verse 2]
Death seed blind man's greed
Poets' starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
Twenty first century schizoid man

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Welcome to the twenty first century
