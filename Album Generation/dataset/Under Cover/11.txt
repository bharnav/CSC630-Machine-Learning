[Verse 1]
As soon as your born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all

[Chorus]
A working class hero is something to be

[Verse 2]
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules

[Chorus]
A working class hero is something to be

[Verse 3]
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear

[Chorus]
A working class hero is something to be

[Verse 4]
Keep you doped with religion and your sex and tv
And you think you're so clever and you're classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

[Chorus]
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

[Verse 5]
There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the fool on the hill

[Chorus]
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

[Outro]
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me
