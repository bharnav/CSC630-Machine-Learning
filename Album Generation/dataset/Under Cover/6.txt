[Intro]
Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Sweet guy, don't want to stay alive when you're 25

[Verse 1]
Wendy's stealing clothes from marks and sparks
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
Funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need tv when I've got t. rex

[Chorus]
All the young dudes (hey dudes)
Carry the news (where are you)
Boogaloo dudes (stand up come on)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (and I want to talk to you all of you)
Carry the news

[Verse 2]
Now jimmy looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his beatles and his stones
We never got if off on that revolution stuff
It was such a drag, too many snags
Well I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Going to race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around me, or is it in my head?

[Chorus]

The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need tv when I've got t. rex

[Verse 3]
Carry the news (let's hear the news come on)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kick you)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (hey you there with the glasses)
Carry the news (I want you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want you at the front)
Carry the news (now you all his friends)
All the young dudes (now you bring him down because I want him)
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes (I want him right here bring him come on)
Carry the news (bring him here you go)
All the young dudes (I've wanted to do this for years)
Carry the news (there you go)
Boogaloo dudes (how do you feel)
Carry the news
