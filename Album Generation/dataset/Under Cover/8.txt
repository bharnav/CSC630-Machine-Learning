[Chorus 1]
When I think of all the good times that I've wasted having good times
When I think of all the good times that 's been wasted having good times

[Chorus 2]
When I was drinking
I should have been thinking
When I was fighting
I could have done the right thing
All of that boozing
I was really losing
Good times
Good times

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
All of my lying
I remember her crying
All of the talking
I could have been walking
Instead of complaining
I could have been gaining
Good times
Useless talking
All that walking
All of my sinning
I could have been winning
I have it too easy
And its a beginning of a good time
Good times

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Oh yeah, I am ready for a good time
Cheers!
