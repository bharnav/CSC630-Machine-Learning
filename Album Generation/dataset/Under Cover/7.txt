[Verse 1]
There's something happening here
What it is not exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

[Chorus]
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

[Vese 2]
Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

[Chorus]
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

[Verse 3]
What a field-day for the heat
Ten thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
You better stop!
Stop
You better stop!
Stop
You better stop!
