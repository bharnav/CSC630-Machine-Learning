[Verse]
It's getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

[Chorus 1]
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

[Chorus 2]
I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two

[Chorus 3]
I'll be with you darling now
I'll be with you till my seas are dried up

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
