Where could I go to escape from you?
Break from you?
If I move beyond all eternity
You would be...

(Chorus:)
I fall everytime, into another place
Where I always find, your single saving grace
Whether I have climbed, or fell into the blue
I'm never lost from you
Never lost from you

I could ask the darkness to envelope me
Cover me
But even the night, is like a light to you
Shining through

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Never Lost From You
