Ten thousand miles from home
And still I know that you're right here with me
They say
I must deny the truth, if I want to live
But I won't turn from you

(Chorus:)
Until I live my final day
I'll speak your name
I won't be afraid
Until I draw my final breath
I'll breathe for you
I'll breathe for you!

I know, you have called me here
But I can feel the fear, rising in me
You give me strength
To stand when I'm alone
When I'm far away from all I've ever known
I'm following you

(Chorus)
I'll breathe for you

(Chorus 2x)
I'll!
I'll!
I'll, I will breathe for you!
