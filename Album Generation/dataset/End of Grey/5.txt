Pull the trigger now, end me
Mark me for the kill
Like I marked your hands your feet
I spilled all your blood, flowing deeper
To suffocate the sin, till I'm drowning you again

(Chorus:)
I am so alive, since you took my life
I'm walking dead now, only you remain
I take the life you gave, I walk from the grave
I'm walking dead now, I am not afraid!

Stabbing deeper now, spill me
My body left for dead
Like I pierced your side until it bled
Now the blood flows freely
It fills me till I see, that there's nothing left of me

(Chorus:)
I am so alive, since you took my life
I'm walking dead now, only you remain
I take the life you gave, I walk from the grave
I'm walking dead now...

(Chorus 2x)
