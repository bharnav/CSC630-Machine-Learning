I don't remember the last time I could say
I was where I wanted to be
Still you see through this mask
Hiding all my flaws
You see something down deep in me...

Bring me back so that I can feel you again
Take me to that place I was before
All I want is to hold my head up high
So take this life and set aflame again

Still I linger around
A life unchanged
I just can't break the cycle now
I feel I've lost my hope
Trapped in my own mind
Break these thoughts that are clouding me

Bring me back so that I can feel you again
Take me to that place I was before
All I want is to hold my head up high
So take this life and set aflame again

Again, Again
Set my life aflame again...

Bring me back so that I can feel you again
Take me to that place I was before
All I want is to hold my head up high
So take this life and set aflame again

Bring me back so that I can feel you again
Take me to that place I was before
All I want is to hold my head up high
So take this life and set aflame again
