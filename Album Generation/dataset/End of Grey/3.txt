I take a walk in the bitter cold
I try to see your face
The way it used to be
The sky was never grey
There was a time when I let you in
You turned my night to day
But I turned you away

(Chorus:)
Burn back the sun
Bring back the fire once
Blazing inside this hollow cage
Burn back the sun
You were the only one
To love me with passions quiet rage

I have tasted the apathy
It's bitter on my lips
I am not who I used to be
Betrayal with a kiss
Open arms for the prodigal
You kept the flame alive
You keep this flame alive

(Chorus)
Rage, quiet rage

(Chorus 2x)
Burn Back The Sun...
