Found a hole that fill inside myself
This emptiness by my own hand
So constricted, self inflicted
It's more than I can stand

(Chorus:)
Got to break free from this disease
And I know without a doubt I just want more
Life breathe from holes down deep inside
I need to find

I push to keep these walls from caving in
Trying though I can't fill this space
I have excuses, it never fuses
It's hard for me to face

(Chorus 2x)
Break Free

Got to break free
Got to break free

(Chorus 4x)
