If yesterday was here I
I could turn and face all my fears
When tomorrow calls my name I
I won't be afraid

(Chorus:)
Change my name, I'm asking you
To take my fame, and wash it away
I'm all in my haze, waiting for you
To take my vanity, my vanity

As the joke goes on, oh
I realize that you, you see through me
And though I try to make believe
I cannot hide, my identity

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
