[Verse 1]
Your time is done
I'm moving in
I've come to fight or lose
So go ahead and try me
You know I've just begun
Just begun

[Chorus]
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Like this before)
I take you down and leave here wanting more
(More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore
(Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Feel the pain
I'm raining down on you
You won't deny my will
'Cause what I start I'll follow through
Craving all that I can see
Making something out of me

[Chorus]
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Like this before)
I take you down and leave here wanting more
(More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore
(Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Yeah)

[Break]

[Chorus]
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Like this before)
I take you down and leave here wanting more
(More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore
(Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Yeah)
