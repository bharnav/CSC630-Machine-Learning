No time for the complexities of conversation
No time for smiles, no time for knowing
No time for the intricacies of explanation
No time for sharing, even less for showing

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

[Chorus]
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time

No time for a quick kiss at the railway station
No time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper
Only time for time tables, calls and transportation
No time to think no time to dare

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
