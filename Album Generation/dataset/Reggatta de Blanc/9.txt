[Verse 1]
I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I'm in a cold sweat, I panic, and it makes me late
I knew you never asked for this
I know
My shots will always misfire
My shots will always miss

[Chorus]
Does everyone stare this way at you?
I only look this way at you

[opera sample]

[Verse 2]
I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I get the heebie-jeebies, and my panic makes me late
I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before I chicken out and decide you're not at home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I never noticed the size of my feet
Until I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape I'm in
For the shape I'm in

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm gonna write you a sonnet but I don't know where to start
I'm so used to laughing at the things in my heart
Last of all I'm sorry because you never asked for this
I can see I'm not your type and my shot will always miss

[Chorus x6]
