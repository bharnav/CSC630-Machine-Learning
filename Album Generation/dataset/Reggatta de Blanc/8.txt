[Verse 1]
I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote
I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat

[Chorus]
Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

[Verse 2]
I've got contacts in my book and in my eyes
My good connection on the telephone never lies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've got a list of the people I have known
I'm never alone on the end of a phone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
