[Instrumental opening and main riff]

[Verse 1]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
God bid yesterday
Goodbye

[Chorus]
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

[Verse 2]
The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head there in the dark
Can't see for the brightness
Is staring me blind
God bid yesterday
Goodbye

[Chorus]
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

[Outro]
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
