[Verse 1]
It was all just a dream, oh no
Yet I wish it was real
All my pets they were there and they smiled
Take a shit, it was fine

[Verse 2]
Everybody's so inviting
They've got it in for me, I know
It's not that I don't really love you
It's just that I don't really know

[Verse 3]
The hateful things you think you want to say, yeah
Time will turn them into jokes, yep
Yes, it was all just a dream, oh no
Was it real? I don't know, I hope so

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Here we go, can I play? Can I watch?
He would like one more night in your life
I saw worlds, they don't stop, they're like us
They go fast like a sun that's been shot

[Verse 5]
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
'Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care

[Verse 6]
This whole life, is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up, then I waved, then I fell
I recall, you were all there with me
Overjoyed and at peace

[Verse 7]
First time around, second took so long
Third time's a charm, circle of fourths
Five days to rehearse, six to make it work
Seven notes in a scale, eight in some countries
Nine in fancy keys, ten years we've been friends
Eleven seconds to Hell and of course, twelve major chords
