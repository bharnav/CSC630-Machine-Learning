The Shepherd:
I cat't say I've always been honest; you can't say I've done a disservice
The girl, she's just a child. She's got a lot to learn, and I'm helping out

Your deceit is under your wing. You won't let her go
You know it's not appropriate. Into the fold, into the fold
But all that hair...and porcelain
You swear it's more than mere lust. Into the fold. Into the fold
If she knew what you do, the pristine routine to fool the rube
The gentle gentlemen, the loathed Lothario
You feign you've changed your ways, but we know, yeah, we know
Can't you quell this need for submissives?

The Shepherd:
Oh, such lovely girls. To lead each other tender little lamb into the fold
Into the fold. And you, my pet, "The Sweetest Yet"-I'll hold you closest to my heart
Into the fold...

Into the fold, into the fold, into the fold, into the fold!

The Lamb:
I was in the student union studying for an English quiz;
He came up and asked direction to the new auditorium
We walked up and down the campus, no one had ever heard of it
He was so embarrassed when he realized he had the wrong college
He offered to buy us coffee for the time and effort wasted
We drank and talked for so long, we started making plans for dinner...

The Shepherd: She was young and impressionable; I pretended to need directions
She led me all over the campus. All the while, I'm asking her questions
She agreed to have a cup of coffee-that's when I started to lay it on heavy
Once she learned I studied Dostoevsky, it was in the bag
