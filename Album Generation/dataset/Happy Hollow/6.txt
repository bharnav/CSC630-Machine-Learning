They took the shrine to the temple
But he wasn't there
They checked the mosque and the chapel
No, not there

Since you've been away on holiday
The natives are all nightmares
Since you've been away on holiday
I did dream you'd disappear

You keep us on a leash you can't conceive
But still must adhere to

The natives are whipping each other
Over which god they prefer
I wish you'd do us all a favor
And just differ

Since you've been away on holiday
We don't know which god is which
And since you've been on holiday
It's been harder to give a shit

So if you stayed away on holiday
We could get on with this
I mean we could evolve like this
If you'd just call it quits

Since you've been away on holiday
We've stomached your archaic rule
And Since you've been away on holiday
We've hosted some wars over you

So stay away on holiday - my friend
We don't need your services;
Your excuses --
Your mysterious ways

What a mysterious way to be hanged
What a mysterious way to just go away

Lord let us go!
