Surrender your furniture
Push the television out the window
Overmedicated, this must be the sunks
If you can't understand the blues you don't know much

With much love for science and a youthful defiance
We struck blindly at the roots of this tree
Whose branches got broken, pissed on and trampled

O please forgive us o mighty shady tree
O please forgive us o mighty doomsday tree

It's time to stick your branches
In the merciless wheel of Time
It's time to stick your branches
In the merciless spokes of Time
It's time to stick a fork in the merciless socket of Time
It's time to be sewn into the limitless fabric of Time

They'll call you a wash up
When you can't stay sunk
It's a shame to be so wet so young
Living your life with much love for science
