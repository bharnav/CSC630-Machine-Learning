Your daddy and my daddy had a drink at the bar
Talking about what was best for me
Without a name or a degree
Stubbornly holding onto you
And you pulling away from me

The best that they could say
For my restless teenage ways
Was time in the service
Might serve me well
Even if it's just service in
The latrines

Lucy my love
Don't go sending me off to war
I put up with your family
Full of bigots and fanatics
Just to get a little closer to you
Now you've turned on me too
You have turned on me too

Go hide behind your flag and family
This town has nothing left for me
This town is nothing more
Than a fundamentalist penitentiary

When you're down on your knees
Are you praying for holy war?
When you're down on your knees
Are you praying for holy war?
Lucy my love
Don't go sending me off to war

We must live
We must true
To our childhood dreams
Or they're worthless
And our youth is insincere

So where do we find worth?

I put up with your family
Full of bigots and fanatics
Just to get a little closer to you
Now you've turned on me too
You have turned on me too

When you're down on your knees
Are you praying for holy war?
When you're down on your knees
Are you praying for holy war?
Lucy my love
Don't go sending me off to war

We must live
We must true
To our childhood dreams
Or they are worthless
And our youth is insincere

So where do we find worth?
