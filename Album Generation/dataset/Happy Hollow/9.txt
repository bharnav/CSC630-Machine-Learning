If you've got the looks
And if you've got the goods
I suppose you can make it
Wherever you wanna get made

And you wanna get made...

My model agent says
You've got to get paid
You've got a special gift
You can't just give it away

For free... Don't give it up for free

And when my daddy calls
Asking how it's going
On them streets
All I can say is

I'm not exactly a salesman
Sure there's a product I'm selling
Guess you can say I'm an actor
Though acting's not what they're after

Sure this service
Is a popular year
More popular than my acting
Or my modeling career

This city
Has quite the service industry

Small town Adonis
Hits the Metropolis
Is brought down to his knees

Guess I'm a so-so gigolo
Guess I'm a so-so gigolo

Every audition
My agent commissions
Isn't so much an audition
So much a job

I guess a job's a job

I thought that if they saw
How much I wanted the part
The very leads that'd
Have to take pity on me

What if the citys never hurt

So-so gigolo (x6)

I'm not exactly a salesman
Sure there's a product I'm selling
Guess you can say I'm an actor
Though acting's not what they're after
