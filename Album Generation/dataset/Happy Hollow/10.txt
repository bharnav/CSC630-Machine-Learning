Moms and dads break up their bands
Take away their roller skates
Give them algebra and trig
Raisins, dates, or figs
But take away the gingerbread and cake

Every husband, every wife, every cop, every teacher
Everybody do the taking away
Every law, every curfew, ever Bible-branded textbook
Watch the kiddies do the breaking away

Moms and dads say
"No more bands
No side projects, no solo careers
No young love
No kissing fish
No pets at all
No fun
And
I think we've had enough art, Mr. Marx."

Every molecule, every atom, every single particle
Down to the quark

Do the breaking apart!

No skateboard no swimming pools
Until you've finished your state approved chemistry
Kid!
Break it down to the electron and quark
And please tell us what happens when the particles spark

Every molecule, every atom, every single particle
Down to the quark

Do the breaking apart!
