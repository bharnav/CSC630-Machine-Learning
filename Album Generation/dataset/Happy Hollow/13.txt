Second hymn, the prodigal damsel
Third hymn, the tree stump of knowledge

Fourth hymn, the passion of the Chaplain
Fifth hymn, the brute kiss of Judas
Sixth hymn, Sodom falls to ashes
Seventh hymn, the church of doubting Thomas
Eighth hymn, the Horses of the Apocalypse

Tenth hymn, the demons of Mary Magdalene

Twelfth hymn, a leacherous Shepard
Thirteenth hymn, hiding in confession
Fourteenth hymn, an afterword

Rocking chairs of disenchantment
Green grass of envy and malice
Our salad days, living in Happy Hollow
