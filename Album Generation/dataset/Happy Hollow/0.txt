Welcome one and welcome all to our small town
The lyrics are the voice
Of the neurosis of a city
Inside each house you'll
Find the guilt that
The fables and folly
Of the residents residing in...

Fourteen hymns for the heathen
First hymn: the son of ...
[fades into inaudibility]

Baby, baby, baby
This world must seem
So immense compared to the womb
And baby baby
Your head must seem
So much smaller than you assumed
Your whole world
Seems to center around you
Be easy to make the mistake
That maybe you're why the world was made

Baby, baby, baby
You learn so fast
You seem to carry a special gift
Maybe you've been given
To this world to make a difference

Such delusions we all struggle with
But the beautiful truth of it is
This is all we are
We simply exist
You're not the chosen one
I'm not the chosen one
But we don't need anyone
Let's not choose anyone
