[Verse 1]
Forget your problems
Lay it down, they start up
The innocence of what you are is what I want
I've ran my colors dripped down and drained out
Tried a million things, but my hearts been shot

[Verse 2]
I hope you try and find me, I'm all spun and pacing
And I know what you want to say here, so say it
Forget the words I'm speaking
Just want to rearrange, so I'll just say it

[Chorus]
I really miss you I miss you I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again
I really miss you I miss you I said

[Verse 3]
Heat stroke, death's like
The wrong things that I think are right
I never knew that I could go as far as this
I took a problem recently forgotten
I know who I had been before I slipped
Oh, I want to change it
I will live a life that makes you smile when I'm done here and long gone
Feverish and peaking, just want to see your face
What you say, what you say?

[Outro]
I really miss you miss you I said
Smile at the chance to just see you again
I really miss you I miss you I said
Just look at me now before I walk away
You might just miss me, miss me one day
