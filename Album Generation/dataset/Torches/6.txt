[Verse 1]
Rise above, gonna start the war!
Oh, what you want? What you need? What'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Eh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear
Eh, oh, eh

[Verse 2]
When I feel kinda bad and I don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well you got what you want and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah, eh, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear

[Chorus]
(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah I'm scared but I disappear
Running around before it corners you
Like he's someone who's lost his way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause itâ€™s simple to see of my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Yeah, it's the right feeling
Yeah, I don't wanna runaway

[Bridge]
You gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
