[Verse 1]
Sometimes life it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
Yeah I'd make it out just to fall on my head

[Verse 2]
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show them what I choose, got nothin' to lose

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

[Verse 3]
You know those days when you wanted to just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game but you kind of cut
Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck

[Verse 4]
I tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don’t fall that way
Yeah yeah and I’m alright
I took a sip of something poisoned, took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned
