In the bigger picture, I have been painted out
Cracks in the earth blacken the sea
No canvas is reserved for me
Look up close and try to see
In every stroke lies past alone

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

Time flys, flys, flys
As you lay your bones to rest
Flys, flys as your past decays inside your chest

You aren't a child fighting in a war
Son please don't tell me that this is bored
Tear your things out from the earth
Long departed we're so short sighted

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

My tongue has sung around the world
But its heard in all the power of words
It can not be, It can not count
So now its a sadistic power in me
My tongue has sung around the world
But it's heard in all the power of words
So hell turned and birthed all means
We're all the earth's disease

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat
