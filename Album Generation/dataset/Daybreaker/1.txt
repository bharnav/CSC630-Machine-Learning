[Verse 1]
The Son of God
Hangman's pawn control our lives
With fairytales and shallow lies

[Pre-Chorus]
You say we'll burn in hell
Spiteful preacher, I know you well

[Chorus]
Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around, you're not alone
One life and one chance, the world in front of me

[Verse 2]
Intelligent design
Sending shivers down my spine
Cells mutate and divide
What a sadistic intention
No light, no dark, no ups, no downs
I'll find peace, buried in the ground
The lights go out, the fuse has blown
No heaven or hell to bring me home

[Pre-Chorus]
You say we'll burn in hell
Spiteful preacher, I know you well

[Chorus]
Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around, you're not alone
One life and one chance, the world in front of me

[Interlude]
Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill that hole inside your heart
Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill that hole inside your heart

[Bridge]
Son of God, son in the sky
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say
"There's more to me than meets the eye
There's more to me, there's more to me"
Son of God, son in the sky
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say
"There's more to me than meets the eye
There's more to me, there's more to me"

[Outro]
Let me say my decency comes from inside
Just human heart, a decent mind
We all slip up from time to time
Let me say my decency comes from inside
Just human heart, a decent mind
We all slip up from time to time
