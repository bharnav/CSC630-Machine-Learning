[Intro]
These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe

[Verse 1]
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price
Lifetime slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a God, was a God
You would be the death of him

[Chorus]
These colours don't run
Like colours from the face
Eyes roll back, chemical despair
It's true what they say, life isn't fair

[Interlude]
So repeat this line: "Everything, everything is fine"
So repeat this line: "Everything, everything is fine"

[Chorus]
These colours don't run
Like colours from the face
Eyes roll back, chemical despair
It's true what they say, life isn't fair

[Pos-Chorus]
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free

[Bridge]
I'm struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line "ignorance is bliss"
So I guess I'll just say it how it is
You had it all, you fucking pigs

[Outro]
These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe
