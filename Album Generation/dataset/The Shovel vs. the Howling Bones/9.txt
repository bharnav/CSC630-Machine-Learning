I’ve been around since the days of old I’ll stick around for years untold I’ve faced the fires, and I’ve seen the rain I’ve felt some pleasure, and all the pain Seen my brother’s blood fall into the sand Shed by his neighbor’s hand We are the people of the land And we ain’t, and we ain’t gonna die away Silk and thread make a noble man But it don’t put the scars across his hand A long gray beard and a wise old face Won’t be seen in your fancy place Though my brothers are falling all around You ain’t gonna keep us down We are the people of the land And we ain’t, and we ain’t gonna die away We’re tilling up the land and we’re staying strong We’re gonna be around when your money’s gone There’ll be a time when you can hear them say “Here come the people of the land, We’ll be fortunate to be one of them one day” We are the people of the land
