Georgia Lee she’s like a springtime storm She’s gonna teach me to be withered, weathered and worn Dresses all tattered and torn She’s gonna wallow in the mud Born on the front porch of an old wood shack She keeps everything she owns in a torn up burlap sack Gives no account for where she’s at When she gonna wallow in the mud

Chorus: Hey Hey Hey, Georgia Lee We’re gonna wallow in the mud She’s got an old guitar she claims was blessed by Muddy’s hand She can’t play for much, but she can sure play that “Hoochie Coochie Man” She’s glad to show you anytime she can That she can wallow in the mud She’s a wild child of the age of 32 You ask her what she’s looking at She says “Oh, boy I’m looking straight at you Now whatcha’ gonna do” We’re gonna wallow in the mud
Chorus repeat
