I got a nickel that I keep here in my pocket I got these snakeskin boots here wrapped around my feet I got a picture that I keep here in a locket Of a woman who’s much too good for me

Chorus: I said drifters they don’t step in mud puddles For fear they’ll fill it up with their own blood I said drifters they don’t step in mud puddles For fear they’ll fill it up with their own blood I got a pocket knife my daddy gave me when I was 20 I found this dusty old hat here at 25 The years of my living add up to plenty But I doubt I’ll ever make it to 29
Chorus repeat
In these familiar streets I used to tread I see only shadows and demons instead Constant reminders Of the sins that I’ve made Blood that I’ve lost And the price I’ve paid
Chorus repeat
