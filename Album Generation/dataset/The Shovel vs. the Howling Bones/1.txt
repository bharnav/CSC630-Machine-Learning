I walk through the valley I see no stars tonight They’ve all died away Because the blood they’re spilling floods like a crimson tide

Chorus: Red skies turn black as night It means you’ll see that next sun come But if they’re fiery red in the morning light It means you’ll see that last red dawn I see all the misery Of what is dead and gone And the sails, they cry in vain Because the ship they’re sailing is made up of skin and bones
Chorus repeat
I feel a storm coming It whispers in the night And the sea it just trembled When it sees that last red light
