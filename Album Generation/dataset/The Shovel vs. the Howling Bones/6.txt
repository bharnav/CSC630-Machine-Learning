I met a dove once white as snow I turned her a shade of gray A dove she wants to spread her wings But a crow clips her dove wings away

Chorus: How does a crow fly like an eagle How does a crow fly like an eagle How does a crow learn to fly so high Where he can rise up to heaven again I went down to the depths of despair I wanted loose dirt on my grave I felt around in the dark for a while Among the wicked and depraved
Chorus repeat
How does a heart turn black as coal How does a heart turn black as coal How does a heart turn black as coal How does a crow save his own wretched soul
Chorus repeat
