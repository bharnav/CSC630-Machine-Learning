One path leads to destruction I got two idle hands that’ll get me there Three stand before me to enlighten I’d reach for the shores if I dared

Chorus: Let the wind act as a savior Let it guide like a savoir should May the river have mercy have mercy on the drifting wood I may be hanging from a tree come next morning Gone to from whence I came My world is burning down to ashes By match or by chance it’s all the same
Chorus repeat
These waters are deep and they are unheeding I could swim upstream or just go along for the ride The latter of which has this clear warning That’s to doom myself to a passive suicide
Chorus repeat
