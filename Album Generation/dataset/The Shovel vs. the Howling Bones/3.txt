Clementine, don’t you cry for me When the smell of the roses fades eventually Just go for now and leave me to my sleep I’m free from this world, from this painful heartbeat

Chorus: Hey, Clementine Don’t you cry for me Clementine, may your path be blessed Never again to wear your black veil and dress Let each step take you far from pain Don’t let this world leave its dirty old black stain
Chorus repeat
Clementine, now it’s time to part There’s no breath in me, but still an ache in my heart Just give me one last smile and dry your eyes We had our time, and now it’s time to say goodbye
Chorus repeat
