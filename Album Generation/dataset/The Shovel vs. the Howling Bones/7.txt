I’ve been picking all the wallpaper off the walls I’ve been calling all the numbers on the bathrooms stalls I’m walking down a gravel road kicking a can I’ve been trying to figure out just who I am

Chorus: I’m searching for some peace of mind To steady my steep decline If you’re gonna live, then you’re bound to learn I’ve got love letters to burn I’ve been washing myself in muddy water I don’t want to be clean, but I think I oughta’ I’ve been putting my sins right up on a shelf To forget your past is to lose your self
Chorus repeat
Asked a part-time thief, “What should I do” He said, “Use that pain to sing them blues” He said, “One more thing that’ll help my brother Before you can open that door, you’d better close the other”
Chorus repeat
