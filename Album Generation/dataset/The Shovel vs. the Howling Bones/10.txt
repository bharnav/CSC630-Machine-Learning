Another road, another city The wheels keep rolling, on down the line The price I pay, for this lonely life Is getting higher, as time goes by The only friend I know, is on the CB We talk about the weather, because it kills the time But, he’ll soon fade away on that open road And leave me thinking about you and I

Chorus: I ride on through these dirty old towns And every road sign says, that you ain’t around Another hard life long forgotten On this lonely, dark highway Through Amarillo, on my way to Colorado It makes me remember how much I like that song I’ll be there long before morning Thinking about you long after I’m gone
Chorus repeat
Another road, another city The wheels keep rolling on down the line Singing along to “You Were Always On My Mind” With my best Willie, it’s getting better each day Alt

Chorus: You were always on my mind And every road sign says, how far I left you behind Another hard life long forgotten On this lonely, dark highway
