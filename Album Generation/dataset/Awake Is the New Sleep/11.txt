Woke up this morning
I suddenly realized
We're all in this together
I started smiling
'cos you were smiling
And we're all in this together
I'm made of atoms
You're made of atoms
And we're all in this together
And long division
Just doesn't matter
'cos we're all in this together

I saw you walking
In the city
We're all in this together
The city's changing
'cos we are changing
And we're all in this together
Every twelve seconds
Someone remembers
That we're all in this together
In the kitchen
Of your rent-control apartment
We're all in this together

C'mon baby
I don't mean to rush you
I only wanted to reach out and touch you
I've gotta start to open my heart

I know you think
About jumping ship before it sinks
But we're all in this together
Ask a scientist
Its quantum physics
We're all in this together
And on the subway
We feel like strangers
But we're all in this together
Yeah i love you and you love her
And she loves him
But we're all in this together

Y'know baby
There's never been protection
In all the history of human connection
C'mon darling
It's alright to show me
You don't ever need to be lonely
Once you start to open your heart

I saw you crying
I started crying
Cos we're all in this together

And then religion
Its a big decision
But we're all in this together

We're all in this together
