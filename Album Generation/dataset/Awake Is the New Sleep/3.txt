[Verse 1]
My head is a box filled with nothing
And that's the way I like it
My garden's a secret compartment
And that's the way I like it, and that's the way I like it
Your body's a dream that turns violent
And that's the way I like it, and that's the way I like it
The winter is long in the city
And that's the way I like it

[Chorus]
So please, baby, please
Open your heart and catch my disease

[Verse 2]
I was backstage in Pomona
And that's the way I like it
She drank beer with Coca-Cola
And that's the way I like it, and that's the way I like it
She told me about the winds from Santa Ana
And that's the way I like it, and that's the way I like it
She told me she loved me like fireworks
And that's the way I like it

[Chorus]
So please, baby, please
Open your eyes and catch my disease
So please, baby, please
Come on and catch my disease
Catch it

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na

[Verse 3]
They play Good Charlotte on the radio
And that's the way I like it
They play Sleepy Jackson on the radio
And that's the way I like it, yeah, that's the way I like it
I hear BeyoncÃ© on the radio
And that's the way I like it, 'cause that's the way I like it
They don't play me on the radio
But that's the way I like it

[Chorus]
So please, baby, please
Open your heart, catch my disease
So please, baby, please
Come on and catch my disease

[Outro]
Catch my disease
(Na na na na na na na)
Catch my disease
(Na na na na na na na)
Catch my disease
(Na na na na na na na)
Catch my disease
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na)
Whoo
(Na na na na na na na)
Na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
