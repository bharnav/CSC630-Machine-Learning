In the rain
I'm walking slowly
There's a light
In your apartment
And I don't know why
I ache for you

And it's alright if you're undecided or
If you're scared that you might like it or
If it's true, I ache for you

There's no rhyme and there's no reason
You're the secret in the back of my skull
There's no logic, so please believe me
Our love's confusing, but it never gets dull

It's getting late
Anticipation
And if we talk
Communication
And then you'll know
I ache for you

And yes sometimes it's just desire
Another problem there you really don't want
But anyway, I ache for you

There's no rhyme and there's no reason
I know the secret in the back of my skull
There's no logic, so please believe me
Our love's confusing, but it never, it never gets dull

I ache for you

I ache for you

And I'm tired, of so much wanting
And what if, don't even think it
But why not

There's no rhyme and there's no reason
Put a secret in the back of my skull (back of my skull)
There's no logic, so please believe me
Our love's confusing, but it never gets dull (it never gets dull)

There's no rhyme and there's no reason
You're the secret in the back of my skull (back of my skull)
There's no logic, so please believe me
Our love's confusing, but it never gets dull (never gets dull)
But it never gets dull (never gets dull)
Never gets dull
I ache for you

I ache for you

I ache for you
I ache for you
I ache for you
