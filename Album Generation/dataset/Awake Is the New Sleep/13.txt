I took a breath of fresh air
I took in the view at the top
I took a lock of her golden hair
I took a look, it was gone

If living
Is giving
I'm ready
I'm willing

I took her heart, cause she let me
I took a walk in the dark
I took some time to decide
If it was right
I took a walk in the dark

If living
Is giving
I'm ready
I'm willing

I took a piece of the puzzle
I took a soign√©e
I took both roads, everywhere they went
Now something's gotta give

If living
Is giving
I'm ready
I'm willing
