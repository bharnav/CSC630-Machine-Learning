You were the one that brings the weather
You were a dream I've had forever
You know exactly what I'm wishing
You're gonna love me in to submission

Feelings I had
While at your feet
Those kinds of things I can't repeat
You're gonna fill the world with light

You put the point in exclamation
You took a day to build a nation
You're gonna teach me how to live
You're gonna teach me how to give

Feeling i had
Well who could say
I could explain them anyway
You're gonna fill my world with light
You're gonna fill my world with light
