I want to know what he knows
I want to feel what he felt
I want to go where he's been

I want to know what he knows
I want to hear your secrets
I want you and I want him

'Cause you smell like apple candy
And we're singing hallelujah
And the edge in your affection broke my skin

But I want to know what he knows
I want to touch what he touched
Call me by his name

'Cause I know you made a promise
You told him he's your lover
Make me feel the same

'Cause you smell like apple candy
And we're singing hallelujah
And I'm feeling so much younger than my years

Well I want to know what he knows
I want to go where he's been
I want you and I want him

So you said, "Go find some trouble."
And you would do the same
And we opened up our hearts and we could change

And you smell like apple candy
And we're singing hallelujah
And you smell like apple candy
And we're singing hallelujah

I want to know what he knows
I want to feel what he felt
I want to touch what he touched
I want to go where he's been
I want you and I want him
