Ok, baby
What'll it be?
I asked my friends, and they all agreed
You're exactly the kind of trouble that i need
I got songs to give
I got songs to prove
Songs i use when i wanna' seduce, and i wanna' seduce you
Why won't you let me?

I wanna' get you
So get gotten
I won't stop til' i get to the bottom
I wanna' get you
So get gotten

I got big, big dreams
In a small, small world
And i'm using god to pick up girls
And i'm willing to put it all on the line

I got words that destroy
Words that build
I use words and feel no guilt about it
I got words that go bump in the night

It's no secret that i've fallen
I won't stop til' i get to the bottom
It's no secret that i've fallen

'cause first you're ripe
And then you're rotten
Don't stop 'til you get to the bottom
First you're ripe
And then rotten

Once I knew
But i've forgotten
I find out when i get to the bottom
Once I knew
But i've forgotten

I wanna' get you
So get gotten
I won't stop 'til I get to the bottom
I wanna' get you
So get gotten
