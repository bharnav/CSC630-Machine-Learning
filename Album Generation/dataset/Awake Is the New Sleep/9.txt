I slipped into a house, to escape my enemies
And opened the door to another world
Of lovers and whores, but i loved you more
Than any of them, ever before

Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
I'm far away

The universe is brought back, from the brink of destruction
Everytime you smile, but I can see things clearer, it's all smoke and mirrors
You broke my fucking heart but i still want you

Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
I'm far away
Look how close ive come I'm far away

One can only guess what would happen if I got all my questions answered
Then we'd know for sure who's got the quickest draw
Who's laying dead and who's above the law

Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
Look how close I've come how close I've come
I'm far away
Look how close ive come I'm far away
