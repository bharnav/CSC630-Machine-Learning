I've been thinking 'bout the straight and narrow
Slip sliding round the back of my hand
Keep turning and its almost tomorrow
Ill find a way to make you understand
There are no right angles in my life
No right angles in my life

Right now im hearing nothing but silence
High beams are on - i can feel you
Every piece contains a little bit of violence
And you've changed so much but its still you
No right angles in my life
No right angles in my life

So breathe
Feel the open space
Leave it all behind
Coming into grace
No right angles in my life
There are no right angles in my life

Suspicious minds and youre back on the warpath
All the things you think are up my sleeve
Though you tell me that im just like a circle
Somehow you still dont believe
There are no right angles in my life
There are no right angles in my life

So dream
Let your body play
Anyone in need
Give it all away
No right angles in my life
There are no right angles in my life

Ive been thinking 'bout the straight and narrow
Slip sliding round the back of my hand
Keep turning and its almost tomorrow
Find a way to make you understand

Please
Taste the sea you sail
Baby i believe
Theres no way you can fail
No right angles in my life
There are no right angles in my life
There are no right angles in my life
