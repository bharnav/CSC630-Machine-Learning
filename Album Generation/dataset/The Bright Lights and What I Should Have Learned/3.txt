So we argue about the stupid things
Decide to take a week off from the binge
But just become more sick
And more deranged
It gets round can't take anymore
And did anything really change?
Do we have to be so tired
Can you think of something else to say?
Something inspired
Oh well, that's just the way things go round here

Now we all love a good secret but
Do you want to know the real reasons why?
We can't look each other in the eye, oh no
We will cry in the same films but
We cry for different reasons
The ending was good
That is understood
The ending is near
Now what do you hear

The slow build
The sound the machines make
The sound of a heart break
The sound of one person alone at the end of the night
The slow build
The sound that the trains make
Lonely people are too late
The hum of the television talking to no-one
The Bright Lights And What I Should Have Learned
So we slept right through the night again
Thinking about what we said to our friends
It's nothing really, don't you fuss
Ain't nothing wrong with the two of us
And the problems came from here
And there and everywhere
And the government says that we should care
Much more about each other
We have a contract with our brothers

Now we all love a good secret but
Do you want to know the real reasons why?
We can't look each other in the eye, oh no
We will cry in the same films but
We cry for different reasons
The ending was good
That is understood
The ending is near
Now what do you hear

The slow build
The sound the machines make
The sound of a heart break
The sound of one person alone at the end of the night
The slow build
The sound that the trains make
Lonely people I'm too late
The hum of the television talking to no-one

The slow build
The sound the machines make
The sound of a heart break
The sound of one person alone at the end of the night
The slow build
The sound that the trains make
Lonley people are too late
The hum of the television talking to no-one
Talking to no-one
Talking to no-one
Talking to no-one
