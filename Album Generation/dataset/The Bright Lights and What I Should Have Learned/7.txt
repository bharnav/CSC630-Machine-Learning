Pressure on me, I don’t feel it
Pressure On You, I don’t feel it
Pressure on me, I don’t feel it
Pressure On You, I don’t feel it
Pressure on me

There’s a crack in every window
There’s a fault in every brain
I want to change everything but I want to stay the same
My doctor used to love me oh, at least, I believe, that today

Pressure On You
Pressure on me
Pressure On You
Pressure on me, I don’t feel it
Pressure On You, I don’t feel it
Pressure on me, I don’t feel it
