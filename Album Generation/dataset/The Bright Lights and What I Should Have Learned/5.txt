Does your public image of you very confused
You feel a thinker in a thoughtless world
Do you often find yourself with nothing to do
Well call this number whether boy or girl
I like you
I want you
You are so good to talk to
We don't know what to believe
Well I guess that everyone gets loved sometimes
And I could use some relief

Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal oh you Animal!

Ah……..

Do you fear the actions of reactionary youth
I am a thinker in a thoughtless world
Suddenly you realise there's nothing left to do
So call this number whether boy or girl
I'm a boy, I'm a girl

Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal, you Animal, yes yes
Me Animal oh you Animal!

Ah……..(x2)
