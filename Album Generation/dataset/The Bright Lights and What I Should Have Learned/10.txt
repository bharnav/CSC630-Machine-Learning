Are we nearly there?
She shifts in the backseat
Are we nearly where?

I don't know which house
Or street I'm looking for
Don't let me fall asleep again
She says, "Please, don't let me
Fall asleep again"

No, she'll be just fine
She just needs some clean air
Whiskey, beer or wine
It depends what kind of night
You're looking for
Don't stop at any lights my friend
Please, let's just get this over with

Lining the floors
We cast a look towards the whores
The newspapers and the TVs glowing light
Some invitation to a new civilization

Where the actors don't drink
Politicians always wink
And my eyes for you
Will last until tomorrow

What I'll neglect to say is that
I'll think of you someday
Is that enough?
Let that taxi go
Let that taxi go

We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why

We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
We're so dead, we don't know why
