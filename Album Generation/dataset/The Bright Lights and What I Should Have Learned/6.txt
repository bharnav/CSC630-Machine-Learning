Papa Pablo show us What We Did Wrong
Now we stand too scared to breath
We were unknown once, talking like idiots
Was it some kind of accident, or did you believe in us

Sitting silently to block out the noise
Some revolution we prepared
Oh so degrading, says Jimmy DaLancia
But maybe we'll start a new life, if we get up and dance with her

We believed in you
From a lack of anything else to do
Must be so naļve
To think that everything would work out, everything would work out
So bye-bye wave, its goodbye yes the morning after comes

Papa we loved, but was we so naļve
That we was living a lie, naa na na naa (x2)

Come the morning Denton pulls his hat on
And pins his colours to the breeze
We stayed up all night, though the dance stopped hours ago
We love you baby, says that song on the radio

We believed in you
From a lack of anything else to do
Must be so naļve
To think that everything would work out, everything would work out
So bye-bye wave, its goodbye yes the morning after comes

Papa we loved, but was we so naļve
That we was living a lie, naa na na naa (x2)

So bye-bye wave, its goodbye yes the morning after comes

Papa we loved, but was we so naļve
That we was living a lie, naa na na naa (x2)

Papa we loved (x2)
