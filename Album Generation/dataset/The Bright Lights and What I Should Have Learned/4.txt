Last night
You were given a warning
Simple and clear
You chose to ignore it
We've been here before
We've been here before

Before every day
A morning
Before every mistake
A warning
We've been here before
Boot to face, face to floor

Oh, now the monsters are loose again
Oh, the monsters are loose, my friend
We smell blood, we are simple men
And we are falling from great heights
Did you ever feel that way?
Did you ever feel that way?

You shut your mouth
I've heard all your stories
So this is how you break down
No drama, no glory
Is this all that remains?
Just the smoke, not the flames

Oh, now the monsters are loose again
Oh, the monsters are loose, my friend
We smell blood, we are simple men
And we are falling from great heights
Did you ever feel that way?
Did you ever feel that way?

Oh, now the monsters are loose again
Oh, the monsters are loose, my friend
Now we smell blood, we are simple men
And we are falling from great heights
Did you ever feel that way?
Did you ever feel that way?
