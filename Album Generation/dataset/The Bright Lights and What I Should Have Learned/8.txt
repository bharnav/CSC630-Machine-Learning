One, two,duels,four...

The young man stares at his shoes, he's in a state
Headache and heartache the thousand times he's been too late
Out in the light, we saw you wheeling around
Whilst the city makes sounds, only for me
No breaking of sweat, this pointless prize
Every solution, is rendered dead before the eyes
We give good fight, with our knees to the ground
To each other we're bound, so perfectly

We are the young believers, show us the next in line
Hey who says, they don't care, our next excuse has been prepared
La la la la la la la (x2)

Take your modern heroes and show us why
Bravado and gaul set the rules that we're living by
Hold out your hands, and show some restraint
What are these pictures we paint, so vacantly

We are the young believers, show us the next in line
Hey who says, they don't care, our next excuse has been prepared
La la la la la la la (x2)
We are the young believers, la la la la la la la
We are the young believers, la la la la la la la
(Just Jim singing)We are the young believers, la la la la la la la
We are the young believers, la la la la la la laaaa
