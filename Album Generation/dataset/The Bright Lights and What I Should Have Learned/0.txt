As I lie perfectly still
She sighs, another evening is killed
All this I see brothers, now at night
The horrors return bright lights
And what I should've learned by now
I should see, sisters

We have not lied, we have not loved
All my brothers all my sisters
All my brothers, all my brothers
All my sisters, all my brothers

The heart it quickens its stride
I try to believe she has lied
All this will be brothers, now she cries
The horrors are true, quite right
They're growing inside of you
All this is real, sisters

We have not lied
We have not loved
All my brothers, all my sisters
All my brothers, all my brothers
All my sisters, all my brothers

The sound wakes you up
In the middle of the night
She still sleeps, hoping
That tomorrow will be different
Please, I did not mean it this way

The ghosts are there
In the corner of the room
They just vibrate until you
Cannot take it anymore
I never knew you felt so alone

The sound wakes you up
In the middle of the night
She still sleeps, hoping that
Tomorrow will be different

All this I see
