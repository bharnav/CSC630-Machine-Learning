[Verse 1]
Don't you want people to love you?
My spanking, that's the only thing i want so much[X3]
That's the only thing i want so much
Why is that better than being hugged?
Why is that better than being hugged?
Because you get closer to the person
Closer to the person
Why is that better than being hugged?
Because you get closer to the person
Closer to the person
Just like a person having sex feels cared for
We wanna be loved, so we have sex together
And they feel loved about that
And this is the way it makes me feel...loved
I want it, i dream about it, i think about it, i want it
Just like a girl wants sex with a boy, you know?
It's the way i'll always be probably
My last one was born in the system
See, they're stupid, very stupid, those people over there
They're stupid
These people are so below mentality, honest to god, really
You know what i mean, he got the nerve to bug me
You know what i mean, he got the nerve to bug me
This mentality, honest to god, really
You know what i mean, he got the nerve to bug me
Honest to god, really
You know what i mean, he got the nerve to bug me
Bug me...bug me...he got the nerve to bug me
Everything seems so eight ball
Everything seems so eight ball
And i, i don't know if that's my imagination, but, umm
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
And i don't know if that's my imagination, but, umm
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
Think they got me
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me...hmm
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
...know if that's my imagination, but, umm
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
She prides herself on her cleaning habits
She prides herself on her cleaning habits
Hey foxymophandlemama, that's me
She prides herself on her cleaning habits
She prides herself on her cleaning habits
It's a lovely stupid mop, it is
There's something really screwey about no streaking
Is it any old dumb mop? it streaks
Come on mop, no streaking mop
I don't mind mop the floor, my mop streaks, i don't like it
It's not me, it's the mop
Come, i bought some new mops
Go away you stupid, dumb old sponge mop
I don't believe it...now the floor looks beautiful
I don't believe it...now the floor looks beautiful
I don't believe it...old sponge mop
Dumb old sponge mop
Dumb old sponge mop
Old sponge mop
Dumb old sponge mop
You're right, this mop's stupid
Dumb old sponge mop
I don't believe it...now the floor looks beautiful
That's why they call me mophandlemama
Now the floor looks beautiful
That's why they call me mophandlemama
That's why they call me mophandlemama
That's why they call me mophandlemama
In two weeks, before she could see herself not dressed
The twenty-third of may...you know she disturbed no one today
The manager told her to completely forget
If you ever go to bed, i'll kill you
Do i tell the whole world that i'm mentally ill?
Go to the papers...yeah, why not?
Drum roll
I want to show them that i can walk on my own without hands of theirs

[Chorus 1]
And, i can still fantasize, but i keep it to myself
Keep it to myself...keep it to myself
I think i deserve to be loved, don't you?
Very much so
Think i deserve to be loved
Keep it to myself...keep it to myself
I think i deserve to be loved, don't you?
...to be loved, don't you?
But i keep it to myself
Keep it to myself...keep it to myself
I think i deserve to be loved, don't you?
And, i can still fantasize, but i keep it to myself
Keep it to myself...keep it to myself
I think i deserve to be loved, don't you?
Very much so

[Chorus 2]
Do you ever think that you would actually, really kill yourself?
Well, if i have thought about it real, uhh, real deep
Yes, i believe i would
I have thought about it real, uhh, real deep
Yes, i believe i would

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
