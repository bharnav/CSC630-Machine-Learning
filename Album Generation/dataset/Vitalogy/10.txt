[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1-Pearl Jam]
Waitin', watchin' the clock
It's four o'clock
It's got to stop
Tell him
Take no more
She practices her speech as he opens the door
She rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

[Hook-Pearl Jam]
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man

[Verse 2-Pearl Jam]
Talking to herself
"There's no one else who needs to know"
She tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew him, now she swears he's gone

[Hook-Pearl Jam]
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man

[Verse 3-Pearl Jam]
She loved him, yeah
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah
That's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better....man
