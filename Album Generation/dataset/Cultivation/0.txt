Bloody bunnies in the road really rips my heart to pieces
Bloody bunnies in the road really rips my heart to pieces
Almost hit one yesterday now the fear in me increases
Almost hit one yesterday now the fear in me increases

You're looking for a tan like an Indian man with your white ass in the street eating deer meat
Thinking you're old soul with your new pedigree
Smoke some peyote now you've got a goatee
Way to go...
Way to go...

Bloody bunnies in the road really rips my heart to pieces
Bloody bunnies in the road really rips my heart to pieces
Almost hit one yesterday now the fear in me increases
Bloody bunnies in the road really rips my heart to pieces

You never looked so good in your whole life want to show the world
Prove it to your ex-wife, take it in stride you're a humble man
With a master plan eat organic drive a hummer in the summertime way to go...
You try to pretend that you're still one of them, got yourself some high end buck-skin coverings with a new manicure, facial and pedicure, you'll be sure to get more than the poor out of life, way to go...
Way to go...
