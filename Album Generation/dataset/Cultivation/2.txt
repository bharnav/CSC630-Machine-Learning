[Chorus:]
Just past the new beginning
When everything was lost
I heard an angel singing
To those who paid the cost

She sang the last tomorrow
Was surely meant to be
Just past the new beginning
When everyone was free

The notes were drenched in sorrow
Her melody was soft
Her words spoke of a sinking ship
Which no one could get off

Her sadness wrapped around me
Her face began to blur
I turned to face the future
And the last thing that I heard

[Chorus]
To save the last tomorrow
To right where we've gone wrong
With hope we stand before you
To sing the angel song
