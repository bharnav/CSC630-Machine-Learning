Where are we? Is this real?
Jesus & I [x9]
Jesus and I were walking through the house of the broken glass disaster
Waiting to pick the pieces up, hoping to see a grander picture
Jesus had answers to our questions, but no one would just stop and hear
But from now on I'll always listen, watch for the signs they're everywhere
Jesus will always win the battle, Jesus will always win the fight
Officer ask me to unravel, there is no need for alibis
But was the caller of the madness, (harking?) the demontality
Now you must sit and watch your sadness, (??? ??) self apologies
Is this real? Where are we? Where are.. Where are we?
Jesus and I [x4]
Once in a while the eyes of evil peer through the windows in at me
I simply say, "Have you met Jesus?"
Then watch them run so fearfully
