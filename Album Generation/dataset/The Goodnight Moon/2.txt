Click my heals three times
Take me anywhere but here
Whisper the words
Let's see this clearly
This is all that remains, so what more can you take?

As contagious as sin and you're gone
Did you really want to know what I was about?
Did you really want to know?
Please your feelings out loud (don't fade away)
Blinded by the light, taking it over
Your silhouette carries me home

Your star can't leave with the angels above
Hold them by their wings (all eyes above)
You can change (all eyes above)
You remain like a diamond in the sky

Did you really want to know what I was about?
Did you really want to know?
Please your feelings out loud (don't fade away)
Blinded by the light, taking it over
Your silhouette carries me home

Take me away
