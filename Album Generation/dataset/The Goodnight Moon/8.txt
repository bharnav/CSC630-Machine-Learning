You found a new love now
He is your type
No need to pose now child
I had to say goodbye
I heard things were better now
With your wonderful life
Your life is perfect now
But mine just died
And do you miss me when I'm feeling sad
I called your friends to see what you said
It's the weekend
Go have fun
It's the weekend
You never loved me at all
The places that you go at night are pre-planned secrets in the back of your mind
And you tell me that I'm not second best but I know I am... you liar
As I clinch my teeth and I hold my breath and these tears begin to pour from the words I said hey kid write a song about her
That's right you can't
It's the weekend
