(Clapping)

Is this what you wanted?
(Alone, alone)
Holding your knees to your head at night
(Alone, alone)
Breathe your last waking breath with your fingertips by your side
Is this what you wanted?

No matter why
No matter how
No matter why
I can't get on your side

And the moon leaves the sun in the morning
But it's still dark, closed blinds, the sign of her glory
Waiting on another day to simply sleep the sun away
I'll still be right here for you

And they say, settle down. Settle down!
Waiting for the day to see, to see where you belong

This is where I'll face my fears, and my hands held out to you
Starving for attention, without direction, you know
This is where it ends. This ugly reflection of you
Oh, but it's not you

No matter why
No matter how
No matter why
I can't get on your side

And the moon leaves the sun in the morning
But it's still dark, closed blinds, the sign of her glory
Waiting on another day to simply sleep the sun away
I'll still be right here for you

(incoherent talking)
And they say, settle down. Settle down. Settle down. Settle down

Woah
