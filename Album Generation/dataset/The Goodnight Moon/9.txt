Hum along, if you find it in your heart to try it
And you feel like you're betrayed
If your presence fell
Then show yourself with confidence
Let it carry you away

You're a little faster than you were before
A little better than you already were
So when the lights go down, don't be shy
Let's give this one last try
This is one from me to you

Sing along, enjoy this drive whie you sit alone
As you find someone to change
Just give this an hour, let it expain itself to you
Don't drive away

You're a little faster than you were before
A little better than you already were
So when the lights go down, don't be shy
Let's give this one last try

And i won't, go on saying this forever
Don't do this, its rediculous
And i won't let this go on any further
Let this line win you over

Woahh, let this line win you over

Rock and roll girl come outside tonight
Put your arms up in the moonlight
We've been here before, we've been here before

And i won't, go on saying this forever
Don't do this, it's rediculous
And i won't let this go on any further
Let this line win you over
