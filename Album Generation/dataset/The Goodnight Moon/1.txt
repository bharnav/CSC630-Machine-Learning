For a minute there I thought you were my type
But now that the interduction's over
There's something on my mind
And now's the perfect time
Lights out, to sleep you go
This poison's like your own
When you think about the things you did wrong
And by the way where everybody goes
And I set it up, and you set it down
And now it won't be long

Yeah I'm Drowning
I'm drowning for your love
Yeah I'm drowning
I'm drowning for your love

Was this a mistake?
Oh my god, was this a mistake?
Would I do it all again?
Would I do it all again?
I was drowning for your love
I was drowning and waiting for your touch
Would I do it all again

When you think about the things you did wrong
And by the way where everybody goes
And I set it up, and you set it down
And now it won't be long

Yeah I'm Drowning
I'm drowning for your love
Yeah I'm Drowning
I'm drowning for your love

The oxygen paints all your fingertips red
Theres the car by the bridge
Where nobody goes
Keep on laughing, keep on laughing
With everybody
Is it wrong to be so evil
With so much strife?
Keep on laughing
And it scares
Have you really had enough?
That's what she said when she hid from your arm

She lied, she didn't lived at all
A question with no answer
And now it is resolved
She lied, she never lived at all
Well keep on laughing
Keep on laughing
Keep on laughing

I was drowning for your love
I was drowning and waiting for your touch
I'd do it all again
I was drowning for your love
I was drowning and waiting for your touch
Would I do it all again? (Yeah!)
Would I do it all again?
For your dead body
For your dead body
