(feat. Brad Fischetti)

"Ten past nine or around midnight
I forgot the time" she said
She didn't want it in a letter
So this is what I said
"If I can just, just touch heaven
I would say that I did
And it glows on my fingertips"
What we want the world can't offer
But we'll get it anyway

Or maybe we're crazy
She said she was lost but now she's found
She said we would never touch the ground
She said all the right things, she said to me
And she got up and walked out without a scene

So I brushed the hair from my eyes
Turn to quickly
The sooner I stop it will be over
As I leave, you simply rescue me
And bring me closer and whisper and say

What we want the world can't offer
But we'll get it anyway

Or maybe we're crazy
She said she was lost but now she's found
She said we would never touch the ground
She said all the right things, she said to me
And she got up and walked out without a scene

One two three four five six seven calls to her cell phone
Without a good reply
Seven six five four three two one times
She picked up the phone and screamed
"I wish you would die!"
Screamed
"why why why, do you call me all the time?"
Screamed
"Why why why do you meddle in my life?"
I said "I tried to be the one
And I tried to be your friend
But you up and left me screaming in the end."

She said she was lost but now she's found
She said we would never touch the ground
She said all the right things, she said to me
And she got up and walked out without a scene
