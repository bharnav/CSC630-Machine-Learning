Did they count you out?
We're lost within
The feelings that you get when you're awake
Staring at ceilings once again
With open eyes, your bandages will heal
Nothing but your ponytail stories to tell
Two for one drinks
Tonight I'm meeting everyone there
Just keep on crawling away
Keep crawling away

Did they set those sails for shore?
No they didn't
Stop
Don't stop
With the ones who set their lives around fashion rules
Stop
Don't stop

I didn't seem to mind
That was during my Orlando chapter of mine
You want it all but it's already over
You want to leave but there's just no getaway

Did they set those sails for shore?
No they didn't

Was there something I could do?
We had things to get us through
Was there something that, something you don't know?
We had plans to go out west
With our futures at our best
Was there something that, something you didn't show?
So let's make the plans tonight
Let's make everything alright
And let's part our ways to figure out what we've become
What we are
Set those sails tonight
