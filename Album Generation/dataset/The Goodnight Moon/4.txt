It's hard to believe a liar
When she's calling out your name
The signals are calling out so well
You called her lover. (lover)
She punished you so deep
Her voice rings out like a beautiful melody

I'm breaking all the angles
I'm falling down in circles
I am gasping for sleep
Did you see me falling
Like a sundown in the evening
I am so dark and weak

So shes packing up to leave
For good now
Battlelines have been drawn out love
And when we drive will take that long way home
And i apologize for bleeding words
Will pack our things like we should
And go our ways back home

It's hard to believe a story
Thats been told so well
All these lines are sounding the same
Cross my fingers, hold your breath
Suburban legend, queen of that
I leave you with this beautiful melody

And so shes packing up to leave
For good now
Battlelines have been drawn out love
And when we drive will take that long way home
And i apologize for bleeding words
We'll pack our things like we should
And go our ways back home

Woooooooaahhh
Woooooooooaaahhhh

I'm breaking all the angles
I'm falling down in circles
Ohhhh (ohhhhh)

And so shes packing up to leave
For good now
Battlelines have been drawn out love
And when we drive will take that long way home

And i apologize for bleeding words
We'll pack our things like we should
And go our ways back home

So shes packing up to leave
For good now
Battlelines have been drawn out love
And when we drive will take that long way home
And i apologize for bleeding words
We'll pack our things like we should
And go our ways back home
