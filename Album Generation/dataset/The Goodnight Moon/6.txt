Close the door & leave me inside
I'll miss the fireworks burning in those eyes
Remember the songs that we use to sing
Come august i'll still be singing

Don't be the one, don't be the one
To fall out of line

Watch the blue roses fall from your hand
Remember summer when we all had second chances
Some day you'll see, that come summer
I'll still be singing

Don't be the one, don't be the one
To fall out of line
Don't be the one, don't be the one
To say goodbye

I gotta get out of here
It's been so long since i've ever had an option
So cold
I've gotta get out of here
It's been so long since i've ever had an option

Someday these scrible lines will be straight
Conversations will never bare your name
Some day you'll see, come summer
I bet you'll still be singing

Don't be the one, dont be the one
To fall out of line
Don't be the one, don't be the one
To say goodbye

I gotta get out of here
It's been so long since i've ever had an option
I gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here

It's what you've wanted
I gotta get out of here
So cold
I gotta get out of here
