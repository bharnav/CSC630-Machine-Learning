The city's spread beneath my feet
But not the one that I was after
While I've been pounding out this beat
The length of the Kudamm
Street legends on the tourist map
A fading script in Gothic
Out in the studio they're
Rehearsing in drag for a lark
Come on, let's get lost in the dark

Tale another step, another move, another pace
What isn't written in the manuscript is a note to play with grace
And if I exit from this story in a way I might retrace
It will have fallen through the cracks when I come back
In any case
Another time's another place

The city's spread beneath my feet
From the top of the Mercedes tower
And I can see the darkness closing in
Hour by hour

But I can't take another step, no filling in, no cut and paste
A bankrupt process for the memory, this terrain is laid to waste

No, nothing's written in the history books
That doesn't leave a nasty taste;
So should I start to tell the story
Will you put me in my place?
'Cause it'll all be crash and burn
When I return...in any case
Another time's another place

Just when did this get broken?
I don't know where to begin -
I got a Ubahn ticket and a Flohmarkt token....
I'm in trouble in the rubble of Berlin

The light is getting dimmer
The walls of history close in
In Babelsberg they're hunting
For a different Stimmung
That predates the war

That was before
That was before
That was a different Berlin
That was another Berlin
That was before in Berlin
