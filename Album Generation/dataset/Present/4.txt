If we had all the time in the world
We might talk about how it used to be
We could have thrown in our cards
When the going got hard
But evidently we went on interminably

Right now I want to walk towards the sea
Hoping you're still in step with me
All joking apart let's play it from the heart
Because at last even the Silver Surfer agrees:
The wave you brave
Rides on a deeper complexity

Ah, come on: surf's up!

Even the Silver Surfer agrees
