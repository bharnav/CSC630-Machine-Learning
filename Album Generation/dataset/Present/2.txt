Oh, the heptagenarians got behind the decks
While the skeleton crew went through the motions
It was only the medication that was keeping them erect
Yeh, the devil got the best tunes
So god knows what comes next

And it's difficult to think of anything less magic
Than the aged in pursuit of the hip
At the lifeboat station there's a mounting panic...
They're going overboard for this one -
Abandon ship!

Oh, the humanitarians took themselves below
While they tried to debate the latest motion;
Meanwhile only the medication served to keep them on the go
So it's devil take the hindmost:
We sail on the sloop John Doe

And it's difficult to think of anything that's factual
Now we find ourselves in Alzheimer's grip;
So at disembarkation it's no names, no pack-drill
We're all anonymous on this one -
Abandon ship!
