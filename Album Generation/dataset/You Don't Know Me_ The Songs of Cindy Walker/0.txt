[Verse 1]
Tonight in a bar alone
I'm sitting apart from
The laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past
Rise before me while

[Chorus 1]
Watching the bubbles in my beer

[Verse 2]
Visions of someone
Who loved me brings
Along salty tears to my eyes
And I know that my life's
Been a failure

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I'm seeing the road
That I've travelled
A road paved
With heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past
That I've wasted

[Chorus 1]
