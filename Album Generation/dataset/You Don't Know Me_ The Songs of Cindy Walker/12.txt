I was just walkin' out the door
It's too bad you didn't come before
I've waited so long, so long, so long
Now there's no time to wait anymore

How I cried for you day and night
For the letters that you wouldn't write
But now it's alright, alright, alright
You won't have to write anymore

Not so long ago you will never know
What this day to me would have been
But it's all changed now
Darling, anyhow
It was nice to see you again

Well, it's almost a quarter to four
Sorry, I can't stay anymore
I must be on my way
It's my wedding day
And I was just walkin' out the door

Well, it's almost a quarter to four
Sorry, I can't stay anymore
I must be on my way
It's my wedding day
And I was just walkin' out the door
