[Chorus 1]
Now, I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last

[Verse]
No, I don't care if I'm not the first one you've kissed
Darling, I'll never ask

[Chorus 2]
Yesterday's gone
Love me from now on
Be true to me
Forget about the past

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Darling, I'll never ask
