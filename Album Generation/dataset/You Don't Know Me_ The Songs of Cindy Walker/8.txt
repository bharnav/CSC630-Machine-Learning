[Verse]
Put some money in the jukebox
And let it play
For my heart is cold with its pain
Take the cork from the bottle
Of the warm red wine
And fill my glass up again
Fill my glass to the brim
Till it flows over the rim
Like the tears flow in this heart of mine
And while I'll say so long
To the dreams that are gone
On account of the warm red wine
Oh, the prison of stone
With its cold iron bars
Is no more a prison than mine
I'm a prisoner of drink
Who will never escape
From the chains of the warm red wine
Oh, the wine is red
So warm and red
Like the ribbon
It sparkles and shines
But I paid for the wine
That one red wine
With all of my hopes
And dreams
