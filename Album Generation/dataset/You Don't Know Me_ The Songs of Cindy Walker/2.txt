[Verse]
Take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart
Take me in your arms and tell me
That you've missed me since we've been apart

[Chorus]
You just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
Or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
And take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart

You just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
Or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
And take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart

You just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
Or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
And take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart
