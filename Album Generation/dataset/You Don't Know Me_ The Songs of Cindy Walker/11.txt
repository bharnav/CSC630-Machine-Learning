[Verse 1]
Hey baby don't you think I know
I've been acting real funny for a week or so
It's not like me to see things through
But I've never seen a sight quite like you
It's time for me to face the facts
I've gone too far and I can't turn back

[Chorus]
I'm in love and it's all your fault
Turned my head and my heart got caught
Gone, without a thought
I'm in love and its all your fault

[Verse 2]
I've survived behind these walls
Never thought that I could see them fall
Hey now baby, I can't believe
That I give in so easily

[Bridge]
The look in your eyes, the feel of your lips
The touch of your skin on my fingertips

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Outro][x2]
Turned my head and my heart got caught
Gone, without a thought
I'm in love and it's all your fault
