[Chorus]
When it's sugarcane time
On around about June
I'll be walking with Sugar
Beneath that old sugar moon

[Verse 1]
Going to drop her a line
To expect me soon
Said I'm craving some sugar
Beneath that old sugar moon
I can see her right now
She'll get the calendar down
Scratch a circle around
The day we're altar bound

[Chorus]
When it's sugarcane time
On around about June
When the bells will be chiming
Beneath that old sugar moon

[Chorus]
When the sugar moon shines
On around about June
I'll be walking with Sugar
Beneath that old sugar moon

[Verse 2]
All the kisses I've missed
I'll be getting it soon
Sugar kisses from sugar
Beneath that old sugar moon
While dreaming sweet dreams
All the loving I'll get
When I get back to my pet
Lordy, how I've [?]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Walking with Sugar
Beneath that old sugar moon
