[Intro]
You don't know me

[Chorus]
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me

[Verse 1]
No you don't know the one
Who thinks of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And yearns to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
No, you don't know me

[Chorus 1]
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too

[Chorus 2]
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside a lucky guy
To never, never know
The one who loves you so
No, you don't know me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You don't know me
