Don't be ashamed of your age
Don't let the years get you down
That old gang you knew
They still think of you
As a rounder in your old home town

Don't mind the grey in your hair
Just think of the fun you had puttin' it there
And as for that old book of time
Boy, you never skipped a page
So, don't be ashamed of your age
Brother, don't be ashamed of your age

Now, listen Mr Smith and Mr Brown
Don't let the years get you down
'Cause life ain't begun until you're forty some
That's when you really start to go to town
Now don't wish that you were a lad
Why boy, you've lost more girls
Than they've ever had
And once more you've graduated
From that ol' stubborn stage
So, don't be ashamed of your age
Brother, don't be ashamed of your age
