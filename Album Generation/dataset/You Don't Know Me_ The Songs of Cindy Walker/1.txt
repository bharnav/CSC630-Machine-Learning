[Verse]
So you saw her last night with her new love
Yes they tell me they make quite a pair
And that they both look happy together
I just wonder not that I care
Tell me was she lovely as ever
Like an angel with golden hair
Does she still close her eyes when she dances
I just wonder not that I care
Once I thought I couldn't live without her
Funny how wrong I could be
Now I never ever think about her
What she does doesn't mean a thing to me
Well it's late so I guess I'll be going
Too much smoke what I need is some air
By the way did she ask you about me
I just wonder not that I care

[Outro]
I just wonder not that I care
