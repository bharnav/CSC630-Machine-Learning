[Verse 1]
Oh, have you seen Miss Molly?
Her cheeks are rosy red
Her lips are soft as satin and they taste like gingerbread

[Chorus]
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too

[Verse 2]
Now when Miss Molly's smiling the sun is dim a spell
And when she laughs her voice is like a little silver bell

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'll trade my horse and saddle
Cow driving I'll resign
If only Miss Molly will say that she'll be mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now listen dear Miss Molly I've told you this before
And even though I told you so I'll tell you just once more

[Chorus][x2]
