[Verse]
One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid
The memory of the that night of love, is lingering yet
And I know I never will forget

[Chorus][x2]
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so
And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies
We'll ride to paradise
My sweet little chickadee
My little Cherokee Maiden and me
