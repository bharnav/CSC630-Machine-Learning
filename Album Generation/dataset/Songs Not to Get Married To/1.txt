You've got alot to learn before I let you go
Theres things you need to see and things you need to know

They say
We won't

What do they know?
They say
We can't
Do it
But I've got to know..

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better now?
And is it getting better now?
