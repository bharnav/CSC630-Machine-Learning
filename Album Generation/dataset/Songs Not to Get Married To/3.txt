Bite the hand that feeds your face
One more thing you can replace
Shut my mouth because I'm spilling all your dirty secrets
Slap the wrist of this embrace
You're the one who's losing face
Search the quiet corners
Lock the door i can hear you screaming
Don't wake up you're not really dreaming

When your world starts caving in
I'd still take you in

Pour the songs straight in my veins
I won't need them anymore
Make the cut much deeper
Lying on your bedroom floor
I'm giving up, I'm giving up

When your world starts caving in
I'd still take you in
And if your world filled you with fear
And I'm already here

And I've been everything you ever needed
Ever wanted
Everything you wished for
And this is how you repay me
And I've always been right here
And you play your part and i'll play mine
Even if I don't want to

Wish i understood this game
But it costs me just the same
Whatever i owe you
Never sacrifice the play
But it always ends
It always ends the same

When your world starts caving in
I'd still take you in
And if your world filled you with fear
And I'm already here
And if your world starts caving in
(And I dont need you anymore)
I'd still take you in
(And I don't need you anymore)
And if your world filled you with fear
(And I don't need you anymore)
And I'm already here
