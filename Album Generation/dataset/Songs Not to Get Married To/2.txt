She said she doesn't want a boyfriend, she's better off with friends
She doesn't like getting hurt when serious relations end
He only wants to see her whenever she will permit
He only wants to be with her and quit feeling like shit

All that he can give, he gives her
More then he really should now
Whenever they meet he'll see her
And he'll tell her that he's happy
She feels good

This simple situation is easier unsaid
He knows just by him asking her it goes straight up to her head

All that he can give, he gives her
More then he really should now
Whenever they meet he'll see her
And he'll tell her that he's happy

If she could give the time she see that everythings fine
Its not up to me
She wishes that he would see its nothing to be that she will for he

She says she'll never need a boyfriend, she's happy with her friends
She's keeping all her secrets with her up until the end

All that he can give, he gives her
More then he really should now
Whenever they meet he'll see her
And he'll tell her that he's happy
She feels good
