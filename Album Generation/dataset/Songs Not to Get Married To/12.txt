"Playing Dead"

My head is pounding, it kills me more each day
I've been here before with you
There's nothing left, nothing left to say
I'll never have to say the words that we don’t want to hear
I'll never have to say the words, you never have to fear

Here's where your story ends
Here's where my life begins
No one knows you better than you know yourself
Everyone around you says you just need help

I'm still the worser, "I'm better" isn't yet
What I've forgotten you will soon forget to say
I'll never have to say the words that we both fear
I'll never have to say the words you never have to hear

I'm giving up on you, not calling in
Stop won't really work for me anymore
I hope it was worth it, I'll never do this again
No one knows just what you mean to me
I hope you pick yourself up again

Here’s where your story ends
Here’s where my life begins
No one knows you better than you know yourself
Everyone around you says you just need help
Everyone will judge us by the words we say
Everything's easy if we just play dead
