How did you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?

I guess I'm horrible for you
I guess it's what the people do
I heard you're moving out of here
You know I'm getting out

What was the point of all of this?
What was the point of our first kiss?
I guess the news I heard was true
The news I heard came from you

I guess I'm horrible for you
I guess it's what the people do
I heard you're moving out of here
You know I'm getting out

I hope that things work out for you
I hope that he works out for you
I wish that we worked out for you
I know we'd never work for you

I guess I'm horrible for you
I guess it's what the people do
I heard you're moving out of here
You know I'm getting out

I hope that things work out for you
I hope that he works out for you
I wish that we worked out for you
I know we'd never work for you

I guess I'm horrible for you
I guess it's what the people do
I heard you're moving out of here
You know I'm getting out
