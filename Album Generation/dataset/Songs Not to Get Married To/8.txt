"The Fuck Stops Here"

You said you did it for the money
You think our friends will need you now
You said it felt that so was ready
I'm sorry now you've got to catch your ass and die

There's no apologies
I'll be around you wait and see

You should have let your kind of me shred
Your dress and mood to me look fine
So tell me what is all this trouble
Screw you and all your world you'll never get the time

There's no apologies
I'll be around you wait and see
You sailing floating in the air
Don't try explaining baby I don't care
(You're not a lady, don't act like a lady)
There's no apologies
I'll be around you wait and see
You sailing floating in the air
Don't try explaining baby I don't care
Here's where the fuck stops
Here's where we end
Why would I ever want to be your friend
(You're not a lady, don't act like a lady)
