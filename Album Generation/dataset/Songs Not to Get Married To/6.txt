Asking me discretely, when she can come meet me, later on tonight
Talking super softly, how we both look gothy, but it's alright
Don't tell me what you're doing to me
I dont want to look sleazy, but you make it seem so easy

Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, it's time for you to take me home
Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, how much you mean to me

Kissing me so slowly, shouldn't be this lucky, like we're in a movie
Smiling at me in the moonlight, wish this could be everynight
And everynight and everynight again
Don't tell me what you're doing to me
I dont want to look sleazy, but you make it seem so easy

Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, it's time for you to take me home
Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, how much you mean to me

And I'd still be waiting, when all this starts fading It's true
You don't even know how much I need you

Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, it's time for you to take me home
Anna, please get off the phone now
I've got to let you know now, how much you mean to me
