Today is the day
I'm ripping you out
The pain you've given
Is worth one seventy five
Leave me so I can have some sanity
Get away from me
I'm keeping a piece of you in a jar
So I can point and laugh at you from now till forever
You suck and it's time you left
I am tired of taking care of you
You never seemed to notice anyways
So pulling out your roots
Go ruin someone else's life
