So far, so good, ohh, well, so, you're in love what the hell?
Someday I can retry this gut rhetoric outtake
Why must I feel disgrace? Please wipe that smile off your face
Forget you, all you do, I know that you'll forgive me

Your piece of me is fading, part of me is done
Saw you from far away and lost you in the sun
So far, so long

This is a point of view, it's doing nothing for you
I don't care if you stare, it's not that complimentary
I'm where I need to be, is that hard for you to see?
What once was better for you, is better for me

Your piece of me is fading, part of me is done
Saw you from far away and lost you in the sun
So far, so long, so long, too long

Your piece of me is fading, part of me is done
Saw you far away, lost you in the sun
Piece of me is fading, part of me is done
Saw you far away, lost you in the sun

So far, so long, so long, too long
So far, so long, so long, too long
So far, so long, so long, too long
So far, so long, so long, too long
