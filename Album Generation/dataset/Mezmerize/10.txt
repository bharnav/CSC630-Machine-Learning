[Intro: Daron Malakian]
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah...

[Verse 1: Daron Malakian]
I'll wait here, you're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should have never gone to Hollywood
They find you, two time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should have never trusted Hollywood

[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
I wrote you and told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should have never gone to Hollywood
They take you and make you
They looked at you in disgusting ways
You should have never trusted Hollywood

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah...

[Verse 3: Daron Malakian]
I was standing on the wall, feeling ten feet tall
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
This is my front page, this is my new age
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

[Bridge: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
Phony people come to pray
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray
The lines in the letter said, "we have gone to Hackensack"
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray

[Verse 4: Daron Malakian]
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard
You should have never trusted Hollywood
You should have never gone to Hollywood
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

[Outro: Daron Malakian]
You should have never trusted Hollywood
