[Intro: Daron Malakian]
You!
Why do they always send the poor?

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious, Victorians, kneel
For brand new spanking deals
Marching forward hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Lalalalalalalalalala, ooooooooh
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses’ dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil crying FREEDOM!
Handed to obsoletion
Still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Lalalalalalalalalala, ooooooooh
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine

[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Blast off! It’s party time!
And we don’t live in a fascist nation!
Blast off! It’s party time!
And where the fuck are you?!

[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses’ dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil crying FREEDOM!
Handed to obsoletion
Still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Lalalalalalalalalala, ooooooooh
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sun–

[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor
They always send the poor
