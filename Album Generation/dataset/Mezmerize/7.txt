[Verse]
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you...
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright

[Chorus]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

[Verse]
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you...
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright

[Chorus]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Chorus]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

[Outro]
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
