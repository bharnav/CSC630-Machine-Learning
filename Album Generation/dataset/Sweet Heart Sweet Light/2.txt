[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Cause only the living can feel the pain
Sometimes I wish that I could fly
You get so grounded that life will pass you by

[Chorus]
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on

[Verse 2]
Sometimes your world's so full of pain
You get so hurt inside, but dry your eyes
Sometimes the words you gotta say
They get so trapped inside and fade away

[Chorus](x5)
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on
