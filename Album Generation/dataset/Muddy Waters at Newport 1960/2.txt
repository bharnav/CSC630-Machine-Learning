[Chorus 1]
Baby, please don't go[x2]
Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans
You know I love you so

[Chorus]
Before I be your dog[x3]
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone
Turn your lamp down low[x3]
I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go

[Bridge]
You brought me way down here[x3]
About to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog

[Chorus 1]
Baby, please don't go[x2]
Baby, please don't go, back the New Orleans
I beg you all night long

[Chorus 2]
Before I be your dog[x3]
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone

[Outro]
You know your man down gone[x3]
To the country farm, with all the shackles on
