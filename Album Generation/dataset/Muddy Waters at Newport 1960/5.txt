[Verse 1]
I got a letter, come to me by mail
My baby's coming home
I hope that she don't fail

[Chorus 1]
You know I feel so good
Well, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to the station
Just to meet a train
My baby's coming home
You know I've got dead aim

[Chorus 1]
You know I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack

[Chorus 2]
I feel so good
I hope I always will
I feel like a Jack out with a Jenny
Well behind the hill

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
