Feeling a great sadness today
Don't wanna indulge it or shoo it away
It belongs to the whole world
The boys and girls
It ain't just mine

Like joy and love, it's always there
Don't know how I tune in, don't know why that I care
But I can't pretend
This don't feel like the end
And everything is fine

Feel exiled from the divine
Me and these sad friends of mine
Just waitin' down here
Drinkin' beer
And losin' time

I hear plenty of music
I see superfluous beauty
Everywhere
Why should I care?
What does it matter to me?

The myth of life is a song
Nature, too, is the song
Don't you destroy the song
Cause when the song is gone
You'll be gone too

Don't know how it went astray
Seem like the whole world is an ashtray
Just floatin' around
A broken-down
Low-end galaxy

Don't know what I did to get sent here
Must have been something bad that I done
There in a world gone mad
Feelin' sad
I guess I'm sorry

Don't need no one to love me
Oh please, dance up above me
What does it matter?
Don't need a ladder
What's it to me?

I hear plenty of music
I see superfluous beauty
Everywhere
Why should I care?
What does it matter?

I hear plenty of music
I see superfluous beauty
Everywhere
Why should I care?
What does it matter to me?
What's it matter to me?
It don't matter to me
Nothing matters to me...
