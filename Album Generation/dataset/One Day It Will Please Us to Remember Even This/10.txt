Seen you rocking the Rainbow store
That pretty little doll that I'd seen before
Stayed too long with the borderline
My emotional landscape one street mind
Was lifting my heart to not cause a stir
She knew I was watching her
Looking like the lover that gave all things for
Starting getting glad that I was born

She walked right up to me
Said "What's it gonna be?"
At the Rainbow Store

She came over and she pulled my hair
Said hey boy "What cha doing here?"
Just shopping for my sister, it's a birthday suit
She knew it wasn't true but whe was cool

Pushed my neck up against the elevevator door
Kissed me like I've never been kissed before
Made a face so sweet in me
I went down like a submarine

She walked right up to me
Said "What's it gonna be?"
At the Rainbow Store

Went all the way down to New York this (?)
It felt like almost happiness
Never thought I'd find myself here
Without guilt and without fear

I never knew it could be alright
I never knew bliss that could be all night
You never know ___ spare all the language says
Was a lifteing complete was an illusion to me

She walked right up to me
Said "What's it gonna be?"
At the Rainbow Store

She walked right up to me
There went my ennui
At the Rainbow Store
