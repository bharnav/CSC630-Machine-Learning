Spirit slumbers in nature
And awakens in mind
And finally recognizes
Yourself in time

Call us what you will but
Love made us like this
So what? Yeah, this whole world is just
Artifice

Take a good look at my good looks
Then close your eyes
Keep the picture in your mind 'cause
I'll be gone

One rainy day, I saw ya smiling
You let me stay awhile
And it was all right
Living with you, not even trying
The pain is long gone
And it's all right!

Take a good look at my good looks
Then close your eyes
Keep the picture in your mind 'cause
I'll be gone

Hellishly transparent
Utterly divine
Every little timeless gesture of
Valentine

Memories hold onto illusion
Cause we're just human
And that's all right (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)
Duality is so confusin'
You think you're not dreamin'
Then you open

There's no foundation
No final resting place
Only emptiness and
Hellish grace

Some rainy day, I'll find ya crying
With love and animus
Sparkling in your eyes (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)
But you'll be the one to recognize me
You'll all get lost
Every time I fall (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)

Nothing you say will scandalize me
You'll be all right
You're just like it is (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)
It's all right, it's all right!

Our noisy years will seem like moments
In a film of
Eternal tears (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)
Seems so long to have romance
(fade out...) (Take a good look at my good looks, baby)
