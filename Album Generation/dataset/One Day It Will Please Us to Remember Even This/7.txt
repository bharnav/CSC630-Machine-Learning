Tommy's got a brother named Thomas
And another brother named Tom
His father is a professional fighter
And I think so is their Mom

Gotta get away, Gotta get away
Get away from Tommy
One time and won't get away
Won't stay away from me, get away from me, Tommy

Tommy gets his wisdom through excess
Tommy don't hold no scorn
Transcends limits of his culture
The very one from where I was born

Gotta get away, Gotta get away
Get away from Tommy
One time and won't get away
Won't stay away from me, get away from me, Tommy

Tommy don't follow no tradition
The song that he sings is his own
I can hear the machine(?) bells ringing
I don't wanna die alone

Gotta get away, Gotta get away
Get away from Tommy
One time and won't get away
Won't stay away from me
Gotta get away, Gotta get away
Get away from Tommy
One time and won't get away
Won't stay away from me, Get away from me, Tommy!
