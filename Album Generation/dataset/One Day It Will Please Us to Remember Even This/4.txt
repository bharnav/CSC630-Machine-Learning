Universe is drama and it plays this game
Got so involved, forgot we're all the same
Appears so real and it does it so well
Some of us in heaven, some are in hell
On the edge of our seat, don't know where it's gonna go
'Til we're all throwin' bombs, screamin' "On with the show!"

In a
Punishing world
Incredibly
Punishing world

Vortex of defensiveness in which I quip
Escaping conflicted, the conflict I try to escape
Try to find some comfort, what i find instead
Like changing my position on a cement bed
A mess of anxiety that lusts and loathes
Livin' in terror of debt, and in the misery I know

In a
Punishing world
Incredibly
Punishing world

Subterfuge, Orwellian doublespeak
A consciously awarin' little ego-freak
So much bullshit everywhere I go
Amazing how many things there are that aren't so

In a
Punishing world
Incredibly
Punishing world

Punishing world
Punishing world

Instead of compassion, lots of love and joy
A vast competition, compulsion to destroy
Further from line I get in spirit and mind
Selfishness makes stronger all the ties that bind
I laboriously make em with my words and thoughts
'Til they're impossible to break
I'm stuck, I'm done

In a
Punishing world
Incredibly
Punishing world
It's a punishing world
Punishing world
Such a punishing world
Punishing world
What a bummer
Punishing world
All summer
Punishing world
Man it's a punishing world
Punishing world
Yeah, a punishing world
Punishing world
It's a punishing...
