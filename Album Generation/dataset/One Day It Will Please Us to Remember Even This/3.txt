Your design's so intelligent
Ain't no way that was an accident
Come on shake your monkey hips
My pretty little creationist
Oh yeah
Ain't gonna anthropomorphize ya
Or perversely polymorphosize ya
Oh yeah

Little girl you look so sweet
(you got hips like a monkey, hips like a monkey)

You just started ten thousand years ago
Presto, Adam and Eve, but go man go
Abel died, Cain took his life
And headed straight for the jungle to find a wife
(Wow)

Nonbelievers running out on apes
This monkey time I want to see you shake

Evolution is obsolete
(you gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child)
Stomp your hands and clap your feet
(you gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child)

Oh one more time, yo
It's monkey time!

Come on pretty baby won't you take a chance
Be my natural selection, dance dance dance
Exorcise your demons with that monkey friend
Because we're gonna inherit the wind

Let them fight it out in the Supreme Court
That's such a mad lame indoor sport
Wave your arms and legs in the air
Rock it like a monkey, like you just don't care

Evolution is so obsolete
Gotta stomp your hands and clap your feet
(you gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey...)
