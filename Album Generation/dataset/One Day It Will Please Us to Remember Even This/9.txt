When I come down and all my money is spent
Try as I may, I don't know where it went
For the good times and all the fun that I had
Just can't remember when I felt so bad

It don't make no sense and it seems so odd
And it makes me wonder if there's a God

I ain't got nothing after the fall
I ain't got nothing, I got no one to call
I ain't got nothing, feeling so small
I ain't got nothing, nothing, nothing at all

This is not how the end should have come
Who could imagine this when I was young?
Where is everybody?
It's not the way I wanted it to be

But the path I took, they all have outgrown
The party's over, I'm all alone

I ain't got nothing after the fall
I ain't got nothing, feeling so small
I ain't got nothing, I got no one to call
I ain't got nothing, nothing, I got nothing at all

All the magic I swore that I knew
Just disappeared, it hasn't left a clue
No one's talking on my behalf
Here in the silence as I force a laugh

There was a time I could'a cried
Even my feelings have crawled up and died

I ain't got nothing after the fall
I ain't got nothing, I got no one to call
I ain't got nothing, against the wall
Now, ain't that something, nothing, I got nothing at all?
