(INTRO)
Whoo!
All right!
Yo!
(wolf whistles)
All right, boys, here we go now..

Why should gay boys get all the good seats?
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Little girl, god gave ya two good feets for
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Your legs are crossed and your shoe is danglin'
Yo!
(???)the shape I'm in
Come on baby, let's get over the street
So goddamn great, I wanna kiss your feet!

Since I was a boy, loved them high-heeled shoes
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Just lookin' at you in 'em takes away my blues
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
I'm right behind ya, flyin' up them stairs
Yo...
What we do up there, I don't care
I be lovin' what I seen from here
You got flesh-colored underwear!

Let's play secretary, let's have a little fun
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
I'll take dictation, you're the bossy one
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
On a desk that's just yea-high
Duh.....
You spread your wings just like a butterfly
My god, it's almost made ya deified
I love you, baby, cause you ain't shy
Taste so sweet, feel I been glorified!

Sexless Italian actress at the Vatican
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Confessin' to a demented clergyman
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Esmerelda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Beauty and the Beast, Cocteau is to blame!
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
Who cares what the neighbors say?
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
They gonna talk about us anyway!
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
The young gravedigger and the corpse
(Runnin' around, runnin' around)
I love you, baby, you're so warped!
