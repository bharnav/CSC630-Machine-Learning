We're all in love!
We're all in love!
We're all in love!
We're all in love!

We all sleep in one great big bed
People like to think we're seekin' a head
Everything to them is just a functional fit
Got a bad reputation, just won't quit
Defame with great suspicion, hostility
Despisable, phenomenal, illusory
Pretty fancy words for not really real
Love ain't pretty, it's the way that we feel because

We're all in love!
We don't care!
We're all in love!
What could they do to us?
We're all in love!
You can do whatcha wanna but
We're all in love!

Jumpin' round the stage like teenage girls
Castin' our swine before the pearls
Don't fuck with us, what people say
They go to work, we go to play!
Drunk on the joy, a-singin' a song
Lovin' hard as the day is long
Excommunicated, then canonized
When love is strong, life intensifies because

We're all in love!
We're all in love!
We're all in love!
We're all in love!

We love fightin' like lovers do
Love makin' up in a hour or two
A kiss on the lips, unseemly for a man
Least we don't go around holdin' hands
Most times we don't, but don't stop tryin'
With the music we got to manifest the divine
To beam it up with love and let it rock on down
Til every creature hip to the ultimate ground because

We're all in love!
What do we care?
We're all in love!
It's our life!
We're all in love!
You can do whatcha wanna, but
We're all in love!
We don't care!

We're all in love!
(in love)
We're all in love!
(in love)
We're all in love!
(in love)
We're all in love!

Love! Love! Love!
