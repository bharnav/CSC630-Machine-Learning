A simple word or two, I need a little clarity
If you make it clear, doubt will surely disappear
If I could see your hand, I bet you'd win
So make me understand before I fall in love with you again

Take me carefully, I believe in you, the words you say
Break me willfully, are you deceiving me, the words you say
I am fragile now, beat about the head
Was I gullible? Absolutely so, the only way I know

You're getting me down, you never call
I stop to wonder what I did or didn't do enough
Until you say the word, I'll stay right here
I wanna be with you, but if you want me gone, I'll disappear

Days of rain, watch the river of tears roll by
Wash away the pain of several years go by
Days of rain, days of rain and I wonder why
Wash away, wash away as I float on by

I only wanted things that would make you happy
I only wish for you that you find your way
I only hope you see that you made things happen
I only wish that you can be right some day
