Now suspicion grows
I can't turn my back
I can't live like that
Anymore
So you're branching out
Trying something new
What am I to do
I'll figure out

Oh, can I be the only person who gets no fruit off the tree
Who could live with me in high fidelity?

As the times they change
I get left behind
Losing all my mind
I'll figure out
And as I tumble down
To the depths below
There's no flowers growing there
I'll dig it out
