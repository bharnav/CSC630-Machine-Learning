Fucked underneath between days
Fucked underneath between days
Mind explode mind corrode
Fucked underneath days
Underneath days

Never wanna say the word to me
Never wanna tell me what you want me to be
You never wanna tell me
You never wanna tell me
Never wanna see the things I tried to show you
Never wanna see the places I could go to
Never wanna see the places I've been
Never wanna see the things I've become

Fucked underneath days
Fucked under these ways

Never wanna let me go my own way
Never wanna let me find out for myself
You always stand above me underneath days
You never get out of my way when I say
You never stand in your shadow

Never stand anyway
Never stand anyway

You never wanna say the words I do
