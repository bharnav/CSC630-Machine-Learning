Give me something to believe in
Give me reason give me space
Give me somewhere I can run to
Give me cause to leave this place

Yes I melted when I met you
Yes I fell in right away
Yes I come to you if you say
Yes I will come today

You were light that killed the shadow
You were love when I was down
You were faith when I questioned everything I knew

I am what you always wanted
I am what will make you whole
I am standing right beside you
I am vision I am sound

Give me something to believe in
I am vision I am sound
