This would be the sound of me
Looking for some kind of closure
You so sad, you just lost
The best thing you never had

All those dreams I believed
I woke up and it's over
You so sad, you just lost
The best thing you never had

As you leave, as you go
There are some things you need to know
How I tried to love you every way
I could, but I was denied

Walked away, never called
All I wanted was to be with you
Wasn't enough, ain't that tough
Guess that's the way it was meant to be

You should save your explanations
(You'll find someone else)
While I change my expectations
(And stay here by myself)

This would be the sound of me
Looking for some kind of closure
You so sad, you just lost
The best thing you never had
