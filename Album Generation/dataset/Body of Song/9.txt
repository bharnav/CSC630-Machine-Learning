This is how I'm feelin' for some time
I'm missin' you, the reasons are all mine
Treated you unkind, so miserable am I, yeah
I'm missin' you, I need you here beside me now

Missin' you I turned into a wreck
You don't know how bad I want you back
From pushin' you aside, to wishin' you were mine
I've been missin' you I tried, now I know there's some hope

Ooh, baby, I'm so sorry now, I gotta see you
Ooh, maybe you could come around and see this stupid fool Who's missing you

Just for you I grabbed a ray of hope
And shined it on the places you might go
I'll search for you all night, I'm hopin' you might find out that
I'm missin' you, I need you here beside me now
Yeah, I been missin' you, I need you here beside me now (x3)

Missin' you
