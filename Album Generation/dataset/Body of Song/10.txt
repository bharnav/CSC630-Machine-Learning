You think you love him or someone like him
He reminds you of a boy you dated once or twice
Just about the same size, just about the same eyes
The only difference being the cadence in his voice

So much in common, woven out of cotton
Or silky like the spider's web, so fragile in the wind
The chains that bind us,  serving to remind us
Anchors hold the ships at bay when high tides rush in

Maybe a tattoo, or a name laid in the tile
I guess you think he's staying for a while
Something to remember, a faint and distant smile
I guess you plan on staying for a while

It's kind of frantic, we all long to be romantic
You try to give yourself away and hope he never leaves
But nothing matters when heart goes pitter patter
No sense of unconditional, it's me who you deceive

A window with a view of present, past and future
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew
And mothers without fathers to help install the cupboards
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew

It's kind of funny, today it might turn sunny
The birds are coming back from winter flights away
And if you miss them, I'll be sure to wish them
A welcome back from both of us
And hope that they might stay
