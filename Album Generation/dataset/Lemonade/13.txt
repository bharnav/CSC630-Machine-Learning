You might be crazy
But then again so am I
They aught to stick me in an institution
Just so I could be by your side
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ah baby I'm still around
You might break up
In a million pieces
Cryin' in the middle of the street
Blame it all on me yeah
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ah baby I'm still around
People say
You're gonna fall in and out of love all the time
People say
That it don't come easy
But you sure came easy on me oh my
Now, I won't tell no one our business
About the night we met
But if you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble's what you get
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ooo baby I'm still around
Now there's a lot of things
That I'd like to change
'Bout my self
Ain't a thing I'd change about you baby
'Cept maybe uh well oh oh I'm just kiddin
Can't you tell?
You're like water from the well
My buckets filled
I got no leaks
That means every drop I got of your, girl
I'm gonna keep
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ooo baby I'm still around
Yeah
Still hangin' 'round
Ooo yeah girl

Chew me up
Spit me out
Run me down
Turn me out
Look at me
Comin' back for me
Ah yeah...
