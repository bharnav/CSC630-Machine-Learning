[Verse 1: Jack Johnson]
Well i woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Yes I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin' me
Everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2: Jack Johnson & both]
Well so long, good friends
When will we meet again?
I said so long good friends
When will we meet again?
Well i don't know, i don't know
But I guess I'll see you then...

[Verse 3: G. Love & both]
Well I'm gonna pack my old guitar
Move on down the road
I'm gonna pack my old guitar
And move on down the road (where you gonna go?)
Where I'll go, I don't know
But I guess I've got to go

[Verse 4: both]
When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin me
Everything...Everything is gonna be alright....
