Your words don't come easily no more
I wonder what you're doing every second that I'm not with you
And now I see what I put you through, I should be gone
Something keep me hanging on
This instinct all this pain I feel don't phase you
It's funny what them drugs will do
And now I'm crying now, how could someone spend so much time so close
And always feel so far away
How could two people stay together so long just because they're afraid to walk away

I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...

Time is so wrong but the feeling so right
Won't you let me kick it just one more time
Won't you let me love you and hug you and squeeze you tight
Won't you be my darling tonight
Kiss me one more time before you turn your back forever, now you walking away
Look me in the eye, smile, like you did the very first time I called your name
Tell me everything's gonna be alright, even though I can't stop these tears
For five long years I was afraid to give it all
Now you're gonna leave me and my best friend is gone

I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...

Why won't you let me love you, baby, baby
Start from scratch, we'll start from scratch
Why won't you let me love you, baby, baby
Start from scratch, start from scratch
You're my friend, you're my sister my lover, I don't want find another to replace you
Start over again
We'll start over again
You're my friend, you're my sister my lover, I don't want to find another to replace you
Start over again
We'll start over again

I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
I swear to god we're breaking up this time...
