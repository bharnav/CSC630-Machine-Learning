[Chorus - G. Love]
Let the music play
Let the music play
Let the music play
Let the music play

[Verse 1 - Marc Broussard]
Sun is up
You know it's hot
No sense in worrying
About what you ain't got
Talk is talk
Action is action
Just tryin to find my soul
Some satisfaction

[Bridge - Marc Broussard]
We ought to take it easy
We ought to take it easy
We ought to take it easy
We ought to take it easy

[Verse 2 - G. Love]
All this running and running around
I'm gonna drop on the outside hit the underground
Better take a lil second and check on out
If you don't we'll be burnin out

[Bridge - all]

[Bridge 2 - Marc Broussard]
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Ben Harper]
Bring on your music bring on your song
Let the music jam all night long, let the music play

[Chrosu]

[Outro - Ben Harper]
Turn on your music
Turn down the lights
Let the music jam all night
Let it treat you right, rock you right
Do it right, get it right now
On and On
On and On
On and On
On and On
