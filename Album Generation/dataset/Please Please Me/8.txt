[Intro]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 1]
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Verse 2]
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 3]
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 4]
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you
