[Intro: Paul McCartney]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Well, she was just 17
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
