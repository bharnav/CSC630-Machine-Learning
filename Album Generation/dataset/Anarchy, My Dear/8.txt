[Verse 1]
I fell and slipped in a pool of spit that my parents spat out on the day they split
Fell clumsily through twigs and trees into a pile of dudes who were as screwed as me
Well guess what, you showed up, with your cape and dress to dress my cuts
Nice to meet you, I'm cliche, yeah, I have this baggage but can you save me

[Hook]
Can you save me, cause I don't wanna end up like they are
Can you save me, cause I don't wanna get stuck like they are
Can you save me, cause I don't wanna give it up like they are
Can you save me, can you save me
Can you save me, can you save me

[Verse 2]
Disfigured things with sadistic schemes have got it out for the woman of my dreams
I'm a helpless mess, damsel in distress, caught staring at the symbol on her chest
You chose me, out of this sea of klutzes come triple amputees
Unworthy of all your time
While I dance here among the land mines

[Hook]

Cause I wanted you, do you want me too?
Cause I notice you, do you notice anything I do?
Cause I wanted you, do you want me too?
Cause I notice you, cause I notice you
Cause I wanted you, do you want me too?
Cause I notice you, do you notice anything I do?
Cause I wanted you, do you want me too?
Cause I notice you, cause I notice you

[Hook]
