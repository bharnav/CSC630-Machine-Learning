[Intro]
When I'm dead, I'll rest, I'll rest...
When I'm dead, I'll rest, I'll rest...

[Verse 1]
Admit it, you lecherous douche!
You were listening to my band in 2004 though you claim you were reared on The Stooges
Your entire facade is a line that you feed to anorexic actresses
Who would have laughed at your jacked-up Navajo haircut, less than a decade ago
Don't wanna hear about how the latest Rihanna single is a postmodern masterpiece, stop punishing me!
Fueled by a potent mixture of cocaine and latent insecurity
Defining your own self-worth by the opinion of a stupid website with Satan as its figurehead
Now you pass your pestilence on to your Ritalin-addled children
Well my mother didn't raise no fool
God, my blood boils at the thought of you, poser
Die!

[Hook]
(Again! Again! Again!)
You'll never cut me down again
(Again! Again! Again!)
You'll never cut me down
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down

[Verse 2]
I'm sure you're proud that you've usurped the popular kids table, you son of a--
Which means you've forfeited your dubious anti-cred by buying into your own inflated hype
And I don't define my enemies by the clothes they wear or the pretentious bands they like
It's about how you seek to control minds, just to appease what you've always lacked!

[Hook]
(Again! Again! Again!)
You'll never have your say again
(Again! Again! Again!)
You'll never wield those words again
(Again! Again! Again!)
You'll never have your say again
(Caught up in it!
So full of it!
You'll never have your say again!)
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down
And your crap rains down

[Bridge]
Don't want nobody, don't need nobody but me
No ashtray-life, no ant-farm university
When I rid my skin and reveal my core, you'll see
When I perpetrate your reverse lobotomy, you'll see

I'm all I wanna be
I'm all that I wanna be
I'm all I wanna be
Don't want nobody, don't need nobody but me
I'm all I wanna be
I'm all That I wanna be
I'm all I wanna be
Don't want nobody, don't need nobody but me
