[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel a baby nipping softly at my heel
A reminder of how fat and scared you love to make me feel
A curse of such a fetching fraud without a soul to speak
Inspired thirty songs I could have written in my sleep
You snort a line of syphilis and run the marathon
Your mentally deficient friends just ask you what you're on
I may be shy and not reply to your scathing review
But I'd rather subsist on venom, than abstain with you

[Hook]
Oh I'll be fine
Sever this for all time
I'll laugh it off when this ends
You can just go get high with all of your dumb friends

[Verse 2]
I was the kind to ask what wrong doing had injured Dahmer's pride
Or to excuse the junkie thief with diamonds in his eyes
But now I taste a righteous fury sparkling with hate
Well you'll diddle this earth up and think "fetch mommy, it's too late"
I'll bite your head off, spit it out, and let it plunge away
You and all your kind won't stamp your future on today
The beat thumps loud, you sweat it out and grind on them for drugs
You hump that pole like a firefighter falling in love

[Hook X2]

Never another song, never another thought
Never another song, not for you
Never another song, never another thought
Never another song

[Hook X2]

You were my crutch, now I've escaped your clutch
So how is that worms-eye view?
I have grown two broad wings and now I'm above you
