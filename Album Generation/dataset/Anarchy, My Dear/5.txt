[Verse 1]
Dressed in rags and drenched in sweat
Spinning something that the world will soon forget
Handkerchief and girlfriend jeans
You're not privy to the splendid things I've seen
Kill that DJ, clear the floor
Have a seizure in the leisure of the board
Damn the mob mentality
If you're sick of it then sing it with me

[Hook]
It's my life and I'll live it without you
It's my life and I'll live it without you
It's my life and I'll live it without you
It's my song and it was never about you at all

[Verse 2]
Social climb our suck up slave
About a moment and you dragged it out for days
Here's the conflict that you crave
Upon the phoenix and the death of the fleeting phase

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You're everything I wanted
You're everything I needed
Everything I wanted
(I've gotta let you go)
Is it everything You wanted
Everything you needed
Everything you wanted
(I've gotta let you go)

Now you've seem to find your place amongst the sheep (I've gotta let you go)
Now you've seem to find your place away from me (I've gotta let you go)

[Hook X2]
