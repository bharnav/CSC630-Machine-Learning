[Verse 1]
I have the sketchy past, yet I have shed my wings
Cold turkey now hanging by a heart-string
Dangle over her, above the pulsing bar
She tries to catch my eye, her gaze is deafening
What do you call a lass conservatively dressed
With a glimmer in her eye that screams "I'm next"
I am the greasy chump with whom she'll fall in love
If I'm her fall from grace, then she's my christening

[Hook]
You look so good tonight, you look so good tonight
Break down those walls tonight, you look so good tonight
And when we're good and close, I think I'll steal your time
They can shoot on sight, but it's all right
You look so good tonight, you look so good tonight

[Verse 2]
And I don't care
Which prophet you adore, who you voted for
It won't discourage love's sick former man-whore
Your skin against my own, I'll be your Oli Stone
You'll be my Audrey Hep, you can have what is left
And we'll combine to be some kind of Japanese mecha-creation
With two fused persuasions, yeah
We'll destroy the earth and herald its rebirth
As somewhere where someone like you would hit on me

[Hook]
You look so good tonight, you look so good tonight
(I gotta have you)
Break down those walls tonight, you look so good tonight
(I gotta have you now)
And when we're good and close, I think I'll steal your time
They can shoot on sight, but it's all right
You look so good tonight, you look so good tonight

[Break]

[Verse 3]
This could produce a meltdown, but I think we're doing fine
We can tear and break the maps apart, shatter all their lines
When the universe that is not comes, to kill our love and trust
I only want a soul to know it feels so good with us
Feels so good with us, and it's all right

[Hook]
