[Verse 1]
In this dream I have I'm staring off a balcony, to an open wound
Where all the suckers who have wronged me will be marching off
To their impending doom
All the cowards who spooned me, thinking in reverse
Revel and they'll swoon
Screaming all the way down
Screaming all the way down

[Hook]
Want this so bad
I want it bad, so bad, I want it so bad
(And you're the right boy, at the right time)
I want it bad, so bad, I want it so bad
(And you're the right boy, at the right time)

[Verse 2]
You'll fax your number to me, garnished with a friendly note
Apologizing for
All of the time you kept me waiting, eating all I could?
Pounding at your door
Spurn all the pop stars who are sucking at Satan's teet
I'll give you so much more, cause you believe in me now
Yeah you believe in me now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can feel it, I can taste it, I can make it, say you will
(Say you will, say, say you will right now)
And we'll get it started
(Say you will, say, say you will right now)
Yeah we'll get it started
(Go on and say you will, say, say you will right now)
And we'll get it started
(Say you will, say, say you will right now)

[Hook]
