[Verse 1]
Condemn my race to genocide, if it meant that I could lay with you
I’d listen to a piercing squeal on a loop, to make this real with you
Forfeit grandma's civil-rights, if it meant I‘d save the life of you
I’d spit upon a bible, dear, if it meant I’d stay right here with you

[Chorus]
Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you
Anything for you!

[Verse 2]
If Satan showed up with a gun, threatened, "Be disloyal, or I shoot!”
I’d take it in the kneecaps, rather than to be that guy to you
I’d throw up every morning, pull my nails out, take a wrench to all my teeth
To put a ring upon your digit, have you fidget in your bed with me

[Chorus]
Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you
Anything for you!

Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you (woah)
Anything for you
Anything for you!

[Outro]
I’d condemn my race to genocide
(Anything for you!)
Listen to a piercing squeal
(Anything for you!)
If it meant that I could lay with you
(Anything for you!)
If I could only make this real...
