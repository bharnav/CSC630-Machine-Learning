[Verse 1]
Anarchy, your wish is my command
I'll free the atom from it's cell
And place it in your hand
Reach beneath my coat of winter fat
And tear my beating heart out
We're the beauty and the brat

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh love, like a falling star I fell for you
Do anything you want me to
And most of all, I'd die for you, it's true
You touch the world and all is set askew

[Chorus]
Anarchy, my dear
The brazen and the queer
We bow before you, Anarchy, my dear
Anarchy, my dame
I quiver at your name
I bow before you, baby born in flames

[Verse 2]
I dream of days that we might share
Where God's no useless effigy
Of something barely there
But all these kings become our clowns
And I will serenade the choice we made
To burn the mother down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh love, like a synonym defined by you
Feel hope cause I'm reminded to, by you
The fools surmise they blinded you, it's true
Your love unlearned the broken life anew

[Chorus]
Anarchy, my dear
The brazen and the queer
We bow before you, Anarchy, my dear
Anarchy, my dame
I quiver at your name
I bow before you, baby born in flames

[Bridge]
You coat me in blasphemy, well once I was so blind
The beauty and the spacious skies, with boundaries undefined
You whisper tunes in my eardrums as we lay here entwined
Search for love for oh-so long, but one day I will find

Find you!
Alright!

[Chorus]
Anarchy, my dear
The brazen and the queer
We bow before you, Anarchy, my dear
Anarchy, my dame
I quiver at your name
I bow before you, baby born in flames

Anarchy, my dear
The brazen and the queer
We bow before you, Anarchy, my dear
Anarchy, my dame
I quiver at your name
I bow before you, baby born in flames
