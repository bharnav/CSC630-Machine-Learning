[Verse 1]
Watch you hit the stage like a willing bomb, strapped to cripple children
It’s hard to watch you whore out your damaged pride, I spit on what you’re building
We rally in the balls of the sweaty club, prepare for insurrections
And, all the dead souls that you would control are bound for resurrections
Your father was a lover and he left you there, need of their attention
You’ll fill this blank page with the brightest shame; the death of all invention
If you’re the new Christ of what will suffice
Then Satan to your savior
Sing it out loud if you don’t believe
In lies and good behavior

[Chorus]
If you’re the Sun, I’m a black hole
If you’re the Sun, I’m a black hole
There must be something in the way you burn
It makes me lose control
If you’re the Sun, I’m a black hole

[Verse 2]
I’m happy to report about the life assured
Livened to ashes
Might of had a few but I gripped the wheel
Now I’m speeding past this
If you should approach with the blue and white
Attempt to pull me over
I have a few words for the weak of heart
To summon and sober

[Chorus]
If you’re the Sun, I’m a black hole
If you’re the Sun, I’m a black hole
Yeah!
There must be something in the way you burn
It makes me lose control
I’m the son of a black hole
Go!

[Verse 3]
Basking in the glow of a dying star
Bowing down blind like the scum you are
Take a little second just to hear me out
Marching off a cliff like you’re free of doubt
You’re Jesus growing fat off of Roman gold
Moses making up the Commandments too
Allah strapped tight to a stolen nuke
Elvis in his pool of royal puke

[Hook]
You’ll never be alive because you sold your soul
(I don’t even want to take you home tonight.)
You’ll never be alive because you sold your soul. Soul!
You’ll never be alive because you sold your soul
(I don’t even want to take you home tonight.)
You’ll never be alive because you sold your soul
Soul! (Soul!) Soul! (Soul!)

[Guitar Break]

[Outro]
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
If you don’t change your evil ways and end this peacefully
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
I beg you before you’re digested, shred your lens and see
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
You won’t curry favor with that flavor, curry tastefully
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
I’ll swallow you and grind you up and you will cease to be
You’ll bleed I can't let this go with you
You’ll bleed I can't let this go with you
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
I can't let this go with you
You’ll bleed to feed the demon in me
I can't let this go with you
I can't let this go with you
I can't let this go with you
I can't let this go with you
I can't let this go with you
I can't let this go with you
