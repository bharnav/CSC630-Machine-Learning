How can we close or eyes
When the walls around wear thinner each day
How can we mute our voices
When a parade of chaos marches through out the land

This is the end, end of all

We've been down this road before
Yet we all just stand and watch
Everlasting ignorance has led our ways
Forewarned, but still forgotten-our history erased

This is the end of all

Chorus-

Down on our knees
We bow to hatred
Down on our knees
We fade away

We've tried and failed
Now rome burns again

This time its all of us
This time its forever
