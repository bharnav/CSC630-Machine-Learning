Put your face on, stage your play
Deep deception, youve dug your own grave
Cowards Cross Indignation
Imposters mount
The loss of the faithful feared
How long can you live in denial
How long will you ignore whats real?
Live you own lies, taste your blood
Cowards crossing is feared
And you celebrate your fame
You celebrate your imposters kingdom
Nothing is real anymore
They claim to feed us the truth
Its the deepest hypocrisy
Imposters Kingdom
