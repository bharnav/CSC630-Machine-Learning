A west side run through
One string away from taking the lead
We stalked the streets at night
To live,to fear,to breath

Bring back those days of gold
When the torch was ours to bear
A troubled youth for some
For us a crown to wear

Chorus-

I see a time,a santity of brothers
We knew another world

A west side horror
A torch burned out before his own time
We closed our eyes at night
To hurt,to hear,to breath

Bring us back to the days
Bring us back to the ages of innosence
Our time to live forever
Our worlds will meet again
