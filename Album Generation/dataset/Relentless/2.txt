Didnt Mean What I Said
I'm Sorry You Feel So Sad
The Words In The Heat Of The Moment
Are The Ones That Can Sound So Bad
Let Me Comfort You
We Can Make It Through

Cause It's Wrong
It's Not Right
Let's Love and Not Fight
And I Say Hey Dont Cry
Let's Love and Not Lie
(Just Let Me) Be The One Who Cares
Just Let Me Be The One Who's There
So, Lets Love And Not Fight All Through The Night
All Through The Night

Sha La La La
(Oh - All Through The Night) Sha La La La (Yeah)

Baby, I Was So Wrong
I Ask For Your Forgiveness
Weak When I Should Be Strong
Now Give Me A Chance To Prove This
I May Not Always Show
How I Need You So

Cause It's Wrong
It's Not Right
Lets Love and Not Fight
And I Say Hey Dont Cry
Lets Love and Not Lie
(Just Let Me) Be The One Who Cares
Let Me Be The One Whos There
So, Let's Love And Not Fight All Through The Night

And When the Morning Comes
Ill Hold You In My Arms
And You'll be Sure Of Me
And Any Fears You Have Will Disappear

Let's Love
(I Know You Want it Baby)
(I Know You Need It Tpo)
Lets Love
(I Know Your Longing For A Love That's So True)
Lets Love
(So Get me Out Now Baby)
(When All I Wanted Was To Make You Mine)

Cause It's Wrong
It's Not Right
Let's Love and Not Fight
And I Say Hey Don't Cry
Lets Love and Not Lie
(Just Let Me) Be The One Who Cares
Just Let Me Be The One Who's There
So, Let's Love And Not Fight All Through The Night
All Through The Night

Cause It's Wrong Its Not Right
Let's Love and Not Fight
And I Say Hey Don't Cry
Lets Love and Not Lie
(Just Let Me) Be The One Who Cares
Just Let Me Be The One Whos There
