Gold and Yellow Sun
Together We Would Run
Til' Darkness Falls on September Skies
On The Blackest Night You Were By Side
Said To me Like A Lullaby

Oh, Oh I Can Fly Now You've Rescued Me From Insanity
The Blue Sky Won't You Paint For Me With the Colors Of My Dreams
And Ill Begin Again At The Rainbow's End

Take The Deepest Blue
Turn The Dark To Light
Set Your Set On A Crimson Tide
Find A Shade of Green For The Apple Of My Eye
Fill The Same Between Your Heart and Mine

Oh, Oh I Can Fly Now You've Rescued Me From Insanity
The Blue Sky Won't You Paint For Me With the Colors Of My Dreams
And Ill Begin Again At The Rainbow's End - At The Rainbow's End
In My Dream Ill Begin Again

I Can Fly Now You've Rescued Me From Insanity
The Blue Sky Won't You Paint For Me With the Colors Of My Dreams
And Ill Begin Again At The Rainbow's End - At The Rainbow's End
