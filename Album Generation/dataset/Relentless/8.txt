Safe In My Madness
Look At Me Im Dressed Up Messed Up
And Totally Crumbling of The Taught Of Seeing You Here
I Thought I Shook You Out of My Hair
But You're Back Like A Showstopper
I Can't Stop Can't Stop This Ain't Easy No

Every Road I Chose Brings Me Back To You
Every Dream I Dream Always Ends The Same
So Tell Me Why Do I Do The Things I Do
I Wish I Was Over You

Caught Up In Such Confusion Im Going With It
But Im Losing It So Damn Quick I Think You Might Notice
I'm In A State There's No Other Way
I Can't Handle About To Go Crazy

Every Road I Chose Brings Me Back To You
Every Dream I Dream Always Ends The Same
So Tell Me Why Do I Do The Things I Do
I Wish I Was Over You
I Wish I Was Over You
I Wish I Was Over

You're Paired In Like A Twisted fate
Like I Found A Cloud On A Sunny Day
I'm Back To You Like I Rickashade
Falling Apart Again Losing My Mind Again

(do, do, do, do, do- ah)

Every Road I Chose Brings Me Back To You
Every Dream I Dream Always Ends The Same
So Tell Me Why Do I Do The Things I Do
I Wish I Was Over You
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
I Try To Keep My Cool But I Know I Can't
Trying Not To Lose All I Do I Say
And Tell Me Why Do i Do Things I Do
(The Crazy Things I Do)
I Wish I Was Over You
I Wish I Was Over You
(I'm Such a Fool)
I Wish I Was Over You
