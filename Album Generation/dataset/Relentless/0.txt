Story Begins
Started as friends
They know it starts to show off
Feelings are changing
Find yourself thinking
That all of the time
They're on your mind

Chance to smile
Wait awhile, a lonely call
Late night at home
A funny conversation
Leaves me contemplating
I wonder if you know, I want you so

I can't stop these feelings
Tearing me to pieces
Hiding everything away
But can't you see my face
My tears relentless

Wish There Was Away
I wait for the day
You'll confide in me (yeah)
And we will talk all night
And when the time is right
I'd say, oh, what would I say

I can't stop these feelings
Tearing me to pieces
Hiding everything away
But can't you see my face
My tears are relentless

Why don't I just say it
Everyday I pray it
This is meant to be
But don't you come to me
And i'll love you relentlessly (yeah)

Have I been here too long
Just to let you know I got it wrong (yeah)
I'm thinkin what should I do
Should I take a chance and end up losing you

I can't stop this feeling (feelings - ooh)
Hiding everything away
But can't you see my face
My tears are relentless (yeah)

My tears are relentless

I can't stop this feeling
Tearing me to pieces
Hiding everything away
But can't you see my face
My tears are relentless

Why don't I just say it
Everyday I pray it
This is meant to be
But don't you come to me
And I'll love you relentlessly

And I'll love you relentlessly
I'll Love You Relentlessly
