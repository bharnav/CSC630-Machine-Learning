Not Much For Talking
But I Really Know I Can Say
Ive Been Round Sleep Walking
But You Woke Me Up Today
And There Are Things That I Know
I Should Remember
But All Im Sure Of Is What You Mean To Me

You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
I Was Afraid And Walked Away
Ive Found A Place To Hide
In The Sanctuary Of My Pride
You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say

Im Not Much For Begging
But Im Begging You Now To Stay
You Better Let me Learn The Lesson
And Show Me The Way
I Should've Seen it Its All So Very Clear Now
And All I Wanted Is Standing Here

You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
I Was Afraid And Walked Away
Ive Found A Place To Hide
In the Sanctuary Of My Pride
You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say

So Please Dont Go
You Gotta Be here And Now
I Wanna Be There To Find The Angle In your heart That Conforms Me
Oh Baby How Can I Make It Up To You Now
Cause I Feel Its Not To Late To Show I Love You So
I Guess You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
You Didn't Knows Cause Of me
How I Kept Inside Your The Only Thing In Life

You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
Got To Scared And Walked Away
How Could I Run & Hide
When Your Love Was On My Side
You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
Got To Scared And Walked Away
How Could I Run & Hide
Knowing Love Was On My Side
You Didn't Know Cause I Didn't Say
Got To Scared And Walked Away
How Could I Run & Hide
When Your Love Was On My Side
How Could I Run & Hide
When Your Love Was On My Side
How Could I Run & Hide
When Your Love Was On My Side
