(VERSE 1)
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That dont bother me
I can take a few tears now and then
And just let them out
Im not afraid to cry
Every once in a while
Even though going on with you
Is gonna still upset me
There are days every now and again
I pretend im ok but thats now what gets me

(CHORUS)
What hurts the most
Was bein so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing, what could have been
Im not sayin that loving you, is what i was trying to do...

(VERSE 2)
Its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere i go
But im doing it
Its hard to force that smile when i see our old freinds
And im alone
Still harder, getting up, getting dressed
Dealing with this regret
But i know if i could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that i say
In my heart that ive left unspoken

(CHORUS x 1)
Is what i was trying to do, oh oh oh ohhhh

(CHORUS x 1)
What hurts the most
Whenever you walk away, yeahhhh
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh....
