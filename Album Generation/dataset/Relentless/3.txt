Something's You Do
Go Unnoticed
Never Say A Word But You Just Carry On
Sometimes Your hurting
But Im Not Listening
And I Should Be The One You Rely Apon
And It Will Take All Day Tonight
But I'd Love To Say It Right

Cause I Know Baby Im A Fool For Always Taking
Made Me Realize The Mess Im Making
Gonna Be The One Whos Hearts Is Break in Two
Now My Time Is Running Out To Late For Talkin
Ill Do Anything To Stop You Walkin
You Dont Have To Wait But Baby Im A Fool
But Boy If Your Gone Please Leave The Light On

Thing I Promised Birthdays I Missed
So Many Ways I That Put You --- ----
Times That You Tried
Crying Inside To Open Up The Door Just To Get Through To Me
And It Will Take All Day Tonight
But I'd Love To Say It Right
Cause I Know Baby Im A Fool For Always Taking
Made Me Realize The Mess Im Making
Gonna Be The One Whos Hearts Is Breakin To
Now My Time Is Running Out To Late For Talkin
Ill Do Anything To Stop You Walkin
You Dont Have To Wait But Baby Im A Fool
But Boy If Your Gone Please Leave The Light On

I Know Theres Point Denying
It's A Mountain Of Lying
And I Pray Your Gonna Give Me One
More Chance To Make It Right And Stay

Cause I Know Baby Im A Fool For Always Taking
Made Me Realize The Mess Im Making
Gonna Be The One Whos Hearts Is Breakin To
Now My Time Is Running Out To Late For Talkin
Ill Do Anything To Stop You Walkin
You Dont Have To Wait But Baby Im A Fool
But Boy If Your Gone Please Leave The Light On
