Oh I Can Do
Never Felt Like This With Anyone Before
I Just Want To Jump Right In
I Can't Stop - No, No
Someones Touched My Heart
And I Don't Feel Like I'm Drifting Anymore
You Like Just What You See
You See Me Just For Me
(Um-Hmm)

I-I'm Falling For You
I-I've Never Been So Sure
I Never Felt Like this Before No

Let Me Tell You Now
Oh, What Can I Do
Never Felt So Free With Anyone Before
The Story Ive Been Through
You Understand - Yeah, You Do
I'm Seeing Things Clearer
The More I Let You Nearer
I Don't Have To Hide The truth - No

I-I'm Falling For You
I-I've Never Been So Sure
I-I Never Felt Like this Before

And if You Could've Seen me
Was Down So Long To Know My Name
So Cynical of Love
But All Of That Stuff
I Believe

Oh - Cause' I-Im Falling For You
I-I've Never Been So Sure
I-I've Never Felt Like this Before
Oh- Before Never Been So Sure
I-I've never Felt Like This Before
Oh - Let Me Tell You Now
Oh, What Can I Do?
Never Felt This With Anyone Before No, No
