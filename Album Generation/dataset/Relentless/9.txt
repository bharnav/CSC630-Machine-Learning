I see the sad eyes behind your smile
Tears would be a welcome release
If you could let your guard down for awhile
You know you might find some peace
Ain't nothing you could do or say
That could shock me or drive me away

And I would do anything to ease your pain
You're not alone you're not insane
You come from a place where it always rains
And I would do anything to be your cure
So lay down with me and let me ease your pain
(Let me ease your pain) (let me ease your pain)

Can't move on if your stuck in the past
And now its time for you to let it go
But if you want to make love that would last (oh baby)
You know that I need you to tell me so
Ain't nothing that you could say or do (oh no)
That would make me lose my belief in you

And I would do anything to ease your pain
You're not alone you're not insane
You come from a place where it always rains
And I would do anything to be your cure
So lay down with me and let me ease your pain
(Let me ease your pain) (let me ease your pain)
(Let me ease your pain)

Ain't nothing you could do or say
That could shock me or drive me away
And I would do anything to ease your pain
It's not to late and its not in vain
You come from a place where it always rains
And I would do anything to be your cure
So lay down with me and let me ease your pain
(Let me ease your pain) (let me ease your pain)
(Let me ease your pain)
