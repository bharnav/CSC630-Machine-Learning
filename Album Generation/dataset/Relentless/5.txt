We Said Goodbye
And We've Been Through All The Questions
Trying To Get the Answers Right
And You It's Nothing You Did Wrong
It's Just A Path I Need To Take
To Go Grow Along My Fate

And The Memories That We Shared Together They're Gone
It Saddens Me to Think But its All Gone

You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
Can't Believe That we're apart - No - I never meant to hurt You Baby
Don't You Think Im So Cold We Already Faught The Fight
Cause' Ill Be Crying Every Single Night - It's So Hard - Yeah
I Never Meant To Break You Heart - no -

You Tried And We'd Fight
If You Put Two Hearts Together
I Guess The Truth Reveals In Time
And With You I Feel That I Belong
What I Need Everynight
Is To Have You By My Side

And The Memories That We Shared Together They're Gone
It Saddens Me to Think But its All Gone, All Gone

You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
Can't Believe that we're apart - No - I never meant to hurt you Baby
Don't You Think I'm So Cold We Already Faught the Fight
Cause' I'll Be Crying Every Single Night - It's So Hard - Yeah
I Never Meant To Break You Heart - no -

Baby Don't Be Holding On
Cause I Don't Know How I Feel
But Don't Just Throw Away Love
What If I Never Love Again
But It's Time To Be Movin' On
Don't Just Throw Away Love
It's not That I Don't Love

You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
Can't Believe That we're apart - No - I never meant to hurt You
You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
Can't Believe That we're apart - No - I never meant to hurt You Baby
Don't You Think Im So Cold We Already Faught the Fight
Cause' I'll Be Crying Every Single Night - Oh - Yeah
I Never Meant To Break You Heart - no -

You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
Can't Believe That we're apart - No - I never meant to hurt You
You Gotta Understand I Never Meant To Break Your Heart
