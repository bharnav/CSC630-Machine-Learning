Oh Felt Like love

Hey I Know its Wrong I'm Wide Awake
But Your Talking To Straight To My Heart
I Know In Life It Can Be Unfair
And Its Tearing My World Apart
But Baby You Can Call Anytime You Want
You Know That I'll Be Waiting For You
I Wanna Wake Up To Where You Are

It Felt Like Love
It Took Me Over
It Only Took One Kiss
Now I Can't Miss The Feel of Butterflies
But It Feels So Right
And I Love The Situtaion
Now I Know That I Can't Have You
You Belong To Someone Else
But it Felt Like Love - Yeah

Didn't hide Im Running Scared
I Can Feel it Everytime We Meet
Sometimes Act Like I'm Not There
And it Hurts So Bad it Leaves me Weak
But Baby You Hold Me In Your Arms I Know
Your Hurting Just As Much As I Am
Pretending All The Time Not To Let Your Feelings Show

It Felt Like Love
It Took Me Over
It Only Took One Kiss
Now I Can't Miss The Feel of Butterflys
But It Feels So Right
And I Love The Situtaion
Now I Know That I Can't Have You
You Belong To Someone Else
But it Felt Like Love

I Felt Like Me
For The First Time That I Knew What Love Could Be
I Dont Know How To Carry On Like This No More
Never Felt So Insecure

It Felt Like Love
It Took Me Over
It Only Took One Kiss
Now I Can't Miss The Feel of Butterflies
But It Felt So Right
And I Love The Situtaion
Now I Know That I Can't Have You
You Belong To Someone Else

But it Felt Like Love
It Took Me Over
It Only Took One Kiss
Now I Can't Miss The Feel of Butterflies
But It Felt So Right
And I Love The Situtaion
Now I Know That I Can't Have You
You Belong To Someone Else
But It Felt Like Love

Felt Like Love Uh-Huh Yeah
Felt Like love
Oh- Oh- Oh Yeah Oh
Felt Like Love
Oh-Woah-Oh
Felt Like Love
