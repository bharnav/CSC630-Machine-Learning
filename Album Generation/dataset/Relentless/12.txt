Only Know That I Know That Im In Love When Im In It
Wishing You Were Here Today
Dont Wanna Wait Forever Dont Wanna Feel This Way
When Your With me I Know My Lifes Gonna Change In A Minute
Nothings Gonna Be The Same
I Know Im Gonan Find You
Seems To Be That Im Not Asking Much
But This Is How I Feel

All I Wanted In My Life
Is Someone Honest By My Side
Someone Who'll Give Me Back There Heart
Say When I'm Right And When Im Right
Just Someone To Be Thinking Of When I'm Loney Late At Night
And When i Find That Special One Thats Where I'll Belong, Yeah

Not So Long Ago It Was Good To Be Alone, I Was Happy
But Now Thats Not Enough For Me, I Wanna Share It All
Only Then Will I Be Complete
I've Been Looking but Boy Im Gonna Try A Little Harder
Cause' Boy Im Gonan Find Ya
Where Ever You May Be

All I Wanted In My Life
Is Someone Honest By My Side
Someone Who'll Give Me Back There Heart
Say When I'm Right And When Im Right
Just Somebody To Be Thinking Of When I'm Loney Late At Night
And When i Find That Special One Thats Where I'll Belong, Yeah
And When i Find That Special One Thats Where I'll Belong, Yeah
That's Where I'll Belong

But I Guess MY Dreams Will Have Todo
Until I Find You

All I Wanted In My Life
Is Someone Honest By My Side
Someone Who'll Give Me Back There Heart
Say When I'm Right And When Im Right
Just Somebody To Be Thinking Of When I'm Loney Late At Night
And When i Find That Special One Thats Where I'll Belong
And When i Find That Special One That's Where I'll Belong
That's Where I'll Belong
That's Where I'll Belong
