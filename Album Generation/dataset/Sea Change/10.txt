[Verse 1]
Go to sleep
We're so tired now
Altogether in a snake pit of souls
New days
Throw your chains away
Try to hang your hopes on the wind

[Chorus]
Little one
Just a little way
Today all we need is waiting

[Verse 2]
Night rise
Like the evening prize
In a turnstile backwards we fly
Cold bones
Tied together by
Black ropes we pulled from a swing

[Chorus]
Little one
Just a little way
Today all of the dreams are waking

[Bridge]
Can't stand on crooked legs
I'm cross-eyed to the wall
In these harbor lights
Satellites explode

[Verse 3]
Drown, drown
Sailors run aground
In a sea change nothing is safe
Strange waves
Push us every way
In a stolen boat we'll float away

[Chorus]
Little one
Just a little way
Today all we need is waiting
Little one
Just a little way
Today all of the dreams are waking
Little one
Hold on
Hold on
All of the dreams are waking
