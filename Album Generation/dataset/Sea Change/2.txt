[Verse 1]
There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
Till I learn to leave the past behind

[Chorus]
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

[Verse 2]
All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Have no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me

[Chorus]
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

[Verse 3]
Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time

[Chorus]
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
