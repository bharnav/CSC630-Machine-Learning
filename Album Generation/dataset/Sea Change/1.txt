[Verse 1]
Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Through the helter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die

[Chorus]
O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Verse 2]
Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We're just holding on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's one road to the morning
There's one road to the truth
There's one road back to civilization
But there's no road back to you
