[Verse 1]
Haven't got a lot to learn
And my eyes they stray again
Looking for a satellite
In the rays of heaven again

[Chorus]
There's no other ending
Sunday sun
Yesterday is ending
Sunday sun

[Verse 2]
Jealous minds walk in a line
And their faces jade the strain
Stranded in infinity rooms
And they're safe from any harm

[Chorus]
