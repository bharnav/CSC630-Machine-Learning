The uttermost attraction
You repressed until tonight
Is breaking free like a boundless scream of ravenous desire
Feral resurrection
Dancing on a wire
Celebrate the darkness that is torturing your mind

Flow!
Your endless dreams are burning
Bright!
The resurrection code
Overflow of quivering shivers
Overflow of quivering shivers
Standing by the moon
Shapes the night in me
The night in me

Paralyze the senses from our state of disgrace
We must fall chase the end of nightmares
By the pulse of midnight we're reborn
In lycannihilation
Face the endless night
Your meaningless existence is a shelter between me and I

Flow!
Your endless dreams are burning
Bright!
The resurrection code

Rise for a midnight ride
From a senseless life
The resurrection code

Overflow of quivering shivers
Overflow of quivering shivers
Standing by the moon
Shapes the night in me
The night in me

Galleries of shadows
Stain the crystal moonlight night
Galleries of shadows
Stain the crystal moonlight night

The netherbreed is reborn
Hail the eve of your decline
The netherbreed is reborn
Hail the eve of your decline

Chasing the dreams of the endless night
Chasing the dreams of the endless night
Solidify
The steps of time
Solidify
The steps of time

Flow!
Your endless dreams are burning
Bright!
The resurrection code

Rise for a midnight ride
From a senseless life
The resurrection code

Overflow of quivering shivers
Overflow of quivering shivers
Standing by the moon
Shapes the night in me
The night in me

Overflow of quivering shivers
Overflow of quivering shivers
Standing by the moon
Shapes the night in me
The night in me
