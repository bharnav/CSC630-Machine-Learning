[Verse 1]
They lie, they steal
They blog, they feel
Entitled to too much
They want, they drill
They drive, they kill
The wildlife and such
They laugh at pain
They cheat, they’re vain
Above all other things
They’re doctors, lawyers
Wives and warriors
Misfits, pawns and kings

[Chorus]
A person is all right
A person is all right
A person is all right
But people never done a good thing

[Verse 2]
They grudge, they sue
They guilt, they do
As little as they can
They drink, they gloat
They’d sink the boat
Before they think to plan
They’re addicted to convenience
“In case of stairway, use elevator”
Can someone take our toys away
We’ve been bad, we’ve been shameful

[Chorus]
A person is all right
A person is all right
A person is all right
But people never done a good thing

[Bridge]
You’re only free when you’re asleep, baby
When you’re asleep, baby
And we choose to be misled
We’re instructions that want to be misread
“Politician” is a fancy word for crook
Most journalists cook the books and fail up
And most of us do as little as we can

[Chorus]
A person is all right
A person is all right
A person is all right
A person is
A person is all right
A person is all right
A person is all right
But people never done a good thing
