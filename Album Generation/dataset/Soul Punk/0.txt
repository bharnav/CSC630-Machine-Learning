[Intro]
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world

[Verse 1]
It was his last day on the force
He was going through divorce
He was a living breathing action screenplay cliche
They said that they found it in the basement
Enough to just blow that roof to the pavement
And he was the man for the job, a one-man bomb squad
A middle-aged mess thinking

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm gonna explode any moment
I'm ready to blow, I can't stand it
I get so worried, I get so low
But if I'm never your hero I can never let you down
And the sirens going oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-ah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
[Whoa, just clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world, yeah]

[Verse 2]
Their last hopes on him they hung
And they weighed him like a ton
But perhaps for him he'd none much left to lose, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Tony, don't sweat it, keep your hand steady
You were born on a dare but you were born ready
Cut the red wire, or was that the green wire?
You're on fire like

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm gonna explode any moment
I'm ready to blow, I can't stand it
I get so worried, I get so low
But if I'm never your hero I can never let you down
And the sirens going oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-ah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world

[Bridge]
And if this is it, I wanna go out with a bang
But I don't claim to know anything

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm gonna explode any moment
I'm ready to blow, I can't stand it
I get so worried, I get so low
But if I'm never your hero I can never let you down
And the sirens going oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-ah-ah-oh-oh

[Outro]
And if this is it, I wanna go out with a bang
