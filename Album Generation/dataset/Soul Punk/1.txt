[Intro]
This city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay

[Verse 1]
From every corner
To every block, yeah
Whether it’s warm or storming or downright stupid hot, hot
From the problems all the way to the solutions yeah
Forget all the drugs and gangs, corruption and pollution no

[Chorus]
Cause this city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh

[Verse 2]
From every high rise
Down to every slum
From every unethical politician to the wise old beat up bum
Oh, my city and I our hearts beat, beat, beat together
When I'm home, we both breathe, breathe, breathe together
This place is my home, wherever I go, I, I, I, I, I take it with me

[Chorus]
This city is my city
And I love it, love it, I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh

[Bridge]
You can take my picture
You can take my name
But you're never gonna take my city away
'Cause you, can burn it to the ground
Or, or let it flood
But it's in my blood

[Chorus]
'Cause this city, this city is my city (is my city)
And I love it, I love it, yeah
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
