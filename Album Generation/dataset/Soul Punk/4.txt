[Verse 1]
It was electric from the moment they crossed paths
Actively attracted but attempting to walk past
Temptation makes impatient impulses pump through married men
So just stop, breathe, count to three
Is she worth it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever this is, it doesn’t feel right
Baby, think about your kids
You’re not putting up a fight
'Cause we could make love tonight
But you’re gonna hate yourself in the morning light
So just stop, breathe, count to three
Get your head right like

[Chorus]
I put the "I" in lie
'Cause I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
And baby bang bang, kiss kiss
You and I got to put an end to this
We cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
If you’re unfaithful, put your hands in the air
Hands in the air, hands in the air
Like you’re under arrest with a guilty conscience
Stick 'em up if you’ve got a guilty conscience, yeah

[Verse 2]
She married young; it was a mistake
She had a son, reluctant father
He upped and walked away
She meets a man who craves her company likes she’s craving his
But, honey, if he seems too good to be true
Well, guess what? He probably is

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever this is, it doesn’t feel right
So just stop, breathe, count to three
Get your head right like:

[Chorus]
I put the "I" in lie
'Cause I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
And baby bang bang, kiss kiss
You and I got to put an end to this
We cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
If you’re unfaithful, put your hands in the air
Hands in the air, hands in the air
Like you’re under arrest with a guilty conscience
Stick 'em up if you’ve got a guilty conscience, yeah

[Bridge]
And it’s just lust
Nothing to write home about
'Cause it’s just trust
Nothing to be messed around with
It might’ve felt good for a minute
But admit it to yourself, it ain’t right
When you’re sleeping with your lover
But you’re living with your wife

Whatever this is
(You’re not putting up a fight)

[Chorus]
I put the "I" in lie
'Cause I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
And baby bang bang, kiss kiss
You and I got to put an end to this
We cheat, cheat, cheat
I’m a cheat, cheat, cheat
If you’re unfaithful, put your hands in the air
Hands in the air, hands in the air
Like you’re under arrest with a guilty conscience
Stick 'em up if you’ve got a guilty conscience, yeah

(Put your hands in the air
Hands in the air, hands in the air)
Did you sell yourself out?
(Under arrest with a guilty conscience
Stick 'em up if you’ve got a guilty conscience, yeah)

[Outro]
They lay together in the silent aftermath
Butterflies subsiding but they can never look back
