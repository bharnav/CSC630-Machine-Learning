[Verse 1]
Whenever you find it, it's none of my business
Now wherever you go, go, go, it's not my concern
But for a second your attention just belonged to me
And it passed so fast, it just fractured all my cool

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not broken-hearted
I'm just kinda pissed off

[Chorus]
'Cause Allie, I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, Miss, you got me
You should have taught me such naughty things
You could have taught me such naughty things

[Verse 2]
You sang to me (in a whisper, a cappella)
Cross-legged on Andrew's bed
And I, drunk beyond my fifteen years
Wished to be anywhere else instead
'Cause I was too terrified of you
And all I was too scared to death to do
So I slid, un-suave, off the mattress
And crumpled to the floor
And the sad fact is

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You said you were protected
I thought you meant you had a gun

[Chorus]
Allie, I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, Miss, you got me
You should have taught me such naughty things
You could have taught me such naughty things

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Allie, I was so good
But I wonder, but I wonder, but I wonder, but I wonder
If I'd be so good
(Listen, Miss, you got me
You should have taught me such naughty things)
You could have taught me such naughty things

Allie, I was so good back then
But I wonder if I'd be so good if I saw you again
Listen, Miss, you got me
You should have taught me such naughty things
You could have taught me such naughty things
