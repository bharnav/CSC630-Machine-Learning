[Intro]
One more shot then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, the room was spinning
I don't remember what I did last night
Beg the ceiling for forgiveness
'Cause I don't want to remember what I did last night
When I was drunk I might have said some things I didn't mean
There's nothing wrong with you, it's something wrong with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running dry from now on
How come no one believes me?
Believe me

[Chorus]
Step one: drink
Step two: make mistakes
Step three: pretend you don't remember
Step four: drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry, I need to run dry

[Verse 2]
My liver's killing me
But willingly I'm going to tell whoever asks that I feel alright
Beg the ceiling for forgiveness
'Cause I don't want to remember what I did last night
When I was drunk I might have some things I didn't mean
There's nothing wrong with you, it's something wrong with me, yeah

[Chorus]
Step one: drink
Step two: make mistakes
Step three: pretend you don't remember
Step four: drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry, I need to run dry

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers

[Bridge]
I get drunk a little too much
For it to be healthy
No one wants to tell me...
Whiskey, I'm trying to cut back
Wine, I'm trying to cut back
Oh, they say everything in moderation
But I'll drink you under the table
I'm not just drunk
I, I really think I'm in love with you, baby
(Okay, I really am just drunk)

[Chorus]
Step one: drink
Step two: make mistakes
Step three: pretend you don't remember
Step four: drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry, I need to run dry

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
