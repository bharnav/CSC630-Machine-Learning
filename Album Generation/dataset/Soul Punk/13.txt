[Verse 1]
Need’s got headlights and I’m in the middle of the road
And it’s hard to have a swagger when you’re carrying the load
But two shoulders, they bode well
And two arrows are well-bowed
But I’m sorry if I ever made you cry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Certainty’s a sprinter and I’m just now catching up
Now my legs creak and I’m thirsty
Still, you always fill my cup
Well, I thought you were a mountain until I saw you erupt
And I’m sorry if I ever made you cry

[Chorus]
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)

[Verse 2]
A mist of red amidst the treads along the yellow dotted line
And the corpse of non-commitment now for scavengers to dine
And the bulb above your head is like a bachelor’s exit sign
That’s why I’m sorry if I ever made you cry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A crystal tells the future, it’s a diamond makes it so
Sea is rough but you can’t mute her so you let your lumber go
And I've labored all this paper as a way to let you know
That I’m sorry if I ever made you cry

[Chorus]
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you, made you cry, it's when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)

[In Background]
Romance is all the mistakes that you made, that you're okay with
And the whole rest of your life has been telling you that you never made it
[Sigh] None of this stuff is going to do any good for me

[Chorus]
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
When I made you cry, that’s when I knew
(When I made you cry, I knew)
