[Verse 1]
The right side's in the wrong
And what's left's just holding on
And the public has been privatized
But I believe in something here on earth

When did the punks stop being mad?
They penned love songs while we got had
The hippies sold out, traded pot for coke
Moved to the 'burbs, found God in a vote
But I believe in something here on earth

[Chorus]
Listen, just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance (dance) just dance (dance)
Just dance (dance miserable)
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
I believe in something here on earth

[Verse 2]
Sorry, Hank, there's room in here
Had squares in the oval for about 8 years
It's as bad as I remember and it's only getting worse
It only gets better when it hurts
(I still believe) But I believe in something here on earth

[Chorus]
No, just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance (dance) just dance (dance)
Dance (dance miserable)
Miserable
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world

[Bridge]
Unemployed?
(Dance!)
Foreclosed?
(Dance!)
Uninsured?
(Dance!)
Climate change?
(Dance!)
Depressed? Depressed?
(Dance!)
The decline of western civilization

[Chorus]
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance (dance) just dance (dance)
Just dance
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance (dance) just dance (dance)
Just dance (dance miserable)
