[Verse 1]
Every word's a new regret if you say it right, right
Every wound can be forgotten in the right light
Oh, nostalgia, I don't need you anymore
'Cause the salad days are over and the meat is at my door

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they might try to tell you how you can live your life
But don't, don't forget it's your right
To do whatever you like, you like
'Cause you could be your own spotlight

[Chorus]
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
You could be the star, you could shine so bright
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own
'Cause they're gonna tell you all the rules to break
To take away that light from somebody, somebody now
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight

[Verse 2]
Depression is a little bit like happy hour, right?
It's always gotta be happening somewhere on any given night
Oh, nostagia, I don't need you anymore
I just hope, my perfect stranger, that my kids look more like yours

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they might try to tell you how you can live your life
But don't, don't forget it's your right
To do whatever you like, you like
'Cause you could be your own spotlight

[Chorus]
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
You could be the star, you could shine so bright
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own
'Cause they're gonna tell you all the rules to break
To take away that light from somebody, somebody now
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own

[Bridge]
'Cause I had a little bit of bad luck
(Shine the light on me, shine the light on me)
Oh, under this crumbling world stuck
(Shine the light on me, shine the light on me)
A little sweetness keeps just out of reach
(Shine the light on me, shine the light on me)
'Cause compassion is something that they just don't, just don't teach, teach
(Shine the light on me, shine the light on me)
'Cause you could be your own spotlight

[Chorus]
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
You could be the star, you could shine so bright
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own
'Cause they're gonna tell you all the rules to break
To take away that light from somebody, somebody now
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
A-yo, a-yo, you could be your own spotlight
