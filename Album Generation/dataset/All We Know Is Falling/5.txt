[Verse 1]
Maybe if my heart stops beating
It won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer
Again to anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't get me wrong

[Chorus]
Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you, whoa

[Verse 2]
One day you'll get sick of
Saying that everything's alright
And by then I'm sure I'll be pretending
Just like I am tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't get me wrong

[Chorus]
Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you

[Bridge]
Let this go
Let this go

[Chorus]
But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you

[Outro]
And I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you
