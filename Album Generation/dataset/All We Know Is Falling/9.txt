[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
I am finding out that maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down and I can't do this alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay with me
This is what I need, please

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I am nothing now
And it's been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope

[Pre-Chorus]
This time I will be listening

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you (Sing it back to you)
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you, oh

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours (My heart, it beats for you)
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart, my heart is yours
(Please don't go now, please don't fade away)
(Please don't go now, please don't fade away)
(Please don't go, please don't fade away)
(Please don't go now, please don't fade away)
My heart is...
