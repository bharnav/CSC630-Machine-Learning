[Verse 1]
I've hoped for change
It gets better everyday
I've hoped for change
But still I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something wrong
Cause everybody knows
That we can't do this on our own

[Chorus]
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh

[Verse 2]
We're doing fine
And it gets better every time
We're doing fine
But I'll let you decide

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something wrong
Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

[Chorus]
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh

[Bridge]
And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
Yeah I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again

And we got everybody singing

[Chorus]
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh

[Outro]
And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
I can, I can
Yeah I'll admit
I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again
