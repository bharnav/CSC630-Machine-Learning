[Verse 1]
So this is how it goes
Well I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone

[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time

[Verse 2]
Well this is not your fault
But if I'm without you
Then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
We'll always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time

[Verse 3]
If you run away now
Will you come back around?
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye
Watching you shine bright

[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time

[Outro]
I'll wave goodbye (You shine bright)
Watching you shine bright (You shine bright)
I'll wave goodbye tonight (You shine bright)
