[Verse 1]
Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight I'll lie awake
Feeling empty

[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
(Without you)

[Bridge]
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
But I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off without me
