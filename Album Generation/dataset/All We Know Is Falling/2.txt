[Verse 1]
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
If you thought I'd leave you, then you were wrong
Cause I won't stop holding on
So, are you listening?
So, are you watching me?
If you thought I'd breathe, then you were wrong
Because I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency, so, are you listening?
And I can't pretend that I don't see this
It's really not your fault
And no one cares to talk about it, to talk about it

[Chorus]
Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(It deserved to be alive)
I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive

[Verse 2]
So, you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is
So, are you listening?
So, are you watching me?
Well I can't pretend that I don't see this
It's really not your fault
And no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

[Chorus]
Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(It deserved to be alive)
I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive

[Bridge]
The scars, they will not fade away
No one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

[Chorus]
Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(It deserved to be alive)
I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive
