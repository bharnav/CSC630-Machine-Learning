[Verse 1]
Your life, back in a banner year
A blast of light, a brace of cheers
A house of wild accolades
Evaporating on an August night

[Interlude]
I'm looking out into the sound
I'm breathing deep, I'm turning 'round

[Verse 2]
(I'm saying)
"Do you, do you want to swim out to that island?"
(I'm thinking)
Touch my wrist. It's shaking just like someday
Baby when we're older
(I'm wishing)
Cash will be inside our kisses, someday
Maybe, baby when I'm gold

[Verse 3]
Your hair is thin and light
As a white forest fire in summertime
Your throat, where it's exposed
Looks like a crime
I'll sneak-up slow and whisper quiet

[Verse 4]
Your pretty face looks like an island
Rising from a sea that's slowly drying
(When I'm saying)
"Do you, do you want to sail out in the silence?"
(I'm asking)
"Will you, will you come over here and do me violence?"

[Verse 5]
Press your ear up to my wrist
The blood is racing some way, going wherever
(I'm saying)
"Will you, will you stand up tall and be my shelter?"

[Verse 6]
How will we go? What do you think?
Into the dust? Into the drink?
You slipped your fears into my head
Some midnight freeway ride along with Jennifer

[Verse 7]
Hotels, jails, hospital details
The highway hugs the water
I had to cross a field of seething fire
To see the moonlight on the river

[Verse 8]
(I'm saying)
"Do you, do you want to come and make me shiver?"
(I'm thinking)
Squeeze my arm and feel it pull away like someday
Baby, when we differ

[Verse 9]
I'll tell you what I didn't say
I'll tell you about the way I really miss him
You tell them what you want to tell them
Tell them 'bout the way you really loved her

[Outro]
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
And take another
'Cause no one, no one is going to stop me
From loving my brother
'Cause no one, no one is going to stop me
From loving my brother
No one, no one is going to stop me
From loving my brother
No one, no one is going to stop me
From loving my brother
No one, no one is going to stop me
From loving my brother

Not even my brother
