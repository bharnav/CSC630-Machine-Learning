[Verse 1]
She went out and found
Her father face down on the ground
Out in the cold
Walked her way around
A hill with the sun sinking down
Into the snow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the whitecaps of the waves slap
Like last hand claps
And the dark water dies in a crash
Is sucked back with a moan
Smoke on the coast

[Chorus 1]
And oh, piled fathers
Soft, sighing daughters
Where does it go?

[Verse 2]
It's a dream, now
I'll describe
Let your mind drift on down, like so
To when the world was young
A big sky, blue of a dead bachelor's tongue
A new bloom on the rose

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So some line someone told says
Even light can get old

[Chorus 2]
Oh, slobbering lovers
Drink-clinking brothers
They don't have to tell us, 'cause we know

[Verse 3]
What a way down
What a ride, what a slide spin-around
What a life to have known
What a time
And how I was singing out in a crowd
Of the thousand most frightening faces I've known

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And when the lighthouse
Lending us sight finally went out
What a fright we felt
In that night

[Bridge]
Friends just shout it out
All the whys and don't knows
All the cries in our throats
And how right we felt
With our eyes tightly closed
Holding something we broke

[Chorus 3]
And then whimpering sisters
Sobbing well-wishers
Well, it's over
Just let my hand go
