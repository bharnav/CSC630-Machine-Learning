[Verse 1]
Abandoned by all her admirers
Wild White Shadow Waltz
Stands alone on a stair down the hall
Just one slip from a trip and a fall

[Verse 2]
In a cold morning, holding her lighter
Wan White Shadow Waltz
Stirs, sputters and stalls
Wakes, wavers and walks right through her prison walls

[Interlude]
She says, "The doorbell is ringing
Go see who it is
Our little island's sinking into mist"

[Verse 3]
A day came, a night went, it lightened
An animal broke his way out
Moped through the scattering crowd
And crawled back to his circus shell

[Verse 4]
And circling the zoo's screaming clients
Was White Shadow Waltz
Deaf to their torn breaths and calls
Wait, take a look closer hey, he's hardly moving at all

[Interlude]
She says, "There's someone is knocking
Go see who it is
Our little world is shaking
I guess our little world is breaking"

[Verse 5]
In the presence of all our despisers
We'll falter and crawl to the bed
The world is a black shadow bled
And what is this tune in my head?

[Outro]
She says
"It's just the white wind when it whimpers
It's just the black rain when it squalls
It's just white meat whistling a waltz
It's just nine hands wiping a white shadow off of the walls"
