[Verse 1]
And I will skim my little sail
My friends all shivering on the rails
Show yourself
Show yourself

[Verse 2]
Floating ten feet off of the ground
Twelve millionaires coughing up clouds
Get them out
Show yourself

[Chorus]
Show yourself
Show yourself
Show yourself (come show yourself)
Show yourself (come show yourself)

[Verse 3]
Train across the island, spitting steam
Six stations of a snowy screen
Show yourself
Show yourself

[Verse 4]
Outside the fields of silver trash
The city trembles on its slab
Come on out
Show yourself

[Chorus]
Show yourself (come show yourself)
Show yourself (come show yourself)
Show yourself (come show yourself)
Show yourself (come show yourself)

[Verse 5]
I've had enough
I can see and almost know
That there is no one there to help you
There is no one there to hold you, let it go

[Verse 6]
I've felt enough
Can't really feel it anymore
And I know I'm closing off
As it gets colder, can I call out like before?

[Chorus]
Show yourself
Show yourself
Show yourself
Show yourself
