[Verse 1]
See you all tonight smiling and talking
We can be polite, when we know they're watching
But I want you like that
Yeah, I want you like that
Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I want you like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're just a friend, I'm a little liar
When we play pretend, body is on fire
Cause I like it like that
Yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it like that

[Chorus]
Come here, closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep a secret, me and you
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh
In the shadows, where it's hot
Love the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
When you look at me, there is no mistaking
Like telepathy, I know what you thinking
That you want me like that
Yeah, you want me like that
Yeah, you want me
Yeah, you want me
Yeah, you want me like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Ultraviolet light, burning hot like you do
Can we synchronize? Meet me in the back room
Cause I like it like that
Yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it
Yeah, I like it like that

[Chorus]
Come here, closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep a secret, me and you
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh
In the shadows, where it's hot
Love the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh

[Interlude]
Say you're just a friend, I'm a little liar

[Chorus]
Come here, closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Keep a secret, me and you
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh
In the shadows, where it's hot
Love the risk of getting caught
Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss, oh oh oh
