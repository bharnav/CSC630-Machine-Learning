[Verse 1]
I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful
I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

[Chorus]
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

[Verse 2]
I feel my body losing focus as he touches me
And I should go, but I can't overcome this chemistry
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

[Chorus]
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

[Bridge]
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I gotta, I gotta go
He don't know that

[Chorus]
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

[Outro]
I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful
