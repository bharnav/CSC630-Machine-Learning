[Hook 1: Britney Spears]
I can be the treble, baby, you can be the bass
You can be the bass, you can be the bass
I can be the treble, baby, you can be the bass
You can be the bass, you can be the bass
I can be the treble, baby, you can be the bass
You can be the bass, you can be the bass
I can be the treble, baby, you can be the bass
You can be the bass, you can be the bass

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, you see me down on the floor
I want you to take me higher
Till I can't take it no more
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
And now, you see me up on the sky
I was rocking the bottom
Now look at me I can fly
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger

[Hook 2: Britney Spears]
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

[Interlude: Britney Spears]
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, bigger, bigger

[Bridge: Britney Spears & will.i.am]
The bass is getting low
The bass is getting low
The bass is getting low
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Hey, you see out in the night
Wanna go out dancing, so I can feel alright
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
Yo, take me out to the lights
I wanna have me a good time, the bass is feeling' nice
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger

[Hook 2: Britney Spears]
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass

[Interlude 2: will.i.am & Britney Spears]
Yo
Yo
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Yo, it's a kick drum, come and get some
The sound that's rocking your system
When it pounds, it cause an addiction
Y'all addicts better have a prescription
Me and Brit got the whole club tripping
They sit and wait and listen
For the kick drum, for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum
For the big, big, fat fat bass, rocking all in your face
Vibration got the place, right now let's get crazy
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Everybody in the place get frantic
This beat right here's gigantic

[Interlude: Britney Spears]
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, the bass is getting bigger
It's getting bigger, bigger, bigger

[Hook 2: Britney Spears]
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
I can be your treble, baby, you can be my bass
You can be my bass, you can be my bass
