[Verse 1]
For tonight, it's just the two of us
Dim the light now, just the two of us
Like how you, oh, whisper in my ear
Your breath, like a ghost that disappeared

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close, hold me tight now
Need you more, want you more, it feels so right, now
Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

[Verse 2]
Baby, can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard from my memory
Your body feels like a fantasy
This moment's all that I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull me close, strip me down, hold me tight now
Need you more, want you more, it feels so right, now
Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

[Bridge]
Trip to your eyes, trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss, trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue, trip to your voice
Trip to your talk, trip to your heart
Trip to your head, trip to your chest
Trip to your breath, trip to your skin
Trip to your sin, trip to your touch
Trip to your tears, trip to your heart

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
