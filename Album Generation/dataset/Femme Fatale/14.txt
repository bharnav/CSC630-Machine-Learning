[Verse 1]
Okay, the shoe is going on the other foot tonight
I'm 'bout to turn you into my very own flight tonight
Okay, you think you got me where you want me
I'mma show you tonight
That I'm a girl and you're a boy
And tonight you gon' be my, be my man

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Verse 2]
Just lay right there and don't you move, I'm in control tonight
Lock you up in my room, be my prisoner of love tonight
Shut up, sit down, who's the boss now?
I'm 'bout to show you now
That I'm a girl and you're a boy
And tonight you gon' be my be my man

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Bridge]
Tonight I'm feeling sexual
Come on and play inside my love below
Strip down and give me my own private show
I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Tonight I'm feeling sexual
Come on and play inside my love below
Strip down and give me my own private show
I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Refrain]
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna be a little selfish, be a little selfish

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish
Boom, boom, baby - pick you up in my Mercedes
I'mma be a little selfish, be a little selfish
