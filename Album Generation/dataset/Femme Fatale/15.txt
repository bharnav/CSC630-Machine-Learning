[Intro]
Will you turn me up?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
This is the making of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration
So give undivided attention

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around, one shot
You're killing me

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting, don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting, don't keep me waiting

[Post-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

[Verse 2]
The time is ticking
The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So come to your destination

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around, one shot
You're killing me

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting, don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting, don't keep me waiting

[Post-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

[Bridge]
What the hell?
I'm standing - what the hell?
Standing outside, I'm standing outside
Wha- wha- what- wha- wha-
What the hell? I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer, come out and melt my ice
I'm running out of time, you're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride, before I change my mind
Don't apologize

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
