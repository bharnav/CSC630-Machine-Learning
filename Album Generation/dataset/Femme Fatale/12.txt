[Hook]
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down

[Verse 1]
I got all tricked out and came up to this thing
Looking so fire hot, a 20 out of 10
I saw you watching me watching you on the floor
Hitting me up like 'what you waiting for?'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

[Hook]
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down

[Verse 2]
All of them girls you're with are probably hating me
But I don't care, because I know it's jealousy
They see me on you like they think I'll give it up
But I ain't easy, just not afraid to rush

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

[Hook]
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down
Down and up and down
And up and down and up and down

[Bridge]
I can almost feel my lace slipping off cause of the bass
I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on
I can almost feel my lace slipping off cause of the bass
I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down
