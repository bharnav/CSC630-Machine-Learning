[Verse 1]
Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Try to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Try to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
You touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up
And get down, and get down, and get down
So come on

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out, inside out

[Verse 2]
I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Try to let you go but it's not that easy
Try to let you go but it's not that easy

[Pre-Chorus]
You touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up
And get down, and get down, and get down
So come on

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out

[Breakdown]
Inside out, out, out, out, out, out
Inside out
So come on!

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
