[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Diamond, diamond, shining, shining
Ooh boy, you so fine
Gotta be the finest thing that I've seen in my life
I will pay whatever just to get a better view
And yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu

[Pre-Hook: Britney Spears]
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight

[Hook: Britney Spears]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Boy, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Boy, you know you broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
You must be B-I-G, because you got me hypnotized
Whoever that beauty's on the inside is a liar
Cause what I'm looking at right now would make a big girl cry
So fasten up your seat belt, it's gonna be a bumpy ride

[Pre-Hook: Britney Spears]
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight
Look at you, look at you
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight

[Hook: Britney Spears]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Boy, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Boy, you know you broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

[Bridge: Sabi]
Oh, I think I like you, Sabi!
Boy, boy, look at you
I wanna get, get, get next to you
Got me kind of hot, but I ain't sweating you
Steaming like a pot full of vegetables
Boy, boy, look at me
I know you wanna touch, but it ain't for free
I don't want your money, I just want your D
Boy, come over here with your sexy ass

[Hook: Britney Spears]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Boy, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Boy, you know you broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine
