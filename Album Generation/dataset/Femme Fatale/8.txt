[Verse 1]
Black jack, whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got the look that you know
You're real bad, yeah, baby, you're right
Everybody loves you
Baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure to stay out of your sight

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like, but I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Oh oh oh oh
Trouble for me

[Verse 2]
Sweet talk, here we go
Tell me something credible
You drive me crazy every time
That I smell your cigarettes and cologne

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like, but I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Oh oh oh oh
Trouble for me

[Bridge]
Kiss, kiss, tip your glass
I'll do whatever you ask for
But if you want my love
You can only find it on the dance floor

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like, but I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh oh oh oh...)
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me

[Outro]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like, but I might regret it
