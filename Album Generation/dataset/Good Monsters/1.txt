January 1, I got a lot of things on my mind
Looking at my body through a new spy satellite
I try to lift a finger, but I don't think I can make the call
So, tell me if I move, 'cause I don't feel anything at all

So carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe
I want to be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

I woke up from a dream about an empty funeral
But it was better than the party full of people I don't really know
Well, they've got hearts to break and burn
Dirty hands to feel the earth
There is something in my veins
But I can't seem to make it work, it won't work

So carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe
I want to be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

Can you find a beat inside of me?
Any pulse?
Getting worse?
Any pulse?
Getting worse?
Inside of me, can you find a beat?

Carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe
I want to be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan

Carry me
I'm just a dead man
Lying on the carpet
Can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe
I want to be a new man
Tired of the old one
Out with the old plan
