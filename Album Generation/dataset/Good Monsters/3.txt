I whisper, "You don't have to worry, we'll survive"
Forced smiles underneath the brittle, frozen light
Proof that you're alive
Cold fingers find the curve below your tired eyes
No comfort in familiar places, not this time
You hold it deep inside

Oh Sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls have fallen letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

No flood warnings, still the waters rise
Flowers through asphalt, diamonds in the pockets of your eyes
You turn your face and hide
I saw a woman with ribbons in her hair
Old and lonely, so beautiful I had to stop and stare
The well will not run dry

Oh Sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls have fallen letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

Oh Sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls have fallen letting in the light
No need to worry
Baby, even angels cry

Sister, if you wake up in the night
Walls have fallen letting in the light
It'll be alright
Baby, even angels cry

Baby, please don't worry
Not tonight
