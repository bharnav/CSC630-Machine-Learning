I'm feeling older than my years
I'm feeling pain inside my chest
It's love that keeps me silent
It's my silence you detest
Rivers flow into the oceans
And oceans never fill
I want to kiss your lips
But I know I never will

Love's a hard decision to risk impending choke
My love will keep you wishing
And my heart will keep me broke

I give you flowers
Give you candy to even out the guilt
I send you greeting cards
With messages that I could never write
Rivers flow into the oceans
And oceans never fill
I want to let you know me
But I know I never will

Love's a contradiction
Many mirrors and smoke
My love will keep you wishing
My heart makes me broke

You will always want me
And I'll always want to leave
Even though I cut your wounds
You still deny they're real
Rivers flow into the oceans
Oceans never fill
I want to lay my life down
But I know you never will

Love's a strange condition
With all the doubts it can invoke
Your love keeps me wishing
My heart keeps me broke

Baby, don't you cry
'Cause I got it all figured out
You always make me sad
But that's what true love is all about
Rivers never fill the oceans
But oceans always feel
The waters reaching deep inside them
I guess they always will

Love's a constant mission
Truer words were never spoke
My love it keeps you wishing
My heart, it keeps me broke

Love's a constant mission
Truer words were never spoke
My love it keeps you wishing
My heart, it keeps me broke

Mirrors and smoke (it keeps you wishing)
My heart keeps me broke

Mirrors and smoke
Mirrors and smoke
