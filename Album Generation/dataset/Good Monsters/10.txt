Catch the rain empty hands
Save the children from their lands
Wash the darkness from their skin
Heroes from the West
We don't know you, we know best
But this is not a test

You treat me like I'm blind
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears
The light gives heat

It's not the way to light their way
Poison holes in empty fields
Oh, how good it feels
Lower-class, understate
Empty promise, empty plate

You treat me like I'm blind (You treat me like I'm blind)
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears, your fears
The light gives heat, gives heat

You treat me like I'm blind
Setting fires around houses on the hill
But light gives heat
You segregate my mind
Burning crosses from your fears
The light gives heat

Will you teach us how to love?
To see the things you see
Walk the road you walk
Feel the pain that you feel
At your feet I kneel
I want to see you shine
See your light not mine
'Cause light gives heat
Your light gives heat
