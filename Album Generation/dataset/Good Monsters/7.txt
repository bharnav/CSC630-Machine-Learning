Shoot a dream in your arm and sleep away
It's not the stuff that kills you that keeps your life at bay
Every crash pulls you in reach
Of a watershed of signal flares that cover your beach

These are just placebos to make us feel all right
Illusions in our pockets make our feathers float us high
For a second I thought I saw your eyelids rise
A moment something restless caught you by surprise
Surprise, surprise

We are so beautiful when we sleep
Hearts of gold and eyes so deep, deep, deep
But love won't cure the chaos
And hope won't hide the loss
And peace is not the heroine that shouts above the cause
And love is wild for reasons
And hope though short in sight
Might be the only thing that wakes you by surprise
Surprise, surprise

Dream little one
See the world just begun

Love is wild for reasons
Hope though short in sight
Might be the only thing that brings you back to life
For a moment I thought I saw your eyelids rise
Surprise, surprise
