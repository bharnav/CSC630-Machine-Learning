Ten long years
Seem like thirty-five
Cause everything you said
Turned out to be a lie
I was sweet to you
I didn't even have to try
Now I look into your eyes
All I see is the other guy

All that talkin'
You ain't got nothin' to say
Well I can tell you
It's time that had to pay
You're gonna pay
You're gonna be sorry some day
That'll while I'm walkin'
Tired of you talkin' down to me
Baby I'm walkin'
Walkin' away from you and me
I wanna be free
I wanna be free from you and me

We were good toghether
That was long ago
Before you left the high road
Took off down the below
You knew what you were doin'
I didn't even have to see
You can fool me twice girl
I think it's shame on me

Day by day
Sun goes down in flames
All that you can say
Is I'm the one to blame
It's all the same
Just play your little girl game
That'll while I'm walkin'
Tired of you talkin' down to me
Baby I'm walkin'
Walkin' away from you and me
I wanna be free
I wanna be free from you and me

That'll while I'm walkin'
Tired of you talkin' down to me
Baby I'm walkin'
Yeh, Finnaly found the key
You know I'm walkin'
Strollin' out the door
It's all gone-babe
And I won't be back no more
I gotta be free
I gotta be free from you and me
