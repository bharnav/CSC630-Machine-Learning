You know it doesn't
Really matter
That I always seem
To forget

Where I put my keys
My hat, and my coat

Searching for your sunglasses
And you lost the remote

Did you forget the heat?
Cause I'm gettin' chills

Are the lights really going out?
Did we forget to pay the bills?

Why?
Does it really matter?

Cause when the lights go out
It only gets better

When you hold me tight
And tell me it's all right
Then the rest doesn't really matter

I guess it doesn't
Really matter
That we ain't been ridin' high
And keeping up with the Jones
Never been to Paris
I don't care if we go, no
We'll get around the world
Right here at home

Now the car won't start
And the paint is peeling
So the dishes are stackin' up
They can wait, I've got that feelin'!

Why?
Does it really matter?
We can dim the lights
And put on Clyde McPhatter (1)

Now baby, hold me tight
Tell me it's all right
Then the rest doesn't really matter

Why?
Does it really matter?

Cause when the lights go out
It only gets better

Now baby, hold me tight
And tell me it's all right
Then the rest doesn't really . . 

Why?
Does it really matter?

Cause when the lights go out
It only gets better

Why?
Does it really matter?

Why?
Does it really matter, baby?

Why?
