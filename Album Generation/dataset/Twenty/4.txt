One last time
And I'll be free
One last time
You'll have your hooks in me

Cause I'm about to lose it
My force of habit

I want to see you burn
All the way down
I want to see your ashes
All over the ground

Then I will know
That I can't forget about
My last regret

The price is too high
For what your giving
So I'll stop being the fool
And go on living

One is not enough
Two is too much
Too much for me

I want to see you burn
All the way down
I want to see your ashes
All over the ground

Then I will know
That I can't forget about
My last regret

No more suffering
No more sorrow
Live for today
I'll be here tomorrow

I want to see you burn
All the way down
I want to see your ashes
All over the ground

Then I will know
That I can't forget about
My last regret
My regret
My regret

No more suffering
No more sorrow
Live for today
I'll be here tomorrow

My regret
My regret!

My regret...
