Have a seat and I'll tell you a tale
It wasn't that long ago..
About a guy who turned out to be a cheater got the heater
So the story goes:

He tried the playboy-thing on two friends
Thinking that they'd never know
They say he got caught in a trap and it snapped
He's not around anymore...

Poor Johnny

He came home looking cool one day
Just wasn't lucky to come out that way
Once from the left... then from the right
They took him down, late that night

Now everyone in town knew he always played around
But not a word was said
All the money and the clothes
And the cars that he drove just kept his ego fed

To his friends he was king
Cause he thought of everything
Except his number one

She had the kids and the house
While he was always out
Leaving his homework undone

Poor Johnny
He came home looking cool one day
Just wasn't lucky to come out that way
Once from the left... then from the right
They took him down, late that night

Then one day his luck ran out
When number two found a number and called his house
Word on the street is that they talked all night
They had to teach him a lesson
They had to make things right

Poor Johnny
He came home looking cool one day
Just wasn't lucky to come out that way
Once from the left... then from the right
They took him down, late that night

Poor Johnny
He came home looking cool one day
Just wasn't lucky to come out that way
Once from the left... then from the right
They took him down, late that night

Poor Johnny
Poor Johnny
Poor Johnny
Poor Johnny
Poor Johnny
