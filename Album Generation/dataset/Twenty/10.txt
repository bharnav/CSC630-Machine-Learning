The night life
Has never been easy
Has never been easy for me

The price I've paid
Has been so very dear
Some of my friends are . . 
No longer here

Now I'm two steps from the end
Last door down the hall
That's where you'll find me

It's gonna be a slow fade from here on out
Just like night into day
I can see all
That's happened
And there's nothing much left
To say

Now I'm two steps from the end
Last door down the hall
That's where you'll find me

Hey!
You can bang your drum
Bang your drum lowly
Go ahead and play your horn
Slowly
I know, you think that it's all over
But tonight I'll be back
Cause I know that's where it's at

Now I'm two steps from the end
Last door down the hall
That's where you'll find me

That's where you'll find me
