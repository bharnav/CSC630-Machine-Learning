You threw out my clothes
The things i own
And locked the door

I guess i crossed the line
Wasted your time
I had to go

If you've made other plans i understand
The fool i am
It doesn't show
No,No

Old friends just pass me by
They seem to hide
Im not alive

I tried you on the phone
He says your gone
Don't call no more

I've tried everything
I even sang
You gave back the ring
And laughed at me
But it doesn't show
No, No. (ooooo)

It doesn't show
