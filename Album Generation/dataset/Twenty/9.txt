Have I told you
Lately that I love ya ?
Well, if I didn't darling
I'm sorry
Did I reach out
And hold ya in my loving arms
O, O , When you needed me

Now I realise that you need love too
And I'll spend my life making up to you

Oh Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burdens that lovers bear
And have I done the little simple things
To show you
Just how much I care

Oo, I've been working for you
Doing all I can
But work all the time, didn't make me a man

Oo Oo, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you somehow Baby

I forgot to be your lover
I'm so sorry
I forgot to be your lover
Gonna make it up to you somehow Baby !
