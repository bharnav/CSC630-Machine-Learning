When you're used up
Where do you go
Soldier
Mother dry your eyes
There's no need to cry
I'm not a boy
It's what I signed up for

When you're used up
Where do you go
Soldier
I can't take the heat
And I hardly sleep anymore
What'd we come here for

Standing out here in the desert
Trying to protect an oil line
I'd really like to do my job but
This ain't the country that I had in mind
They call this a war on terror
I see a lot of civilians dying
Mothers, sons, fathers and daughters
Not to mention some friends of mine
Some friends of mine

Was supposed to leave last week
Promises they don't keep anymore
Got to fight the rich man's war

When you're used up
Where do you go
Soldier
Late in 2004
Comes a knock at the door
It's no surprise
Mother dry your eyes

Mother don't you cry, no, no
Someone told you a lie
Yes they did, why
Mother don't you cry, oh no
Mother don't you cry

When you're used up
Where do you go
Soldier
Where do you go
