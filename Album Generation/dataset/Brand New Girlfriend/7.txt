Every night i go to bed
I hear a voice in my head
And I go crazy
Thinking bout the words that you said
And how you had some place you'd like to take me
So baby take me

It's your call, your move
Oh, girl it's up to you 'cause
I know you know
I'm in your hands
I'm so in love with everything you do
So don't lead me wrong
Lead me on

Now we're standing at your front door
And as I turn to go you touch me, mmmm
As you take my hand you
You ask me if I will be staying
Said I've been waiting on

It's your call, your move
Oh, girl it's up to you 'cause
I know you know
I'm in your hands
I'm so in love with everything you do
So don't lead me wrong
Girl, lead me

Lead me on to something new
Something here tonight, baby you
Baby I will follow with you

You turn the lights down low and
As we're dancing slow you whisper

It's your call, your move
Baby it's up to you 'cause
I know you know
I'm in your hands
I'm so in love with everything you do
So don't lead me wrong
Lead me on

This love is so strong
Lead me on

Lead me on

Mmm

Mmm

Lead me on
