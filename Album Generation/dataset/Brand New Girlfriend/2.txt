Well I know
You know
I don't know
How long I can wait
You touch me, you move me
And that's almost
Too much for me to take

I try to be patient, I know you're worth the while
But my sanity is tested every time I see you smile

Now you can't rush a good thing
No love before it's time
And anybody fine as you's heard every pick-up line
I swear that I respect you for what hasn't happened yet
But could you hurry up every chance you get

You know what you do when you do
What you're doing now
You tempt me, you tease me
With that "I ain't done this look but I know how

I'll be worth your wait babe, I swear to you it's true
When you finally let me do for you what you won't let me do

Now you can't rush a good thing
No love before it's time
And anybody fine as you's heard every pick-up line
I swear that I respect you for what hasn't happened yet
But could you hurry up every chance you get

Would you like to slow dance?
You can use my shoulder for your head
Would you mind me feeling
What I feel your beating heart just said

Now you can't rush a good thing
No love before it's time
And anybody fine as you's heard every pick-up line
I swear that I respect you for what hasn't happened yet
