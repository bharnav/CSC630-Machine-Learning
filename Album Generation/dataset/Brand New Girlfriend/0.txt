[Verse 1: Steve Holy]
She said, "I need sometime to find myself
I need a little space to think
Maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way to fast for me."
So, I, I picked up what was left of my pride
And I put on my walking shoes
And I got up on that high road
And I did what any gentleman would do..
I, um...

[Chorus: Holy]
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, I think I'm on to somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend

[Verse 2: Holy]
I love it when she calls me butter cup
Laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops and tosses me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When I get hungry, she takes me out
I ride the shotgun like a Shih Tzu hound
My tails a waggin', my tounge's hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...

[Chorus: Holy]
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
