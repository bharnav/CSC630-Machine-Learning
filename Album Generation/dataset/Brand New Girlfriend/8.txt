Your blue eyes
Are looking at me tonight
In a brand new light
What a surprise
There was a time
I'd given anything
For you to look at me this way
But as your friend I've gotta say
Maybe we should wait

When you say you're over him, I wanna believe it but we both know
It's only the lonely talking
Wanting me to keep on holding you this way, baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talking

It would be easy for me
To lie in your arms tonight
Oh but in the moonlight
Would it be right

Cause I want all of you
And not just a part of you so tell me

It's not just the lonely talking
Wanting you to keep on holding you this way baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talking

Baby we've got time
To make this thing right
But right here right now tonight

It's only the lonely talking
Wanting me to keep on holding you this way, baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talking

It's only the lonely talking
Wanting me to keep on holding you this way, baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talking
