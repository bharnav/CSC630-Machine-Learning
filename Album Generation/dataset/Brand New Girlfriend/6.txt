Tired of channel surfing
El camino ain't working
Monday night an i'm hurting for company
Bummed a ride to the hideaway
I'm the only guy in the place
Bored silly, wasn't gonna stay
Then she walks in, heaven sent
And it occurs to me

What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue
Is it luck or a twist of fate
Doesn't really matter either way
It's a good night
A good night to be lonely

Dollars worth of quarters
Played some songs and ordered
One for me and one for her
As I tipped my hat

Said that she felt restless
Just moved here from Texas
That's when I suggested
Maybe she could dance with me
She said "thought you'd never ask"

What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue
Is it luck or a twist of fate
Doesn't really matter either way
It's a good night
A good night to be lonely

Shes following I'm leading
Feels just like I'm dreaming

What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue
Is it luck or a twist of fate
Doesn't really matter either way
It's a good night, a real good night
It's a good night
A good night to be lonely
