Come on rain
Pour on down
Flood that runway
Shut 'er down

She's in Dallas waitin' on a plain
Don't let her leave
Come one rain

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time
Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

Don't let your storm clouds break
Like my heart if I'm too late
One hour is all I'm asking for
Come On Rain, Let it Pour

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time

Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

And I here you come
You heard my prayer
Give it all you got, she's all I got
And I'm almost there

Unleash your fury thorugh the sky
Let your clouds explode go on and cry
Your tears of mercy give me time
Unlock your winds and let 'em blow
Let your lightning strike, let your
Thunder roll
Heaven help me stop that plain
Come On rain

Heaven help me stop that plain
Come on rain
Come on rain
Come on rain
