I can't believe I told you if you ever go through with walking out that open door
I would be OK but I must have been insane, I won't be saying taht no more
Baby don't go, baby don't go

I miss the little chances to do some more romancing and make you feel like a million bucks
I've taken you for granted, granted I've been blind but my eyes have opened up
Baby don't go, baby don't go

Don't you wallk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay baby come back
You know I want you now
I was wrong baby don't go
I wanna hold, hold hold you tight
Do whatever it takes make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so
Baby don't go

Clouds are overhead, a storm is moving in, what a bad time to be on the road
It's a poor idea with the fuel prices high and your gas tank is really low
So baby don't go, baby don't go

Don't you wallk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay baby come back
You know I want you now
I was wrong baby don't go
I wanna hold, hold hold you tight
Do whatever it takes make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so

Don't you wallk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay baby come back

I wanna hold, hold hold you tight
Do whatever it takes make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so
Baby don't go

Baby don't go
Baby don't go
