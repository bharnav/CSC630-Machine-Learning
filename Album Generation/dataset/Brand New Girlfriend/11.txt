On My way home I had to tune out the radio
Too much news that shook me to my soul
I had to reach her right now, cry out loud and let you know
That the only thing worth living for is to learn to love you more

When you fall, in my arms, I hold on a little tighter
Let my heart be open wider
And never let a chance slip by
Say the things left unsaid
So I don't look back in sorrow
If I knew you'd be gone tomorrow
What could I do different tonight?

I promise you I won't turn down any more dances
I've been a fool to think I'd always find you here
No I thank you god for this moment I've been granted
To stand up on a mountain and shout
So you won't have any doubt

When you fall, in my arms, I hold on a little tighter
Let my heart be open wider
And never let a chance slip by
Say the things left unsaid
So I don't look back in sorrow
If I knew you'd be gone tomorrow
What could I do different tonight?

Oh oh ooo
When you fall, When you fall in my arms I hold on a little tighter
Let my heart be open wider
And never let a chance slip by
Say the things left unsaid
So I don't look back in sorrow
If I knew you'd be gone tomorrow
What could I do different tonight?

What could I do different tonight?
What could I do different tonight?

Oh baby

What could I do different

Oh
