They got married on a mountaintop in Denver
Just a preacher and a few of their best friends
They said I do, and then he gently kissed her
He whispered if I die tonight, I'll die a happy man

They made a lot of memories together
They came back to that mountain every year
With his head in her lap, he'd smile and tell her
"Baby if I go before you, bring me right back here"

On a cliff in Colorado
The story ends right where it all began
On a cliff in Colorado
With tears in her eyes
She said her last goodbye
And let his ashes fly into the wind

Some say she heard his voice softly whisper

And followed it right out into the cold
They all say that no one went up with her
But at the top they found two sets of footprints in the snow

On a cliff in Colorado
The story ends right where it all began
On a cliff in Colorado
With tears in her eyes
She said her last goodbye
And stepped right back into his arms again

On a cliff in Colorado
The story ends right where it all began
On a cliff in Colorado
With tears in her eyes
She said her last goodbye
And stepped right back into his arms again
