[Verse 1]
I could've been working' overtime
Or at home trying' to make that truck run right
Instead of wading' out in that stream
All day long barely catching' a thing
Just me and dad
I'm glad he talked me in to that

[Chorus]
It was time well wasted
And there's no way I trade a few more dollars in my pocket I could've spent
For a day I'll never forget
No, I didn't get a thing done
But I sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making'
And I count it all as time well wasted

[Verse 2]
Those leaves were a foot deep in the yard
And 'wash me' was written all over the car
But watching' movies all day with you
Wasn't on my list of things to do
But we laid on that couch
Girl, we never left the house

[2nd Chorus]
It was time well wasted
And there's no way I trade a few more things that I could've crossed off my list
For a day I'll never forget
No, I didn't get a thing done
But I sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making'
And I count it all as time well wasted

[Bridge]
This world spins too fast if you let it
There's always one more thing to do
But looking' back I never have regretted
Taking off early or calling in sick
Or loving' away a Sunday afternoon

[Chorus]
It was time well wasted
And there's no way I trade a few more dollars or things crossed off my list
For a day I'll never forget
No I didn't get a thing done
But I sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making'
And I count it all as time well wasted

[Outro]
I count it all as time well wasted
