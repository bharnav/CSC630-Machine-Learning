[Verse 1]
When I looked out today
And saw that the sky was gray
I thought about the way
You loved days like this

[Verse 2]
And driving in to town
It really started coming down
Bringing me back around
To all that I miss

It feels like it's raining you
It feels like it's raining you

[Verse 3]
I didn't even run inside
Or worry about staying dry
Besides there nowhere I can hide
These feeling now

Running down my face
Takes me to another place
I can't think of a better way to drown

[Verse 4]
It feels like it's raining you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's raining you

[Verse 5]
If I had my way
It would do this every day
I would never see the sun
Because the closest I get
To holding you again
Is every time that sky opens up

[Verse 6]
It feels like it's raining you
I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew
It feels like it's raining you
It feels like it's raining you
