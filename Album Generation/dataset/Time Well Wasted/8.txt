[Verse 1]
Seasons come and seasons go
One day sun, the next day snow
Flowers die and flowers grow
But love is never-ending

[Verse 2]
You can't kill it with goodbye
It always finds a place to hide
Inside your heart for your whole life
Love is never-ending

[Chorus]
When the lights have all gone down
It'll still be hanging 'round
Even when you think it's lost, it can still be found
When every memory has been made
And the pages start to fade
And every prayer you ever prayed is heaven bound
When you think the ride is over
You're back at the beginning
Love is never-ending

[Verse 3]
When a man and woman start growing old
The fire of passion may grow cold
But what they got still warms their soul
Love is never-ending

[Chorus]

[bridge]
It keeps going on and on
Long after we're all gone away

[Verse 4]
Time may change what you believe
But one day the truth will set you free
Just have faith and you will see
Love is never-ending
Love is never-ending
