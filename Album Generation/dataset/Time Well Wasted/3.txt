[Verse 1]
When a freight train jumps off a track
And rolls down my road
And it's summer time in Texas
And they're playing in the snow
When politicians everywhere stop telling lies
And only state the facts
Right then, that's when
I'll take you back

[Verse 2]
Let's say I get bucked off a bull and fall and hit my head
And then I get amnesia and forget the things you said
I lose my better judgment and I take up smoking crack
Right then, that's when
I'll take you back

[Chorus]
Go on keep trying
Come on keep calling
You know I like it
When you come crawling
It's like music
To hear you bawling
Waa, waa, waa, waa, waa

[Verse 3]
When Donald Trump takes a part time job parking cars
When Clint Eastwood does ballet in a big pink leotard
And a donkey wins the Derby as he takes his victory lap
Right then, that's when
I'll take you back

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The day that old morning sun rises in the west
And they pass a law in L.A. banning artificial breasts
When cars can run on water, gasoline and oil ain't worth jack
Right then, that's when
I'll take you back

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's like music
To hear you bawling
Waa, waa, waa, waa, waa
