[Verse 1]
A gun goes off in a far off city
A siren wails right here at home
Well sometimes life ain't all that pretty
When you're watching it all alone

[Verse 2]
You build a wall around your feelings
Just another heart afraid to break
And you don't wanna let me in cause really
What difference can I make?

[Chorus]
I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours

[Verse 3]
So let Jesus look down on this mess
And let the powers that be just fuss and fight
Cause everyone needs to pick their battles and
We all realize

[Chorus]
That I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours

[Verse 4]
And every time you light a flame
You just get burned and you feel like
It's all in vain
You feel like
You need to learn that no one's gonna save you
No, no one's gonna save you
But I'm standing here
My heart's on my sleeve
Never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna leave you

[Outro]
Baby, that's for sure
Oh I can't change the world
But I can change yours
I bet I can change
Yours
