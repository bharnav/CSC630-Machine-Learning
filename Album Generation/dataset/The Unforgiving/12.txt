[Verse]
I'm on the road of broken dreams and I need to know why
Seek the truth through lies to be my guide
I'm in a world of doubt and trust, can't deny
I lost my way here in this quest, can't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe what's happening
I don't know what to say
I can't believe I've lived to see this day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And I don't wanna live in fear but I can't change what's right
But I know we'll be living in a lie

[Verse]
While we're hanging on the cross when I put the nails in
It's time to choose, you know that we believe it
You say you understand it all, try and smile
If only I could see it's true somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't believe what's happening
I don't know what to say
And what I wouldn't give to change our faith

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And I don't wanna live in fear but I can't change what's right
But I know we'll be living in a lie

[Bridge]
And I tried so hard to hold on
But I keep on falling
And no matter how hard I run
I just keep returning
And I'm back to where I started from

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
I don't wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
I just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And I don't wanna live in fear but I can't change what's right
But I know we'll be living in a lie
