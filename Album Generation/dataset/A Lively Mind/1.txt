Just another victim baby, left for dead
Watch you burn the bodies in your haste to get ahead
Spread your lies (Spread your lies)
Spread your lies (Spread your lies)
No compromise

You want it all - Everything
No compromise (No compromise)
You need it all - Everything
No compromise (No compromise)

In another vision you were lost for days (No compromise)
Never learned the language. Easier to walk away
Spread your lies (spread your lies)
Spread your lies (Spread your lies)
Spread your lies (Spread your lies)
Spread your lies (Spread your lies)

You want it all - Everything
No compromise (No compromise)
You need it all - Everything
No compromise (No compromise)

If you want it all. Gotta let it go
If you want it all. Let love flow (Let love flow)
If you want it all (Let it Flow) Gotta let it go
If you want it all, let it flow (Let love flow)
