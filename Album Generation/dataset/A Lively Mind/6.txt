Time to say goodbye
It's time to make a move
Nothing left to hide
Everything to lose
There is not a day I wake
Not a step that I take
When I don't see your ghost
I think you should know
It's time for both of us
To put aside our past
We're looking forward now
Strong enough to last
There's not a night asleep
Not a dream that I keep
If I don't see your face
It's you I can't replace

You're running through my mind
(baby all the time)
It's not over yet
Deep inside my soul
(this I know for sure)
It's not over yet

You're running through my mind
(baby all the time)
It's not over yet
Deep inside my soul
(this I know for sure)
It's not over yet

Every single night I dream of love
Every single day I'm thinking love
With every thought of you I'm still in love
Don't say goodbye cuz it's not over yet
Every night, every day
Not over yet
Every night, every day

You're running through my mind
(baby all the time)
It's not over yet
Deep inside my soul
(this I know for sure)
It's not over yet
