No it never crossed my mind
You might try to hide from me
You would set the place on fire
With your long and broken wrecking shriek

Always aiming for the truth
Sometimes missing just one word
Something really shaken loose
Look around to the see the cities burn

It's just the way I'm feelin'
Lost without the meanin'
The love has disappeared without a trace
It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
That hide my face
It's just the way I'm feelin'

You were never forced to choose
I tried to keep you safe from harm
And now there's nothing left to lose
You've gone and torn my world apart
All that's left for me is you
A shadow of my former self

It's just the way I'm feelin'
Lost without the meanin'
The love has disappeared without a trace
It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
That hide my face
It's just the way I'm feelin'
Ost without the meanin'
The love has disappeared without a trace
It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
That hide my face
It's just the way I'm feelin'
