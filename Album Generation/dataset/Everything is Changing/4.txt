Frozen, older, I walk the streets alone
Further, falling, I stare into the cold
I wake up, with you next to me
I wake up, totally free
Your actions, speak louder than words
I wake up, with you next to me
Faster, closer, I run towards the light
Can you help me to leave this all behind?
I wake up, with you next to me
I wake up, totally free
Your actions, speak louder than words
I wake up, with you next to me
