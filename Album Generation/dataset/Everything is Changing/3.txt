God I feel, I think I should be all that I can be
Dude I like, I hope we can get together someday
Since the stars in the sky and the clouds aligned
I have realized you should
Let me lead the way, oh oh
Let me lead the way, oh oh
Take me home
Fingers crossed my obsession with you is tameable
Best thing for me is to be in your grip before night falls
Since the stars in the sky and the clouds aligned
I have realized you should
So alone
Give me some kind of understanding
All alone
Give me even the slightest sedation
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
