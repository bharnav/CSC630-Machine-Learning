My friend, an angel in disguise
We live, in a world that's full of lies
You are, always on your own
Even so
You're holding out a lifeline
You're holding on to love
You'll never give up hope
When all we do is run around in circles
And everyone is searching for the answers
You close your eyes, you're ready to start over
And again, you leave the past behind
My friend, the comfort of your home
Your hands, will sit me down and rest
You always will
Hold out a lifeline
You're holding on to love
You'll never give up hope
When all we do is run around in circles
And everyone is searching for the answers
You close your eyes, you're ready to start over
And again, and again
Keeping me warm
Even the coldest days won't scare you away
I reach for your hands
Don't you let me slip away
Just hold on to me
For one more day
When all we do is run around in circles
And everyone is searching for the answers
You close your eyes, you're ready to start over
And again, and again
You leave the past behind
