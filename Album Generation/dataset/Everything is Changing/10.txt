Bitter and dis-eased
Slowly you come undone
You won't take me down
The time has come to let you out
It's too late, ya made me wait
Ya might realise, ya paralyse me
Oh, it's insane you have just turned a cold shoulder
Once there was a time
You moved me, you drove me wild
Now you just bring me down
The time has come to let you out
It's too late, ya made me wait
Ya might realise, ya paralyse me
Oh, it's insane you have just turned your back to me
You're letting me go
Don't let go
Don't let me go
Fingers crossed, I got lost
I'll come home, to my own
Sanity, you have to be out
Of your mind
To let me slide
I see you go
Out the door
My heart's on the floor
While you should be gone
Ya paralyse me
It's too late, ya made me wait
Ya might realise, ya paralyse me
Oh, it's insane you have just turned a cold shoulder
Don't let go
Don't let me go
