Hey turn around I was just in the middle of a sentence
Hey you what were you thinking not to grant me the time of day
If you stay, I'll wait
But you know if I gotta go, I'm gonna take you with me
If you stay, if you stay, I will wait
I'm friend, your confidant
I'm there in times of trouble
But you take me for granted
It's time to snap out of your dream
If you stay, I'll wait
But you know if I gotta go, I'm gonna take you with me
If you stay, if you stay, I will wait
Wait up, didn't you see me?
Look up, haven't you noticed me, trying to be
Your perfect friend?
If you stay, if you stay, I will wait
