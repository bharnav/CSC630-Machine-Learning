Look in my eyes, you saw me here while I was gone
You know me well, you know I'd make it all along
Look in my heart
You found your way through all my tears
You made me smile
You made the dark clouds disappear
Hope for me, pray for me
One day I'll be fine
Dance with me, play with me
Never fall behind
Walk with me, I have to show you what is mine
Talk to me, I want to learn as much as I can
It must be hard
But there is just no other way
You make me smile
You make the dark clouds go away
Hope for me, pray for me
One day I'll be fine
Dance with me, play with me
Never fall behind
