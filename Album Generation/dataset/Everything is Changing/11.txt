Here I am
A thousand miles away from you
I understand, I will have to do without you
In the dark, forces run me down
The end, in the corner of my eye

A thousand miles away from you
A thousand miles

Honesty is following me around
I have to do what is right
I fall down, my face against the ground

I bow down

A thousand miles away from you
I understand, I will have to do without you
In the dark, forces run me down
The end, in the corner of my eye

I believe he'll find love
In the kindest of gods
I can see he'll find home
In the greatest of kingdoms

A thousand miles away from you

He'll find love
In the kindest of gods
