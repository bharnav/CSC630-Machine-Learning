My eyes search like a bird's scanning the city
Ants race while I am in slow-motion
Where is my place?
Everything is changing
Nobody is waiting, I see
Clouds fold around me like a coat keeping me cozy
I realize I have to come down
These roots they will cure me
Everything is changing
Nobody is waiting
Everything is changing
Nobody is waiting, I see
False hope raises in me a dark sense of violence
Your love is worth every hour
I lay down in silence
