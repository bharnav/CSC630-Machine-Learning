The best is yet to come
But only if we run
The race has just begun
We seek a better life
But only if we die
We'll find the deep blue water
I can't wait, hurry up, can't take a break
Can't be late, hurry up and go
Don't you slow, slow me down boy!
You try, you live, you love, you die
You start, you wonder why
You hold on to the past
You break, you go ahead and fake
You realise there's so much more at stake
One should not wait
Be kind, be good, be smart, be true
Be bold, be loud, be you
I'll race you to the top
I honestly believe, we'll conquer this dis-ease
If only we could love
I can't wait, hurry up, can't take a break
Can't be late, hurry up and go
Don't you slow, slow me down boy!
I'll never know for sure
What is taking me this long to learn
I'll never understand
But it feels to me like coming home
I can't wait, hurry up, can't take a break
Can't be late, hurry up and go
Don't you slow, slow me down!
