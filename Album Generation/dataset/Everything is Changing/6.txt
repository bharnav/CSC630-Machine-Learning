My boy I loved you since you opened up your eyes
My boy the steps you take, I'm never far behind
How did you know that I was the one, perfect for the job
And how you showed the one and only truth about myself
Let the rain fall on me
'Cause underneath the sky
I'll be there, rain or shine
Even though I don't have all the answers
I would go to the end of the world for you
My boy I see your joy, I feel your doubt
But did you know that I am the one to always help you out
Let the rain fall on me
'Cause underneath the sky
I'll be there, rain or shine
Even though I don't have all the answers
I would go to the end
And even though I'm crazy for you my boy
You'll be fine, rain or shine
Even though I don't have all the answers
I would go to the end of the world for you
