I feel your heart it beats against
The side of my face
I'm holding on the memory
Of our embrace
I see your smile and I'll never want it to fade again
You find your way trough hide-aways
In the back of your mind
Let's hope I find the energy
I'll never deny
I feel alive, you saved my heart
I lost control
I feel alive, you saved my mind
I wanted you to know
I'm holding on the fairytale
Of our embrace
I feel alive, you saved my heart
I lost control
I feel alive, you saved my mind
I wanted you to know
