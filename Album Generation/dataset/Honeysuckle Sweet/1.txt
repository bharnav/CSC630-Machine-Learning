Last night I put the top down
And drove to the edge of town
A part of me just kept on goin' when I turned around
Why did I turn around?

Every day it's more confusing wonderin' where I stand
The things you say and the things you're doing
Never go hand in hand
I don't understand

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go

It's gonna take more than a cold shoulder
To make me walk away
Let's get it on or get it over, what have you got to say?
What have you got to say?

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go

I don't know why you wanna keep me guessin'
I try to keep holding on
Just tell me what I want to hear or please just tell me no
Baby, make me stay or make me go
Yeah, baby, make me stay or make me go
