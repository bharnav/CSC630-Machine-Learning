Bare feet on southern soil
Burning up in the August heat
Tall grass and butterflies
We're all praying for breeze

I'm going down to the river
Gonna wade into my knees
Rest a while there on herd bank
Under the cypress trees

There's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet, honeysuckle sweet

In the evening on the back porch
You can see the stars like you've never seen
Patsy singing that sweet old song
I'm dancing on my daddy's feet

Oh, I was growing fast
I was restless as the wind
Too young to know that once you leave
You'll never be the same again

But there's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet, honeysuckle sweet

I try to reach back in time
And touch those summer days
But as each year passes by
I feel them starting to fade
Oh they're fading away, yeah, yeah

But there's a back rout in my mind
Taking me back there every time
And it's all mine it waits for me
If only in a daydream

Cause it's long gone and it's in my past
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be
Honeysuckle sweet

Come on wind won't you take me home
I want to see how that grass has grown
Dirty water won't you wash me clean
Honeysuckle sweet

Ooh, I smell it on the vine
I got to taste it one more time
It's all coming back to me and it's
Sweet, it's honeysuckle sweet

So sweet, so sweet
So sweet, so sweet
Honeysuckle sweet
