Time after time, I've turned away from you
When all I had to do was surrender to your love
You've seen me stumble, you've watched me fall
And though I heard you call, I just wasn't strong enough
But there's an emptiness inside without you in my life:
Lord, I hope you hear my prayer tonight

Won't you blind my eyes when all I see is temptation
Break my stride when I'm runnin' from the truth
An' tie my hands when I reach out with desire
Go on an' do what you must do
Whatever you must take me through till I turn to you
Yeah

I know that others fall down on their knees for mercy
But you may have to hurt me before I see the light
'Cause I've grown as far as I can go by myself:
I need your help if I'm gonna get it right
Tired of strugglin' every day
I wanna know the way
So now the only prayer I wanna pray:

Is just blind my eyes when all I see is temptation
Break my stride when I'm runnin' from the truth
An' tie my hands when I reach out with desire
Go on an' do what you must do
Whatever you must put me through till I turn to you
Yeah

Blind my eyes;
Break my stride;
Whatever you want to be denied;
Whatever you must do
An' tie my hands;
Ignore my demands;
Build a wall that stands so high, I can't get through
Till I turn to you, yeah
Until I turn to you
'Cause I wanna turn to you
Oh, yeah
Oooh
Oooh
