I've tried everything I know
But I still see you everywhere I go
On the sidewalk by the park where we first kissed
I can still feel every touch and tenderness

Everywhere I go, everything I see
Everything I do, you are here with me

Everything I touch, every sound I hear
Everywhere I turn, you are there
You are there everywhere I go

Don't say that time won't right all wrongs, no
'Cause I don't have the strength to last that long
In the shadows where the broken heart, it cries
You will find me lost in memories I can't hide from

Everywhere I go, everything I see
Everything I do, you are here with me

Everything I touch, every sound I hear
Everywhere I turn, you are there
You are there everywhere I go

Everywhere I go, everything I see
Everything I do, you are here with me

Everything I touch, every sound I hear
Everything I feel, you are there now

Everywhere I go
Everywhere, baby
God, You're everywhere I go
