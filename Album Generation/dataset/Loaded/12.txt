Always that smile that brings you down
Oh, and When I think that it's only just begun
Smiling faces are not forgotten cause
I love you

When I think of all the things we've done
Oh, and I know that its just only begun
Oh, Smiling faces not forgotten because
I love you

Just for a little while
Oh, baby, just to see you smile
Just for a little while

Oh, when I think of all the things that we've done
And I believe that it's only just begun
Oh, Smiling faces, not forgotten because
I love you X4
