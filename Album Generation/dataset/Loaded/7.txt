[Chorus 1]
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa

[Verse 1]
I found a reason to keep living
Oh and the reason dear is you
Oh I found a reason to keep singing
Oh and the reason dear is you
Oh I do believe
If you don't like things you leave
For some place you've never gone before

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Honey, I found a reason to keep living
And you know the reason dear it's you
And I've walked down life's lonely highways
Hand in hand with myself
And I realized
How many paths have crossed between us

[Chorus 2][2x]
Oh I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better that what came before

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
And you'd better come, come, come, come to me
Better Come, come, come to me
Yeah come, come, come, come to me
Pa pa pa pa pa pa
