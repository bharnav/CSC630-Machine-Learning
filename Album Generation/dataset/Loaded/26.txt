[Verse 1]
Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
He knocked the shirt right of his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
He walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
And threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said:

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nothing at all
Oh, sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Say a word for Polly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
Just like a cat she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She ain't got nothing at all
With every day she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does she says:

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet nuthin'
You know She ain't got nothing at all
[Woe, oh] sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nothing at all
Oh, let me hear you
(guitar solo)

[Verse 3]
Oh, say a word, say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all, not a thing
And not a shirt, shirt on his back
No, he ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger
He walks with his head to the ground
He took the shoes, took the shoes from his feet, from his feet
And threw the poor boy out into the street
And then he said:

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet sweet nuthin'
She ain't got, she ain't got, she ain't got nothing at all
Sweet sweet sweet sweet nuthin'
She ain't got
Sweet Sweet nothing ...
Oh, let me hear you
(guitar solo)
She ain't got nothing at all ...
