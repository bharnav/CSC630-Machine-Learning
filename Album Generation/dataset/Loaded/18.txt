Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Crashing in

Earth is a hollow hair, part of a bigger head
It nearly drives me crazy
In the harmoniums
They have small rubber ducks
Recording all our actions

But here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea, down by the sea
Down by the sea

Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the shore
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Crashing in

Insects are evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son
I never get things done
Made up mostly of water

And here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea

Here comes the waves
Here comes the waves
Here comes the waves
Here comes the waves
Here comes the waves
