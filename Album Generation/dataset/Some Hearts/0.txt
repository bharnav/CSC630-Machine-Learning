[Verse 1]
Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out and I‘m gonna take it

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don’t kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Bridge]
She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin’ no more time
Wasted
