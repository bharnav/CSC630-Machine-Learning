[Verse 1]
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 2]
When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 3]
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
Oh, yes I do
I wanna be inside your heaven
