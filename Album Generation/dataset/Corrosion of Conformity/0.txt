Well I been hunting on the I-10 with Jesus for a liar
And watched an ancient man use a gun to retire
I seen the wall fall down and crush the old
So now everybody's hungry but they'd rather be cold

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Before we lose it all in time
What's deserved always gets served

Cause we stick therefore we can
Cause we stick therefore we can
Cause we stick therefore we can
Break down endtime
Hey fool haven't you heard heaven's not over flowing

And I been to a seance for the ku klux klan
I've seen a brother kill another with his own bare hand
I seen your rising son fall in your mama's eye
And now the cop's got a medal but he calls it a prize

Let it go let it go let it go
Before we lose it all in time
What's deserved always gets served

Cause we stick therefore we can
Cause we stick therefore we can
Cause we stick therefore we can
Break down end time
Hey fool haven't you heard heaven's not overflowing

You know the rules only apply on the witness stand
At that you never get in trouble if you stick with your plan
That's why I'm livin' for the day like a necromancer
Cause when you go your gonna take the pain back stabber

Stick me & let it go...
