I've been looking for answers to set you free
Black are the reasons you gave to me

Never, never look back
Just move, move ahead
You were lucky, friend
You could be dead

Ignore the future or bury your head in the sand
It's a two-bit fantasy that the man in your
Head demands
You can say it with a vengeance - you'll be
Back from the grave

Time waits for no one - this has to be true
Mine ran out a long time ago - there's nothing
Nothing you can do

Never...

Now you're living with a burden that rests
Upon your mind
You were lying to yourself 'cos you were
Afraid of what you'd find
You can say it with a vengeance - you'll be
Back from the grave
We'll be waiting a long, long time before
You're ever saved

Drifting so far away - things seem so strange
Thought you could escape - believed things
Would change

Never...

Ignore the future or bury your head in the sand
It's a two-bit fantasy that the man in your
Head demands
Now you're living with a burden that rests
Upon your mind
You were lying to yourself 'cos you were
Afraid of what you'd find
You can say it with a vengeance - you'll be
Back from the grave
