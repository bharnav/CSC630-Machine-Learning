Grace, pride, tell me what's your name
Crippled will with tomorrow's pill
Cause I feel no pain and I can't remember who's to blame...

This is not my home, this is not my home
But the source was always known
My grain

I beg, you steal, do you show me your signs of sin
Blistered and torn by the pure and reborn
When they're just like us and remember man, they cave in...

This is not my home, this is not my home
But the source was always known
My grain
This is not my home, this is not my home
But the source was always known
My grain

War stone, do you write your name in trust?
Word to the wise my instincts rise
All your heroes are gone and the proud ones have turned to dust, seven dust
You can kill my pride but my heads still flying

My grain
My grain
My grain
My.......
