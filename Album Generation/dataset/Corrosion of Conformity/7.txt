If I was the king
Of all the rotten
Stealing filth
From those forgotten
Would you be my queen
Of a desperate land?
Do you give a damn?

What if I had to scold you?
Listen once, tried and true
What if I had to trade you
For another man?
Do you think I can?

I won't call on the angels, no
Beating on the line
As I turn to amputate
I'm bleeding on you

What if you were torn in two?
What if I wanted to be like you?
What if I were high, like an aeroplane?
Would you look at me the same?

I won't call on the angels, no
Beating on the line
As I turn to amputate
I'm bleeding on you

If we walked side by side
Would you stab my back
And kill my pride?
Would you fall ahead
Or would you move behind?
Tell me, words unkind?

Now if I was the king
Of all the rotten
Stealing filth
From those forgotten
Would you be my queen
Of this desperate land?
Do you think I give a damn?

I won't call on the angels, no
Beating on the line
As I turn to amputate
I'm bleeding on you
