Break neck rat race world does it taste just like it should?
You only own what's etched in stone you better get it while it's good
Don't weep big city sheep I'm just trapped in your hemisphere
You tell me what I should know and I can tell you what you wanna hear

Say tunnel vison there is no purpose served
By staying aboard this runaway wreck
While you're losing is on the curve
Right there's the door

Don't knock little can't rock he's the one huffin' gasoline
Been keepin' time with a cloudy mind since they hit him with a limosine
Still the lil' ones eat off the cold concrete
And the bleedin' hearts don't care
You tell me where I can go and I'll bet you that I see you there

Say tunnel vison there is no purpose served
By staying aboard this runaway wreck
While you're losing is on the curve
Right there's the door

Don't deny, purify said the man on the golden throne
Guilty times have made you lie and you realize you're all alone
So now you're throwin' stones at some old bag of bones
And you can't even knock him down
And there's one last thing that you should know
And I can tell you without a sound
Right there's the door
