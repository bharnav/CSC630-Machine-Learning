Torn from within, disciples til the end
Wasting time is how it's always been
Kiss the floor, steal the key, lock the door
There's many ways to decline
Bonafide, crucified in your prime
You left behind...

Twilight explodes
In my time of the blind
You can't postpone
Some tomorrow

Just one more wishbone

Broken days pumping through your veins
Shattered thoughts, reflection always stays
Losing sight, losing sight without a fight that once was a war
Now you got a thousand scars and nothing to show them for

Twilight explodes
In my time of the blind
You can't postpone
Some tomorrow

Just one more wishbone

In between surrender sight unseen
Split the seam when no one intervenes
Feel the kick from the heartless heretic that once made you shine
Now you're grounded down for the last time, shut your eyes to the crime

Twilight explodes
In my time of the blind
You can't postpone
Some tomorrow

Just one more wishbone
Just one more wishbone
One more
One more wishbone
Just one more wishbone
