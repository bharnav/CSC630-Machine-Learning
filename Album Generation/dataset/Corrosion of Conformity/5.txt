Please pray for the plowboy
'cause there's more than meets the eye
Once and twice might protect you
Land of fatted lamb don't lie
Land of fatted lamb don't lie
So you reach out for the sky
And I can't save you
I can't save you
Still I try to
But I don't think you want me to
Three cheers for the dying
Standin' tall on wounded knees
If I can only fix your problem
In this land of free disease
In this land of free disease
In this land of no repreve
And I can't save you
I can't save you
Still I try to
But I don't think you want me
I don't think you want me
No I don't think you want me
I don't think you want me
No I don't think you want me
I don't think you want me
No, not me
And I can't save you
I can't save you
Still I try to
But I don't think you want me
No I don't think you want me
I don't think you want me
No I don't think you want me
I don't think you want me
No I don't think you want me
So I dance with the devil
So I dance with the devil
So I dance with the devil
So I dance with the devil
