Here we stand before the call accused of fire
It's too cold and you're too old, for me it's time for me to expire

Serve to see of what could be
Burn the freak and set him free
Out of sight, out of sight, out of time
And you're way out of line

They cool the tongue to tame the flame
We burn the soul and it still remain
They freeze the tongue to stay the same
Control me...

Cast the stone when in Rome
Thick as a brick, the lamb's alone
Bend the knee but don't you pray for me
Cause I fly for free

Finding fame without a name
Holy sound and no sustain
Out of sight, out of sight, out of time
And you're way out of line

They cool the tongue to tame the flame
We burn the soul and it still remain
They freeze the tongue to stay the same
Control me...

Free to run, deaf and numb
Lock and load, unholy son
Within reach, bleach the leach
He's a smoking gun

Serve to see of what could be
Burn the freak and set him free
Out of sight, out of sight, out of time
And you're way out of line

They cool the tongue to tame the flame
We burn the soul and it still remain
They freeze the tongue to stay the same
Control me...
