After the deadlock and dazzle
As good as or better than gold
I lay down my guns on the table
First scarlet, then blue growing cold

Black light and smoke
Making a joke
In the haze of a setting sun

Leviathan waits in the water
Skeletons hide in the trees
The hours crawl by like a spider
Hangman is following me

At sorrow's door
A century more
In the rays of a setting sun

After the deadlock and dazzle
Glitters at night like it's gold
Lay down your heart if you're able
First scarlet, then blue grown cold

Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you

Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
Everyday a prayer for what I never knew
But this is one I said for you
