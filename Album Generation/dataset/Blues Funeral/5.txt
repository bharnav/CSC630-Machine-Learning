The sun’s tolling bell, subterranean eyes
A thousand to one, the factory line
Stars outside the window flicker and shine
The hollow headed morning isn’t blind

A mountain of nails burn in your hands
Here I give all I am

Gloria
I get down on my knees
Further from my own

A tower of stones, sympathy’s shade
Ride a white horse, the drowned on parade
A diamond headed serpent climbs a vine
See all the lonely children lose their minds

A mountain of dust burns in your mouth
Here there’s no north, just south

Gloria
I get down on my knees
Further from my own

Thirst swollen tongue, an arcadian twist
The sleepwalk is done, yet the notion persists
Cars outside the window careening by
The hollow headed morning is unkind

Gloria
I get down on my knees
Further from my own

Gloria
I get down on my knees
Further from my own

Under a cliff, darkness denied
Here I have seen the light
Here I have seen the light

Here I have seen the light
Here I have seen the light
Here I have seen the light
Here I have seen
Here I have seen
Here I have seen the light, the light
Here I have seen the light
