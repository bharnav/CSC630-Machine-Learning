Yellow moon keep hanging there
Don't you ever come down
Tattered newspaper pages
Are scattered 'cross the ground

Lost on a violent sea
Gone for endless days
I have tried to free myself
But it's been hard to break away

So long light, you're bound to fall
Now isn't that a shame
Casting shadows on the wall
Too late to learn another game

Transfixed by what isn't seen
And what will never change
The times I've tried to free myself
It's been hard to look away

It's a deep black vanishing train
Upon a very long track
Standing on a sidewalk in the rain
Hands behind my back

Lost on a violent sea
Day on endless day
I have finally freed myself
But it's been hard to break away
