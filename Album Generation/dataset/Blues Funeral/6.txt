I have given to you, Jane
A torn and tattered love
But do you hear the tolling bells
That ring down from above?

I thought I'd rule like Charlemagne
But I've become corrupt
Now I crawl the promenade
To fill my empty cup

And you're free
You're free again
One more time

Now if you found a razorblade
And took it to your wrist
Then I'd be here in my electric chair
Because of this

All last night and night before
I stood on the pier and cried
But I don't want to turn away
For fear of going blind

And you're free
You're free again
One more time

I have given to you, Jane
A bruised and beaten love
But do you see the cold white light
That shines down from above?

Thought I'd rule like Charlemagne
But I've become corrupt
Now I'll crawl the promenade
To fill my empty cup

And you're free
You're free again
One more time

Oh you're free
Yeah, you're free again
One more time
