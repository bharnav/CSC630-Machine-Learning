Don’t you turn off my radio
Please don’t turn off my radio
Not with the rope still swinging
While eternity’s mouth is singing

So insect, I’m in amber
Days go by please don’t forget
Uneven, so enamored
Days go by remember that

Gray goes black, oh
Gray goes black, oh
Gray goes black, yeah

Can’t you hear my radio?
Don’t you hear my radio?
Not with the beast still sleeping
While eternity’s eyes are weeping

So insect, I’m in amber
Days go by please don’t forget
Uneven, so enamored
Days go by remember that

Gray goes black, oh
Gray goes black, oh
Gray goes black, yeah

Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black

Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
Into the blood we sink and burn
Gray goes black
