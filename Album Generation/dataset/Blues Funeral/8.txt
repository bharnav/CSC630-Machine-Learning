I walked by Harborview Hospital
I heard the Agnus Dei
Oh, sister of mercy
I've been gone too long to say

And all around this place
I was a sad disgrace

They're singing, they're singing
Away up on the hill
They're building, they're building
A mystical union, beautiful and still

But down here in the dirt
They'll say it doesn't hurt

The devil's ascended
Upon some crystal wings
In the citadel lightning
Splits a cloud of butterflies and fiends

And with a vacant stare
I'll leave a flower there

They're riding, they're riding
A hellhound down the hill
They're sinking, they're sinking
Into the ocean, beautiful and still

And yet it's hard to leave
In wealth or poverty

I walked by Harborview Hospital
And stopped at Ninth and James
Oh, sister of mercy
I've been down too far to say

Are they supposed to be
As sick as you and me?
