With piranha teeth
I've been dreaming of you
And the taste of your love, so sweet
Honest, it's true

Through my heart flows sleep
And the dark, heavy rain
Where the gravedigger's song is sung
You've been torturing me

Tout est noir, mon amour
Tout est blanc
Je t'aime, mon amour
Comme j'aime la nuit

Love, is the medicine good?
Is the crow flying eight miles high
Over wire and wood?

Shovel down six feet
With a head heavy pain
The magnolia blooms so sweet
And it fades just the same

To the stars, my love
To the sea
To the wheels, my love
'Til they roll all over me

Oh love, I've been thinking of you
With razor white teeth, so sharp
Honest, it's true

In my blood flows sleep
And the dark heavy rain
The magnolia blooms so sweet
Only torturing me

To the stars, my love
To the sea
To the wheels, my love
'Til they roll all over me
