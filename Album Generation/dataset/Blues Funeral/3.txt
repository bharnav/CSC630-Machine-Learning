I look at the sky
I see an airplane as it flies
Is this the way they said Jesus came?
Gone through St. Louis
Gone straightaway

And I hear the winter
Will cut you quick
If tears were liquor
I'd have drunk myself sick

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Woman are you home?
A house of cards, a frame of bones
Here I am earthly bound
Said hallelujah, I'm going down

And the River Jordan
Is deep and wide
I think I see forever
Across on the other side

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I look at the sky
I see a nightbird as it flies
Over the old bent cherry trees
Shivering in a row

Down here the winter
Will cut you quick
These tears are liquor
And I've drunk myself sick

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And the dead of winter
Will cut you quick
These tears are liquor, mmm
And I've drunk myself sick
