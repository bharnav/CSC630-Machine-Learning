There's a riot in my house
Chaos is blossoming
Run and hide little mouse
Go on and get yourself together

When burn outs by the score
Strung out in metal cages
See technicolor pour
From every laceration

I realize that I'm slowly coming down with you

Angels fill my room
With what I've scant belief in
When death's metal broom
Comes sweeping through the evening

Get up off the floor
There's hot smoking radiation
From window to the door
In ultra violent hesitation

I realize that I'm slowly coming down with you

Battle lines appear
Within the broken mirrors
Yet the dogs have no fear
Fighting in the dark grey shadows

Hear the coughing sound
Mama bring my medication
No harmony is found
While performing levitation

I realize that I'm slowly coming down with you

There's a riot in my house
Chaos is blossoming
Run and hide little mouse
Go on and get yourself together

From window to the door
There's cold choking strangulation
See technicolor pour
From every amputation

And realize that I'm slowly coming down with you
Oh yeah

There's a riot in my house
Go on and get yourself together
Go on and get yourself together
There's a riot in my house
Go on and get yourself together
Oh yeah
Go on and get yourself together
