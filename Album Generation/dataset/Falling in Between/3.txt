[Verse 1]
Smoke and mirrors, it's a house of cards
Everybody has windows and big cigars
The law of the jungle is very new to some
The animals are vicious and arrogant, and they eat their young

I used to work my job from 9 to 5
I just survived

[Chorus 1]
I was the king of the world
I had every thing thrown at me that the judge and jury could hurl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way up to the very top of the tower

[Verse 2]
Helter skelter, it's a den of thieves
A sea of errors that a greedy man weaves
A few really bad apples always spoil the lot
Rolling blackouts, on everyone's buck

I go to work and try to make ends meet
My life is over

[Chorus 2]
I was the king of the world
I had everything I needed, I owned every type of girl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way up to the very top of the tower

[Chorus 3/Outro]
I was the king of the world
I had everything I needed, I owned every type of girl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way up to the very top of the tower
I was the king of the world...
I was the king of the world...
