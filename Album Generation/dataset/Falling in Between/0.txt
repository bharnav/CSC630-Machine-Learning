[Verse 1]
I've just got to find
Find a way, back home to you, girl
Life's been Hell to pay
I can't disobey, gotta live in my world

[Chorus]
I hear the voices calling from the faces never seen
Darkness all around me, I am falling in between

[Verse 2]
You've been lookin' down
Down to the ground, on everything I say, girl
Hope just can't be found
I'm so gagged and bound, because of you girl

[Chorus]
I hear voices calling from the places I have been
Love and understanding only flows from deep within
Darkness that surrounds me, I am falling in between
