[Verse 1]
Gimme some beer, gimme some fear
Reality and fame
Money from you, money for them
Billions being made
You think you got a real deal
When all you're buyin' is a fifth wheel
They gotcha by the yin-yang
More dollar for the big bang

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And when you have to have it
Somehow you always find a way
(You'll find a way)
Then it becomes a habit
You'll rob your late friend's grave

[Chorus 1]
It's sex, it's drugs
And then we all fall down
Get hooked, on life
Or join the underground
It's oil, it's guns
Bad guys we never see
It's war, dead sons
Be all that you can be

[Verse 2]
Give it a spin, maybe you'll win
Nobody's gettin' paid
Lightin' it up, shootin' it up
Ya really should be afraid
You're lookin' for a new chin
So they tighten up your old grin
All you wanna do is fit in
So they're gonna make you real thin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's just enough to tease you
They nail you right between the eyes
(Nail you right between the eyes!)
Somehow it will disease you
While you're lobotomized

[Chorus 2]
It's meds, it's feds
Don't need no PhD's
Load down, those sounds
We love our MP3's
It's cribs, it's cars
Mercedes BNZ
It's abs, it's carbs
Stop super-sizing me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
It's sex, it's drugs
And then we all fall down
Get hooked on life
Or join the underground
It's crips, it's bloods
It's pimped out S.U.V.'s
It's court, prime time
Those lawyer S.O.B.'s
It's X, It's crack
It's glass and A.D.D
It's cool, it's wack
I'll pay you back
Your kick, you prick
You get the first one free
You're cuffed, you're hooked
You're hooked!
