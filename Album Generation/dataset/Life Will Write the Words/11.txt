Shook up and beat down
Hallelujah
From bad cards that I was dealt
Hallelujah
So I spoke a match that burned them down
Hallelujah
So light it up

Ashes made of spades are going through the air
The embers and the flames are going through the cares
The sickness of the past, let it burn back there
The ashes made of spades are going through the air

Dodging rocks. You're a street light
Hallelujah
London fog on a dreary night
You took a hit, they could not take your light
Hallelujah
So light it up

Ashes made of spades are going through the air
The embers and the flames are going through the cares
The sickness of the past, let it burn back there
The ashes made of spades are going through the air

Stranded in the streams without a branch to rescue me and pull me from the tormenting
Will I die here in the water?
I closed my eyes so I could see then there grew a tree from my belief
Now here I stand with two dry feet, and there my past dies in the water

Oh My Light
All My Life
