Desert rain is falling
A southern cold July
Do it or don't do it
Don't wait forever for the right time
Do it, run to it
The tree bearing apple now bears a lime

Run, don't stop it
Although I'm barely walking suffering
Run, don't stop it
I am the tarnished locket that holds you within
Busted Bones I'm running

Catalyst explosion
My horse stolen, my ride done
Do it. Run to it
Let them sit back and watch you

Run, don't stop it
Although I'm barely walking suffering
Run, don't stop
I am the tarnished locket that holds you within
The day they stole the horse I started running

Mug me, inspiration take my apathy

Run, don't stop it
Although I'm barely walking suffering
Run, don't stop
I am the tarnished locket that holds you within

Sanity can keep its distance from me
The day they stole the horse I started running
