Idiot or fearless I confess I am. Naive ...yeah I dream American
I swing with no net on that trapeze. Beats, beats, beats, beats me

You crash on a couch within my head
Bumming around and don't pay rent
I've been in danger for you for so long
So come on...

There are not one but two hundred thousand miles on my car
To be with you I've driven far, but I loved you that much
Yes I made those morning coffee drinks at four AM for a ring, but I loved you that much
I stood up to that gang by myself. When they messed with you, I had no help, but I loved you that much
And remember the time I wrote that song and many folks sang along? Yeah I loved you that much

May I cut into your plans and cause a ruckus?
Let's break some records in some books. You'll never pop until you're shook up
If a picture paints a thousand words, how come I'm speechless and full of nervous
All I got is...
So come on...

Older times are out of sight. I thought about it and I kinda died
A kid and kite, a flickering light. I thought about it, I thought about and I kinda died
Because all good things come to an end
But the end will be the dirt between us
The end will be the dirt will be the end

I won't settle down, I won't settle down
