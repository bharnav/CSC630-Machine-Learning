Coming up no plans
Betty AV, Monahans. Little in a football town
Waiting for some right to come around
Praying for release
Bottle Rockets in the streets. Never really had a dad, no all that you had was your hope...
Keep your eyes open where you roam because you never know when your life's about to change

Just for a moment start to forget about the scars and forget who you think you are. Don't say another word. You're meant for greatness

The mirror's her nemesis from insecure accomplices
And crooked blokes in disguise messed you up behind your eyes
Now you're scared to talk, scared to dance
And sick of clich√©s about second chances, but it's time to live or time to fade
Somewhere in this place there is hope

Keep your eyes open where you roam because you never know when your life's about it change

Just for a moment start to forget about the scars and forget who you think you are. Don't say another word. You're meant for greatness
Just for a moment start to forget about the scars and forget who you think you are. All the fear within your world, you can take it...

And greatness isn't what you think it's not being up on that silver screen
It's not convincing people you don't fall apart
It's just loving and serving and being who you are

You were made in an image of greatness

Just for a moment start to forget about the scars and forget who you think you are. Don't say another word. You're meant for greatness
Just for a moment start to forget about the scars and forget who you think you are. All the fear within your world, you can take it...
