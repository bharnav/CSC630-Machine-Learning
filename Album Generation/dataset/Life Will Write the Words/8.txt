Since a kid I always loved to sing
I told my teachers, "That's what I want to be"
And this road I'm on, as sketchy it may be
Brings chances to beat the odds the devils has for me

And I'm never gonna miss a beat
Because brother, I'm a soldier
No, I'm never gonna miss a beat
Because I got to be a soldier

And in heaven maybe
He is smiling down on me
But behind the doors
Of my heart I am crying

Epic warfare, it's spiritual
When out of nowhere come the black cannon balls
Today we broke down and caught wind
Of a tragedy in the same hour
But tonight I, I won't sing about this

Because I'm never gonna miss a beat
'Cause brother, I'm a soldier
No I'm never gonna miss a beat
Because the Lord made me a soldier

And in heaven maybe
He is smiling down on me
But behind the doors
Of my heart I am crying
Today, behind the doors of my heart

And in the end the life we lead
It will have made a difference
In a world unseen

So we're never gonna miss a beat
Because brother, we are soldiers
No, we're never gonna miss a beat
Because we got to be soldiers

And in heaven maybe
He is smiling down on me
But behind those doors
Of my heart I am crying

If I said it was easy always I'd be lying
Today behind those doors
Of my heart I am crying
If I said it was easy always I'd be lying
But behind the doors of my heart
