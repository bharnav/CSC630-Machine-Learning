Let's get out of here
Walking outside and everything is feeling right
Sounding like a hymn that cuts in your soul
Like a lifetime flashing by your brand new eyes
It's the first time in so long that you see
That you see you in the mirror

We're gonna make it out
I won't forget this place, I won't forget you
Let the revival rattle me and open my eyes
Open my eyes, it's so good

It's been a bombs and guns and fire kind of season
And oh, I need a reason for all of my bleeding tonight
I'm gonna break it out, I'm gonna make a scene if I don't write
The electric light we are tonight

We're gonna make it out
I won't forget this place, I won't forget you
Let the revival rattle me and open my eyes
Open my eyes, it's so good

You're gonna make it out
You're gonna make it out of here
Let the revival rattle me and open my eyes
Open my eyes, it's so good
I won't forget this place
