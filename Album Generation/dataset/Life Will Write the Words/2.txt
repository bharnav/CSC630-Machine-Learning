"Good evening"
She says to herself with haughty eyes
The motive lies behind them
He walks in proudly, loosens his tie

So satisfied to keep walking past
All the people you used to know
I say hello, "Please to meet you," she said
Although I knew her some years ago

What are you trying to prove?
What are you trying to lose
As you condescend through the room
With your subtle grip on the ruins of old?

What are you trying to prove?
What are you doing talking bad on those you knew
With your subtle grip on the ruins
Of ten years ago and counting?

So just stop it, hey, take it easy
It's not hard to see you've had one too many
And do you kiss your mother
With that mouth you have talking at me?

And do you think you try too hard?
You're holding on to things forgotten
So how are you?
I am sincerely asking about you

What are you trying to prove?
What are you trying to lose
As you condescend through the room
With your subtle grip on the ruins of old?

What are you trying to prove?
What are you doing talking bad on those you knew
With your subtle grip on the ruins
Of ten years ago and counting?

So slow down
You don't have anything to prove
So quit the self-aggrandizing

What are you trying to prove?
What are you trying to lose
As you condescend through the room
With your subtle grip on the ruins of old?

What are you trying to prove?
What are you doing talking bad on those you knew
With your subtle grip on the ruins
Of ten years ago and counting?

Did I nail? Did I nail it?
Nail it, yeah I nailed
Yeah I nailed it, nailed it
