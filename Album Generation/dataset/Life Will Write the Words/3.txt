I had a dream that could save my life
Airplane hands in the wind in a vintage time
I want to love like my grandfather loved his wife, but I got some problems with the way I tick
We are addicted to the world and we want more of it
My generation heard of old love and commitment, but did it stick?

Based on what you've heard, does it work that old pastime love?
Because I can't help but observe the sinking ships just giving up
So come on give me that old love. I just want to try and make that work
Come on give me that old love

Carving their names into sap bleeding songs
The movie script it lasted sixty-six years long
And there was hurt and there was death and there was friction but better yet, an adventurous story as they told it

But I've got some problems with the way I tick
We are addicted to the world and we want more of it
My generation heard of old love and commitment, but did it stick?

Based on what you've heard, does it work that old pastime love?
Because I can't help but observe the sinking ships just giving up
So come on give me that old love. I just want to try and make that work
Come on give me that old love

Based on what you've heard, does it work that old pastime love?
Because I can't help but observe the sinking ships just giving up
So come on give me that old love. I just want to try and make that work
Come on give me that old love. Is this chance or a red alert?

So come on give me those bright eyes. Teach me how to widen mine
No I don't believe in the lies that it's not alive

I had a dream that could save my life
