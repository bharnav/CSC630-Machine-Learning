A scrapbook on my lap
A soft head on my shoulder
Behind loose plastic pages
Are some fading photographs
Peculiar fashion styles
In the corner there's a baby
Behind the infant smile
Is a heart I recognize

What was I doing then?
Learning to take some steps
Then walking through adolescence
Some thousand miles away
And up in heaven
God called a meeting
And in the space that was next to mine
He chose to write your name

I never understood our weather here
Or how together, life and death must dance
But I'll forever be most baffled by the
Subtle glances, from who I landed
What are the chances?

There's the place
Where the story about us started
And took the stage
It's been so many days
And now the bricks are starting to crack
Feels a little weird looking back
'Cause some things have changed, some things have died
But somehow you've stayed the same all this time

I never understood our weather here
Or how together, life and death must dance
But I'll forever be most baffled by the
Subtle glances, from who I landed
What are the chances?

Some will say that it goes away
I will run and chase it down
Through that rolling thunder and rain
I will risk my sails and all this boat to be in that storm

Either way, I'm gonna stay
Either way, I'm gonna stay
Though the waves will try to pull me away
Either way, I'm gonna stay
