I've been working in the city. I've been working at night
I've been working in the city. So dark, no light
And I know, I know everything will be alright but I, I'm a little bit crazy right now

And I feel so underrated. Have you ever felt this underrated?

And I'm just sick of all things Underrated. All I want, all I need is a chance
Underrated. I don't want to be more than me I'm just sick of things underrated...
We'd appreciate it

I'm a little in motion. I'm a little out of line
My ear's on the phone with Jesus and my eyes are angry and blinded
And I know, I know the last will be first in that line but I, I'm a little bit crazy right now

And I feel so underrated. Have you ever felt this underrated. And are you sick of it?

Underrated. All I want, all I need is a chance
Underrated. I don't want to be more than me I'm just sick of things...

See the cuts on my hands? They hurt from working
Will I ever be deserving? Oh, help my eyes to see and not feel so underrated
I don't want to be one of those that stares at all the questions while the open doors they close
I just want to get out there
So with a humble heart, teach me some lessons. Show me to do my part in the place you have me standing
As I meet with humility, is it the injustices or pride that's killing me?

I've been here all day, and just one denarius
If I must boast, let it be that of my weaknesses
Humility, you have my attention

You know, you're better off to be underrated
All I want, all I need is a chance
Underrated. I don't want to be more than me I'm just sick of things underrated
All I want, all I need is a chance
