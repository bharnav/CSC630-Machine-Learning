And if I could go back Was heaven abound on the other side of them train tracks?
I kicked the rocks as I watched you leaving. Thinking of how I could save you
And how close was your window I should have gone through it
I should have been a roman. Oh how I know it

Be the rescuing type. Be reckless. Be bright
Do you sometimes hear that heroic heart beating behind bars?
Yes that question is mine. Am I that rescuing type?

So shook up. Many a thing I've seen but never seen a thing so messed up as someone in need and I stutter, I can't get up
Reminds me how you would like to sing but don't for fear of them blue notes
Should have gone through it, should have been a roman. Oh how I know it

Be the rescuing type. Be reckless. Be bright
Do you sometimes hear that heroic heart beating behind bars?
Yes that question is mine. Am I that rescuing type?

Break my heart in two so I can see what I'm supposed to do
I've covered it up layers black and blue open it up, let me see that blood red truth

Break my heart. I'm ready to start to be the rescuing type
Be reckless. Be bright
Do you sometimes hear that heroic heart beating behind bars?
Yes that question is mine. Am I that rescuing type
