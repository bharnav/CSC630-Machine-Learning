Desperation took us down
Uneasy lies, the head
But where's the crown?
You can't see it
I saw the mourners passing by
These wicked men
Beneath the sulfurous skies
Oh what can it mean?
Every bell is silent here
The hands of clocks are bound
And time itself has stopped
Can you feel it?
The birds are frozen in their flight
Trapped within the thunder light
A storm is rising
A voice within the winter halls
Some grave secret from these careless lips will fall
A star on the horizon
See you gods forgotten son
Lies broken and alone
Searching for a father
From Dresden's blazing skies
To the bloody wash of dawn
I saw the beast arise
And climb upon the throne
And fallen angels weep
And long for peace, for home
Whilst far beneath the ice they sleep
These dark knights of the black sun
And upon stromlashed mountain high
I found the hidden book
On the altar of the wretched prince of lies
And I broke apart the graven seal
And these seven words I read
Rejoice, the great god fear is dead
So from the rooftops calling out
You where always free
Yes from the rooftops calling out
And ever may you be
