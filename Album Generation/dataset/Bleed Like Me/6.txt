[Verse 1]
No evolution, sometimes it depresses me
The same old same, oh, we keep repeating history
The institution curses curiosity
It's our conviction, sex is not the enemy

[Chorus]
A revolution
Is the solution
A revolution
Is the solution

[Verse 2]
I don't feel guilty, no matter what they're telling me
I won't feel dirty and buy into their misery
I won't be shamed cause I believe that love is free
It fuels the heart and sex is not my enemy

[Chorus]
A revolution
Is the solution
A revolution
Is the solution

[Verse 3]
True love's like gold, there's not enough to go around
But then there's god and doesn't god love everyone?
Give me a choice, give me a chance to turn the key
And find my voice: sex is not the enemy

[Chorus]
A revolution
Is the solution
A revolution
Is the solution
Sex is not the enemy

A revolution
