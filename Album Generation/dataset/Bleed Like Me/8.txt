[Intro]
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night

[Verse 1]
They know best how they can mess with us
Nursing an opinion's getting dangerous
And in a world where good's not good enough
Let's get loaded and kick up a fuss

[Chorus]
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night

Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?
Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?

[Verse 2]
What a mess we've made, it's ridiculous
The whole wide world's a stage of complete chaos
It's gets so funny that we get confused
We don't know where to turn cause we've all been used

[Chorus]
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night

Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?
Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?

[Bridge]
Let's get loaded (oh let's be selfish)
Let's get wasted (and lose our senses)
Let's get shit faced (so we can fake it)
Let's get stupid (just entertain us)
Let's get wicked (desensitize us)
Let's get toasted (don't educate us)
Let's get hammered (yeah paralyze us)
Let's forget it (don't count on all)

[Chorus]
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night
The boys wanna fight
But the girls are happy to dance all night

I'm sick sick sick of doing nothing
Sick sick sick of saying nothing
I'm sick sick sick of doing nothing
I'm sick sick sick of saying nothing
So let's get loaded

[Outro]
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
The boys wanna fight
The boys
