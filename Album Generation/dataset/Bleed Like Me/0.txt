[Verse 1]
I've got a fever, come check it and see
There's something burning and rolling in me
We may not last but we'll have fun till it ends
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I wanna hear you call out my name
I wanna see you burn up in flames
Keep you on ice so I can show all my friends
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend

[Verse 3]
So ripe, so sweet, come suck it and see
But watch out daddy, I sting like a bee
I know some tricks I swear will give you the bends
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend

[Verse 4]
My fever's rising you ran into luck
Say what sugar, you wanna get what?
I wanna give you one hundred and ten
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend

[Breakdown]
It's wild the way you tease me
It's wild the way you free me
It's wild the way you reach me
Wrapped me up in your wire from the start

[Verse 5]
You've got the women waiting in line
I'm not asking you to make up your mind
But I can make you happy at least now and then
I've got something special for my bad boyfriend

[Outro]
If you can't love me honey go on, just pretend
I've saved something special for the very end
If you can't love me honey go on, just pretend
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend

Oh, c'mon baby be my bad boyfriend
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend
C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend
