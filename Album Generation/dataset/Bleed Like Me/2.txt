[Verse 1]
Don't care what they have to say
No point in listening to them anyway
Why do you have to give them what they want?
They love to watch you as you fall apart

[Chorus]
Stick it to them like a phoenix rise
There's nothing grander than the big surprise
They can't hurt you with their sticks and stones
About time take them right between the eyes

[Verse 2]
Seek to destroy cause they're scared of you
That's why they try to make a fool of you
They're so jealous of my pretty star
Cause you've got soul inside your shattered heart

[Chorus]
Stick it to them like a phoenix rise
There's nothing grander than the big surprise
They can't hurt you with their sticks and stones
About time take them right between the eyes

[Breakdown]
And you've been waiting all your life
To fly high into somebody else
And it's true it's a cruel, cruel world
Life's a bitch and then you die my love

[Verse 3]
Don't care what they have to say
You shouldn't listen to them anyway

[Chorus]
Stick it to them like a phoenix rise
There's nothing grander than the big surprise
They can't hurt you with their sticks and stones
About time take them right between the eyes

[Interlude]
People like to build you up
Then they'll stab you in the back like that
You know it breaks my heart
Can't see you going out like that

[Outro]
Stay alive my love
Stay alive my love
Stay alive my love
Stay alive my love
