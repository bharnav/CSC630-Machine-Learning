[Intro]
...How we living
Nigga this is Harlem nigga
Bang bang nigga
Yeah you see us

[Verse 1]
Police tryna find me
Can't confine me
Home confinement
Caught a loud nigga shining
Shit enticing
Flashed the iron now his shit is mine
And its flashing sirens
911 line blinging
Tossed the 9
Now i'm standing in a damn line-up
Shit what's the point
When it's point em' out and line em' up
Screaming A-Hiii
When the funds is low we hit a lick to lift us up
S-S-S Stick em' up
Reach up for the sky
Put em' high before we clip you up
Shit you could stick me in the fire with the heater tucked
Moving through the smoke like a schemer with redeemer bucks
Ridin' with my 5s and slimes like
Fuck a 9-5 life
We rather die for that lime green like ohhh God
Was my mind like in 05'
Front line
Got a bunch of 9 Treys and some 5 nines
Down to slide for that homie right
I could put that on mine if I'm lying then I'm flying nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah run up on me wrong my niggas slidin' slidin' slidin'
Bunch of lil' niggas wildin' wildin' wildin'
Catchin' wreck committing violence violent crimes
All the time niggas slidin' slidin' slidin'
Bunch of lil' niggas wildin' wildin' wildin'
In a city with no guidance guidance guidance
But we gotta eat
So deep in this shit
Woke in my sleep feel me

[Verse 2]
I been slidin' through the town
I could tell that you ain't 10 toes down
You ain't even .5
You ain't break a quarter pound
224 times
Dime pitching got my mind shiftin' line spittin' bout' the line sniffin'
In my blood line
Trippin' ass lying niggas rhyme about the white flippin'
In their stories on some auditory story time
Here's a gory vibe like
09' if I remember right
Like
My right hand fightin' plights
I was outta sight
Gettin' right
We been homie tight
Since some tricycles
Told keep his tri eye wide
He been selling white
Outta line
Hand to hand pitchin' on that type of time
Caught a F-F
To his own fam servin' dimes
On my line
Feeling like he running outta time
Time pressing
Press rewind
He was thinking bout' retiring
Damn I pray he get his mind right

[Chorus]
He like nigga I been slidin' slidin' slidin'
Since a lil' nigga wildin' wildin' wildin'
You remember all that violence violence violence
Hope you make it with the rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'
On them tracks you be wildin' wildin' wildin'
If you need me know I'm slidin' slidin' slidin'
Ima get back on my feet
Don't sleep
I'll be good my nigga
Keep doin' you
Keep it tru
Keep on grindin'
Push it through

[Verse 3]
Silky with the flow
Cut from a clothe yo
Nigga bout' to blow
I been plottin' movin'
Sonic boomin'
Rappin' like a doobie
On the dome of your boobie
All alone in a room and she wanna kamasutra
But I'm like
I need 2 of ya
Mixing with the formula
Aura of a Pac like God like
Nigga I am not like anything you witnessed in this life time
Write rhymes
Scriptures rip ya from your spirit assylum
These niggas regular
Even all the veterans
Shit send em' in
Know I got that heaven sent God flow
Pablo
Ch-Choppin' leave you mind blown
I know
Got you lookin' like Picassos
I know
Got you feelin' on the vibes though
I know
Yeah I know you wanna rhyme though
I know
But you gotta pay the fine though
I know

[Chorus]
And if it's paper them I'm slidin' sildin slidin'
Gotta put on for the family family family
Tryna move em' out the projects projects projects
I been doing shows grindin' grindin' grindin'
Grindin' muffuka

[Outro]
Don't worry about a thing
Cuz every little thing is gonna be alright
Ayy
Yo i think I'm on to some shit man
Ya'll don't feel me
No
Fuck ya'll niggas
