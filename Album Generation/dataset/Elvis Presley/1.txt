[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

[Outro]
Hay Hey Hay Hey Hay Hey Hay Hey
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days may your days may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
