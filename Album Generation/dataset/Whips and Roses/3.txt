Halfway gone, and halfway back
You're always dreaming' 'bout what you lack
You're takin' your time from your busy day
To sit by the track and watch the train roll away

Dreamer I know what you're thinkin'
I can see it in your face
Maybe before you were happy
But now your thoughts aren't of this place

You've begun to change now baby, I don't see
Oh but I know you well and it's clear to me
You think chains hold you here now baby, but they don't exist
You don't have to stay mama, I won't insist

So take the train today, and don't look back again
Live the dreams you have, don't dwell on what has been
Your future's brighter now, there's brighter days ahead
Any sad farewell words, better left unsaid

Maybe before you were happy, but now your thoughts aren't of this place
I only wish you were with me, someone like you can't be replaced
