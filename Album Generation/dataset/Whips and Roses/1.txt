Baggage handcuffed to my wrist
I drag it everywhere I go
Sometimes I fight it with my fists
If I knew which way was home
It's where I'd go
If I knew which way was home

Porter come and cut me loose
Bring that whiskey in my water
Sometimes I get the blues
But I know I shouldn't oughtta
That's where I'd go
If I knew which way was home

Run down ghost town, no chance for love
No sign of life - just wild dogs howlin' in the night
That's what I like
Hey porter come and cut me free
I'm sick of my own company
Sometimes I miss the gold
Most times I miss my home
That's where I'd go
If I knew which way was home
That's what I like

Hear 'em howl....
