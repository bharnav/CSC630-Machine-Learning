[Verse 1]
Darling, it seems like the whole world's just turning so fast
Everything's changing and we're just trying to keep up
But we've got something special here
Something worth waiting for
Yeah, we're right on the edge of falling
Falling in love

[Chorus]
No rush, no rush, ain't this world turning, baby
Fast enough
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush

[Verse 2]
Walking (walking) and talking (talking)
Dreaming with you, wondering (wondering)
And tell me baby, I've been wondering
Are you feeling it too

[Chorus][x2]
