[Verse 1]
I grew up working on a farm, way down South
I went to school against my will, way down South
I kissed girls and I shot squirrels out behind my house
I learned a lot about this world, way down South
I went to church, sang a lot of hymns, way down South
I learned to work on my pickup truck, way down South
I played my guitar under the stars, out behind our house
You will always find my heart, way down South

[Chorus]
Clothes on a clothes line, hanging in the sunshine
A garden growing in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good old sound
People driving pass when I'm cutting grass
Waving at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South

[Verse 2]
Swimming in the creek with all my friends, way down South
Praying them days would never end, way down South
Give me a worm and a fishing pole, I'll pull a fish on out
Those memories will never get old, way down South

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Mmmmmmm
Yeah, way on down
