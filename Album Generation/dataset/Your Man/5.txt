[Verse 1]
Grand Old Opry music show playing on my radio
Fiddle and a steel guitar in some little redneck bar
Parking lot full of four wheel drives
You won't hear no hip hop jive
Cowgirls looking for cowboys
Two-step to that old white noise

[Chorus]
I'm talking about white noise coming from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stomping
To that white noise coming from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonking

[Bridge]
When the evening sun goes down cruising through our little town
Country girls and country boys showing off hillbilly toys

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Tractor pulls and rodeos, county fairs and bluegrass shows
It ain't a thing about black and white
It's Johnny Cash and Charley Pride

[Chorus]
