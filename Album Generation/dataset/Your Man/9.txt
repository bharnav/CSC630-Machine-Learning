[Verse]
I've got my share of scars on those ol' monkey bars
Every time I'd hit the ground
On that old long dirt my bike lost control
And once again I was fallin' down
Every time I'd try to fly, there's a force I can't deny
Gravity
Grew to be six foot one, depended on no one
Yeah, I was my ol' man
Invincible and strong until you came along
And touched me with your gentle hand
When I look into your eyes, there's a force I can't deny
Gravity

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Gravity
Mmmmmm, gravity
