And I feel like I knew you before
And I guess that you can hear me through this song

And my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine

And I know that you just want me to belong to someone
And I guess that now I'll just be moving on to someone

But my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine

I've never betrayed your trust
I've never betrayed your faith
I'll never forsake your heart
I'll never forget your face
There's a feeling that I can't describe
There's a reason that I cannot hide
Because I've never seen a light that's so bright
As the light that shines behind your eyes

I can see
This life
And what you mean to me

And when I dreamed
I dreamed of you
Then I wake
Tell me what could I do?

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
And find a way back home
