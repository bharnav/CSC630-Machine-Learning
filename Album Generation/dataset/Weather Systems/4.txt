Sunlight failed
But only for a while
In the moonlight pale
Someone made me smile
The shining almost took me
But I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me
And I ran for miles

Sunlight
In a billion dreams
That are lost and won
Moonlight
In spite of all you've seen
There's only one way out

(Say you will)
In a billion dreams
That are lost and won
(Love me until I leave the world)

(Say you will)
In spite of all you've seen
There's only one way out
(Love me until I leave the world)

(Say you will)
In a billion dreams
That are lost and won
(Love me until I leave the world)

(Say you will)
In spite of all you've seen
There's only one way out
(Love me until I leave the world)
