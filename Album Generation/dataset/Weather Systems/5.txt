Never, never
Ever
Worry
I will always
Always
Be there
For you
Found you
Found you
I will never, ever
Leave you
Never
I will always
Be here
With you
Getting better, better, better
Better, better, better

It's getting colder
I'm getting colder, colder
It's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel
Anything at all
It's getting colder
It's getting colder, colder

Come on, come on
On me, on me
Touching, laughing
Ha ha
Love me, love me
For me
Holding
Watching
Loving
Getting better, better, better
Better, better, better

It's getting colder
I'm getting colder, colder
It's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel
Anything at all

It's getting colder
It's getting colder, colder
I'm getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel
Anything at all

It ebbs and flows and comes and goes
And rips you up and lets you go
It eats inside and splits your mind
As you search around for others kind
You gather strength from the depths
Fight the fight from day 'til night

This beautiful feeling soars over the skies
Moving through my body out my mind
It rises up and floods my brain
This is fucking insane
This is fucking insane

(Am I still here? As one with the fear
Am I still alive? As one with the fear
Am I still here? As one with the fear
Am I still alive? As one with the fear
Am I still here? As one with the fear
Am I still alive? As one with the fear
Am I still here? As one with the fear
Am I still alive? I'm still fucking here
Am I still here?)
