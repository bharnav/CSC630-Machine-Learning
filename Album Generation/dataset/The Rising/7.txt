[Verse 1]
I been watching you a long time
Trying to figure out where and when
We been moving down that same line
Time is now maybe we could get skin to skin

[Chorus]
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of coming to an end
Don't know when this chance might come again
Good times got a way of slipping away
Let's be friends, baby, let's be friends

[Verse 2]
I know we're different you and me
Got a different way of walking
The time has come to let the past be history
Yeah, if we could just start talking

[Chorus]

[Bridge][x2]
Do, do do doo do do do doo[x3]
Let's be friends

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of talk going around you
Let them talk, you know you're the only one
There's a lot of walls need tearing down
Together we could take them down one by one

[Chorus]
