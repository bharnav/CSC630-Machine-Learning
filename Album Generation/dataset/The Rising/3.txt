[Verse 1]
I don't remember how I felt
I never thought I'd live
To read about myself
In my hometown paper
How my brave young life
Was forever changed
In a misty cloud of pink vapor

[Chorus]
Darling, give me your kiss
Only understand
I am the nothing man

[Verse 2]
Around here everybody acts the same
Around here everybody acts like nothing's changed
Friday night club meets at Al's Barbecue
The sky is still the same unbelievable blue

[Chorus]
Darling, give me your kiss
Come and take my hand
I am the nothing man

[Verse 3]
You can call me Joe
Buy me a drink and shake my hand
You want courage
I'll show you courage you can understand
Pearl and silver
Resting on my night table
It's just me Lord, pray I'm able

[Chorus]
Darlin' with this kiss
Say you understand
I am the nothing man
I am the nothing man
