[Verse 1]
Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road

Got on my dead man's suit and my smiling skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Chorus 1]
Further on up the road[x2]

[Chorus 2]
Where the way dark and the night is cold
One sunny morning we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Verse 2]
Now I been out in the desert, just doing my time
Searching through the dust, looking for a sign
If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burning in my soul
So let's take the good times as they go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2][x2]
