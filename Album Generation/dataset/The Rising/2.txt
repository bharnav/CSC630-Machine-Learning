[Verse 1]
It's raining but there isn't a cloud in the sky
Must have been a tear from your eye
Everything will be okay
Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
Must have been you sighing so deep
Don't worry, we're going to find a way

[Chorus]
I'm waiting, waiting on a sunny day
Going to chase the clouds away
Waiting on a sunny day

[Verse 2]
Without you, I'm working with the rain falling down
Half a party in a one dog town
I need you to chase the blues away
Without you, I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
And ice cream truck on a deserted street
I hope that you're coming to stay

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hard times baby, well they come to us all
Sure as the ticking of the clock on the wall
Sure as the turning of the night into day
Your smile girl, brings the morning light to my eyes
Lifts away the blues when I rise
I hope that you're coming to stay
