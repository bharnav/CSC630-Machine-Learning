[Verse 1]
Baby, once I thought I knew
Everything I needed to know about you
Your sweet whisper, your tender touch
I didn't really know that much
Joke's on me, but it's going to be okay
If I can just get through this lonesome day

[Chorus]
Lonesome day

[Verse 2]
Hell's brewing, dark sun's on the rise
This storm will blow through, by and by
House is on fire, vipers in the grass
Little revenge and this too shall pass
This too shall pass, darling, yeah I'm going to pray
Right now, all I got is this lonesome day

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah[x4]

[Verse 3]
Better ask questions before you shoot
Deceit and betrayal's a bitter fruit
It's hard to swallow, come time to pay
That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away
Thy kingdom come, I'm going to find my way
Yeah, through this lonesome day

[Chorus][x3]

[Bridge][x6]

[Chorus][x3]
