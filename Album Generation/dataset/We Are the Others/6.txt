Carved your name in my heart
Love will tear us apart
Unavoidable the break
Carved your name in my heart
Love will tear us apart
We both realised from the start

All our expectation's the same
So why do I take the blame?
You yourself were king of the game
So why do I pay for your pain?

Can you believe
I still think of you?
Can you believe
I still dream we could turn around?
But I forgave, forgot too many times
