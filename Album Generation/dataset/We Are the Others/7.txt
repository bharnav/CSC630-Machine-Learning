Here I am in all my majesty
And there is nothing you won't get to see
Come along and I'll give you my world
In one-hundred-forty characters

Don't you try to analyse
We are just ways to reach the stars
Can't you see it's generation me
I don't need anyone or anything
I'll make it alone
Can't you see it's generation me
We don't need anyone or anything
Just leave me alone

On and off? I spend my time in vain
In getting everyone to know my name
All I know is my face looks fuckin right
From this certain angle certain light

Don't you try to criticise
No crime a product of our time
So here I am [x3]

Can't you see it's generation me
I don't need anyone or anything
I'll make it alone
Can't you see it's generation me
We don't need anyone or anything
Just leave me alone
