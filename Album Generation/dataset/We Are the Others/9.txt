This city drinks and roars
Each word so meaningless
Each word, especially yours, echoes inside my head

[Bridge:]
Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me?

[Chorus:]
So are you done with me
And if you are won't you just let me be?
I'm trying to understand your reason for leaving
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and screams
This appum? never end
This city made of dreams
My dreams have turned to sand

[Bridge + Chrous]
So are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep?
Did you realize that I can't be all you need
Are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep
Love is gonna die and die again

[Chorus x2]
This city drinks and roars
