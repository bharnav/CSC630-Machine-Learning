I've broken down, I'm a nervous wreck
My heart is beating out of my chest
And nothing feels familiar at all to me
Yeah, to me

My head is like a traffic jam
I can't stop crashing into bed
When I panic, yeah, I find it hard to breathe
Yeah, to breathe

[Chorus]
I can't get your face out of my head
It makes my brain hurt
I need radiosurgery

I'm hearing voices that are not there
When no one calls I could be anywhere
No medication can stop this spreading through me
Yeah, through me

[Chorus]

My best friends, they don't even know that my mind is going a thousand miles an hour
I climb walls just to see the world but time slows down
Minutes turn to hours
I force myself to open my eyes, but I lose control
Hope turns to madness
I can't stop myself from walking backwards

[Chorus]

I've broken down, I'm a nervous wreck
My heart is beating out of my chest

I can't get your face out of my head
I need radiosurgery, radiosurgery
