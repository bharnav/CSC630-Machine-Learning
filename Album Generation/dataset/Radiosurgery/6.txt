[Verse 1]
It's about time
We wrote our names in the cement
It's been killing you to say it, so let's begin
Affecting you more than you'd like me to believe
And it comes in many forms of excuses and at least

[Hook]
Look them in the eyes, tell them what they want to hear
Yeah, that's when everyone falls, my dear
Look me in the eyes, tell me what I want to hear
You know I'll never fall for it

[Chorus 1]
But when you need a boy around you, just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door
When you need a boy around you, just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

[Verse 2]
I got time
I'm gonna wait another minute
So tell me your lies, I'll let you finish
Distracting me more than I'm liking to admit
And it goes without saying, you have a lot to do with it

[Hook]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Don't waste my time
You're never gonna change my mind
When you need a boy around, you just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So when you need someone around you
(Ba ba ba, ba ba ba)
So when you need someone around you
Don't come knocking on my door

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Don't come knocking on my door
Don't come knocking
When you need a boy around you[x2]
