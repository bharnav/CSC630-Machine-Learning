[Verse 1]
Bury me under a crooked sidewalk
That's where we allegedly met
I knew that this would end
When the lines weren't drawn across your bed
I know that I'm not a smooth talker
I know my eyes are the wrong color
To see you open up your willing eyes and say
"Did you mean it? 'Cause I didn't hear it"

[Chorus]
What did you say as I walked out the door?
Did you want me want me back?
Did you want me?
What did you say as I walked out the door?
Did you want me want me back?

[Verse 2]
Bury me six feet under your bedroom
That's about as far as you could get
I knew that this would end
When you packed me up and declared me for dead
You knew that I was a pushover
So you pushed me right over the edge
I must say you never looked so good in black
But did you mean it?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you're having second thoughts, then you better speak up
You didn't want me, you didn't need me
What did you say as I walked out the door?
Did you want me back?
I'm amazed that we made it this far, we've been through this before
And my hope is lost
I'm amazed that we made it this far, we've been through this before
And my hope is lost
My hope is lost

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Did you want me want me back?
If you're having second thoughts, then you better speak up
Do you want me? Do you need me?
What did you say as I walked out the door?
Did you want me? Do you want me back?
