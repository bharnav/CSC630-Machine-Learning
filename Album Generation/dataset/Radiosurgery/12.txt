[Verse 1]
I've been here before
I've heard all these words
You need a new plan
Going to have to better get to my heart
You used your looks
You love the staring eyes
I don't see them
Going to have to better get to my heart
You finally notice that
I was sneaking slowly inside your head
Did you know that it was
Just me falling for you

[Chorus 1]
Over again[x3]
You knew that I was falling for you
Over again

[Chorus 2]
I wrote you songs
I sent you letters
Gave you my records
(Going to have to better get to my heart)

[Verse 2]
Gave you my soul
Spent all my time
It doesn't matter
Going to have to better get to my heart
Can you tell me if there's any
Chance of you fitting me in really leave me alone
Standing there waiting again
Can you tell yourself to open up this time
Maybe give me one more shot no hands to block me from falling

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
I wish I could go back to when it was good
You don't remember the things that you should
(I know every line that's on your face)
(You'll never look at you the further you move away)

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Outro]
Going to have to better get them all
