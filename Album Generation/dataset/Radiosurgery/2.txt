[Verse 1]
I woke up Saturday morning
Didn't look in the mirror
I don't want to see my face today
Forgot everything that you told me
About needing space
And how I keep getting in your way (uh oh)
How did I survive the downfall
Two wrongs don't make a right here at all (uh oh)
How did I survive the downfall
Don't you worry about that

[Chorus]
You keep bringing me down because you know I let you
Drill it in my brain so I won't forget you
Hold you back when I don't deserve you
Wanting you more the more I know you

[Verse 2]
I could be falling to pieces
And you wouldn't notice if I was at your feet
If you needed constant attention or constant affection
You always looked further than me (uh oh)
How you took me as a fool, girl
But I knew it from the moment I knew her
Before you do me in like that
Can't we lay on our backs and
Think about the times we had

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Now I finally found you
Where in the world have you been
I would never let something
And regret come between us again
Nothing will come between us again
Nothing will come between us

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Drill it in my brain[x2]
Drill it in my brain so I won't forget you
(Drill it in my brain[x2])
Hold you back when I don't deserve you
Wanting you more the more I know you
