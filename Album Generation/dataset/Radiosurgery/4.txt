[Verse 1]
Would you save me or leave me behind
Don't say maybe you don't know what I'd do
I put it on the line because we all

[Pre-Chorus]
Looked through your diary
Tell me everything you know
Before I go before I go

[Chorus]
Set this whole town on fire
Take you with me to watch it burn
Is this what you wanted
Look at what you started

[Verse 2]
Would you take me so far away from here
I'm not crazy for crawling back to you
I wonder all the time
When you're all alone
Do you wonder where I am
I can be where you want
Just say the right words
But you won't

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Then it hit me
Should I go that far
For a girl doesn't ever
Really know what she wants
[x2]
For a girl doesn't ever
Know what's she wants
(She doesn't know what she wants)
She doesn't know what she wants

[Pre-Chorus]
I read through your diary
Tell me everything you know
Before I go before I go

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yeah look at what you started
