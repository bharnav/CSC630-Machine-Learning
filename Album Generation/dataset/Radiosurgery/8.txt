[Verse 1]
Lately I've been pulled down so hard
I can barely afford to miss out on you
I would be rich by now if I'd saved my breath
Careful it doesn't pay to be so regretful
No, I won't look back
And if I had the guts right now to take it
But I don't think I will make it

[Chorus]
I want to kiss you so hard that your lips bleed
And I want to hold you so tight that your ribs break
And in the end, we'll both know who we are
A body full of memories and battle scars

[Verse 2]
Blame me every chance that you get
I'm hopeful that this won't ruin us yet
You'll gladly risk your neck to tell me how
This will never work out

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
How will I leave when my veins are broken
I can barely see when I'm stuck in my moment
Coming undone to the backbone of our memory
Falling asleep to the promise of our melody
You'll risk your neck to tell me how
This will never work out

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Memories and battle scars
(Yeah)
In the end, we'll both know who we are
A body full of memories and battle scars
