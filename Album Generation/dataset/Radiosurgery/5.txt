[Intro]
Let's go!

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
You always thought that you could be
Oh, with just about anyone
You know the right way to get around in my head
Whoa
I never had the chance
There was no letting up
It was over before I put the key in the door
Whoa
I stayed all night till you asked me to go
I remake it every time that I am alone
And it's only now that I'm finding out

[Chorus 2]
You were, you were the only one to break my heart
You were the only one to break my heart
If I could just go back to the start
I'd tell myself I don't need anyone

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
You always knew that you could have me
Or just about anyone
And now I'm stuck here with a mouth full of regret
Whoa

[Chorus 3]
We talked all night till the sun showed up
I confessed my love but that wasn't enough
And it's only now that I'm finding out

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Verse 3]
You wait around for the perfect time
Changing your plans, changing your mind
When you got up and left me
Did you think that you'd forget me?
Yeah did you think that you'd forget me?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
You were, you were the only one to break my heart
I don't need anyone
You were, you were the only one to break my heart
I still remember how

[Chorus 3]

[Outro: Spoken]
You'd never think a girl so beautiful
Would be so cold a killer
