[Verse 1]
Things are looking up
Now the stars are all aligned
I prefer apologies on greeting cards with underlines
Finally looking up
Finally keeping you in mind
You can take advantage of me thinking ahead of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh I know you'll never find a way out without me

[Verse 2]
Stuck
Hearing your repeating lies
It's okay to to patch it up here and there
With tearing eyes
Keep it up
You will never realize
All the friends you're losing will add up in time

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh I know you'll never find a way out without me
Oh I know you'll never find a way out

[Chorus]
There's a map of your body hanging over my head
It's a curse not having you to hold again
By the time I figured this all out, you let me go
Oh oh oh oh whoa

[Verse 3]
Now our time is up
Now we're exchanging goodbyes
It was better before before that meaningless kiss
Breaking up
Hiding all the evidence
I know it's a fact you fell more than you ever did

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge][x2]
I remember, like it was yesterday
When it was you and me against the world
(Whoa)


[Pre-Chorus]
And oh I know you'll never find a way out[x2]
Without you

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh whoa
