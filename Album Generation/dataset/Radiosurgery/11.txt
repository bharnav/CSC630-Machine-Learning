[Verse 1]
You'll never get away with it
Just because you have a way with words
To tell me the truth when ever that ends
You waited what good for you
Is for us to be in separate beds

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to not string me along

[Chorus]
(So) Stay with me now maybe
I know you barely know me
Are we going to be anything
Find out in the morning
[x2]

[Verse 2]
You're never going to let me forget it
It's drilled to my brain I have nothing to prove
Nothing good comes from telling the truth
So it's obvious why we lie in separate beds

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Stay with me and tell me
Nothing's changed
Covers rearranged
Nothing's changed
Colors rearranged

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Are we going to be anything
Oh
