[Intro]
Hey ho, let's go[x2]

[Chorus 1]
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

[Chorus 2]
Hey ho, let's go
Shoot them in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Hey ho, let's go[x4]
