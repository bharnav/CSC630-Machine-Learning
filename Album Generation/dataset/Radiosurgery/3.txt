[Intro]
"The wild pulse beat of their young blood beats out a reckless rhythm
Every young girl wants her guy and every guy is looking for"

[Verse 1]
Knock-knocking on your bedroom door
Standing here wondering what I'm doing this for
Don't know where my mind went
I need to piece together the events that led me here
(So let's go)
I don't know your name at all
Told me over a band I've never heard before
Lost you in the moment
I know I'm hard to follow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't mean to cause you trouble
But your lips were too close to my mouth
(So let's go)

[Chorus 1]
She said that I'm not the one
That she should bring home tonight
(She said I'm not the one)
And I know that she's not the one
That I should bring home tonight

[Chorus 2]
Have you made up, o-oh
Have you made up your mind?
Don't think this over
Have you made up, o-oh
Have you made up your mind?
Don't think this over

[Verse 2]
Knock-knocking on your bedroom door
Can't help but feel like I've done this before
Hoping that my jaw breaks
So I can't talk my way out of this web I've spun
(So let's go)
I'm throwing your name around
Driving to your house on the other side of town
Hoping that I break down
I need to get it together

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Let's cross that bridge when we get to it
I won't be alone, no I want your number
Let's cross that bridge when we get to it
Write it down on my hand so I won't forget
[x2]
I didn't mean to cause you trouble
I didn't mean to ruin your night

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
I'm not the one she should bring home tonight
She said that I'm not the one
That she should bring home tonight
She said I'm not the one
