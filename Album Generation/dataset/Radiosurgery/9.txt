[Verse 1]
I'm ready to pick my weary head off the floor
To be someone that you can't ignore
I'll be original, someone to keep your secret safe with
And so you let yourself in
You made your way through my room again and again
You made a habit out of getting under my skin
You said you don't but you do

[Chorus]
Falling in love is like a trainwreck
If you make it out alive
You still haven't made it
So tell me the truth
You don't know what you do
So tell me the truth
You don't know what you do to me (do you)

[Verse 2]
I'll say whatever's crossing my mind
After time whatever you want I'll find
I'll be the capital of whatever state you live in

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You don't know what you'er putting me through
Finding it I'm finding it hard
To keep it all together
And I'll break it all apart
Finding it yeah I'm finding it hard
Call me good, call me good
Like you said you would
You got me wrapped around
So tight like you said you would
And the worst has to be on it's way
I'll feel how you want me to feel
I'll say the things you wanted me to say
I'll be your tell-it-all
I'll be original
I'll be nothing at all

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I'll be original
I'll be nothing at all
