[Verse 1: New Found Glory]
What a waste of regrets and side glances
I should have let it all end, and not answered
Using your pain as your way to bring me closer
Oh, to bring me closer
Your inviting words never hurt or caused a scene, and
I'm just a name onto your breath, not a feeling
A patient boy waiting on your mattress
Just a patient boy waiting in the back

[Chorus: New Found Glory]
Oh, I'm caught in the act
Before tonight, let's do something that we're gonna regret
Gonna regret
Oh, I'm caught in the act
Before tonight, let's do something that we'll never forget
Never forget

[Verse 2: New Found Glory]
What a waste of high hopes, you leveled them out
I think I just might be in the thick of it
Using your body as your way to bring me closer
Come on and bring me closer

[Chorus: New Found Glory]

[Bridge: New Found Glory]
Your inviting curves never hurt or caused a scene, and
I'm just a name that you forgot, now we're even
A patient boy waiting on your mattress
Just a patient boy waiting in the back

[Chorus 2: Bethany Cosentino and New Found Glory]
Oh, I'm caught in the act
Before tonight, let's do something that we'll never, never forget
Let's do something that we'll never, never forget[x2]

[Chorus 1: Bethany Cosentino and New Found Glory]

[Outro: Bethany Cosentino and New Found Glory]
Oh, I'm caught in the act
Before tonight, I'm just a patient boy
Waiting in the back, oh
Caught in the act
Before tonight, let's do something that we're gonna regret
Gonna regret
Oh, I'm caught in the act
Before tonight, let's do something that we'll never forget
Never forget
