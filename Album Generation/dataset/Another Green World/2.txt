[Verse 1]
Brown Eyes and I were tired
We had walked and we had scrambled
Through the moors and through the briars
Through the endless blue meanders

[Chorus]
In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon

[Verse 2]
Over the nights and through the fires
We went surging down the wires
Through the towns and on the highways
Through the storms in all their thundering

[Chorus]
In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon

[Verse 3]
Then we rested in a desert
Where the bones were white as teeth, sir
And we saw St. Elmo's Fire
Splitting ions in the ether

[Epic Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon
In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon
