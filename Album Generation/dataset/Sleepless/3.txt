His face cries out from the flood
Fish me out and I'll do you some good
You who are blood of my blood
You'd kill me for kicks if you could

Run silent, run deep, run river run

Her lips wash by, well rehearsed
I am living to love you, well
Lady, you're dying of thirst
And soon you'll be drownin' in hell

Run silent, run deep
Run silent, run deep
Run silent, run deep, run river run

Run river run
Run river run
Oooo, ha!

Run silent run deep, run river run

This flood was long overdue
And I couldn't save you if I tried
Only your terror rings true
I'll saddle my seahorse and ride

Run silent, run deep
Run silent, run deep
Run. Run silent, run deep
Run river run
Blood of my blood
You're dying of thirst (run river, run)
(run river run)
(run river run)

Ride you up
Ride river ride
Ride river ride
Ride river ride
