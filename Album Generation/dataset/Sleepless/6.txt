Mmmmm

You wanna feel, you wanna touch
Somthing inside you, something so much
You pick 'em, you lay 'em down
You play your life out all over town

Hey Jordan, that's a boy's name on a girl
Are you still undecided?
It's such a crazy world

Hey Jordan, life's a river and it bends
The search for love abiding, just never seems to end
You can play through all these changes
From midnight until dawn
And still come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone

When my turn comes, what can I do?
The night's in me, like the night's in you
When morning comes, the going's low
Will you stay with me, or will you go?

Hey Jordan, life's a river and it bends
The search for love abiding, just never seems to end
You can play through all these changes
From midnight until dawn
And still come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone

Same old round and round
We're either lost or found
Or somewhere in between

Hey Jordan, that's a boy's name on a girl
Are you still undecided?
It's such a crazy world

Hey Jordan, life's a river and it bends
The search for love abiding, just never seems to end
You can play through all these changes
From midnight until dawn
And still come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
Hey Jordan, don't come down alone
