Whoah baby, I might be a fool
Waste my time not going to school
The way you love me, you love me so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Oh baby, you got me so blind
You got my mother running circles
'Bout to lose my mind
The way you love me, you love me so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Alright
Come on baby

Now baby you're as sweet as you can be
Everything you do is into me
The kiss of your lips, the touch of your hand
Watever you're doing child is really grand
Oh baby, baby, baby, what can I do
You got a wooga wooga mamma googa runnin' round about you
The way you love me, you love me so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Alright

Now baby, you're as sweet as you can be
Everything you do is into me
The kiss of your lips, the touch of your hand
Whatever you're doing, child is really grand
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, what can I do?
My, my, my, wanna be in love with
The way you love me, you love me so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
