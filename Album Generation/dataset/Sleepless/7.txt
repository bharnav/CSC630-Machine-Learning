"Alright, this is a story about being double parked on the highway of love. Let me hear you Shawn!" (Let me in)

Take me back, yeah, 1994
I had two fine chicks livin' door to door
And that was too close together
Too close together (too close together)
That was too close together
That was the best that I could do

Well, I got up early one mornin'
Make my midnight creep
I got talent, I got one girl goin'
The other was lookin' at me
That's too close together (too close together) let me tell ya'
Man, too close together (too close together)
Yeah, too close together
That's the best that I could do

Aw, come on, dig in, (Hey!)
Stetch your legs, baby
Keith, come on
Yabba, yabba, baby!

Well, I slipped in the back door to get me a little toddy
Before I walked out the front door they both knew all about it
That was too close together (too close together)
Trouble! Too close together (too close)
That was the best that I could do

Well, I drove in my car, down to get outta town
Saw two fine chicks, they were just hangin' around
That was too close, baby
Oh, man that was too close together (too close together)
That was too close together
That was the best that I could do

Take me witcha when you go

"Make it? That felt good!"
