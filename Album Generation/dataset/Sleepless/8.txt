Let's go home, baby
It's time to turn in
When we lie down together
Are you thinkin' of him?
There's some things about love that never let go
There's some things you don't wanna know

The cold lonely morning
In the heat of the night
You don't know what you'll do
To make you fell right
There's some things about love that never let go
There's some things you don't wanna know

There's some things we never should say
It's not worth the price that we pay

Yes!

There's some things about us we never should tell
The heart we have in us is deep as a well
There's some things about love that never let go
There's some things you don't wanna know
There's some things about love that never let go
There's some things I don't wanna know
