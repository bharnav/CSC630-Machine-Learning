The day is gone
And I'm just drifting on
Same old song
Comes to haunt me 'til she comes

Five o'clock angel
Whispers like a reverie
Five o'clock angel
Sings a secret song to me
To some secret part of me

The world goes blue
And I don't know what to do
And I think of you
How you always get me through

Five o'clock angel
Whispers like a reverie
Five o'clock angel
Sings a secret song to me
To some secret part of me

Blue night the floatin' of the light
So right on an after heaven's laughter

Five o'clock angel
Whispers like a reverie
Five o'clock angel
Sings a secret song to me
To some secret part of me
