When I'm past the boulevards
Out here underneath the stars
I've been flyin' past the houses, farms and fields

Leavin' all I know, back home
Rushin' through the cold night air
I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel

Stayin' clear of the interstates
I'm seekin' out these old two lanes
And tryin' to explain the way I feel

'Til all at once it's half past three
And it's down to the trust and me
And I'm holdin' on to nothing but the wheel

I've been trying to drive you off my mind
Let it that way be, I can leave it all behind

An' 41 goes on and on
And the lights go winding in the dawn
And the sky's the color now of polished steel

An' the only think I know for sure
You don't want me anymore
Then I'm holdin' on to nothing but the wheel

I've been trying to drive you off my mind
An' let it that way baby, I can leave it all behind

And the only thing I know for sure
Is that you don't want me anymore
An' I'm holdin' on to nothing but the wheel
An' I'm holdin' on to nothing but the wheel

Gettin' down old 41
An' 41 takes me on and on
An' the lights go winding in the dawn
An' I'm holdin' on in the corner, yeah

I'm holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
An' the only thing I know for sure
Is you don't want me anymore
An' I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
