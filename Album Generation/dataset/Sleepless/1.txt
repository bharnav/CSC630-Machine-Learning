Oh, I, Oh yeah

If yesterday were still here today
I think I might
I might do it all, I just might do it all
Another way

I feel the passing of the years in the teardrops
I see shadows everywhere
But I still do carry on
Though there's a lot of good ones gone

Empty space where one I saw a face
Memories stand by me now
You know I need you now
Keep on going

I feel the passing of the years in the teardrops
I see shadows everywhere
But I still do carry on
Though there's a lot of good ones gone

There's so much I have see
It comes to haunt me in my dreams
In the stillness of the night

I feel the passing of the years in the teardrops
I see shadows everywhere
But I still do carry on
Though there's a lot of good ones gone
I still do carry on
Though there's a lot of good ones gone
