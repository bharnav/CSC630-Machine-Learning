Life is a dead end street
Oh, but the music's sweet
Shine in your finery
For a day tonight

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's hold on while we can
Tomorrow will come
And we will be gone
Our lives are drifting sand

Here, on the Silver Strand
We talk in a Spanish hand
We sing "Siempre a la moda mi corazon"

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's hold on while we can
Tomorrow will come
And we will be gone
Our lives are drifting sand

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's close our eyes and dream
And live in a song where nothing is wrong
And there's a place for you and me

The world is a sad place
So put on a brave face
And dance
Make a wish on a wild wind
Let it fly to the world's end
And dance, and dance, and dance

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's hold on while we can
Tomorrow will come
And we will be gone
Our lives are drifting sand

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's close our eyes and dream
And live in a song where nothing is wrong
And there's a place for you and me

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's hold on while we can
Tomorrow will come
And we will be gone
Our lives are drifting sand

Oh, Marianne (Oh, Marianne)
Let's close our eyes and dream
And live in a song where nothing is wrong
And there's a place for you and me
