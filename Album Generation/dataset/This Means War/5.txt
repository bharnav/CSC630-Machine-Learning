I've given all that I have to give
Taking all of the lives that I can
Will this be my last? (There's no end in sight)
When will all of my brothers know?

I'll fight this war alone
If that's what it takes to get home to you
I'll fight this war alone

I've lost control again and the night is closing in
How do I keep my feet on the floor, when I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
Cause I have you, to come home to

Take a step back and finally think for yourself
You're living a life full of lying
I'm over this process of letting my life be run by your desire

I'll fight this war alone
'Cause that's what it takes to come home to you
I'll fight this war alone

I've lost control again and the night is closing in
I've gotta be whole within, so my life is mine again
How do I keep my feet on the floor, when I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
'Cause I have you, to come home to
('Cause I have you, to come home to.)
('Cause I have you, to come home to.)

I'm never gonna give up hope
I'm never gonna give up hope
I'm never gonna give up hope
I'll never give up until I'm dead
And if you want me to, you'll have to take my life

I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war alone!
