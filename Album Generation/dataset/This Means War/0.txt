Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution!

For the first time
I understand what it means to have taken a life
I don't think I can handle this
I feel my sanity slipping away

All is lost!
Everything has been taken away from me
All is lost!
Everything that I've known is gone

Can you hear the voices in your head?
Listen to what they're saying

There's no more time to be wasted
Cause I've wasted all my life
Giving to the sin when I had a mind
Waoh, waoh, waoh, waoh

There's the blood of another man
On my hands (on my hands)
Why do I feel so comfortable?
What's happening to me?

All is lost!
Everything has been taken away from me
All is lost!
Everything that I've love is gone

Can you hear the voices in your head?
Listen to what they're saying
I can hear the voices in my head!
Listen to what they're saying

There's no more time to be wasted
Cause I've wasted all my life
Giving to the sin when I had a mind
Waoh, waoh, waoh, waoh

There's no more time to be wasted
Cause I've wasted all my life (all my life)
Giving to the sin when I had a mind
Waoh, waoh, waoh, waoh

You've never been where I've been
You've never seen what I've seen
You've never had to spend a day with a cage around your mind
Just set me free!
Set me free!

Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution!
