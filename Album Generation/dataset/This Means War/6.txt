[Verse 1]
There's somebody else inside my head
He's telling me to give up, he's telling me to give up
I'm being taken down from the inside out
I think I'm gonna die here!

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you now, when nothing's making sense

[Chorus]
This time is not my perspective
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree

[Verse 2]
Let's face the facts, shall we?
My life, my life will never be the same
There's no time to make a change

I'm hopeless, I'm broken
I'm beaten, bruised, and bleeding
Oh God, where are you, now?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you now, when nothing's making sense

[Chorus]
This time is not my perspective
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree

And I know it's just what you're thinking
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree

[Bridge]
(I've put it all on the line for you)
(I've put my life on the line for you)

I've put it all on the line for you
I've put my life on the line for you
I've put my life on the line for you
So, why did you say goodbye to me?

[Chorus]
This time is not my perspective
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree

And I know it's just what you're thinking
There's something wrong with me
And I can't seem to agree
