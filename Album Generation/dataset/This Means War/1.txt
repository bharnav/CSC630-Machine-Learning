Get up!

How can you say you never knew me?
I put my life on the line to keep this family alive
Hour after hour, day after day
Where's the meaning? Where's the passion?
Where's the passion?

Don't try to say you've forgotten about me
I know the thought of us is creeping in your mind
You drove me crazy, now there's no maybe
So grab your guns, and pick your side

Cause this means war!
This means war!

I'm going to turn around and walk right out that door
And in your mind you've never seen my face before
Somehow (somehow), they've made you believe
Believe in the lie

Don't let them take me away
Don't let them take me away
Don't let them take me away
Oh God, don't let them take me

Don't try to say you've forgotten about me
I know the thought of us is creeping in your mind
You drove me crazy, now there's no maybe
So grab your guns, and pick your side

After all that they've put me through
I just wanna come back to you
After all that they've put me through

Just remember me!
Remember me!
Come on!

Just remember me!
