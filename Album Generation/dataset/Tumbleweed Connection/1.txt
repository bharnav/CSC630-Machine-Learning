[Verse 1]
In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

[Chorus]
Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

[Verse 2]
Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a hard love to get
And I, I've walked most all the way and I, I have not heard her call
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
There are women, women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night
