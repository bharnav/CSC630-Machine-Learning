[Verse 1]
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans well that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Aaa aaa aaa)
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

[Verse 2]
As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

[Chorus x5]

[Outro]
The riverboat sails tonight
That's just fine alright
(Aaa aaa aaa)
Ohh, slip us a rope
Sail on round, sail on round, sail on round, sail on round
(Sail)
Sail on round the bend
The riverboat sails tonight
All are there
That's just fine alright
