[Verse 1]
I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah
With the sun behind my back
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago
The day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice
Of the things they've had to say
And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be
I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not that guy, or so it seems
To fill my old man's shoes

[Chorus][x4]
Like I'm a wicked way of life
The kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail
And tied up in their chains
Oh it's hard and I can't see
What they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think
I should step into the old man's shoes
