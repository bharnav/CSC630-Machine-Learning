Don't go acting all innocent
It suits you all too much
I know the messages we've sent
Have helped us get in touch
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now

Don't want you making no big mistake
Especially when it's dark
Not to mention the risk you take
While drinking in the park
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now

The triumph of hope over experience
My faith has been restored
An uncommon sense of commonsense
Sure is its own reward
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now
Don't go acting all innocent
Look at you now
