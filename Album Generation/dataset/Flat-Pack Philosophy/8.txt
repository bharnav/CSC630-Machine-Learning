Standing around staring into space
Trying to see what's going on inside you
Shouts from the crowd well that's just not allowed
Take a look at what they made you do
When you're looking at a line of blue

Where did you go what did you know
What happened when the wind blew through
And the thoughts you receive make you what you believe
Then you're hanging onto everything you knew

Big brother wheels
Gonna stamp it out of you in time
Gonna make you jump and walk the line

With your mind on the blink hands tied to the sink
All you think is double think double think

Big brother wheels
Gonna stamp it out of you in time
Gonna make you jump and walk the line

Jack boot stamps all over you face
Jack boot stamps all over the place
