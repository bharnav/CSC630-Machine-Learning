No matter what I try is no good for you
Everything that I say, everything that I do
It's crystal clear now that we're going nowhere
And that once was a dream has become this nightmare
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

Now I know how it feels to have loved and lost
Because of pride
To be deserted so that hurt is all that's left inside
I'm ashamed I've been blamed so much I wanted to die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

What makes me think I mean nothing to you?
Everything that you say, everything that you do
All you excuses, the lies you invent
Provide more than a little discouragement
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

Now I know how it fells to have loved and lost
Because of pride
To be deserted so that hurt is all that's left inside
I'm ashamed I've been blamed so much I wanted to die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
