I'm a soul survivor and I live in a world of tack
Whatever they say it just rolls right across my back

Clinging wreckage I was alive
When the car crashed
Swam out the water before
My life started sinking fast

Well they messed with my mind
Tried to brainwash what I had
Somethings they can't find
So I guess that's not so bad

Yeah I'm counting the hours
You're a long time living dead
And yesterday's flowers will be placed
Upon your head

So come on come on come on come on
Let's roll through rings of fire
So come on come on come on come on
Let's light this flames desire
Let's light this flaming fire
Soul survivor
