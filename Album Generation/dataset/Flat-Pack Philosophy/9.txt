Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Will my dreams come true or am I simply wasting my time?

Well, I told you that I'm sorry, didn't mean to make you cry
But look at it from my point of view
It's the little things in life on which our happiness depends
And what's the use if any in trying to survive
All the problems that the world can provide
If at the end of all it we haven't got the time to be friends?

Well, I get this funny feeling that just won't stay away
You know it drives me almost out of my mind
It seems that life's too short to carry on the way that we do
Too much discrimination is keeping us apart
And I don't think I can take any more
I only hope and pray I can find a way to say "I love you"

Oh wouldn't it be great if we could be in that state forever
Just a moment with you in the next year or two or whenever
Let's make history together

Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Will my dreams come true or am I simply wasting my time?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
