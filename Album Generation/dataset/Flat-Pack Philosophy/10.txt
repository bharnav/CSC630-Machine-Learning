Heading for bad weather
Hard rain is gonna come
Everybody shakes to the sound of a gun

You might think you're clever
This thing will strike you dumb
Everybody shakes to the sound of a gun

You can live forever
Just like everyone
Everybody shakes to the sound of a gun

Bullets flying everywhere
What they hit they don't care
A sonic sound is in the air

This time it's now or never
Like a rabbit on the run
We could live together
The time has got to come
Everybody shakes
To the sound of a gun
