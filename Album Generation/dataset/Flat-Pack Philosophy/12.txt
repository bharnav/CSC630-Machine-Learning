This time I've made up my mind I've had enough
What a complete waste of time I've had enough

Each morning I wake to discover that nothing's changed
The love I wished for don't exist
If it's not one thing it's another - can't carry on
But I feel powerless to resist

Friends don't know what I go through I've had enough
Now see what you've made me do I've had enough

Been trapped in this state of denial for far too long
The love I've aimed for has been missed
But this time I'm serious, it's final
It would be wrong, don't wanna be a masochist

And I wish that there could be another way
But I can't believe a single word you say, anyway

Not gonna take any more I've had enough
Just what did you take me for? I've had enough

Each morning I wake and discover you're still the same
The love I crave for won't exist
It's neither one thing nor another - I won't go on
I hope I'll find strength to resist

Yes, it's the end of the line I've had enough
