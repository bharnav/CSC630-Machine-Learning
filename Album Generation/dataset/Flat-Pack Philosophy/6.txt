Breakfast in the room continental
So went to find a small caf√©
Latin lovers can be temperamental
You have to be careful what you say

God what have I done?

Trying hard to leave the past behind me
Hoping to avoid the same mistake
Haunting memories that still remind me
How lonely is the road that I must take

God what have I done?
Everything seems so strange
God what have I done?
Everything seems so strange
