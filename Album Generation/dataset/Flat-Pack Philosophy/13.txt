They say the best things in life are free
But now I'm not so sure
Something has crawled right in my mind
And opened up the door
Now and then it seems so strange
It leaves you insecure
And everything you thought you knew
Is different from before
Something stuck in my mind between heaven and hell

You might think that what you see
Is all there is for sure
But if you look behind your eyes
You'll see there's so much more
Darkness blanks your train of thought
And sticks in your mind's eye
You've got your feet still on the ground
But your head is in the sky
Something stuck in my mind between heaven and hell

Where things come from no one knows
What it does or where it goes
Sometimes life you just can't see
