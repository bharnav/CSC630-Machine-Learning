The lights are so bright all the things you wanted
Set within your sights you sell your soul tonight
And in the morning there's something not quite right
Sell you everything
Sell me everything

And every Friday night you've spent all your money
It's turned daylight well if it's wrong or right
Some things are funny under the street light
Sell you everything
Sell me everything

Yeah the lights are so bright
And all the things you wanted
Set within you sights
Sell you everything
Sell me everything
