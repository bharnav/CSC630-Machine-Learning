Paradise is a platinum card
Behind the wheel of your car
With your new pair of trainers
Designer clothes
Go on, I'll have seven of those
And go to ski where it snows
Its bounty sustains us

Credit
In love with the never never
Wish I could get something I really need

Videophones
With all the latest ringtones
You buy-to-let your new home
Don't care what you're spending
Then just like that
Reminders under the mat
Of your flat full of tat
The pile of debts never ending

Credit
In love with the never never
Wish I could get something I really need
