[Intro]
Well I went to school...Oh
Well I went to school...ha ha

[Verse 1]
Well I went to school in Olympia
And everyone's the same
What do you do with a revolution?
When I went to school in Olympia
And everyone's the same
We look the same
We talk the same
Don't you please

[Chorus]
Make me real, fuck you
Make me sick, fuck you
Make me real, fuck you

[Verse 2]
Well I went to school in Olympia
Everyone's the same
And so are you, in Olympia
Everyone's the same
We look the same
We talk the same
We even fuck the same
Well I went to school in Olympia
Don't you please

[Chorus]
Make me real, come on
Make me sick, come on
Make me real, yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it for the kids

Well I went to school in Olympia

Goodbye
Goodbye
