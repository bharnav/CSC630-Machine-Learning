[Chorus:]
For so long, I was out in the cold
And I tought myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

[Verse:]
I came so close to the edge of defeat
But I made my way in the shade
Keepin' out of the heat
It was fun shooting out of the stars
Looking into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

[Bridge:]
Home
Where there's nothing but sweet surrender
To the memories from afar
Home
To the place where the truth lies waiting
We remember who we are

[Chorus:]
For too long,I was out on my own
Everyday I spent trying to prove I can make it alone
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

[Outro:]
Home
To the place where the truth lies waiting
We remember who we are
For so long, I was out in the cold
But I taught myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
