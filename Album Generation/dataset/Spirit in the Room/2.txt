One, two
Oh One two three oh

Death went out to the sinner's house
Come and go with me
The sinner cried out I ain't ready to go
I ain't got no traveling shoes
Got no traveling shoes
I got no traveling shoes
The sinner cried out I ain't ready to go
I ain't got no traveling shoes

And the death went down to the gambler's house
Come and go with me
Gambler cried out I'm not ready to go
I got no traveling shoes
I got no traveling shoes
I got no traveling shoes
I got no traveling shoes
I got no traveling shoes

And then death went down to the preacher's house
Come and go with me
The preacher cried out "Lord, I'm ready to go"
I got my traveling shoes
I got my traveling shoes
The preacher cried out "Lord, I'm ready to go"
I got my traveling shoes

Got my traveling shoes
Got my traveling shoes
Got my traveling shoes
Got my traveling shoes
I got my traveling shoes
Got my traveling shoes
I got my traveling shoes
I got my traveling shoes
