[Verse]
Now it's time
To say good night to you
Now it's time
To bid you sweet adieu

[Bridge]
And maybe, drink a cheers to yesterday
And maybe, you'll drink those tears away

[Chorus][x2]
So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight

[Solo]

[Chorus][x2]
So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight
