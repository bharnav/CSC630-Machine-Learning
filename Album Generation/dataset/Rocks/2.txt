[Verse 1]
Going under, rats in the cellar
Going under, skin's turning yellow
Nose is runny, losing my connection
Losing money, getting no affection

[Chorus]
New York City blues
East Side, West Side blues
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

[Verse 2]
Safe complaining, because everything's rotten
Go insaning, and isn't a thing forgotten
Feeling cozy, rats in the cellar
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow
Loose and soggy, looking rather lazy
See my body, pushing up the daisies

[Chorus]
New York City's dues
East Side, West Side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

[Chorus]
New York City blues
East Side, West Side blues
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
