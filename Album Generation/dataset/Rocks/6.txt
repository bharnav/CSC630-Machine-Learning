[Verse]
Do you like good boogie
Like a real boogie woogie
Hear the juke box singing
A get the dance hall swinging
A won't you grab my shaker
I got to meet your maker
Get out the lead
Get out of bed
Get the lead out

[Chorus 1]
(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)

[Chorus 2]
Uumm, hey good looking
A what you got there cooking
You a young spring chicken
A make your feet start kicking

[Bridge]
No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Oh, hey good looking
A what you got there cooking

[Chorus 2]
Hey good looking
A what you got there cooking
You a young spring chicken
A make your feet start kicking
Boot it out, dance without me

[Outro]
No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no
