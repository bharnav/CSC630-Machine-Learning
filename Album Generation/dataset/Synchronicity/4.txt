[Verse 1]
Don't tell the director I said so
But are you safe Miss Gradenko?
We were at a policy meeting
They were planning new ways of cheating
I didn't want to rock your boat
But you sent this dangerous note

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been letting your feelings show
Are you safe Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko are you safe?
[x2 the first time]

[Chorus]
Is anybody alive in here?[x2]
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us in here
Nobody but us
Is anybody alive in here?
Nobody but us

[Verse 2]
Your uniform don't seem to fit
You're much too alive in it

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
