You can't, you can't forgive yourself
I don't blame you
There's times I can't tell who you are anymore
Or if I ever even knew you
What exactly do you want to hear?
Yeah, what exactly are we doing here?
Your indecision
Makes a slow incision
Cuts what little we have left

No, it doesn't feel a thing like falling
(It doesn't feel a thing like falling)
I can't feel a thing as I watch you move in and out the door

You can't, you can't forgive yourself
I don't blame you
There's times when I can't see a way out or over
This hole you've dug us into
What exactly do you want from me?
Who exactly did you want me to be?
Your indecision
All this endless friction
Burns what little we have left

No, it doesn't feel a thing like falling
(It doesn't feel a thing like falling)
I can't feel a thing as I watch you
(Move in and out the door)
It doesn't feel a thing like falling
(It doesn't feel a thing like falling)
I can't feel a thing as I watch you move in and out the door

Oh, there is this part of me I bury, when the television's off
I appreciate the details, that's where God goes to get lost
I wanna fall back into all we used to represent
Wash my filthy hands, wash my filthy hands

Like fall... (like fall...)
Like fall... (like fall...)

It doesn't feel a thing like falling
(It doesn't feel a thing like falling)
I can't feel a thing as I watch you
(Move in and out the door)

It doesn't feel a thing like falling
Falling, falling
I can't feel a thing as I watch you move in and out the door

Like fall...
Like fall...
