Get gone, before it gets too late
Keep on, keep on keeping away
Courting her disinterest, you cataloged the ruins
This was all your fault
Doesn't matter what you're doing
All this rests on you, on you

You know you had it coming
You got what you had coming
Yeah, you made that pig squeal

Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Had to laugh
She wants, she wants it all
Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Let go, let go, let go, just let it go, go, go...

Get gone, keep on keeping away
Get paid, sit around and wait
Well, all that time you wasted
Complain, complain, complain
She walked in then out the bank
Well,she knew what she was doing
Took everything you saved

You knew you had it coming
You got what you had coming
Yeah, you made that pig squeal

Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Had to laugh
She wants, she wants it all
Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Let go, let go, let go
That brilliant animal
Let go, let go, let go, just let it go, go, go...

She walks in and out the bank
With those long, long legs
Everything you saved
You lost along, lost along the way
Get gone, yeah you keep on keeping away

Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Had to laugh
She wants, she wants it all
Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Let go, let go, let go, just let it go, go...

Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Had to laugh
She wants, she wants it all
Had to laugh
She wants all that money, come on
Let go, let go, let go
That brilliant animal
Let go, let go, let go, just let it go, go, go...
