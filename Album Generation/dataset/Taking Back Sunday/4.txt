Oh when the firing finally stops
And our weapons start to drop
Will we like what we see?
Will we like what we see?

Will I be completely confident that
It was worth the time I spent
Will I like what I see?
Will I like what I see?

I still have all these questions
You're all talk no follow through
And when I ask you for an answer
That's when you say you'll have one soon

Who are you to think?
To think you’re worth the wait
Are you worth the wait?
(Are you worth the wait?)
Is it worth it?

Is it when the smoke does finally clear
We find our problems disappear
Will we like what we see?
Will we like what we see?
When I assess the damage done
Would I be smart enough to run?
If I don't like what I see
I don't like what I see

I still have all these questions
You're all talk no follow through
And when I ask you for an answer
That's when you say you'll have one soon

Who are you to think?
To think you’re worth the wait
Are you worth the wait?
Is it worth it?

Oh just say you like what you see
Say you like what you see
Yeah don't you like what you see?

Is it?
Is it worth it?
Are you worth the wait?

Who are you to think?
To think you’re worth the wait
Are you worth the wait?
Is it worth it?

Is it?
