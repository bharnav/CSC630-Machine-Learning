Skin against skin
Covering bone
The body you're in is aggressively slim
Yeah, you earn the clothes you put on it
They cover up where you've been

Leave those scars at home
Let them slide down the length
Of your spine
'Cross your knees
And down to your feet

They slow our momentum
Each time you're reminded they're there

You don't have to pretend to be an orphan anymore
You don't have to pretend to be important anymore

That brutal youth
Exhumed and removed
Entombed in a box
Cached 'cross your room
It slows our momentum
Each time I'm reminded it's there

Your anxious tongue slurs cautious words
Yeah, it's gotten so used
To being misunderstood
You do your best to control it
Remind yourself that you care

You don't have to pretend to be an orphan anymore
You don't have to pretend to be important anymore

Hey (Hey)
Sad savior (savior)
You don't have to pretend to be an orphan anymore

Never not ever again
Is what you swore the last time this happened
Never not ever
Are you gonna settle for those bastards

Never not ever again
No never (not ever)
No never (not ever)
Never not ever again
Is what you swore (swore)

You don't have to pretend to be an orphan anymore
You don't have to pretend to be important anymore

Hey (Hey)
Sad savior (savior)
You don't have to pretend to be an orphan
Not important anymore
