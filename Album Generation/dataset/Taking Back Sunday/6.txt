So now I am owed this
One self indulgent tirade
A hollow attempt to
To sell my point of view

Yeah, I know what's rotting
Beneath your best intentions
At the heart of your convictions
Sits a broken man that needs to understand

I am owed this now
I am owed this now
I am owed this now

This is all I ever asked from you
The only thing you couldn't do
Tell me the whole truth

You don't know yourself
How could I know you?
I will not be moved
Until you tell me the whole truth

I know you mean well
With your ancient code of ethics
Lead by example
Can you imagine Christ hitting a child?
You live in a shelter
Built from your own truth
There's so many things
You don't want me, you don't want me to know

I am owed this now
I am owed this now
I am owed this now

This is all I ever asked of you
The only thing you couldn't do
Tell me the whole truth

You don't know yourself
How could I know you?
I will not be moved
Until you tell me the whole truth

Oh, next time you're standing on that stage
(You're lying to yourself, you're lying to yourself)
Selling your cold hollow faith
(You're still lying to me, you're still lying to me)

Oh, next time you're standing on that stage (Repent!)
Selling your cold hollow faith (Repent!)
Remember?

This is all I ever asked from you
The only thing you couldn't do
Tell me the whole truth

You don't know yourself
How could I know you?
I will not be moved
Until you tell me the whole truth

(Oh, the only thing I asked from you)
The only thing you couldn't do
Tell me the whole truth

I will not be moved
I will not be moved
I am owed this now (I am owed this now)
Tell me the whole truth
