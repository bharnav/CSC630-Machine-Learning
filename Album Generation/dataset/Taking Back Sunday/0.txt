[Verse 1]
Cradle the sound
Caller, speak through your teeth
I was up and away
I've never known what to think
What I wanted to know
Where did God sway?
And if the silence was gold, gold, gold
When you got your way

[Chorus]
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get

[Verse 2]
My eyes got sore
Oh, those perverts are sick
I held the truth on my tongue
Hadn't know until when
What I wanted to know
Whether God was away
Cause I was there as you, you play
And you, you fools, you look all the same

[Chorus]
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you get, no
(Yeah)
You'll never give what you..

[Bridge 1]
(You all look the same)
You'll never give what you get, you'll never give what you get
You'll never get what you want, you'll never want what you get
Just do your best to forget, just do your best to forget

[Bridge 2]
You got your way, you got away
When god, he was away
You got your way, you got away
When god, he was away
You got your way, you got away
When god, he was away
You got your way, you got away
When god, he was away

[Chorus]
You'll never give what you get, no
You'll never give what you get, no
You'll never give what you get, no
You'll never give what you get, no
You'll never give what you get, no
You'll never give what you get, no
Just do your best to forget
Just do your best to forget
Do your best to forget
