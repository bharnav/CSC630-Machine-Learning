[Verse 1]
Since you're gone
I don't go out
I smoke in the house
Yeah and since you're gone
The days and nights are long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, this is nothing like I pictured
Forgot what it was like to miss you
There's no one to take for granted
Now you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Come back, come back
Oh, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with myself
Come back, come back, come back

[Verse 2]
Since you're gone
I lock the house
I keep the curtains closed
Yeah and since you're gone
I don't do much of anything at all

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh no, I've forgotten what it's like to miss you
Oh, I didn't know this would be nothing like I pictured
Oh no, I've forgotten what it's like to miss you
Oh, oh no

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Come back
Why did I let you
Why did I let you
Why did I let you
Let you go
Come back
