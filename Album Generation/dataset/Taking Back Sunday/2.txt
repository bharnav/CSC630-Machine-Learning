[Verse 1]
I thought a lot about the morning after
And there's some things I need to get off of my chest
Forget the preconceptions we both surely have
Like, "What if the grass is always greener"
Or, "Today should taste much sweeter"
I don't wanna talk

[Pre-Chorus]
Peel back your skin
Invite me in

[Chorus]
Am I just like the rest of them?
The sum of my father and all his sins
(I didn't need an answer when...)
You said it all saying nothing at all
You said it all saying nothing at all

[Verse 2]
And now I see you so much clearer
Through the smoke and past the mirrors
Past the bright brutality of the people we have been
But you didn't need that explanation
No, I have no expectations
I don't wanna talk

[Pre-Chorus]
Peel back your skin
Invite me in

[Chorus]
Am I just like the rest of them?
The sum of my father and all his sins
(I didn't need an answer when...)
You said it all saying nothing at all
You said it all saying nothing at all

[Bridge]
The wait in fluorescent suspense
The hope at the foot of my bed
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna taste you

[Chorus]
Am I just like the rest of them?
The sum of my father and all his sins
(I didn't need an answer when...)
You said it all saying nothing at all
You said it all saying nothing at all
