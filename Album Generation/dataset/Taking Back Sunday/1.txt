You might lose your faith in science
You might lose faith in wealth
You might lose your faith in Jesus
Or lose faith in yourself

But, when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just, please, please
Don't lose your faith in me

You could lose your faith in music
Or lose your faith in friends
You could lose your faith in freedom
Feel trapped in your own skin

Oh, but I'll be right there beside you
(I'll be right there beside you)
When the walls are caving in
(I swear, oh, I'm not going anywhere)

But, when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me

Oh,Oh,oh....
I'm not going anywhere. [3x]

But, when I let you down
Look past your doubt
Just please, please
Don't lose your faith in me
Please don't lose your faith in me

I'm not going anywhere
