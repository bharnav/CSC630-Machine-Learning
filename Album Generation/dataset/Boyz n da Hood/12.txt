Nobody move nobody get hurt
We came fo them niggas that be off on that work
An its drought season niggas lookin fo a reason
Have to duck niggas like its huntin season

(Duke)

Yall in tha club bobbin an weavin
Im just tryna hit a lick an leave u slobbin an bleedin
Hope u niggas dont thank that we teasin
Its a drought on the street so thats a good enough reason
So tha next time u niggas wanna lean back

An i dont need a solo stack this a team sack
If u dont wanna get cracked where the cream at?
Yea lil daddy please believe i need that

I want u all butt-naked turn the(?) into a strip club

(Chorus)
(Big Gee)

What if i ran in yo shit nigga beat u wit tha butt of the chrome
I beat ya wit the butt of the phone
I put ya arm behind ya back keep pushin til im crushin ya bone
Or get some acid,iodine hardto pour on ya bone
Dont slip hack saw off tha fangertips
Cut ya foots at the angles makin sure u dissapear
Dental records can't tell who u is
Cuz ya whole skull gone nothin left but the ears
We lay the club down fuck we rob fo real
Got some standho niggas like the mob fo real
Got erasers in decatur a goon sqaud by mosey park

(Chorus)
(Big Gee)

Lay the fuck nigga this boyz n da hood
