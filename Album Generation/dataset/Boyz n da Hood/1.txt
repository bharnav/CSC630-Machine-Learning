Ya'll know who I be, J-O-D-Y Breeze

Y'all nigga don't scare nobody
I dare a nigga to try me
I never killed nobody but I will come get somebody
I'm in the streets for reason like to be a demon in da night
And in da evening I serve fiends and leave semen on ya wife
[Duke]
Dig it, there ain't no question bout me 'cause im da answer
I've been puttin in work since Jody Breeze was wearin pampers

But it wasn't shit to me all he did was make me harder
Fuck throwin sticks and stones now we toting Guns and bricks
I've been representin like this since lil Kim was suckin dick
Pops ain't taught me shit 'cause ima bastard
And fuck u little tricks its paper that i'm after
[Young Jeezy]
We the young and da restless, the fast and the Furious
Lick a couple shots at 'em let 'em kno
That we serious
And u kno wut u get for talkin out ya mouth sideways
Point blank range nigga blow ya shit sideways
I do this shit for dem boyz in da hood stay down grindin til i get my boyz out da hood
Its da J- double E- Z to the Y yall
Stay strapped, iced up, and rock fly yall
