[Chorus]
Judging by the look on the organ-grinder
He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit
It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder
He's waiting for the day when he gets me

[Verse 1]
But I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string
I just need this stage to be seen
We all need a pantomime to remind us what is real
Hold my eye and know what it means

[Pre-Chorus]
(CAUSE)
I'm out of my mind (8x)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
But I won't be your concubine - I'm a puppet not a whore
I just need this stage to be seen
Will you be a friend of mine to remind me what is real?
Hold my heart and see that it bleeds

[Outro]
I'm out of my mind (12x)
