[Verse 1]
Drink up beautiful
I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack
Cause I've got so much trapped
It's all because of you
So I figured you might like some back

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time

[Verse 2]
I can't live my life
Knowing you'll be in his arms each time I blink my eyes
Know what goes on behind my back every night
Afraid I'll never leave
Afraid I'll never know what's good for me

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time

[Bridge]
And now you say that
You say you love me
Well I may have your heart
He has your body
And now you swear that you're being honest
But you're not honest
And you never could be

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time
