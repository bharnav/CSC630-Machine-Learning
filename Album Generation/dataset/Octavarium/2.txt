[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
This is so hard for me
To find the words to say
My thoughts are standing still
Captive inside of me
All emotions start to hide
And nothing's getting through

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Watch me fading
I'm losing all my instincts
Falling into darkness

[Chorus 1]
Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls for me now

[Verse 2]
So much uncertainty
I don't like this feeling
I'm sinking like a stone
Each time I try to speak
There's a voice I'm hearing
And it changes everything

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Watch me crawl from
The wreckage of my silence
Conversation failing

[Chorus 2]
Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls

[Bridge]
Everytime you choose to turn away
Is it worth the price you pay?
Is there someone who will wait for you
One more time? One more time?

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Watch me fading
I'm losing all my instincts
Falling into darkness

[Chorus 1]
Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls for me now

[Outro]
Tear down these walls for me
It's not too late for me
Tear down these walls for me

[Instrumental Outro]
