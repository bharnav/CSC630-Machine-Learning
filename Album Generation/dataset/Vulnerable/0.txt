Breathing in now
I try counting my blessings
Picturing the last time I fed
Beg forgiveness
With some words that mean nothing
Illusions like smoke in my breath

[Hook]
I come alive
When I'm falling down
I let myself go
'Til I hit the ground
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I feel it, I know
Come alive when I'm falling down

Air is thin now
While my lungs are collapsing
Vertigo blankets my head
Far from reckless
When uncomfortable's
All that I know I could never forget

[Hook]
I come alive
When I'm falling down
I let myself go
'Til I hit the ground
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I feel it, I know
Come alive when I'm falling down
(Yeah!)

Keep your distance
Far away from me
Watch this eat me alive

Keep your distance
Far away from me
Watch this eat me alive

[Hook]
I come alive
When I'm falling down (-ling down)
I let myself go
'Til I hit the ground (The ground)
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I feel it, I know
Come alive when I'm falling down

I come alive!
I come alive!
I come alive!
I come alive!
I come alive!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
