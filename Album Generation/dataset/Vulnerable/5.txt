"I began to smoke, up and away from my body
My brain's holding the grip of a giant vice
It was all very good
Floating higher and higher, a wonderful feeling..."

DIE! DIE! DIE!

I'm watching closely just to see
So I can rest in peace
I put my face close, make sure you're not breathing
You look so nice, so pretty dressed
Your painted skin can say the rest
Until they bury you, I won't believe it

BREATHING! NOT BREATHING! BREATHING! NOT BREATHING!

How can it feel so right when it's so wrong?
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on
You're not with Jesus Christ, you're just gone
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on

BREATHING! NOT BREATHING! BREATHING!

I see that nothing in your eyes
Touch your skin as cold as ice
I steal a kiss to make sure you're not breathing
We picked you out a pretty cage
Scribbled some bullshit on the grave
Until they bury you I won't believe it

BREATHING! NOT BREATHING! BREATHING! NOT BREATHING!

How can it feel so right when it's so wrong?
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on
You're not with Jesus Christ, you're just gone
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on

Life, as precious as it is, I've waited for this day
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away

How can it feel so right when it's so wrong?
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on
You're not with Jesus Christ, you're just gone
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on

How can it feel so right when it's so wrong?
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on
You're not with Jesus Christ, you're just gone
Now that you're dead, it's kinda turning me on
