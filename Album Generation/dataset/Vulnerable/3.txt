[Verse 1]
You bought your smile on a corner
You paid a pretty little penny, you did
You paint yourself in a picture
As you deny the kind of person you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
You kill what you feel, what you wish to be
You kill with sarcastic sincerity
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine
You get what you feel, you get what you feel

[Chorus]
I gave you everything, you threw it away
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette

Come on!

[Verse 2]
You bought right into the moment
You paid a pretty little penny, you did
You never noticed how broken
As you deny the kind of person you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
You kill what you feel, what you wish to be
You kill with sarcastic sincerity
You sharpen your guilt like a guillotine
You get what you feel, you get what you feel

[Chorus]
I gave you everything, you threw it away
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette

[Bridge]
You kneel to pray
Live life on your knees embrace the disease
Start to pull in as you start to choke, your life begins

YOU PUT ME OUT! LIKE A CIGARETTE!
YOU PUT ME OUT! LIKE A CIGARETTE!
YOU PUT ME OUT! LIKE A CIGARETTE!
YOU PUT ME OUT! YOU PUT ME--

[Chorus]
I gave you everything, you threw it away
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
I gave you everything you threw it away
Put you out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
Love like a cancer still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette
You put me out!
You put me out!
YOU PUT ME OUT!
