True, we acted like we should
And did all that we could
When you pushed we never pulled
We answered back yes, anything
We can give you anything
Will you take everything?
'Cause we do not need a thing

[Chorus]
This fire
This fire burning, it burns inside of me
This fire
This fire burning, it burns inside of me
Not faded away, not faded away
Our love, our hope never faded away
This fire
This fire burning, it burns inside of me

True, we were never understood
Or acted like we should
Ask again, I bet you would
We don't owe you anything
For we won't give you anything
Try and take everything
But we won't give you anything

[Chorus]

Build a fire for yourself (x6)

Anything, we won't give you anything

[Chorus]
