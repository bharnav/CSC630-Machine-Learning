If you need me I'll be out with the night
If you need me I'll be up with the moon
Watch me changing as you turn out the light
Watch me changing as I leave your cocoon
I'm like a ghost, a vampire in the mirror
You're the beast that's waiting to feed
Lord of the flies you think that you are the leader
You act so big and watch it bleed

How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
How can I let go? I'm not holding on
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand, you pull me down, down
How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)

Because you need me like a throat needs a knife
You're the cross, and I am Jesus Christ
I am the corpse, you are the maggots inside me
Now it's time to give up the fight

Cut it out, get the abortion
Cut it up, just feed my organs
Shoot it up, cut through the bullshit
Making love to her cadaver
Like I said, I had to stab her
My heart can't get much blacker

How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
How can I let go? I'm not holding on
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand, you pull me down, down
How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)

Disaster. Call me all the things you wanna...
You think I don't know
Oh bastard, you got me started
But what do I know?

Whoa...

How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
How can I let go? I'm not holding on
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand, you pull me down, down
How can I change, when you're the disaster?
(Disaster, you fucking disaster)
