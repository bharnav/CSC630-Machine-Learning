I might have so far to go
And the moments left behind
I started gasping for air, forgot that I'm still breathing
Swallow the pain, I thought I didn't need it, didn't need it at all
When I watch the cut heal I know my heart's still beating

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
This night cannot escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
Move through the storm until we see what we've become
When there's no road for us to follow
We'll keep moving on

Might not have so far to go
Just to leave the mess behind
I see the sun coming up, I know it's worth believing
Haven't lost my mind, haven't lost the feeling, it's been there all along
It makes me feel strong to know my heart's still beating

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
This night cannot escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
Move through the storm until we see what we've become
When there's no road for us to follow
We'll keep moving on
We'll keep moving on
Moving on moving on moving on moving on

Feel the beat of my broken heart
Feel the beat as we're moving on
Feel the beat of my broken heart
Feel the beat as we're moving on

It's getting old, we've been here for so long
So feel the beat of my heart moving on

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
This night cannot escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
Move through the storm until we see what we've become
When there's no road for us to follow
We'll keep moving on
We'll keep moving on
