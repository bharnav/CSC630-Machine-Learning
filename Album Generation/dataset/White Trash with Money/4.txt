[Verse 1]
Yeah when I came to you were standing by the foot of the bed
I was still hung over, and my eyes were bloodshot and red
Did you think that things were going to be different?
Did you think you tore my whole world apart?
But as you can see there is no pain in my head
And down in this old broken heart

[Chorus]
I took your leaving with a grain of salt
Tequila and a slice of lime
Yeah the minute you left
Me and the boys went out and had a real good time
It is nice of you to check up on me
Just to see how I was getting along
But I had already gotten over it baby
Before you were even gone

[Verse 2]
By now you have observed
I was a little over-served last night
I need to catch a few Zâ€™s
Baby please turn off that bedroom light
See the boys are coming by to get me
We are going to take our little show into town
I will need my rest cause they will be doing there best
To find another (juke joint now?)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah I had already gotten way over it baby
Before you were even gone
Bye now
