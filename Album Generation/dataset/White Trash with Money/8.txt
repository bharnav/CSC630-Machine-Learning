[Verse 1]
7 in the morning
She has to make a choice
Precious baby girl
Or bouncing baby boy
She could either keep it
Or give that child away
So she quit school that morning
And became a mom that day

[Chorus]
There is no right way
To do the wrong thing
You can justify
But it is still black and white
Paint it any shade
But it would not change
There is no right way
To do the wrong thing

[Verse 2]
News came on my TV
A mother cried and said
That her son was fighting for his life
Because her husband lost his head
Might have been a problem child
If that boy were mine
I would not beat him half to death
Trying to make him walk the line

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now empowered politicians
Trying to pass a law
They would not let our children pray
For the better of us all
If God blessed America
Then how could someone vote
To take prayer from our classrooms
Right when we need prayer the most

[Chorus]
