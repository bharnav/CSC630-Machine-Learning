[Verse 1]
My buddy said his girlfriend is as pretty as can be
He said help a brother out tonight and come double date with me
She is got to a baby sister and they are headed into town
They are looking for a good time
They are fun to be around

[Verse 2]
I said what do she look like?
He scratched his head and stated
"She was a home coming football queen before she graduated
We will wine and dine and do them fine
And really double date them
Then take them back to the motel six and
Try to separate them

[Verse 3]
They showed up in a pick up
They were right on time
His was kind of hefty
But not half as big as mine

[Verse 4]
I am running block
Turn the lights down low
Running block
Do not want know one to know
That I tried to drink her skinny but she is still about 215
Sometimes you got to bow up
And take one for the team

[Verse 5]
She cleaned her plate at dinner
Then she ate what is left of mine
Then she wolfed down a big cheesecake as I drank all the wine
She strolled out to the portico for an after dinner cig
I said "Bro you done her this time and going to owe me big

[Verse 6]
You know why?
Because my brother is having a party
Thought you got to know
He is got co-eds swimming naked
