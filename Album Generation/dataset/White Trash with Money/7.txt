[Verse 1]
It is as sad as It is true
But I cannot believe a word that you say
I have been hoping for the best
But there is less and less more everyday
You cannot where you been
Behind that little grin
I can see
Girl you cannot fool me

[Chorus]
You have gone
A little too far this time
You stepped one doorstep over the line
Swore you would always be mine
I would never leave you behind
But you have gone
A little too far this time

[Verse 2]
You can tell me how it happened
Still I would never understand why
All I can keep thinking is
He sure must be one hell of a guy
You cannot blame no one else
You brought it all on yourself
Now It is gone
And It is time on because

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
Girl you have gone
Just a little too far this time
