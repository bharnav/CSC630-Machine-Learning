[Verse 1]
Yeah the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip
I am not nothing but a number on his timecard slip
I give him 40 hours and a piece of my soul
Puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole
Hell I do not even think he knows my name

[Chorus]
Well all week long I am a real nobody
But I just punched out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
I am going to get drunk and be somebody
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
My baby cuts hair at a beauty boutique
Just blowing and going till she dead on her feet
They walk right in and sit right down
She gives them what they want and then she spins them around
Hey I do not think they even know her name

[Chorus]
How week long she's a real nobody
But I just punched her out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
Baby let's get drunk and be somebody
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well just average people, in an everyday bar
Driving from work in our ordinary cars
And I like to come here with the regular Joes
Drink all you want, be the star of the show

[Chorus]
How week long but you're a real nobody
But we just punched her out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
People let's get drunk
How week long but you're a real nobody
But we just punched her out and it is pay check Friday
Weekends here, good God almighty
People let's get drunk and be somebody
Yeah, yeah, yeah
