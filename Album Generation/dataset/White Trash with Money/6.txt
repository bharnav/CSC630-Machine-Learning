[Verse 1]
Note to self
Better call
She will be mad as hell
If I know her at all
Because today is her birthday
And I almost forgot
Note to self
I better not

Note to self
On my way home
Do not forget the roses
And Dom Perignon
You know how she loves a
Great big surprise
Note to self
You are skating on thin ice

[Chorus]
Hmm I am not going to screw it up this time
Hmm I am going to really make her proud she is mine

[Verse 2]
Note to self
Remember when
You use to light her up
When you walked in
And she stole your breath away
That is the way it was
Every time you kissed her
And she still does

[Chorus]
Hmm I am not going to mess it up this time
Hmmmmmmm I am going to really make her proud She is mine

Turning down the street
I am pulling in the drive
Door is not lock
So I step inside
She is not here to greet me
So what is going on?
Note self
She is already gone

[Outro]
Hmm gone
Hmmm gone

Hmm I guess I really messed it up this time
