[Verse 1]
She called me on the phone and said come on and get on the plane tonight, pronto
So just like every time king sad cried for help
Here come Toto
I guess you run a lover off again
And I cannot believe how long it is been
I had my fingers running through her hair
Only bad thing about it
I am not already there

[Verse 2]
Baby I just landed grabbed my bag and hopped a cab
And I am coming solo
Light a candle, fill the tub, and put on some music that you love
And I will bring the mojo
Yeah the cabby said he would drive like heck
If you would promise me a pony tail
And my favorite secret underwear
Only bad thing about it
I am already there

Now it is been real and it is been fun
Another notch carved in her gun

You know a funny thing when you play her game
What you thought would change just stays the same

[Verse 3]
I will be on this plane to Illinois
She be locked down with some pretty boy
When we touch down in Chicago at o'hare
Only bad thing about it
I am already there
Oh no
