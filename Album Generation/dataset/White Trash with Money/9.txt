[Verse]
Thought I would call you up
See if had celebrated
Day you were born
It is a little belated
Age is just a number
It is really over rated to me

Yea November third
That is a day I remember
Because its thirty seven days after mine in September
You would thought I forgot
Because here it is December again

[Chorus]
Oh, happy birthday baby
Want to see you tonight
I got your present waiting
I want to do it right
I have not got enough money for a big diamond ring
Let us tie a brand new bow around the same old thing

[Interlude]
Yea

Now blow
Out your candles

[Chorus]
Oh, happy birthday baby
Want to see you tonight
I got your present waiting
I want to do it right
I have not got enough money for a big diamond ring
Let us tie a brand new bow around the same old thing

[Outro]
(It would be cool if we could make an ending for it)
