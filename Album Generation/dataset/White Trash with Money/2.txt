[Verse 1]
I got a sweet little woman at home
She knows that I love her true
I got three little kids at home on the floor
They love their daddy too
I got one on the way and I do not think I can pay the doctor bill
I never finished paying the last one off
Do not guess I ever will

[Chorus]
So we save it all up for a rainy day
But it is always sunny
Guess all the happiness in the world
Cannot buy you money

[Verse 2]
I got an old work truck
It will barely get me to town and back
I try to put in a little over time
But that do not put in no jack
So I bring it home
Were my baby got my hot supper cooked
Then I lay down and rest my weary bones
Get back up at six

Just working hard in the land of milk and honey
Hey, all the happiness in the world
Cannot buy you money

[Verse 3]
But if I had plenty
I could keep us afloat
Then in the end if my ship do not come in
I would just buy a bigger boat
I have got no money
I am knee deep in dept
We must be living on love from above
Because we have hit bottom yet

[Verse 4]
I pick my pay check up and go straight to the bank
That is my usual route
Then I go home and pick up the wife and the kids
Because we are going out
It is a drive through window
Pick out a combo super size
Swing on down to the wallmart
Let the kids pick out a prize
My truck broke down at the red light
She thinks it is real funny
Yes, all the happiness in the world cannot buy you money

[Chorus]
