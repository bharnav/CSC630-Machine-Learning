[Verse 1]
Guess it slipped my mind
Now I am in trouble deep
See the last two years in a row I forgot
Our anniversary
So I come Rushing in
Twelve roses in bloom
Said honey would you like a romantic evening
Out under the stars and the moon

[Chorus]
She did not say no
But in her eyes I could see
That this would not turn out to be
The enchanted evening I thought it would be
Yes I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She did not say no
She said hell no

[Verse 2]
Then we split the sheets
About six months ago
I told all my buddies down at the bar
This cowboy is headed home
Walked into her house
Yeah climbed right up in her bed
When I asked her if she still loved me
Man you know what she said

[Chorus]
She did not say no
But in her eyes I could see
That this would not turn out to be
The enchanted evening I thought it would be
Yes I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She did not say no
She said hell no

[Outro]
Yeah I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She did not say no
She said hell no
