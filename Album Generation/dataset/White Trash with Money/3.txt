[Verse]
I almost said I love you
Could I really be that kind of guy
See one candle burning in your eye
And watch my heart fill up with butterflies
I almost said I need you
Girl I should not go there anymore
Act like I never been in love before
You probably think it is my first time
Is this what love is all about
Am I getting in too deep
Would not want to freak you out
Make a promise I cannot keep

[Chorus] [x2]
So close your eyes and hum along
And I will sing you one more love song
If everything is still alright
Why do not you just crash here tonight

[Outro]
Girl if everything is still alright
Why do not you just crash here tonight
