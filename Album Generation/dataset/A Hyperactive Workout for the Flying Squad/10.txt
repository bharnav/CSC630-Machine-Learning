I don’t ever want to go out like a light

Have you got the right, to lay your burden on me
Have you got the right, to lay your burden on me

Is it ever right
To make it all out when it will never be

But it’s different, so different
So different from before
And it gets no easier

Do you have the right
To come on over so strong
Does it make it right
When it makes it all so very wrong

But it’s different from before
This is different from before
This is different from before
