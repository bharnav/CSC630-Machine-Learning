I want to know how it feels to be
Alone as it appears to me
As the start of the day is the end of the night
So the end of the night is the start of the day

I know that it’s true because everybody knew
Before me, so where can I go now?

If the start of the day is the end of the night
The end of the night is the start of the day
And once it has gone it can never come back again

Well we know where we are
And we know that we’ve come so far
And we’ll never come back again

Now I know that its true ‘cos everybody knew
Before me, so where do I go now?
You take me back to the start
Where I was falling apart
Now all the things you want to be
You never want to be with me

If the start of the day is the end of the night
The end of the night is the start of the day
And once it has gone it can never come back again

Well we know where we are
And we know that we’ve come so far
And we’ll never come back again

You said you knew everything
You said you knew everything
About love and peace and hate and lies
About love and peace and hate and lies

If the start of the day is the end of the night
The end of the night is the start of the day
And once it has gone it can never come back again

Well we know where we are
And we know that we’ve come so far
And we’ll never come back again

And once it has gone
It will never come back again
And once it has gone
It will never come back again
