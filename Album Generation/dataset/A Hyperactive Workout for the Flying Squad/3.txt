C / Am / Dm / G

You drive the away the best of you
It's all that's left to say
You leave me with the rest of you
You've made it on your way
I need a call to say from you
Just before you go
The more that I've been close with you
The door was always closed

Drive away and all, there's nothing you should say
Drive away and all, we're travellers anyway

Get on up and straight you go
There's nothing left to say
Begging's not my place you know
You wouldn't hear it anyway
'Cos all the days I begged you stay
I saw it made you blind
There's more than I can really say
What it is that traps you all inside

Drive away and all, there's nothing you should say
Drive away and all, we're travellers anyway

You made it all get so uptight
I made it in between
You went and wronged all the rights
Then you hid behind your screen
You're headed where I just don't know
I think you've gone inside
I hope the world looks good from there
Well I hope it looks all right

We never made it all the way
We never made it all the way
You take the best of you
I keep the rest of you

Drive away and all, there's nothing you should say
Drive away and all, we're travellers anyway
