I bless you well, won't you move things over
The night is moving and and I've set my foolish fate
The moon is cold, lets move over
The night is moving and and I've set my foolish fate
So I stop and stare

Here comes your eyes
Here comes your eyes
Do they really smile
Your eyes really smile

And the morning sings, it won't give over
The blue awakening comes to your bed
The moon is cold, well lets move over
The night is filled to the edge and you've said your things
So I stop and stare

Here comes your eyes
Here comes your eyes
Do they really smile
Your eyes really smile

Move things over
Move things over

So I stop and stare

Here comes your eyes
Here comes your eyes
Do they really smile
Your eyes really smile
