My resistance is getting weaker
I just can't stand the pressure
I can't be any weaker
I've got to find me some of the treasure

I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the right to be like any other man

My mind's in such a state
Sometimes it makes me sick lord
At times I try to wait
But I don't often know the trick

I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the right to live
Like any other man
Oh, like any other man

Experience has taught me wisdom
Thank god I've got some life left
I'm getting out of serfdom
My soul stands the test

I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the right to live
Like any other man
Oh, like any other man

My resistance is getting weaker
I just can't stand the pressure
I can't be any weaker
I've got to find me some of the treasure

I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the right to live
Like any other man, Oh, like any other man
