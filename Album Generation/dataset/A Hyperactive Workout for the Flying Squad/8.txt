Well the old man shuffles off
And he’ll curse the world and cough
And the young man who is watching rushes off
And he vows to the sky
To have faith in you and I
And the old man who is watching slowly cries

Well it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To justify your personal responsibilty
But it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To nullify all personal responsibilty

Well the young man makes a plan
That he’ll save all foreign lands
And at his right hand
We’ll all be singing
And he’ll vow to the Sky
To have faith in you and I
And the whole world that is watching slowly dies

Well it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To justify your personal responsibilty
But it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To nullify all personal responsibilty

Don't nullify your personal responsibilty yeah
Don't nullify your personal responsibilty yeah

Well it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To justify your personal responsibilty
Well it’s God’s world and it’s safe and it’s easy
To nullify your personal responsibilty
