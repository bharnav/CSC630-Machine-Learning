When the night time creeps on in
I will be there, I will be there
Come on and let me in
I will be there, I will be there

Don’t ever be afraid when I say
I Love You, I Love You
And I’ll take the time to say I love you

Come on don’t shoulder hurt
Take it on back, don’t make it worse
Come the night and I will call
I’ll take it back, you’ll take it all

Don’t be afraid when I say
I Love You, I Love You
And I’ll take the time to say I love you

Don’t be so scared about it
I just can’t be without saying
I Love You, I Love You
And I’ll take the time to say I love you
