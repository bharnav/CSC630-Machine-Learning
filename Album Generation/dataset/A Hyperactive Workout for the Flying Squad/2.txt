Wah Wah, you've given me a wah wah
And I'm thinking of you
And all the things that we used to do
Wah Wah
Wah Wah

Wah Wah, you made me such a big star
Being there at the right time
Cheaper than a dime
Wah Wah, you've given me your wah wah
Wah Wah

Oh you don't only see me crying
Baby baby
You don't only hear me sighing Oh no

Wah Wah, I don't need another wah wah
And I know how sweet life can be
If I keep myself free
Wah Wah, I don't need no wah wah
