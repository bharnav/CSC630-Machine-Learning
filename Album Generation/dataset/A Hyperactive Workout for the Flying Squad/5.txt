Oh in my heart, It always begins
Just keep on trying to make this situation win
Sometimes you should hold it back
And keep on the rails of the straight and narrow track

And I know I’ve been wrong before
But I really believe this day should last forever

These times we’re travelling in
Can tie you to trying to do your worst to keep on in
And how can you say that there’s nothing left
I come around every time you try to hate yourself

And I know I’ve been wrong before
But I really believe this day should last forever

I’m leaving today
I’m finding it hard to hear a single word I say
And all of the time wasted with you
It makes it hard to know what exactly to do

And I know I’ve been wrong before
But I really believe this day should last forever

I never give out
I had no my doubts and now I know they were you
Just like before I got myself clean
And now it’s amazing how this situation seems

And I know I’ve been wrong before
But I really believe this day should last forever
