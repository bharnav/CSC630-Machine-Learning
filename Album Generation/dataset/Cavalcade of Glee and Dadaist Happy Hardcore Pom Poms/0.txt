Hi. This is Wilford Brimley. Welcome to Retardation: A Celebration. Now hopefully with this book I'm gonna dispel a few myths, a few rumors. First off, the retarded don't rule the night. They don't rule it, nobody does. And they don't run in packs. And while they may not be as strong as apes, don't lock eyes with them. Don't do it. Puts 'em on edge. They might go into berserker mode, come at you like a whirling dervish, all fists and elbows. You might be screaming "no no no", and all they hear is "who wants cake?" Let me tell you something: they all do. They all want cake
