And away we go
And I hope that you know
That one day, we will all be alone

Holding on to broken hearts
Memories are what's left of us
You're trying to hard to be my friend
And I'm placing all our pictures
In these broken frames to remind me never fall in love again

I'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place
So I never have to deal with you again

And away we go
And I hope that you know
That one day, we will all be alone

Maybe now I'll figure out
That life is one big question how am I supposed to grow
When I'm stuck inside this state well I'll never know
Your falling faster then the shooting star you wished your body on
(your body on)

I'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place
So I never have to deal with you again

And I never felt so high as my back is to the ground
And we're staring at the stars making faces at the clouds
But all those days are gone and the memories put to rest
And if you want to see my youth your gonna have to dig deep in my chest

I'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name.... Forget my face...
So I never have to deal with you again
