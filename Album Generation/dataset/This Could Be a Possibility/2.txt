It's amazing how quick
We could turn an argument
Into a fight for what is right
When the conversation dies
I will rip my tongue out
Just to show how much I don't want you
To quit this anymore

Cause lately it's the same again
As I'm writing to unfold
Just keep turning those pages
There's still stories to be told
But don't
Don't let me turn into the person I once hated
All I wanted was to make it
And swing life away

Save me from myself
Cause I don't know who to be
I'm trapped inside a world of all this cold concrete
Walking through this town
You'll find me staring at the sky
This city, my city, it burns tonight

Everything you ever wanted
Well it's always by your side
Let it haunt you, let it haunt you
Let it keep you up at night
Everything you ever needed
Well it's always by your side
Let it haunt you, let it haunt you
Let it keep you up at night

Save me from myself
Cause I don't know who to be
I'm trapped inside a world of all this cold concrete
Walking through this town
You'll find me staring at the sky
This city, my city, it burns tonight
