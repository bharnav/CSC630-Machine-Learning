Born in a generation, write lies but no inspiration
Couldn't tell you what you need to believe
Throw away, your integrity
The radios on and you listen
The T. V. 's on and you'll watch
So look, mark it, why don't you buy in
There has to be some way to make it stop

By now, you should've figure out
That everything you believe
It was overconfident
So take my hand and let me lead you
To where we feel...

[Chorus x2]
With our backs against the wall and maybe our shadows aren't that tall
Is this what it takes to make you think
I can't believe it

With out backs against the wall
And maybe our shadows aren't that tall
Is this what it takes to make you think
I can't believe it...
