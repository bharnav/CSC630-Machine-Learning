Once all I wanted was really to stay
When I find out it's not just a phase
I just can't see things working out
The way I planned them in my head
So forget it, I'm runnin' and I'm never looking back
All that I want is something to believe
And I can't take much more of
You're waiting for me to see what times brings
But your relief it evens the score up
One thing I know, I'll be fine
This is just the story of my life
Some days it takes a little time to forget
How hard we concentrated on the end
I still can't see things working out
The way I planned them in my head
So forget it, I'm runnin' and I'm never looking back
You know this all could be a possibility
All that I want is something to believe
And I can't take much more of
You're waiting for me to see what times brings
But your belief it evens the score up
One thing I know, I'll be fine
This is just the story of my life
'Cause I look up and watch
And see the stars up above
I know that it's wrong
To wish upon the shooting
'Cause they burn out so quick
To fast for me to get my wish
I guess they are just there for hoping
We're all hoping
We're all hoping
This could be a possibility
(Will this all work out, how will we ever know?)
This could be a possibility
This could be a possibility
This could be, this could be
