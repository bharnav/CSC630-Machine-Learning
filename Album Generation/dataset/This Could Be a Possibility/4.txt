Let's build a rocket to the moon
Just you and I
We could start a whole new world up there
Leave our past behind
Behind

Sometimes I can't believe my eyes
I want to stare up
And get lost in the city lights
Because I've had enough and this is the end
And now I understand
That a heart breaks it does not bend

Someone please help me out
I never meant to take this so far
Now I've fallen way too hard
Take a long step back to
To The days when I was younger
Decisions never mattered all this much

It's an emptied handed promise
From my heart to my conscious
That says one day I will make this count
(The best that I know how)

The closest that I am to living life on the edge
Is packing all my bags, and heading off with my best friends

Someone please help me out
I never meant to take this so far
Now I've fallen way too hard
Take a long step back
To The days when I was younger
Decisions never mattered all this much

So let it all go
You have no worries now
(I've made my decision)
With the sun in your face you're never beneath the clouds
(I'm lifting)
And all the along the way I found you wishing on those clouds to move away
Grab my hand
Let's kiss the sun goodbye

I know the way to go it's never as easy as it may seem
The takeoffs the landings, our rockets transcending
Ordinary, what's ordinary?
(To the moon)

The takeoffs the landings, our rockets transcending
Ordinary, what's ordinary?
(To the moon)
