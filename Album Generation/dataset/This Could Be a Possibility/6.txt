You think that you are so predictable
I've got some news for you
These words don't seem to leave my mind
As easily as yours do
Well I've go something inside that won't let me give up again

So get up and get into me cause you know you want to
It's so damn hard to believe in the things that matter most
What you just can't seem to understand
Is you've got me as your friend
Well I fold this hand
That I've been playing for all these years

So pop that pill
And put another fake smile on your face
Just cause the sun rises tomorrow
Doesn't mean you'll make it through today
The days may seem to go slow
But before you learn to run
You need to get on your feet walk away

So get up and into me cause you know you want to
It's so damn hard to believe in the things that matter most
What you just can't seem to understand
Is you've got me as your friend
I fold this hand that I've been playing all these years
Well tomorrow is burning bright
So get outside and just enjoy the daylight
It's time you realize growing up is moving on
So run away

Get up and get into me cause you know you want to
It's so damn hard to believe in the things that matter most
What you can't seem to understand
Is you've got me as your friend
I fold this hand that I've been playing all these years
That I've been playing for all these years
