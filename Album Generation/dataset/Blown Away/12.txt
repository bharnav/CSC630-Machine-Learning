[Verse 1]
Once upon a time our world was on fire
And I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits
Guess I had a lot to learn
'Cause fire turns to embers
Embers to ashes that blow away too soon
Now everything after you is like

[Chorus]
Having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you, babe
To you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong, you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

[Verse 2]
Looking back I guess it's really for the best
Still you’re something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go
You’re a habit hard to break
I got used to being high
And nothing that I try seems good enough right now
It’s all so watered down

[Chorus]
Like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you, babe
To you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong
You can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

[Outro]
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It's like having wine
It’s like having wine after whiskey
