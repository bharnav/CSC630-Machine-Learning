[Verse 1]
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry
'Cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

[Chorus]
I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Verse 2]
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

[Chorus]
I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I’ll see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Outro]
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
