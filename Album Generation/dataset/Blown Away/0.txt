[Verse 1]
Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love
And go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me
He’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl
Like every good girl does
Want a fairy tale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl
So good for him
Better back away, honey
You don’t know where he’s been

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

[Outro]
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
