Back To Me Lyrics

I've got ways to make you sorry
Start my life with someone else
I've got ways to make you fall
Tell you all the things that I lied about
I've got ways to make you mad
Just laughing at the girl sittin on your lap
I've got ways to make you sing my songs
The ones I ain't written yet

Chorus
I've got plots you've never seen
I've got moves I've never used
I've got ways to make you come
Back to me

I've got ways to make you strange
Drug you up and drag you home
I've got ways to track you down
In all of the places you like to go

I've got ways to make you crazy
Wear all the things you always wanted me to
I've got ways to make you run
And my daddy is coming for you

Chorus
I've got plots you've never seen
I've got moves I've never used
I've got ways to make you come
Back to me

I've got ways to make you hear me
Just by whispering your name
I've got ways to make you think
You'll never be happy again

I've got ways to make you see
I'm so much better than before
I've got ways to make you swear
You won't want your old life anymore
Chorus
I've got plots you've never seen
I've got moves I've never used
I've got ways to make you come
Back to me
X2
