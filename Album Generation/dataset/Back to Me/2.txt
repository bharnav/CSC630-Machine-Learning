Painted over the walls
The saddest colour of blue
Posters covered in glass
Favorite curbside grab
Red Valentine's card
Stuck on the mirror to keep
Record player made of tubes
Spinning Tommy by The Who

There's no time to waste
There's no time to wait

Keys on the hook by the door
For the truck sold years ago
Standing guitars in the case
Filling up closet space
Vintage 40's wardrobe
Pink Emerson radio
Old lace dress I bought in the store
Motorcycle boots on the floor

There's no time to waste
There's no time to wait

Sirens up on the street
Smoke is burning my eyes
And the neighbours are screaming at me
I can only carry one thing
I can only carry one thing

There's no time to waste
There's no time to wait
