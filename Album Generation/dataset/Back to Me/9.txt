This is not my town and it will never be
This is our apartment filled with your things
This is your life, I get copied keys
Try and force a little smile hold it a little while for you

These are your old streets and you know them well
One way shortcuts all the way downtown
But your favourite find is just my secondhand secret
Try and hide a little pain for the things
I can't explain to you

These are your good friends and I like them fine
Cuz they are your past and your present time
But would you even be the same if you left them behind
All the things I used to be
All the things I miss of me for you

These are your good friends and I like them fine
These are your old streets and you know them well
This is not my town and it will never be
And it will never be...ours
