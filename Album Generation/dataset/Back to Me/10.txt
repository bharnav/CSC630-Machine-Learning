I've got a long, long list of things
That no one needs to see
Desk drawers filled with picture frames
Postcards tucked in underneath
We were only young when we moved away
It went on and on for years
You fell in love and now you live in the city
I'm my own company out here

Don't get down
Good things come when you stop waiting around
Good things come when you stop looking
Don't get down
You've just got to stop looking

There are some things that I believe
Like if you've got nothing you've still got your family
And when you are no one you're still the king
And there's not a dollar enough in the world to
Make you sing

So don't get down
Good things come when you stop waiting around
Good things come when you stop looking
Don't get down
You've just got to stop looking

There are some things I used to be
Won't you find the will just to remind me
Because you are so safe inside my memory
And the scar underneath my knee
