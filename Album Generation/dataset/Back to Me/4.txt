Of all the things that you could choose to say
"Baby come home with me for old time sake"
"Stand by my side and flash me that smile"
"Everybody is out tonight"

So I called you up from god knows where
Would you lie in bed if I were there
Speak soft, just talk I will listen
Don't you dare leave till the morning
Like you always do

Follow me down through the streets of the states
Make up a reason not to come for old time sake
Nothing in this town could ever change
Except maybe new lines on your face

So I called you up from god knows where
Would you lie in bed if I were there
Speak soft, just talk I will listen
Don't you dare leave till the morning
Like you always do
