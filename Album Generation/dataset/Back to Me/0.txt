I can spot your kind a million miles away
Buckle down boots and a bloodshot gaze
You talk so sweet until the going gets tough
The last job you pulled was never big enough

Don't say you'll change after the next time
You wouldn't even be yourself if you weren't telling a lie

And I know where the cops hang out
I know where you'll be found
I know what you're all about
I know when you're going down

You only call me honey when we're alone
Hiding at your place up on Slack Road
You've got an answer for every little thing
You can't even tell me where you've been

My face couldn't make you leave it behind
Maybe 20 years in state will change your mind

Cuz I know where the cops hang out
I know where you'll be found
I know what you're all about
I know when you're going down

And don't say you'll change after the next time
You wouldn't even be yourself if you weren't telling a lie
Maybe 20 years in state will change your mind

Cuz I know where the cops hang out
I know where you'll be found
I know what you're all about
I know you'll never change now

I know my love was good enough
I know you would have shed my blood
I know you can't shut me up
I know when you're going down
