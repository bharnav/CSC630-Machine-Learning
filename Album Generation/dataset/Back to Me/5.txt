I know how to play this game
One, two, three and I'm safe
Count real slow to five
You couldn't keep me around if you tried

I know how to beat the rage
Of my tender age
Touch me once in the hall
But don't look back and don't call

There are some things I can hardly say
You've got me feeling a brand new way
Please don't let this be summerlong

I used to play this game
In the middle lane
Pass them all on the inside

And don't get caught in a lie

There are some things I can hardly say
You've got me feeling a brand new way
Please don't let this be summerlong
'cause I want to stay

All the nights and wasted time
Trying to get my head to change its mind
All the talk of what it could be
When it never was

There are some things I can hardly say
You've got me feeling a brand new way
Please don't let this be summerlong
Please don't let this be summerlong
'cause I want to stay
