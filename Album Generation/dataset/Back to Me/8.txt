I used to look for you out in the daylight
I took highways and sidestreets and back lanes
Slept under open skies
Life can be cruel
Life can be sweet if I want it to be

This town that I once called home
I just can't hold on to
It's got bus stops and strip malls and people
I would never even talk to
She said life can be cruel
But life is so sweet cuz I let it be

Everybody out here
They wanna live somewhere else
I wish I could find a place
And stay there by myself
Bit by bit I swear I think I'm losing
All this city's confidence
