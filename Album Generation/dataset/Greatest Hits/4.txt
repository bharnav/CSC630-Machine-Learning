[Chorus]
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 1]
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
He should know, he's been there enough
Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much, oh

[Chorus ]
Daniel my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
Oh
Daniel my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

[Outro]
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh God, it looks like Daniel must be the clouds in my eyes
