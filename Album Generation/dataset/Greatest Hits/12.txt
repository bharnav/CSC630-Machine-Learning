[Verse 1: Elton John]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's going to catch you when the bitch gets back
Eat meat on Friday that's alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Verse 2: Elton John]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
