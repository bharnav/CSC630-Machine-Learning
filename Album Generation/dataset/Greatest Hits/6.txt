[Verse 1]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things looking better, baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy hurts

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things looking better, baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things looking better, baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

[Outro]
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
