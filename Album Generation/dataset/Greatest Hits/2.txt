[Verse 1: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Verse 2: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
