[Intro]
Okay?
(Y'all can start singing)
(Alright- alright- set - I can't hear you- not that damn loud!)

[Verse 1]
You've got something about you
You've got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed

[Verse 2]
I was born on Olympus
To my father, a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one

[Chorus]
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul

[Bridge 1]
(What?- I can't, I don't want to do it too loud)

[Verse 3]
I'm the lord of the wastelands
A modern-day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the

[Chorus]
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul

[Bridge 2]
(What?- I can't do that! I don't know if I can play that!)

[Verse 3]
I am the lord of the wastelands
A modern-day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the

[Chorus]
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
