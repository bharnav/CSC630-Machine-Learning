[Verse 1]
Someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard
Catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave

[Chorus 1]
Yeah and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 2]
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

[Chorus 2]
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 3]
And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck
Don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose

[Chorus 1]
But to be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Chorus 2]
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Outro]
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do
