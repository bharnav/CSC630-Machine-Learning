[Verse 1]
I've got a will this time, I don't care what you say
I've got a feeling this will all go away
It's in the wind this time, it's in the southern sky
I can't walk on water yet won't even try

[Chorus 1]
Drown me slowly, enclose me
Drown me slowly alright
Drown me slowly, enfold me
Drown me slowly

[Verse 2]
All that I took with me was a bad taste in my mouth
Went all around the world just couldn't spit it out
Just like ground zero was the surface of the sun
That's a sickness, I can't fix it, not all at once

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]
Don't let them take you down
You'll leave a better world than you found

[Bridge]
Don't let them take you down[x4]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Drown me slowly
