[Verse 1]
Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk
She looked at me and winked her eye said "see you after class"
I heard the school bell ring that told me that the day was done
She called me back and locked the door my lesson's just begun

[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
Teacher's wet

[Verse 2]
Sitting down she crossed her legs her skirt crept up her thigh
Feeling something start to rise my thought began to fly
You've been a naughty boy she said now that you can't conceal
I'll have to punish you the best way that I feel

[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
Teacher's wet

[Verse 3]
She took my hand and gently placed it in between her thighs
With open legs and heavy breath she slowly closed her eyes
Her flesh was aching and her hands began to stray
One thing that I know for sure I won't forget today

[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
Teacher's wet

[Verse 4]
Pulled me down forwards her mound teacher tasted sweet sixty-nine
I don't mean lines this was teacher's treat
Played hide and seek with teacher's mouth her lips were warm and wet
Now today I've had my way and teacher won't forget
