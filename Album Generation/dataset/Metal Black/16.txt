Die hard
Satan, father, help me from this grave
Demons, warriors, ever be my slaves
I can't reason with men and mortal fools
They will die hard, hear the golden rule
(Die hard)
Legions iron and steel
(Die hard)
Men of war revealed
(Die hard)
Captors of the brave
(Die hard)
Sinner, liar, guard your crown of thorns
Priestess, parson, live your life of scorn
I can raise the fires of hell and blasphemy
We can grow strong, satanic royalty
(Die hard)
Legions iron and steel
(Die hard)
Men of war revealed
(Die hard)
Captors of the brave
(Die hard)
Die hard
Great fires of hell
Come on Satan
(Die hard)
Legions iron and steel
(Die hard)
Men of war revealed
(Die hard)
Captors of the brave
(Die hard)
Evil, angels, vultures of the night
Oh, ride the wings of hades
Death is on our side, furnace burnin' bright
We ain't getting tired
(Die hard)
Legions iron and steel
(Die hard)
Men of war revealed
(Die hard)
Captors of the brave
(Die hard)
Yeah
