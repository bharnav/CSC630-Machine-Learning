Come on turn it up!
Madness
Stalking the night, feeding fast on my prey
Draining the life 'till the dawn of the day
Drinking and sucking, the blood rushing sweet
Heart drained of glory and heart drained of heat
Bloodlust
Tearing the flesh of the weak and the child
Sparing no one, the meek and the mild
I sink my fangs in your neck as you dream
I am Count Cronos, Vampire Supreme
Bloodlust
Bloodlust upon me, I'm biting the flesh
I'll take away all your God given breath
Now I shall feast on your life giving blood
Leave you to die on the land you once stood
Lust, oh bloodlust
