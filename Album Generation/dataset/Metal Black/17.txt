You have got everything I need
You can bring my soul out of me
I'll pay your wicked price, deliver your merchandise
Gypsy, you'll drive me a dream
Acid Queen
Wild tames the raging beast
Child helps the blind to see
Demon controls my mind, leaves the real world behind
Mold me a purgatory scene
Acid Queen
Acid Queen
You ain't want to hear no one
Can you hear me?
I said get out of here, you
Witch, now you've given all you've got
Bitch, thought you'd left me here to rot
You're coming down and fast, you've tripped your very last
I'll take your place and sing
Acid King
You deny
