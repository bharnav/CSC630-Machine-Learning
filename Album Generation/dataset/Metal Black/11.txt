Bursting out
I'm a son of a bitch, ready to stitch
You mothers not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears and ain't got no fears
And the key to my heart bears no lock
Hell has granted me three wishes
Life, death, immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your Blessed Trinity
'Coz I'm bursting, I'm bursting out
'Coz I'm bursting, I'm bursting out
I'm a bastard and brave, I'm nobody's slave
I'm telling you once and for all
Breaking the laws 'coz I know the score
Waiting on nobody's call, nobody's call
Hell has granted me three wishes
Life, death, immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your Blessed Trinity
'Coz I'm bursting, I'm bursting out
'Coz I'm bursting, I'm bursting out
Let's burst right out of here
Let's go
Let's burst right out of here
