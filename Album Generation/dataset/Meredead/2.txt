Like cold breath writhing in despair
These lonely souls never disappear
Like a mission nobody wants to share
This curse will never disappear

Velvet heart
Poison reaches my veins when you caress me
I'm not alone
A deadly kiss in the dark

Your velvet heart
The ashes of love buried in the past
A masquerade of the lonely torn-apart souls

Like marble halls in winter's sphere
I'm breathing you wanting me
Within these never-ending walls
These souls will never disappear

Within these walls awaiting voices whisper
These marble halls so cold and never-ending
Like cold breath writhing in despair
I'm breathing you, wanting me, someone take me away from here

Velvet heart
This burning
This yearning
This killing heart
