I close my eyes forever
Forever and evermore
One lonesome sigh a time between
Let the spirits in
Let my spirit sing

Welcome to the lonely holy spirit's masquerade

The first gate of pleasure
The second door we'll lose all shame
We'll dance through the heavens enter spirit's masquerade

The light of day is fading
Hear the violins fill the halls
This is our way to heaven and to spirit's masquerade

A scarlet fever shakes me
Desire burns within
Redeem me from my sins
Let my spirit sing

And when the morning falls silent
We all fall asleep

For all and forever
Forget our deeds
