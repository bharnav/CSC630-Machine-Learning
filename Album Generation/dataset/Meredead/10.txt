Tie me to a pillar
Feed me with your lies
I will still know that true love never dies
Have a look into my tell-tale eyes

Build me a coffin
Lock it with a million nails
I will still know that my love can never fail
Have a listen to my tell-tale heart

For centuries and centuries
We stepped on our enemies
To make them speak
To make them bleed
And make them plead for leniency
But memories cross boundaries
You cannot wipe out memories
And all those dreams
That cause believes
Delete our grieves and grimy sins

Push me from a mountain
Watch me I can fly
'Cause I know where I'm going
Into my seventh life
Have a look into my tell-tale eyes

Tie me to a pillar
Push me from a mountain
Spit on my innocence
Sit on my freedom
But my soul is invisible
My life goes in circles
If my ghost caused you trouble
I tell you I'm still here
