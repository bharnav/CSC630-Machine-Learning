[Verse 1]
I've got a wound that doesn't heal
Burning out again
Burning out again
I've not sure which of me is real
And I'm alone again
Burning out again

[Pre-Chorus]
My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

[Chorus]
It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belong

[Verse 2]
They're selling shares of me again
But I'm not buying it
I'm not buying it
My wound goes deeper than the skin
There's no hiding it
So I'm not trying it

[Pre-Chorus]
My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

[Chorus]
It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belong

[Post-Chorus]
Somewhere past the setting sun
Going back where we belong
I'll find you
The setting sun

[Bridge]
Let the weak say I am strong, and it won't be long
Let the rat say I was wrong, and it won't be wrong
Let us find where we belong
Beyond the setting sun
Beyond the setting sun

[Chorus]
It won't be long, I belong
Somewhere past the setting sun
Find me free, find me strong
Somewhere back where I belong
