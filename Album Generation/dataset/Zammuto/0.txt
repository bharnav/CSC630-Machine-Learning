Grown man says, I don't have to walk no more, late
Tear out all his priviliges, grown man wouldn't know
It's all good it's alright, grass is solved, but it's revolting
To watch you complaining at the lake
The smallest little violin stuck in your eye makes you cry
Riddles made you fake
Groan man, don't cry
Groan man, don't cry
When you're on your own, leave the past behind
When you walk along, relax unwind
Justice says, I don't have to hold my head
