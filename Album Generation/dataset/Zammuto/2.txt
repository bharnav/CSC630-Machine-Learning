You see? What did I tell you about people!?
You can't trust 'em! You can't even depend on 'em!
They're leaving!
Now, what do you think of the, human race
They can't wait to get outta this place
They leave us when we're down
Oh I knew they would
So if you're sorry don't come crabbing to me
Brother don't come crabbing to me
