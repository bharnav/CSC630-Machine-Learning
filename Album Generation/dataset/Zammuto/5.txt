Shame, shame, knows my name Shame, shame, knows my maiden, Christian name. And do they smile down on me every time I feel embarrassment While walking on the wide horizon? And do they earn a dime for every time I hate myself and who I am While walking on the wide horizon? Will they be satisfied when I come back weather-beaten leatherized While walking on the wide horizon? Shame. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling. Faces up to the weird ceiling
