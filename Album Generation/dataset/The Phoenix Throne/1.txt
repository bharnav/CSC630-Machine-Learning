Coldâ€¦ hands feed us death
While war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set
The sacrifices we endure
Perfection we pursue
Darkness, nothing pouring through
Like Harkonen vision
All will fall before usâ€¦ and all will be made to suffer
Bornâ€¦ Screamâ€¦ Confusionâ€¦ Painâ€¦
Bornâ€¦ Screamâ€¦ Confusionâ€¦ Painâ€¦ Insanity
All will fall before usâ€¦ and all will be made to suffer
Bornâ€¦ Screamâ€¦ Confusionâ€¦ Painâ€¦ Insanity
Reborn into this fleshen form
Forced through the portal of the womb
Fear is the mind killer
I'll face my fear and allow it to pass through me
Fear is the mind killer
I'll face my fear and allow it to pass through me
Coldâ€¦ hands feed us death
While war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set
All will fall before usâ€¦ and all will be made to suffer
All will fall before usâ€¦ and all will be made to suffer
A vision of lightâ€¦
A survivor of deathâ€¦
A vision of lightâ€¦
A survivor of â€¦
Deathâ€¦ Screamâ€¦. Confusionâ€¦ Painâ€¦ Insanity
Deathâ€¦ Screamâ€¦. Confusionâ€¦ Painâ€¦ Insanity
Return to the source where it all began
I can't make any sense of it
Not in the way you demandâ€¦
Fear isâ€¦ the mind killer
I'll face my fearâ€¦ and allow it to pass through me
Fear isâ€¦ the mind killer
I'll face my fearâ€¦ and allow it to pass through me
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion
A vision of light
A survivor of death
From far away not everything is perfect
From far away not everything is perfect
From far away not everything is perfect
From far away not everything is perfect
