Up and out

I never regretted a thing
Take a glance from the inside
It isn't what you think
This is it
This is everything i have
So between you and me
Give up all fucking hope

I've got the answer, so save your
Fucking, explanation
This is the last time I'll suffer
Through your exploitation
Harvest truth and save it for your revelation
I've lost all trust and i've finally
Had the realization

All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you

Give up hope

I don't care and I'm through
Hearing you justify
You've given up and I know
You've fucking died inside
We've burned it all and everything it signifies
I've reched my breaking point
And i finally realize

All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you

Give up hope

I'm sick of trying and I'll never
Put my trust in you
No more heroes no promise of something new
It's over now
There's no more damage you can do
You're dead to me, because me and you are
Finally through

All my heroes have failed me
And I have given up hope
This is the last time I ever
Place my trust in someone else
And I have given up all fucking hope
