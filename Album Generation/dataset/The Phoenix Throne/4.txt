Crashing Flowing Swirling
Right from the start
Gnashing Ripping Bleeding
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Through my cloudy vision
Billows of crimson
Signal the feast
One last bite, it brings release
I'm sinking fast
Take my last gasp
I'm lost at sea
One with her finally
Coming from all sides
Confusion, pain, mortality
Reminds
That I cannot live

My last hope for survival
My last attempt at freedom
My last pointless struggle
It sets me free
I can't believe they let me go
Now which way is home? (2x)
OH SHIT!!!
Here they come again
OH SHIT!!!
Here they come again
Quickly tears my flesh apart
OH!
Here they come again
CHUM! (8x)

My last hope for survival
My last attempt at freedom
My last pointless struggle
Sets me free
They have the right to reclaim what is rightfully theirs (2x)

CHUM FIESTA!!! (3x)
OH SHIT!!!
Quickly tear my flesh apart

Crashing Flowing Swirling
Right from the start
Gnashing Ripping Bleeding
Quickly tears my flesh apart
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! (3x)
Quickly tears my flesh apart
F**K!
