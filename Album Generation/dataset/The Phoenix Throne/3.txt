The hands of time are frozenâ€¦ in thisâ€¦ moment
I can't spit it out for fear has overtaken my voice
Waiting seems impossible different stages
Waiting seems predictable different ideas
It is I that will have to live with this
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
It is I that will have to live with this
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
Hear I am the worthless kingâ€¦ Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless kingâ€¦ Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless kingâ€¦ Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless kingâ€¦ Join my legions of useless
Wandering the great depths
Searching the canyons for truth
Discovering every darkness
Bringing its ugliness into new light
It's come down to thisâ€¦ All or nothing
Our Choiceâ€¦ Decide
Decide our suffering
It is I that will have to live with this
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
It is I that will have to live with this
Live with thisâ€¦
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
