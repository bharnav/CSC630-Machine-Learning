[Verse 1]
Seventeen seconds and I'm over it
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face
Trying not to listen
To the voices in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright now
(It's a distant memory, baby)
Alright now
(You know you should just let it go)
Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show

[Chorus]
Wearing me out
(All this)
Hanging around
(It just starts)
Getting me down
(Till I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out

[Verse 2]
Brain-dead from boredom
I'm led to distraction
Scratching the surface of life
Nothing really happens
But it's easy to keep busy
When you tell yourself you're traveling right

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright now
(Was it really worth it, baby?)
Alright now
(Was it just a waste of time?)
Keep on second-guessing
Use my memory like a weapon on everything I try

[Chorus] x2
