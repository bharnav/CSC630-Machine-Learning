[Verse 1]
Get up in the morning
I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away

And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And I say
(La la, hey hey)

And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed

[Chorus]
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)

[Verse 2]
And when you're smiling on me
That is all I need
To put behind me all my worry
And life's complexities
It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself
And everything else
That depressed me yesterday

And I can sing
(La la, hey hey)
Yeah I sing
(La la, hey hey)

[Bridge]
When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
If only I could always be just as I am right here
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light
And I won't get by if you take that light away

(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)

[Bridge]

When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
If only I could always be just as I am right here
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away
