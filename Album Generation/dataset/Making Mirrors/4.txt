[Verse 1]
You're a fraud and you know it
But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
Anyone would do the same

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
So now that you've arrived, well you wonder
What is it that you've done to make the grade?
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them?
Will they see then
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure
What you do it for
Well do you even want to know?
You put on quite a show

[Bridge]
Mother, are you watching?
Are you watching?
Mother, are you watching?
Mother
Mother

[Verse 3]
You're a fraud and you know it
And every night and day you take the stage
And it always entertains
You're giving pleasure
And that's admirable you tell yourself
And so you'd gladly sell yourself to others

[Bridge]
Mother, are you watching?
Mother, are you watching?
Mother, are you watching?
Mother, are you watching?
Are you watching?

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure
What you do it for
Well do you even want to know?
You put on quite a show

[Outro]
