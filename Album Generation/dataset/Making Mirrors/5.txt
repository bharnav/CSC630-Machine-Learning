[Verse 1]
There was a time I was down, down
I didn't know what to do
I was just stumbling around, around
Thinking things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call

[Hook]
And I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more

[Verse 2]
And there were times I was sure, so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care any more
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
I only have to see you and then

[Hook]
I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more
I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more

[Verse 3]
Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
Like everything just brings you down
Just when you think there's nothing you can do
A friendly face will bring you around

[Hook]
And you'll feel better
You'll feel better, you'll feel better
Better than before
You'll feel better, much better
No you won't be down any more
