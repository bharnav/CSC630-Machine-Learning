I had a dream last night
I was back down in old Caroline
I had a dream last night
I was back down in old Caroline

Well, I woke up down in Texas
Yeah, without that girl of mine

I had a dream
I was rollin' in my baby's arms
I had a dream
I was rollin' in my baby's arms

Well, I woke up with my pillow
Yeah, and my baby was so far

Well, I'm leaving in the morning
Leavin', I'll go see that old friend of mine
Yeah, I'm leavin', leavin', leavin', leavin' baby

You know my wheels
Ain't gonna stop turnin'
Till I get back to Caroline
