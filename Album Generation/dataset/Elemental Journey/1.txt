I'm getting the feeling loud and clear
The time is now for getting out of here
I saw a sign that I can't ignore
(?)

[Chorus:]
So here's a toast
With one that's poor
To last forever and the minute more
Good fortune seems to you have sung
To live and love
Way past long
May you live and love
Way past long

I'm shaking off these blues
Like a dusty broom
To let them mop and sweep across the room
Tell Max we meet wherever again
And we'll know each other the better my friend

[Chorus:]
