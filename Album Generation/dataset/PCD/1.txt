[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
Every boy's the same since up in the seventh grade
They been trying to get with me
Tryna - ha-ha-haaa, ha-ha-haaaa
They always got a plan to be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna - ha-ha-haaa, ha-ha-haaaa
I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around, that's not the way it's going down

[Pre-Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
Cause they only want, only want
My - ha-ha-haaaa, ha-ha-haaaa
Only want, what they want
But, na ah-ahhhh, na, ah-ahhhh

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Do you know that no
Don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute, let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushin' like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
Tryin' get your [*gasps*]

[Pre-Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
Do you know... that I know?
And I don't... wanna go there...
Only want, only want
My - ha-ha-haaaa, ha-ha-haaaa
Only want, what they want
But, na ah-ahhhh, na, ah-ahhhh

[Post Hook: Will.I.Am - Repeated]
Boom-boom, Boom-boom
Boom-boom-boomp...
Boom-boom, Boom-boom

[Nicole Scherzinger]
Ooooooh, you've got it bad, I can tell
You want it bad, but oh well
Dude, what you got for me
Is something I -
Something I don't need...
Hey!
