[Intro]
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

[Refrain]
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling...so good, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River's running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel

[Refrain]
It's a new dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good, so good

[Verse 2]
Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world, for me, for me

[Bridge]
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel

[Refrain]
It's a new dawn
And a new day
And new life for me
And I'm feeling...oh, woah
I'm feeling....good

[Outro]
Come on
You know how I feel
You know how I feel
You, you know how I feel
Feeling good
I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good
Feeling good
Feeling good
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life, for me
