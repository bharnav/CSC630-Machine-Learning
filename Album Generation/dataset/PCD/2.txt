[Verse 1: Timbaland & Nicole Scherzinger]
Everybody listen all over the world
I got a story 'bout my favorite girl (Wait a minute)
Oh, my baby sexy for sure
I had to have him when he walked through the door
(Wait a minute)
She was 'bout to drive me insane
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains
(Wait a minute)
I'm focused but I'm losing control
He only wants me for my body and soul

[Hook: Timbaland & The Pussycat Dolls]
Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back, so wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Minding my business, I was doing my dance
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance (Wait a minute)
Did I mention he was buying the bar?
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard (Wait a minute)
Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need
Droppin' his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees (Wait a minute)
Now he been blowing up my phone like he know me
Been leaving messages "You know what you owe me"
Oh, no

[Hook: Timbaland & The Pussycat Dolls]
Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back, so wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)
Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back, so wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)

[Interlude: Nicole Scherzinger & Timbaland]
What is your problem daddy?
Slow your roll
Who you think you jiving?
You're disturbing my flow (Wait a minute)
Why you be bugging?
Like I'm some kinda hoe
Got no more questions
Now I want you to go
So break (Break)

[Verse 3: Timbaland & Nicole Scherzinger]
(Hey, let me talk to you for a minute
Shut up...shut up)
I love the way you strut
Girl, you already know
But, I'm feeling like you don't want me
You just after my dough
Baby, please, I'm fine
I'm not one of these hoes
Chasing dreams and diamond rings
So don't call me no more

[Break]

[Hook: Timbaland & The Pussycat Dolls]
Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back, so wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)
Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money
Can't even call a player back, so wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
(Wait a minute)

[Outro: Nicole (Timbaland)]
See, I don't want your money
Yeah, I seen you rolling up here
In your cadillac (Wait a minute)
But, I don't need all that
It is a nice color though
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
What they call you, Mr. Tin man or something?
See, I don't want your cars
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
I don't want your jewelry
You can't buy this
So you can keep that (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute...
Uh yeah, you can give me that back
