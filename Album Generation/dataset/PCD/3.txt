[Intro]
Mmm...come on

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
Throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say (Hey)

[Hook]
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick with you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody getting in between
I want you to know that you're the only one for me (one for me)
And I say...

[Hook]
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick with you

[Verse 3]
And now
Ain't nothing else I could need (nothing else I could need)
And now
I'm singing cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you (baby, I'm with you)
Baby, you're with me (baby, you're with me)

[Bridge]
So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts
So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's...that's why I say

[Hook]
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick with you
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stick with you, my baby

[Outro]
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick with you
