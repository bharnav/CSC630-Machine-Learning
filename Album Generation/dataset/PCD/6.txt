[Verse 1]
Well, I tried
But I won't give in
That's alright
'Cause I'm gonna win

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know
I've got to let you go
Now I see
You were never meant for me

[Chorus:]
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight
I want your hot stuff
I gotta feel it
Gotta have your hot stuff
Gotta have your love tonight

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah
I want you back
Ooh, yeah
I want you back

[Verse 2]
I remember the love in your eye (yeah)
When you took my hand and said goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where the river flows
But now I'm free
I'm not gonna go down again

[Chorus]
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it (come on)
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (baby, baby)
I want your hot stuff
I gotta feel it
(I gotta feel it)
Gotta have your hot stuff
Gotta have your love tonight

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah
I want you back
Ooh, yeah
I want you back
Ooh, yeah
I want you back
Ooh, yeah
I want you back
Hot, hot, hot (come on, yeah, yeah)
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot (baby, baby)
Hot, hot, hot

[Chorus]
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (baby, tonight)
I want your hot stuff
I gotta feel it
Gotta have your hot stuff
Gotta have your love tonight
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
(Baby, I need it)
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (Baby, tonight)
I want your hot stuff
I gotta feel it
(I gotta feel it)
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

[Outro]
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
Tell me that you
Do yeah
Ooh yeah
Tell me that you
Do yeah
Ooh yeah
Tell me that you
Do yeah
Ooh yeah
Tell me that you
Do yeah
