[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away from the pain
You drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
I think I've lost my light for I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
Give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
Tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
Give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
Tainted love

[Bridge:]
Don't touch me, please
I can not stand it when you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
But I'm going to pack my things and go
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Tainted love)
Tainted love (Tainted love)
Tainted love (Tainted love)
Tainted love

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burning, yearning, yearning
Feeling inside me, ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart so tenderly
With a burning love that stings like a bee
And now that I surrender so helplessly
You now wanna leave, ooh, you want to meet me
Baby, baby, where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more
