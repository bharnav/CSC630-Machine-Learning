Waited far too long
For this day to dawn
Marked position with an x and kept floating on
Now I stretch and yawn
All impostors gone
Once again it’s time to reap and sow
I’m a rising tide
Rollercoaster ride
We’re ch-ch-chuggin right into the fun
I won't be denied
So you open wide
Cause I’m only looking out for you

My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!

What now! It’s going down!
From way up top to the down low
Take a chromosome
Make it monochrome
And I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do
Be a rising tide
Rollercoaster ride
We’re ch-ch-chuggin right into the fun
I won't be denied
So you open wide
Cause I’m only looking out for you

My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!

My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!

'Cause my patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!

Cause see I rolled in through the back door when it was my turn for throne
I never wanted to stand on your pedestal man cause I was born to build my own
When they say do or die, I said no way no how, they said I wouldn’t last for long

But I’m still standing in the hurricane’s eye and it’s dancing to my song
Again I rolled in round the back door, no I ain’t got no common sense
So you can bitch and whine, but you best stand aside cause I’m doing it again
Well no I won’t unwind, I won't be dumped behind, I won't be coolly led astray
So on the dotted line, I slit my thumb and sign yours truly, HPA!

My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!
