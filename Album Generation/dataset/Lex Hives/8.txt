Where were you when the world stopped moving?
To one side waiting wearily through it alone?
Only life you ever knew looking back at what you used to do
Pass a dump along the road, rearview mirror turn it into gold
You all grew up on the radio and all the moments that I missed
When you had fun fun fun but nowhere to go, they are nothing compared to this
Cause when you don't wake up for nothing, then nothing's all you get
And then when it's all over you're gonna know it was the best that you had yet
Wrapped up in a blanket so soothing
You've stopped but the meter's still moving along
But all ain't quiet on the eastern front
March in time with your commandant Listen up to the latest blast
And let it wipe out your past
Got your mind spinning loop de loop
And it feels like a monkey jumping through a hoop
Here's your moment, wait a moment and the moment is gone
And then you forgot what it was that you want
You all grew up on the radio and all the moments that I missed
When you had fun fun fun but nowhere to go, they are nothing compared to this
You all grew up on the radio and all the moments that I missed
When you had fun fun fun but nowhere to go, they are nothing compared to this
Cause when you don't wake up for nothing, then nothing's all you get
And then when it's all over you're gonna know it was the best that you had yet
Cause we're still here
