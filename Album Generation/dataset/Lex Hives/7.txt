One, two, three, four

See I only wanna have a good life
One I could live and wouldn't have to despise
But I only wanted you to know
That without the money
There's nothing you can do

There are those who never had to work at all
Come from places where green from trees fall
But I only wanted you to know
That without the money they're talk through and through
Without the money
They're just like me and you

You can't start out with two empty hands
From the house up on the hill
And you don't invent the first electric light
On the back of a thousand dollar bill

See I only wanted everything for me
Yeah I only wanted everything for free
Yeah
