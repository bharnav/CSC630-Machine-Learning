You do your time, toe the line
Wading thru the water heading for the wine
Throw your pearls for swine, break your spine
You'll never reach a hundred doin' 99
You gotta lift your chin to see what comes up ahead
Before the casket slams shut and the fat lady's dead

But if I do do all I can
Tomorrow comes a chance
And if I do do all I don't
There's no reason it won’t
I'm gonna sit right down, I'm gonna count to four
So hand it over a couple million or more!

Said I know you gotta work hard, working hard every day
Midnight shifter
I know you gotta work hard, working hard every way
Midnight shifter

Surprise surprise, I got wise
When you get up in the morning I just close my eyes
No dos or dies are worth the price
Cause once you hit the floor they cut you down to size
No don't get me wrong we could be one in the same
But there's a difference in the way that we're playin' the game
Never let no one be no boss over me
You work in chains, but my thinking is free

Cause if I do do all I can
Tomorrow comes a chance
And if I do do all I don't
There's no reason it won’t
I'm gonna sit right down, I'm gonna count to four
So hand it over a couple million or more!

Said I know you gotta work hard, working hard every day
Midnight shifter
I know you gotta work hard, working hard every way
Midnight shifter
