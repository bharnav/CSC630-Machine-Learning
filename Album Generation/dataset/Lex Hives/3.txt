A healthy appetite is good for one and all
And I should be at peace with the world baby, but still I want some more
A larger slice of pie, a bigger set of wheels
A million sets of human eyes staring right at me – come on!
I want shit that’s made in India
Incense, gold and myrrh
Expensive wine and peace of mind
A sailboat n’ dancing girls
Cause I can’t wait forever, no I just gotta have
Beg, steal, borrow, take, heist, nip, get or make, can I hear you say

Is it enough? No! Is it enough? No! Is it? No! Is it? No! Is it? No!
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more

Yeah that’s the way get it, any way I can
Not a balanced sensible individual, not that kind of man
You careful types with sorted lives won’t know what I mean
When I speed through life like biblical locusts on a laser beam
Ain’t gonna deserve nothing, no I just gotta have
I am a man of much importance to me, I’m a much important man

Is it enough? No! Is it enough? No! Is it? No! Is it? No! Is it? No!
I want more
I want more
I want more


More cars! More jewels! More women! More men! More fans! More lawyers! So come on and give me more!
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
