You were the whisper in the wind
You hear that I come back again
Thought I was dead and gone but my light's still on, and...
My time is coming

You see, I grew up in a hole
Squeezing diamonds out of coals
I'm the seventh son
I'm the only one, and I'm...
On the rise

I'm electricity starting to hum
I'm burning brighter than the morning sun
When people try
To do as I
I say, "Let them try!"

Praise the lord, my time is coming

I cut a swath through the Poconos
And I paid my dues in the barrios
I have a plan
And they say I can't
But, yes, I can

No more waiting on the sidelines
And no more hanging on the thin line
Got my leather on
And my problems are gone, and
My time is coming

Praise the lord, my time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is coming

So people of the world
You take a bow
Cause I used to be out
But I'm flaming now
So hold on tight
With your knuckles white, cause

My time is coming

Praise the lord, my time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is...
Praise the lord, my time is...
Praise the lord, my time is...
Coming
