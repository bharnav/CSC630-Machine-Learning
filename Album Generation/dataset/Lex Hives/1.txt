[Intro]
(Go right ahead)
(Go right ahead)
Yeeah
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead! (ow)
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead! (go, go, go)
Go right ahead!

[Verse 1]
Roam the streets in a uniform
(Go right ahead)
Find a bull and you grabbed the horns
(Go right ahead)
Scream your head off at the day you was born
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead

Go right ahead!
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead! (go, go, go)
Go right ahead!

[Verse 2]
Here's a secret, keep it tight
(Go right ahead)
It's California late at night
(Go right ahead)
Lay low and drink, fuck and fight all night
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it right or wrong? You never know it
So just come along, I'm gonna show it
Our God is a zilla, our king is a kong
The room's about to crumble as I burst into song

[Chorus]
Go right ahead!
Go right aheaaaad!
Go right aheaeaeaee!
You've gotta go from A to Z
From when you're born until you're dead

Go right ahead!
Go right ahead! (go, go, go)
Go right ahead!

[Verse 3]
Like a tiger breaking out of the zoo
(Go right ahead)
Doing anything that you wanna do
(Go right ahead)
The rumours you heard, they were all true
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it right or wrong? You never know it
So just come along, I'm gonna show it
Our God is a zilla, our king is a kong
The room's about to crumble as I burst into song

[Bridge]
Go right Ah..!
(Go right ahead, go right ahead)
(Go right ahead, go right ahead)
Go right ahead!

[Chorus]
Go right ahead!
Go, go right ahead!
Go right aheaaaad!
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead!
Go right aheaeaeaee!
You've gotta go from A to Z
From when you're born until you're dead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead

Go right ahead!
Roam the streets in a uniform
Go right aheaaaad!
Find a bull and you grabbed the horns
Go right aheaeaeaee!
Scream your head off at the day you was born
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead

[Outro]
Go right ahead!
Go right ahead!
