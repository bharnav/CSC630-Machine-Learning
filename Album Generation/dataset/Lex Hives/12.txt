So what to do now?

We got achin' problems
Said we are breaking the rules
So What to do now?

All the times
I just can't get off

Never thought anyone
Sit around to be that blue
We turn around
?

No education rules
We got ?
We're off to the high school shuffle

So what to do now?

We got amples of trouble
Said we're fading away
I might use it someday
For awhile
I thought I might use it someday

Never thought anyone
Would
Turn around
Just laughin' again

No education rules
We're twisting rules
We're off to the high school scuffle!
(shuffle)
Scuffle!

We got rid of all the rules!
Shuffle!
Scuffle!

Just another high school shuffle
So what to do now?
Ohhhhh
Shuffle!
