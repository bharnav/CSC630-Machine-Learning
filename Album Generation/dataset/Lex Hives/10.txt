One more crime only way you ever knew it
One more time got a feeling that you blew it
It's a long way down
One last line put the blame on someone else
Now you dug your own well, put the poison in yourself
And my head hangs down
Got a pain in my brain, you is just a migraine
Won't shut my mouth for another day cause you see

If a had a cent for every time
You went across the line
Of what's appropriate or not
I'd be the richest guy in town

One last time and you're gonna power through it
Moan, bitch, whine then you come back and I knew it
It's a long way down
Tongue still split now you're burning through the pack
I could always spot your friends by the daggers in your back
And my head hangs down
What is this? Monkey biz, I have had enough of this
Won't shut my mouth for another day cause you see

If a had a cent for every time
You went across the line
Of what's appropriate or not
I'd be the richest guy in town
And my head hangs down
