Yeah!

Be aware of the pretty face
The one that calls your name

Be aware of the german race
They can leave a stain

I'm a man of flesh of and bone
To wallow in pain
Sometimes I get burned
That's why I go insane

Be aware of those tender words
That don't mean a thing
Be aware of the simple things

I'm a man of flesh of bone
To wallow in pain
Sometimes I get burned
That's why i'm going insane

Ahhh!!!

I'm a man of flesh of bone
To wallow in pain
Sometimes I get hurt
That's why i'm going insane

That's why i'm going insane
That's why i'm going insane
That's why i'm going insane
That's why i'm going insane

Ahhh!!!
Insane!
