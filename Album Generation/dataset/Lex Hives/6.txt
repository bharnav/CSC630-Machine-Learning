[Verse 1: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
Take back the toys that you've given me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break out the box
I sink the pebbles and boulders and blocks

[Chorus 1: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
So take back the toys that you threw my way
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break out the box
I guess the tables were served on the rocks

[Verse 2 : Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
I've been down on the beaten track
Just holding on, holding up, holding back
Given not what I've got but of what I lack
I guess that's what we've been taught all along
It's the time for poison in the locks that I got for free
And I've been pumping the pills placed in front of me
But I've had enough baby I'm breaking free
I never knew why it would take me so long

[Chorus 2: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
Take back the toys they are destroying me
Hear what I say? I say
Take back the toys that you've given me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break out the box
I sink the pebbles and boulders and blocks

[Bridge: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
Open my eyes to what I despise
And in fourteen seconds or more I tear it down

[Verse 3: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
You see they give you toys just to distract
And then they break your mind so they can break your back
Got you in so much that you can't pay it back
And that's the way that it has been for far too long

[Chorus 3: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
Take back the toys they are destroying me
Hear what I say?
Take back the toys that you've given me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break out the box
I sink the pebbles and boulders and blocks

[Outro : Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
So take back the toys that you've given me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break out the box
I guess the tables served on the rocks
