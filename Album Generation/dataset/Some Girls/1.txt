Yeah, Mama and Papa told me
I was crazy to stay
I was gay in New York
I was just a fag in L.A
So I saved my money
And I took the plane
Wherever I go
They just treat me the same

When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah

Yeah, I go to 53rd Street
And they spit in my face
But I'm learning the ropes
Yeah, I'm learning the trade
The East River truckers
Are churning with trash
I've got so much money
But I spend it so fast

When the whip comes down, yeah
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down

When the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down

Yeah, some call me garbage
When I'm sweeping up the street
But I never roll
And I never cheat
And I'm filling a need
Yeah, I'm plugging a hole
My Mama's so glad
I ain't on the dole

When the whip comes down, yes
When the whip comes down

Yeah, when the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah, yeah

When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down

Yeah, go ahead

Yes

When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah, I'll be running this town
I'll tell you
When the shit hits the fan, baby
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down

Yeah
Oooh!
Shh!

Why baby, why, why baby?
I'll tell you!
I'll be running this town!
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out

Yeah, when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah, when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
