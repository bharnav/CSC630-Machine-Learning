No one told me there'd be days like these
I'm sick of sinkin' man I'm on my knees
Tell me again just why you lied to me
It's separation anxiety
Where did I go wrong?
Is what I'm feeling
Some kinda love song
To stop the bleedin'
Get on the right track
We'll never make it back
You go the wrong way
You're goin' my way
All the things I said to you are over now
And I just can't get over you

Since you've been gone I fall apart
I knew you'd leave me from the very start
Tell me again just what you want from me
It's separation anxiety
