Nobody really knows the pain
But everybody knows your name
You've got their full attention, all eyes on you
Small talk can get you through the day
There's got to be a better way
When all your friends are faceless
You can fake it
He knows the highs and lows
He'll give you what you need
And we all agree it's time to shine
He'll stand and deliver
He goes about his day
Smile and a wink hello
When the picture's gone
Fading to black he's poppin' down prozac
Nobody knows the highs and the lows

Sports cars and fancy souvenirs
That you collected all these years
So proud and self assured, hold your head high
A chest of broken memories
Of how and why and what could be
Still locked inside your closet
You can't fake it
