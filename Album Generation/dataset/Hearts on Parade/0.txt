Some call it love I don't know what you're thinkin' of
Such a mystery to me
Somehow you always like to play undercover
It's your path to discover
Roll me like we're tumbling dice
A wrecking ball rag doll ain't no breathing space
All the tapes have been erased
Prize fighter taking all the punches he can stand
And dropping on command
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you

What you don't understand
Forget the master plan
I'd give it all away to have you back again
I said it in my letter
So we could make it better
No need for you to read between the lines
Baby can I be your baby
Definitely maybe won't do

Ruby red play dead they don't make a sound
Plastic soldiers in a row
You're shouting calling all destroyers what to do
They're coming after you
Surrender but the battle is won

She thought of cars where to drive trying to survive
How to make the great escape
Still watching life on other planets fall apart
She wears it on her heart
All my dreams are trying to come true
But all I ever wanted was you

Someday you'll see
All our worlds collide
Way out in space
