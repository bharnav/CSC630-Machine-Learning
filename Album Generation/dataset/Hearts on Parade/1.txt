She likes the boys in the band
I'm moving fast as I can
Sliding over in her direction
Pause to check out my reflection
She's wearing all the right clothes
The jam is playing on the stereo
Checking emails on her phone
She got more hits than the rolling stones

Hell yeah so young and fine
Could she be the one my baby
I'm gonna make her mine
At least for tonight
Hey ya'll I gotta know
Did she get my number maybe
You tell her blow me up
I'm one call away, hell yeah

She's everything that you need
The kinda girl we all dream of
Long legs never stop
Like all those videos in zz topp
She got the stars in her eyes
And she don't mind if you tease her
Can't get her outta my mind
Can't you see she put the freak on me

You know it hurts when she looks so bad
Can't you see you're the best thing I never had
I'm walking out the door before I act like a fool
(She's not that cool)
