We were good, playin' hard, rollin' down the boulevard
Liquor drinks, between the bars
Making out, back of cars
Hey, you see that girl?
She's the one that wrecked my world
Think you're gonna take it far
She don't wanna know who you are
Sunset strip, back in black, i'm right on track
Holdin' court like obie wan, baby's got it goin' on
So what am I supposed to do
She left me I got nothin' to lose
Exit axis bold as love got a new girl i'm thinkin' of
One thing you gotta know
I thought I did everything just to keep you around
I hope that you're happy now
I'll keep my good intentions and you keep the car
This story's coming to an end
Baby we can't be friends

Disco trip, party ships, breakin' down those ruby lips
Ex-girlfriend, comes in view
Sees me there with someone new
Hey, you see that girl?
She's the one I wrecked her world
Baby's in my cadillac, drivin' off no lookin' back

What makes you think I'd wanna call?
I forgot your number
What makes you think I care at all?
