I understand your point of view
So what do I say
I've been so underwhelmed before
You've got a lot to prove

Somewhere lines get crossed it's true
It's the nature of things
The longer we can see it through
The more we make believe

Baby likes a blue sky
I don't mind if it's gonna rain on me sometime
Maybe got her mind made up for sure
Baby won't you come back home?

All the people that we love
Disappoint us the most
Makeshift friends and low demands

We're runnin' outta time

Baby likes a blue sky
I don't mind if it's gonna rain on me sometime
Maybe got her mind made up for sure
Baby won't you come back home?

My late night call
One way to fall
I miss you still

Baby likes a blue sky
I don't mind if it's gonna rain on me sometime
Maybe got her mind made up for sure
Baby won't you come back home?

Baby won't you come back home? (3x)
