Ooh ah, baby aw, she gaw, yeah
Tell me how you like it so far, baby pa
I thought, I thought, I saw some good putty tat by the bar
But when the light hit him, yo, I was like nah

Put the needle to the record when I'm getting butt naked
I like your microphone, do you mind if I check it?
One, two, yeah, I like the way it sounds
No feedback, I need that turn your ass around

Ding, dong, is anybody home?
I'm like, King Kong on a throne in Rome
I don't have a car yet no rims of chrome
No diamonds no pretty stones

Just a dresser drawer filled with broken cell phones
But I didn't pay my bill so no dial tones
But I don't care hey people get loud
Jump on the stage can you hear me now?

Step, step, uhh, like that
Gonna get set up
Ooh, ooh, come on, are you movin' yet?
Step that, all my body's gonna get that
Feelin' good, let's do what your body should

I always wanna punch people wearing Von Dutch Trucker hats
Oh Lord, I hate 'em so much
But anyway let's just get it back gutter
Dirty ass street shit make to me shutter
With anticipation gotta stop wastin time

Let's go, we can all catch a case in
Federal court 'cause I'm better at sports
Spend the weekend in Wisconsin at a Cheddar Resort
Spend cheese and G's with the greatest of ease

Rude girls, no, thank you, no please
Got no kinda manners, got no home training
Gettin' so wet, you would think it's raining

Took a trip to Spain and points beyond
The prince took me to an opera but I just yawned
Spawn of the devil but I chill in Heaven
Get my forties and blunts from Seven Eleven

I wanna drop top, poppi poppi, chop shop, poppi poppi
Matt cock it back in the hotel lobby now
We rip shows in other continents
You rob Mickey D's for condiments you should

Send your man my compliments
Your pillowcase is where the condom went
Are you tired? You can catch your breath
Or there's something you'd like to do instead

Uptown and downtown, ugly people, be quiet now
Everybody bring the ruckus
Corner crack slingers and redneck truckers
North Cackalacka South Cackalacka
Make some fuckin' noise for FannyPackalaca
Smack all you bitch ass backpacalackas
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, comin atcha
