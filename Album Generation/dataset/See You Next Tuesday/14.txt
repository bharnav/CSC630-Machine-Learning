You got it burnin' burnin', I keep you yearnin' yearnin'
You got me so far gone, there's no returnin' turnin'
So ladies, move them hips from the left to the right
Round and round til that thing feel right

Let it bounce, let it pop to the sound of the beat
'Cause the heat got us drippin' from our heads to our feet
I, I, I, I want you, baby
I ain't trippin' that fire drive me crazy, baby

Fire, fire, fire blaze it up ten time higher
Make it burn like when fire catch kaya
Fe smoke the highest grade my desire

And when it's burning and upside down the place turning
And a nuff, nuff, nuff respect we earning
Anytime we pass through people yearning for more

I feel the fire, boy, make me feel tired boy
Seems like I'm wired, boy, make me perspire, boy
Keep it scorching hot, I'm like a sweat box
We steaming up the spot, somebody call the cops

Work up an appetite, yeah baby, get it right
We'll do it all night, slap it flip it dim the lights
I, I, I want you, baby
I ain't trippin that fire drive me crazy baby

Fire, fire, fire, blaze it up ten time higher
Make it burn like when fire catch kaya
Fe smoke the highest grade my desire, oh

And when it's burning and upside down the place turning
And a nuff, nuff, nuff respect we earning
Anytime we pass through people yearning for more

Light it up and burn it down you just
Put those flames up, make it hotter now
Spark that thing, we gettin' heated now
So so hot we got uh whatcha needed now

Bust that shot and cock it back again
Smokin' hot thats how we do it and
Temperature is movin' up and up
Fire, fire, bring me up another cup

Fire, fire, fire, blaze it up ten time higher
Make it burn like when fire catch kaya
Fe smoke the highest grade my desire, oh

And when it's burning and upside down the place turning
And a nuff, nuff, nuff respect we earning
Anytime we pass through people yearning for more

Fire, fire, fire, blaze it up ten time higher
Make it burn like when fire catch kaya
Fe smoke the highest grade my desire, oh

And when it's burning and upside down the place turning
And a nuff, nuff, nuff respect we earning
Anytime we pass through people yearning for more
