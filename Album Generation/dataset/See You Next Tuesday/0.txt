Yeah finally some fun stuff
Me and my girls can get wild and what not
Forget all the haters, forget your troubles
Get dressed, get lookin all cute
Go to the party, the club, or whatevah
Tell that dj to play yo song
Say yo my man bust out with my joint
That's right
Go ahead and find that special someone
And do your thing
Just do it yo
Get loose
Have fun and enjoy yourself
Okay y'all lets do this
You ready?
Okay people
Let's get famous
Let's get famous
LET'S GET FAMOUS
