Us girls, be needing dances too
Us girls, sexy dances from my boo
Us girls, we like dances too
Us girls, boy I thought you knew

What the deal son, how you feel son
Get down in front of me and kneel son
I wanna feel one, steal one
We can burn rubber and peel son

Champagne room, me and you
Now here's what I want you to do
Get down slow, set it on back
Putcha fine ass down in my lap

Work it around, now gimme a thrill
Let me know now, I'mma grab an' feel
You gettin' me worked up for real
The price is right, so let's make a deal

Relax, sit back, ah yeah
You do it on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap

Sit back, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You do it on my lap

Same lap time and same lap channel
Workin' my control panel now
You could do it once, you could do it for a change
In the hooptie, in the range

In the friendly skies up, up in a plane
Or on a locomotive, choo choo train
Got a diamond in the back, move it up top
Work it all around and don't you stop

This a really, really good, kinda deal we got
I sit down in my lap, you hop
Stickin' me with friction, makin' me hot
Searchin' my body like a dirty cop

Relax, sit back, ah yeah
You do it on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap

Sit back, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You do it on my lap

Pardon me, sir but can I please get a dance
Straight up grinding, no romance
Twenty bucks, what the hell, I'll take a chance
Let me help you outta those pants now

Start off slow, okay
Here we go, okay
Faster pacin', oh yeah
Conversation, no way

Can I touch it? Why you look so shook?
Can you put the cranny inside the nook?
Can you finger through the pages like a book?
Can I have the twenty bucks back that you took?

Relax, sit back, ah yeah
You do it on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap

Sit back, ah yeah
You dance up on my lap
Like that, ah yeah
You do it on my lap
