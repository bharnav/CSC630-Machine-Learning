Keep it up, let's go
Move it like you know
Keep it up, let's go
Move it like you know

Keep it up, let's go
Move it like you know
Keep it up, let's go
Move it like you know

If you want more
Keep it on the floor
I said, if you want more
Then we're here, you can't ignore

Let's go now, you want more
Keep it on the floor
I said, if you want more
Then we're here, you can't ignore

Let's start some ana
In this man or girl
Just a wanna dance a
Can I get a oh no

Baby, shake it like a cold
Getcha weight up, throw it down
Yeah wassup, I get around
Keep it tight, every night
Come on, get me feelin' right

We got the top choice girls and boys
Everybody makin' noise
Beauty brains insane
Style and poise

This is it, handle it
Break it up, dismantle it
So put it back, take it out
This is what we're all about

Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go
Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go

Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Let's go

Keep it up, you know what's up
Lemme see your pimp cup
Lincoln and Myrtle too
Got more shells than turtles do

Don't ask why, don't think
Hit the floor, bring me a drink
If you blink then we'll be gone
Think you got it dead wrong

This the song you sing to
You know what we been through
Rip another venue
Then we gon continue

To tear it up, wear it up
Decibels just blare it up
Don't you cry, don't weep it up
Everybody keep keep keep it up

Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go
Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go

Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Let's go

Let's do it now, turn around
Get off like a wedding gown
Let's do it now, turn around
Get off like a wedding gown
People on the pitchers mound
Turn it up and lock it down

Fast ball, curve ball
Working on your nerves y'all
In the mall or on the block
This is how we gonna rock

People in the front
And people in the back
People everywhere
There ain't no turnin' back

Cut you slack, I think not
This is your only shot
Derelicts and hard rocks
Keep it up because you got to

Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go
Keep it up
Keep keep keep it up
Let's go

Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Keep it up
Keep movin' movin'
Let's go

If you want more
Keep it on the floor
I said, if you want more
Then we're here, you can't ignore

Let's go now, you want more
Keep it on the floor
I said, if you want more
Then we're here, you can't ignore, let's go now
