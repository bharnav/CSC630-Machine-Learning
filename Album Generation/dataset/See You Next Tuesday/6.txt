Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that
Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that

Uh, I want, you want
We wanna do that
Uh, I want, you want
We wanna do that

It's alright, it's okay
You gonna pump our gas someday
On fire all night
Make it hot like great white

I don't know if you know
Okay, here we go
Time to make it really hot
Pump it, give me all you got

We pump, you pump
Dump trucks blow the trumpet
Puppy doggies wanna hump it
Oh well, what the hell

Never ever kiss and tell
Butterscotch on the crumpet
People, let me see you pump it

Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that
Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that

I'm sorta like trump
And you my apprentice
If you don't pump, you fired
And you got a life sentence in purgatory

What's yo story?
Why'd you have to go and bore me?
Cheers normy, pour it for me
Weather's gettin' stormy like a hurricane in the rain

Ready percoset go when I kill the pain
Tell me what's good people
Real sugar never equal
No artificial flavor

No, I can't do you no favors
First you gotta sign this waiver
Suck up on this lifesaver

Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that
Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that

For my down home cats
My smokin' home grown cats
Totin' chrome packin' gats
Brooklyn to hackensack

Act a fool, but do it right
Keep it in the trunk, tonight
Gon' get drunk, tonight
Puff a lotta skunk, tonight
