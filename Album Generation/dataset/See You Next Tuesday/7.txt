Push Up To You
Ready To Do You
Then Play It Off Like I Thought I Knew You
Whats Up Boy
Whats Yo Name
Whats Yo Sign
Whats The Time
I'm Gonna Go And Get This Freak
Peeka Boo Can I Take A Peek
Saw You Walking Down The Street
You Looked So Fine I Had To Meet
You For A Drink At The Cafe
Limo So Stretched I Call It Taffay
Come For A Ride Boy I Won't Bite
Unless You Ask Me Reall Polite
When I Saw Him
Walking Down The Street
He Looked So Fine
I Just Had To Meet
I Asked His Name
Does He Wanna Play
As We Walked
All That I Could Say Was
Mmm Hmmm Yeah Yeah
I Know You Feelin Me
And Boy I Feel You Too
You Joke And Laugh With Me
And Call Me Your Boo
Walk Me To The J Train
Almost Every Day
When We're Together
All That I Can Say Is
Mmm Hmmm Yeah Yeah
Oh Yeah God Damn
Run Up On You And I Take Ya Hand
Hey Now Lay Down
Now Its Time To Play Now
On Boardwalk And Park Place
All Up In Each Others Face
I Know You Shy But Its Alright
As Long As You Keep That Body Tight
Now Dont You Worry Bout A Thing
Isnt He Lovely Looking
Just Wanna Shout It From The Roofs
Hes My Boo And Thats The Truth
