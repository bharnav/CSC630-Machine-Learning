Distraction number one, her looks kill more than a shotgun
Shakes it up a little downtown, with the right crowd
But she always stands out
You think it's all in good fun, you know it's not when she's done
What's she gonna do, haven't got a clue
Here's the situation, she's your medication

Like white lines on a mirror!

She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
You took a look and now you're hooked, it's what I predicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
You took a look and now you're hooked, it's what I predicted

She's taking over now, she's in control, don't know how
I've seen it with my own eyes, and I realise, she's always in disguise
There's no stop to the world she spins
She looks like an angel, but she's all sin
Boy, you're so pathetic, you're never gonna get it
Here's the situation, she's your medication

Like white lines on a mirror!

She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
You took a look and now you're hooked, it's what I predicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
You took a look and now you're hooked, it's what I predicted

I want mymymymymymymymy my drugs
I want mymymymymymymymy my drugs

Look Out!

She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
You took a look and now you're hooked, it's what I predicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
Just one look and you get addicted
She's drugs, she's drugs
