Hey!
I'm ready when I wake up, I'll take on everything, I'm made of gasoline
Relax is not a word I understand it makes no sense to me
Attack never bend shit man you should do something
Don't think that time stands still it's passing you by meanwhile I'm ready

Sleep is the enemy
Sleep is the enemy

Good morning, how you doin, hit the bottom, rock the cradle
Skim the fat, get the payoff, stay lean, keep the blood clean and get ready
Fear is what needs to be put to sleep, out of reach
And when you decide you've got to do it and move it you can feel it

Sleep is the enemy
Sleep is the enemy

Stay still, be calm, relax, screw that, pull the alarm
Make the waves, roll the dice, suck the life, beat on the brat
Cut the crap, turn the white black

You know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about

I'm ready when I wake up, I'll take on everything, I'm made of gasoline
Relax is not a word I understand it makes no sense to me

Sleep is the enemy
Sleep is the enemy
I'm ready!
