When will I see you again?
It's a question I ask all the time
It's now the last time 'til the end
All I need to see is a sign

It's starting to wear me down
Little by little
Feeling like a sick dog
Everything's gone wrong

Tell me what it takes
To make it like yesterday
One thing that is true
I'll be waiting

If I only knew what was right
I'd do it in a second to calm down
Oh baby, when day falls to night
My heart always ends up on the ground

When will I see you again?
It's a question I ask all the time
It's now the last time 'til the end
All I need to see is a sign

Everynight, spent alone, nothing gets easy, no one comes home
It's simple when you say
I've accepted what's come to me
Tell me what it takes
I'll be waiting

If I only knew what was right
I'd do it in a second to calm down
Oh baby, when day falls to night
My heart always ends up on the ground

When will I see you again?
It's a question I ask all the time
It's now the last time 'til the end
All I need to see is a sign

A sign, a sign, a sign, a sign, a sign

If I only knew what was right
I'd do it in a second to calm down
Oh baby, when day falls to night
My heart always ends up on the ground

When will I see you again?
It's a question I ask all the time
It's now the last time 'til the end
My heart always ends up on the ground

When will I see you again?
It's a question I ask all the time
It's now the last time 'til the end
All I need to see is a sign
