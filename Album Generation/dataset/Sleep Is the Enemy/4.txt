Nobody really cares what you have to say
You get cut off in traffic cause everyday's a bad day
What do you do you don't wanna 'cause a scene
But if you do nothing they'll step all over you, you're too naive
So this is what you do
Look 'em in the eye
Open your mouth and say

You get you get you get you get you get the finger
You get you get you get you get you get the finger

You catch your boyfriend with your best friend on the floor
Or some girl you go out with don't want to no more
Two wrongs don't make a right but you know what I'd do
Listen to me watch this and do it too
This is what you do
Look 'em in the eye
Open up your mouth and say

You get you get you get you get you get the finger
You get you get you get you get you get the finger
I say you get you get you get you get you get the finger
You get you get you get you get you get the finger

Give it to 'em for counting you out
Give it to 'em for leaving you back
And when you raise it tell them
"Now..I..give..you..the..finger"

You get
The Finger
You get
The Finger
You get you get you get you get you get the finger
You get you get you get you get you get the finger
