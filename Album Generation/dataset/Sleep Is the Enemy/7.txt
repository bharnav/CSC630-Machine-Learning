I'm always moving and I ain't got the time
To live it up a bit and stay up all night
If you wanna meet up here's what you do
Give me just a second and I'll tell you the truth
Make sure you're not easy to shock
You need a little bit but I got a lot
You're feeling itchy honey I understand
You need a man with a natural tan

Let the sun hit your skin
Burn it again and again now
Body's boiling
I like it tight
When it feels right
Is usually night time
Keep it rolling

I was born with the sun in my eyes
Don't need the light baby I prefer night
I dig love but the way that you move
Makes me wanna ditch it and get on with the groove
So how 'bout it is it feeling alright
Moving fast but the bark doesn't bite
Let's grow up and kiss all night
Wake up in the morning I'll get out of your sight

Let the sun hit your skin
Burn it again and again now
Body's boiling
I like it tight
When it feels right
Is usually night time
Keep it rolling

Oh yeah
Bodies boiling
Oh yeah
Keep it rolling

I'm always moving and ain't got the time
To live it up a bit and stay up all night
If you wanna meet up here's what you do
Give me just a second and I'll tell you the truth
Make sure you're not easy to shock
You need a little bit but I got a lot
You're feeling itchy honey I understand
You need a man with a natural tan

Let the sun hit your skin
Burn it again and again now
Body's boiling
I like it tight
When it feels right
Is usually night time
Keep it rolling
