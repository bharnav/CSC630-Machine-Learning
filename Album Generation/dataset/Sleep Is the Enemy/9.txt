I've got these feelings, alive in my head
Don't listen to reason, they only see red
And I'm coming to get you, coming to get you
I know I'm gonna live through this
And when the wound on my back heals
I'm coming to get you, I'm coming to get you
Alright

Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing
Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing

'Til the bullet is lodged in my skull
I refuse less and risk it all
'Cause I'm coming to get you, I'm coming to get you
I know I'm gonna live through this
And when the wound on my back heals
I'm coming to get you, I'm coming to get you
Alright

Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing
Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing

I've got these feelings, alive in my head
Don't listen to reason, they only see red
And I'm coming to get you, I'm coming to get you
On the day I find you the sun will shine
The birds will sing, everything will be right
I'm coming to get you, and I'm coming to get you

Living Proof

Alright
Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing
Just look at me
I'm living proof
Time heals nothing
