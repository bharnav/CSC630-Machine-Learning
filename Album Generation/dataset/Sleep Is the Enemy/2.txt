Please don't look around for anybody else
Why don't you concentrate on yourself
Someone's gotta say that it's ok to feel alone
You're not a freak you don't need help

Everybody wants to fall in love...not me
Everybody wants to fall in love...not me

And when the radio
Plays a lovesong
Something that you should know
They're all wrong

Everybody wants to fall in love...not me
Everybody wants to fall in love...not me
Everybody wants to fall in love...not me
Everybody wants to fall in love...not me

All your friends got someone else they hang out with
And now you want your someone else too
But to me it all seems that they breakup just to makeup
They got nothing to do

So why don't you consider just eliminate it
All the fuzz and fighting around
I'm not trying to tell ya what to do
Just wanna pick you up ‘cause you're down

Here's something they're never gonna tell ya (wo-o-a)
I kinda figured it out (wo-o-a)
As much as people wanna love ya
They'll always wanna try to bring you down

Everybody wants to fall in love... not me
Everybody wants to fall in love... not me

And when the radio
Plays a lovesong
Something that you should know
They're all wrong

Everybody wants to fall in love... not me
Everybody wants to fall in love... not me
Everybody wants to fall in love... not me
Everybody wants to fall in love... not me

I'm not gonna fall for it
