So you got dumped on your rump not surprised you had nothing to say
To your friends the night before your birthday
But you got up and took control of the situation
Got it then he wants you back without an explanation
You change your style
You change your hair
Your jeans got tighter
Now people stare
He bites his hand and doesn't stop thinking about you
He asks a friend to ask you out now what do you do?

You know that he wants you but you don't want him anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation

Well you caught her in the act with 'a Brad' from your work station
You used a baseball bat and now it's into litigation
But you stood up cooled off and walked away despite your temper
Now she's calling you from January to December
You let it slide
You played it cool
And now she calls you
But you're no fool
She's not even worth the time but I think you know this
And she can have all the boys that are on the checklist

You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation

You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation

Woo, don't get stuck!

It's that girl that you let go the one that doesn't get the picture
Because you left her right wanting to get back together
But you moved on found another and it leaves no question
She cries to her friends just to get attention
She puts you down
But you let her
You're feeling guilty
She's feeling better
But when she sees you
With another
She tears her heart out
You can't be bothered

This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation
This is this is this is a sticky situation

You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation
You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation
You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
