First date, electricity
When you walk in you short my circuitry
Back it up with attitude
When people sweat it out you always play it cool
I think I know you, I'm gonna bet
That you like Superchunk and Joan Jett
Get your quick fix in my car
You've got a sweet tooth and I'm your chocolate bar

And it goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on

And I say, "heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
'Cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do

New York Doll on the catwalk
I like to play it discreet, you only wanna shock
Spray paint your tight jeans on
And cruise yourself, it don't feel wrong
So take a chance, give me a shot
You think I'm bluffing? I think I'm not
Get on your high heels, give me a heart attack
I got a question for your sweet ass

And it goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on

And I say, "heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"
'Cause I do, do you do, what I do, and with you, if you do, what you do, would I do
A-whoo-hoo-hoo!

-Doorbell-
"Well hello baby, you look so hot tonight! Can I hold your hand? Oh thank you! Now this is what we're gonna do on our date today! We're gonna do all the things all the couples like to do. We're gonna go to a movie, we're gonna have some dinner, take a walk, look at the moonlight, anything you want, but baby I got a question..."

"Do you kiss on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, let's do it on the first date!"
"Heyyyyy, what do you do on the first date?"
"Heyyyyy, do you kiss on the first date?"

'Cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do, 'cause I do
Woo-hoo-hoo!
