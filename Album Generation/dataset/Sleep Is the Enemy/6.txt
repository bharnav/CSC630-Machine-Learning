I'll crash my car, just for you
I'll burn my house down, just for you
I'll rip my nuts off, just for you
I'll max my creditcards

I'll sell my soul, just for you
But nothing's good enough
I might be the longer road
But I'd make it worth your while

When you're invisible, it's easy
When you're invisible, it's easy

I'll rip my eyes out, just for you
I'll slash my wrists up, just for you
I'll break my dick, just for you
I'll make my momma cry

I'll dip my hands in blood
I'll be your kicking dog
Point crosshairs at my head
I'll take it all

When you're invisible, it's easy
When you're invisible, it's easy

Come on, alright, alright

I'll crash my car, just for you
I'll burn my house down, just for you
I'll rip my nuts off, just for you
I'll max my creditcards

I'll rip my eyes out, just for you
I'll slash my wrists up, just for you
I'll break my dick, just for you
I'll make my momma cry

When you're invisible, it's easy
When you're invisible, it's easy
When you're invisible, it's easy
