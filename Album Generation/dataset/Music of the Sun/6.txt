[Verse 1]
Baby, slow down
Just hear me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need to push
No need to rush
You know you had me from 'hello'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it comes to my heart, I don't play
Baby boy, can't you see the stop sign?
You're moving much too fast
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)

[Verse 2]
Boy, can't you see?
I'm not tryna be the girl who gets taken for a ride
You take your time, and you will find there's so much more to me inside
And you say there's no need to delay
You're telling me to trust you
Boy, you know I want to, baby
But my heart it's so recently break
Before we take this very far, show me who you really are

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late ?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late ?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (take our time)
