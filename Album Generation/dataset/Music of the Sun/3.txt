[Intro: Vybz Kartel]
Vybz Kartel
Rihanna
You know, my love for you's the highest
Please say yes

[Chorus: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no
You don't love me and I know now (I love you with my heart and soul)
No, no, no (baby)
You don't love me, so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby  (baby), I shoulda left (when?) you a long time ago, no
(Timeless)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
Playas gonna play (I don't play)
At least that's what they say
Well, I know that for myself now
(You know I love you)
You said you loved me babe (to my heart)
And then you played your game (me?)
A game that I know all too well now (easy girl, you know I'm sorry)
Well, I used to buy your lines, but it's time for me to sail now

[Chorus: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no (no-n-n-no-no, oh)
You don't love me and I know now (you don't love me and I know)
No, no, no (no, no, no, oh no)
You don't love me (love me), so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
So let me go now (No, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby, I shoulda left you a long time ago, no (a long time ago)

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
First you tellin' me no, but please tell me yes
Without some of this stress
Straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest
As ya chest you got me feelin' like I'm climbin' on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna, your lovin' really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me
Soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes, yes to that yes, to whateva you suggest
So please say yes

[Verse 3: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no
Haters gonna hate (let them hate)
I found out much too late
I think I know we're a little hot now (feel mature with my pride)
The truth leads to the lies
The heart ain't always right (I know that)
And I see that love is blind now (I can show you)
Boy, you used to have my trust
Without trust, there ain't no us, boy

[Chorus: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no (no-n-n-no-no, oh)
You don't love me (you don't love me) and I know now
(Love you forever with all my heart)
No, no, no (no, no, no, baby)
You don't love me, so let me go now
(let me go, let me go, let me go, baby)
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me (if you ask me), baby (baby), I shoulda left you (I shoulda left you) a long time ago, no
Can't let you go
So please suggest
No, no, no (It's so over baby)
(I know)
You don't love me (you don't love me)
And I know (and I know) now
No, no, no
