[Verse 1]
You said we girls, but all the while
You look at my man with a funny smile
Now I don't look, it might be me
But ain't no need to bump so tightly
That night we all hangin' at the club
You tell Mr. DJ wanna rub a dub
When I don't look
You took a chance to ask my man to come and dance

[Pre-Chorus]
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot
Don't even waste your time
'Cause a love like ours is hard to find
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
(Oh) 'Cause he's got me singing that la la la
(Oh) Our love is strong, yes, it's keeping me fortified
(Oh) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right
(Oh) He got me singing that la la la
(Oh) So fall back, don't be hit and you can't deny
(Oh) Oh yes, he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right

[Verse 2]
I hope you take this as a lesson learned
This ain't that kind of party, so just let it burn
The next time you see me act like you know
I don't play those games
Don't take me for a joke

[Pre-Chorus]
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot
Don't even waste your time
'Cause a love like ours is hard to find
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
(Oh) 'Cause he's got me singing that la la la
(Oh) Our love is strong, yes, it's keeping me fortified
(Oh) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right
(Oh) He got me singing that la la la
(Oh) So fall back, don't be hit and you can't deny
(Oh) Oh yes, he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right

We got, we got, what him and me, we got, we got

[Chorus]

(Oh) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la
(Sing) (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right
