Aahhh aahhahAH ahh..4X
So soft and slow
Never knew a girl could be so god damn cold
I know, the way she move got me spendin my dough
And yo, If you would've seen what i seen on that pole
Just know
That i was wrong for fallin in love
I was wrong for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
I was wrong for fallin in love
[Don't do it yo']
I was wrong for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
But i just went against the grain
It was a feelin i can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
Look at me, I'm stuck
That bubble in my pants got me caught up
I never, had no luck
Thinkin with the wrong head got me jumpin out there
With no glove
It feels so good had me sprung out all messed up
Now i'm stuck
That's what i get for fallin in love
That's what i get for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
That's what i get for fallin in love
[Don't do it yo']
That's what i get for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
But i just went against the grain
It was a feelin i can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart
I'm caught
The way she drop down won't allow me to close my drawers
Cause i'm, already in love and i knew better from the start
Oh No
I was wrong for fallin in love
I was wrong for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
I was wrong for fallin in love
[Don't do it yo']
I was wrong for fallin in love
[They always say don't love a ho]
But i just went against the grain
It was a feelin i can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
Aahhh aahhahAH ahh..4X
