[Intro]
Yea it's like you know sometimes you feel like its better to just you know keep how you feel to yourself but you know sometimes you don't wanna put yourself out there you know you never know when the feeling is mutual. But you know sometimes you gotta take that chance. You never know. Yea

[Verse 1]
Let me get in your ear for a minute
And cut straight to the chase
Be real for a minute
Couldn't say it to your face
Was weird for a minute
I'm setting the record straight
Since you're here for a minute(here for a minute)
Now let's be clear
This ain't simple at all
Less than a year we done been through it all
That's what is seems like
From the beginning we was getting along
Remember you spinning me spitting while we listen to songs
I think it's safe to say we hitting it off
You would agree right
Had the kid nervous sweat dripping in all
I bet witnessing the business had me sitting in awe
Walk you to your car settle for a kiss on the jaw
Even though it's tempting dismissing promiscuous thoughts
Attempted to resist giving you more without a green light
It's funny how its on your wrist would evolve
Into a symbol of our intimate bond
Now don't it seem right

[Hook]
Inside(Inside x4)
(Wayna)
Involved with feeling what I feel inside
(Kenn Starr)
I'm bringing it all out
Couldn't say it before
So I'm saying it all now
Couldn't keep it on the
Inside(Inside x4)
(Wayna)
And still concealing what I feel inside
(Kenn Starr)
If I would've known
What would I know now (Know now)
It would have been on
It would have gone down

[Verse 2]
Yea, everything is peace for a minute
Managed to keep your attention at least for a minute
But, then I got weak for a minute
Caught up in a situation
I had to keep discreet for a minute(discreet for a minute)
Now seeing is how we was impressed with a open no's
Doesn't change the fact that we left on an open note
So my homie knows you wants us to be enough
Me succeeding
And treating
You when you needing
To know what's up now
Are you feeling me and feeling me not
And ain't no need for you to bluff
We've known to keeping it real right(real right)
But instead I end up feeling your spots
Situation got kinda rough
But its good to know that we still tight
I was underhanded
But you was understanding
Now I got other plans
Ain't no need for us to rush
I can understand
If you were concerned about your reputation being damaged
Keeping it on the hush like

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me break it down
Stop being fancy (Stop being fancy)
Understand me
You was never a plan B (never a plan B)
I just didn't know how to approach
You just hotter than most
You called player without a coach
And yo, didn't know if I was overstepping my bounds
Safe to say I learned my lesson for now
Let's make date
Me and you a couple of drinks
Up in the chill spot
We can rock the like
Water of chock
And Jill Scott
Then we could get little Raheem
To volunteed ya
Put this song on repeat
Please believe i need ya
I ain't trying to jeopardize what we got going
But the feelings that I kept inside had me not knowing
If we on the same page
Feeling the same way
Whether you accept or reject
Shit I just can't wait (just can't wait)
Even if I seem awfully impressed
I just had to get this off of my chest
I couldn't keep it on the

[Hook]
