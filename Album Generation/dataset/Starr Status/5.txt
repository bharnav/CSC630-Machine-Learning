I done came a long way but got further to go
The question is do I deserve to broke?
Just because the majority of people out there never heard of me, no
But as long somebody can say yea, I heard him he dope
And thats enough motivation to jump the more than patient
Juggling situations to struggles to tribulations
Know that success in rapping ain't happening overnight
So I'm sacrificing the social life to get vocals right
Overnight sessions over mics testing my skills
Just another step on another indie quest to be ill
A check and a deal to help me fulfill the rest of these bills
I'm destined but still I'm repping' if you expect me to fail
You keep holding your breath, my peeps know me the bst
I'm just trying creep slowly out this deeper hole in this debt
Doing the school thing choose to stay true to my queen
But thats conflicting with me living and pursuing my dreams
I try to balance it out, but it's a challenging route
I want power and clout but my thoughts clouded in doubt
Stressed to the point that I want to get loud and just shout
But I don't quit when I'm down and I'm out

:::Waiting on you:::
Days turn to weeks weeks turn to months months into years
I'm falling behind :::waiting on you:::
Everybody got opinions on how you living your life it's not yours
It's mine so I am not  :::waiting on you:::
Because I happen to be the type to stand on my own two
My plans don't involve you so :::waiting on you:::
To make it happen for me no I don't plan I don't want to
So this is what it comes to

I come like time's working against me can't afford to be waiting
Even though they say its a virtue can't afford to be patient
The rest of the world hating some claiming they in my corner
The faking and sadly mistaken if they think that I want them
My inner circle seems to be getting smaller by the minute
To the point that if I don't already know you then you ain't in it
Can't hang around with those bringing me down slowly
Refuse to let any set of circumstances control me
All that I know, be a respectable man, with a flexible plan
And maintain the best that I can
Carry traditions I was given and investing in fam
Never fold to pressure to those giving less than a damn
And uphold certain values, ethics and principles
Institute a message and method that you can listen to
This is proof I acknowledge the need for somebody to step up
Sometimes even followers lead I can't be

Days turn to weeks weeks turn to months months turn to years
I'm falling behind :::waiting on you:::
Everybody got opinions on how you living your life it's not yours
It's mine so I am not  :::waiting on you:::
Cause I happen to be the type to stand on my own two
My plans don't involve you so :::waiting on you:::
To make it happen for me yo I don't plan I don't want to
So this is what it comes to

I ain't following the guidelines and rules you abide by
I utilize tools using to prove it's my time
So I act like it and I write with core rap like it
The pen is mightier than a knife in a sword strike like it
Take the initiative focused on what my mission is
Getting my point across if you ain't listening then you missing it
I'm spitting it for the benefit of the like minded
Ace already set the record straight on what its like grinding
It's tough enough as it is without you up in my biz
Respect and establishing a rep is tough enough for the kid
Don't care if I don't live up to what you expect
Never second guess even what I consider my best
You can analyze if you want cause I ain't here to impress
I ain't fin' to sit and be stressed you can give it a rest
Bet, I'm ready for whatever niggas throw my way
Can't another nigga control my fate, I can't afford to be
