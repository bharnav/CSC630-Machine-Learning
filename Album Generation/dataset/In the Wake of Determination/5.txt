[Verse 1]
I found an angel near the edge
I felt her placed against my skin
I saw the face of God, I know
You're more than me, I know I need you

[Verse 2]
When it's a sound that makes you live
The way the needle breaks the skin
And all I want's to keep you safe
But how can we go on this way?

[Chorus]
Now I'm wide awake, staring at the ceiling
As time is counting my days
Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces
As I'm praying for rain to carry me away

[Verse 3]
It's a simple life we live
Where every moment's like a gift
And just a song could help you sleep
But it's hard to sing with broken wings

[Chorus]
Wide awake, staring at the ceiling
As time is counting my days
Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces
As I'm praying for rain to carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away

[Pre-Bridge]
It's moments like these
Where I feel like I'm tied to the tracks
And a train is barreling toward me
I can feel its rumble and I can see its lights
But somehow I'm not scared to die
I don't pray for it to stop, I don't pray for escape
All I can do is close my eyes and wait
And just moments before it decides
To take my heart, take my blood
I tell myself that it's only love

[Bridge]
Take my heart, take my blood
Cause after all it's only love
Take my heart, take my blood
It's only love
We took our time, we turned the page
And now it's all that still remains
We found the lights, we found our name
I hope we find ourselves again
You broke me down, you fucked me up
But still it never was enough
So take my heart, take my blood
It's only love

[Outro]
Love!
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
