Underneath the gun
In front of waiting eyes
Our time has just begun
No second chance tonight
So we walk the longest days to live
Inside the shortest nights
We compromise our hearts
To keep them satisfied
The shadows of our past
Hard to ignore
But judgment means nothing
That's not what we're fighting for
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
Underneath the gun
In front of doubting eyes
We walk this path as one
Take on the world tonight
And we'll carve our names
Into their bones
We'll never sell ourselves
That's not what we're fighting for
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
I won't let this love
I won't let this love die
I won't let it die
There is only one thing
That matters this time
At the hands of judgment
I won't let it die
No sacrifice
Regrets left behind
I won't let it die
This time, yeah, this time
I won't let it die
That's not what we're fighting for
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
No, we don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
I won't let this love
I won't let this love die
