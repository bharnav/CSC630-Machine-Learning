You tell yourself that you're not the same
As you stand in line, your time will all be wasted
Scum of the earth, blind lead the dead
Blood thirsty selfish cold to reject
The colorful, the brightest skies
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said, yeah
Deny the chance to think for yourself
You inherit lives, your time has all been wasted
Follow tradition to quench your thirst
And swallow profits from excess dirt
So shut you queer and face the skies
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said, yeah
You're already dead
You're already dead
You're already dead
You're already dead
So now you stand in line, embrace your leaders
Stand in line, these aren't their words
Stand in line, embrace your leaders
Stand in line, these aren't their words
Refuse to learn
And choke on their tradition
Are you gonna take your turn
And just stand in line?
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said
So take these words for what they are
That's what you said, what you said, yeah
Your denial will lead you
Single file into the ground
You're already dead
You're already dead
You're already dead
You're already dead
You're dead
