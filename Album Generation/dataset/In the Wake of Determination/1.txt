Do you still remember back when the days were longer
Dreams were bigger then
The weight of the world had not yet landed on the shoulders of a man
I thought that time stood still, sheltered, protected
They never told me this would end or that the leaves would fall again
So take me back, back to better days
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Take me back, when we were not afraid
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
There was the day when this world went to war and didn't bat an eye
Feel life in the movies, felt the same to me and I never questioned why
I know the difference now, between fact and fiction
But I've come to find that I've grown bitter in just twenty-four short years
So take me back, back to better days
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
So take me back, when we were not afraid
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Wasting me away, waste away
So now we're running
We're running blind into the light
And we fall behind
We're running and wasting away the time
So take me back, back to better days
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Take me back, when we were not afraid
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Take me back, yeah back to better days
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Take me back, when we were not afraid
'Cause this time between is wasting me away
Yeah, take me back, just take me back, yeah, take me back
Yeah, take me back, just take me back, yeah, take me back
When we were not afraid
