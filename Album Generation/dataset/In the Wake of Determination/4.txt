I never thought I'd see the day
That we honestly could say
We stand five against the world
And the doors are open
Through all those years
I would've died to be right here
I never thought of backing down
With one chance to make a sound
So we'll take our chance right now
These are the days we will remember
(These are the days we will remember)
And these are the days we won't forget
(These are the days we won't forget)
These are the times we've shared
These are the promises we've made
These are the days
Revolution dead and gone
Still integrity holds strong
We stand five against the odds
And rise through it all
Relentless form and dedication carried on
We stand tall and won't back down
With one chance to make a sound
So we'll take our chance right now
These are the days we will remember
(These are the days we will remember)
And these are the days we won't forget
(These are the days we won't forget)
These are the times we've shared
These are the promises we've made
These are the days that we won't forget
Yeah, we carry on convictions
Learning as we go
Living out the only life we know
These are the days we will remember
(These are the days we will remember)
And these are the days we won't forget
(These are the days we won't forget)
These are the times we've shared
These are the promises we've made
These are the days we won't forget
We won't forget, we won't forget
