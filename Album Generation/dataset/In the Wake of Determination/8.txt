Your face was never missed
You cleverness and cunning words did not exist
Bitter bleak, you're fuckin' weak
You know you don't deserve a thing
You fight for pride to save your name
To heal the scars you waste to shame
Take the blame, take the blame
Save it now so this can end
'Cause there's nothing left to prove
To you
You've become the enemy
Let it go, whoa, whoa
But you'll never take the blame
So let it go, whoa, whoa
I'll tear it down, arrogant, sick of it
Flatter everyone you can
I'm pulling teeth, 'cause talk is cheap
You lie regrets are elbow deep
So now its time to chase the dream
With hand grenades and gasoline
Burn it down, burn it down
Every gracious word you speak
'Cause now I see right through
So fuck you
You've become the enemy
Let it go, whoa, whoa
But you'll never take the blame
So let it go, whoa, whoa
The time has come you know
To just let go, just let it all go
And it's not enough
That you're handed everything
Still you smile to my face
But this time I'll tear it down
I'll tear it down and I'll tear it down
'Cause there nothing left to prove
To you
You've become the enemy
Let it go, whoa, whoa
But you'll never take the blame
So let it go, whoa, whoa, whoa
You are your own worst enemy we know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
