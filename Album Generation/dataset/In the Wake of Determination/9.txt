I've swallowed every hook
Fallen for their disguise
Lived by the book
Felt the blade of the knife
As it pressed against my neck
We're taught to imitate
Segregate and divide
Do what we're told
Rise and fall with the time
If we refuse to play the part
Then they will hear us screamin'
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
They advertise your life
Through a blanket of lies
Expand the truth
So their profits will rise
Ignore the sacrifice
Wires cast in stones
At the gods that create
We're amplified
To provide what they take
If we refuse to play the role
Then they will hear us screamin'
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Go
There's a reason for defiance
We can't ignore
With the promise of a new day
This is a war
The blood will spill
The voices will be heard
And tonight we are alive
I swallowed every hook
Falling for their disguise
Lived by the book
Felt the blade of the knife
But I refuse to play the role
And they will hear me screamin'
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Wake up the voiceless
Wake up the revolution
Whoa, we are alive tonight
Whoa, we are alive tonight
We are alive tonight
We are alive tonight
We are alive tonight
We are alive tonight
