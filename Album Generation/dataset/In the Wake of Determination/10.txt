Do you really think
That it's a choice, a way of life?
Played by discrimination
You're narrow-minded, quick to judge
With Bible belt tunnel vision
This is ignorance
Failure to evolve is failure to us all
When will you learn
That this is where we fall?
Failure to evolve is failure to us all
When will you learn
That this is where we fall?
Where we fall
"Is this my fate?", he asked them
They answered, condemning him to burn
Rejected, forsaken, for being born
I can't believe that this is still a question
That needs an answer
A bigot's eyes judging lives
Based on the sex of who you
This is ignorance
Failure to evolve is failure to us all
When will you learn
That this is where we fall?
Failure to evolve is failure to us all
When will you learn
That this is where we fall?
Where we fall
Burn
(Burn)
Burn
(Burn)
Judged and condemned to
Burn
(Burn)
Burn
(Burn)
Judged and condemned to burn
When will you learn?
Will you learn?
When will you learn?
