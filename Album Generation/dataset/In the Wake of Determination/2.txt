Today will be the day
To start rising up and fighting back
And from this moment on we will live our lives
With open hearts and open eyes
Just keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
Keep fighting onward
We take control, we take control
Keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
And we will never step down
We won't fall or hesitate
And from this running life we disengage
And we strive to break away
And stop wasting time on these insecurities
Just keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
Keep fighting onward
We take control, we take control
Keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
And we will never step down
Our time is now
Our time is now
Our time is now
We won't step down, no we won't step down
No we won't step down, no we won't step down
We won't step down
Because our world is waiting for us to live
Because our world is waiting for us to live
So right now just keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
Keep fighting onward
We take control, we take control
Just keep pushing forward
We take control, we take control
Keep fighting onward
We take control, we take control
And we'll never step down
Our time is now, our time is now, yeah
