We're all part of them, of this thoughtless world
A generation bought and sold
Buy a reproduced, stolen copy package
We've been taught to love this robotic formula
Built to please ignorant minds, uncultured masses
Do we know that our ears should failed us now?
Stereo, stereo tired bullshit dressed in gold
Withstand the youth, find the pieces
Stereo, stereo in the world that you've created
Follow the pieces
We're all bought and sold
Radio waves, they still transmit the same
Replica that which will stand this in decay
And as we resist and open our eyes to this
Uniform and standard model being said
We consume, well, our hearts have failed us now
Stereo, stereo tired bullshit dressed in gold
Withstand the youth, find the pieces
Stereo, stereo in the world that you've created
Follow the pieces
But do we know?
We've all been bought and sold
Yeah, bought and sold
We've all been bought and sold
Yeah, bought and sold
We've all been sold
To a world that failed us
Stereo, stereo tired bullshit dressed in gold
Withstand the youth, find the pieces
Stereo, stereo in the world that you've created
Follow the pieces
Stereo, stereo tired bullshit dressed in gold
Withstand the youth, find the pieces
Stereo, stereo in the world that you've created
Follow the pieces
We're all bought and sold
We're all bought and sold
We've been bought
