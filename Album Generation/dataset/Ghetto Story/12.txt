[Intro]
We a step up inna life so tell me what this bag of diss fah?
Work and get your own, nuh grudge your brother and your sister
Bun a hypocrite because the whole of dem a trickster
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor, let this one register

[Chorus]
I see dem coming from afar
Perpetrating war
No matter who they are we
Bun bad mind!
And I hear they coming with their gun
Waan mi life fi done
But dem run, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
When the enemies deh pon we name
No matter what they claim
We nuh shame, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
And who nuh like fi see we car a pass
And a pass remarks
Kiss mi  -, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!

[Verse 1]
Let dem know it is Baby Cham's desire
To bring this heat and fire
We're heading for the top
Tell dem, "Get over it"
Let it go
And allow ghetto youths to progress
Just allow me to show my prowess
Ain't nothing can make us stop
No mon, get over it
Hello, yo, fassy wha' unuh deh pon?
You never know say Jah Jah a mi weapon?
So true unuh never see me with no second
You think a me alone, a that you reckon?
Your business, that's wha' you need to check on
Tell me something? Why a Baby Cham you want to take on?
Maybe a true mi name easy fi beckon
Listen nuh!
Me nuh really deh pon wha' unuh deh pon
Pow!

[Chorus]
I see dem coming from afar
Perpetrating war
No matter who they are we
Bun bad mind!
And I hear they coming with their gun
Waan mi life fi done
But dem run, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
I hear the enemies deh pon we name
No matter what they claim
We nuh shame, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
And who nuh like fi see we car a pass
And a pass remarks
Kiss mi  -, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!

[Verse 2]
Woman!
If you love your man and you miss him
And you a hear say a next gyal a kiss him
Don't bother follow hearsay and go fist him
But if a him diss you first, gyal, diss him!
'Cause you nuh stay like dem weh getty-getty
And you know nuff of dem a catch man peggy
Nuff of dem a dweet 'cause dem too beggy-beggy
Dem nuh like you, but you know that already
So, make dem know that it is your desire
To bring this heat and fire
You're heading for the top
Tell dem, "Get over it"
Let it go
And allow God bless to progress
Just allow you to show your prowess
Ain't nothing can make you stop
Yo, get over it!
'Cause!

[Chorus]
I see dem coming from afar
Perpetrating war
No matter who they are we
Bun bad mind!
And I hear they coming with their gun
Waan mi life fi done
But dem run, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
I hear the enemies deh pon we name
No matter what they claim
We nuh shame, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
And who nuh like fi see we car a pass
And a pass remarks
Kiss mi  -, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!

[Outro]
I see dem coming from afar
Perpetrating war
No matter who they are we
Bun bad mind!
And I hear they coming with their gun
Waan mi life fi done
But dem run, 'cause we
Bun bad mind!
