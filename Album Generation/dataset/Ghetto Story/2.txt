The road to success is not straight
Theres a curve called failure
A loop called confusion
Speed bumps called friends
And red lights called enemies
Caution signs called family
And flat tires called jobs
But if you have a spare called determination
And a engine called perseverance
With insurance called faith
And the drive to make it
Youll reach a place called success (can u hear me?)
This one is for the ghetto youths dem
Man a ghetto youth for life (yo!)

(Chorus:)
I can, not forget where I come from
No mount a money cyaa change man
Still blaze the skunk
But some leave the ghetto get rich & turn punk
But I won't forget my roots cause I don't
Worship money that's not what counts
Kill or be killed
Somehow I have to buy mama house pon di hill (because)

I've been through struggles & wars
I man survive it with just a few scars
Nuff man dead some gone behind bars
Suh right now real ghetto youths dont fear police cars
Experience teaches knowledge
I graduate from the the street side collage
Back when the whole a wi a share one sausage
Suh every now & then mi send back a package (weh Cham seh)
Cho
Some man mek it an a live a better life
An don't recall the days when we a walk wid knife
A simple argument bring strife
Some man a diss dem babymada fi dem uptown wife
Dem a front but I have my doubt
Si dem in the club a flash cash all about
A pose like thug when in fact dem a scout
Cause dem never look back dem rich & sellout
(But)

(Chorus)
When I was small & growing up
If we cooked then Paul is showing up
Paul left town since then he's blowing up
Now him buy Benz him nuh remember him frenz (but)
The other day him get rob pon di block
Broad daylight like round 12 o'clock
Him come pon di corner wid him little fake act
And from him turn millionaire him neva give nutt'n back
(But)

(Chorus)
