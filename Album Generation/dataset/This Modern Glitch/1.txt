[Verse 1]
We're self-imploding
Under the weight of your advice
I wear a suitcase
Under each one of my eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Finally
I know now what it takes
It takes money
And aeroplanes

[Chorus]
If you love me, let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace

I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the vampires and wolves
Won't sink their teeth

I'm sick of dancing with the beast...

[Verse 2]
Astrophysics
You'll never be my closest friend
I find no comfort
In what my mind can't comprehend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Finally
I work out what it takes
It takes money
And aeroplanes

[Chorus]
If you love me, let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace

I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the vampires and wolves
Won't sink their teeth

I'm sick of dancing with the beast...

[Bridge]
No matter how much
It needs me
Go and follow
Someone else's lead

[Chorus]
If you love me, let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace

I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the vampires and wolves
Won't sink their teeth

I'm sick of dancing with the beast...
