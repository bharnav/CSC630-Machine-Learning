[Verse 1]
I'm a good friend and an excellent lover
I can fool myself just like no other
Person can
I'm turning into a twisted man

I haven't got time for any selfless deeds
What I do for you is indirectly for me
I'm a stubborn boy
There's nothing here that you can break or destroy

[Pre-Chorus]
Then as I count sheep in my bed
A train of worry bullets through my head...

[Chorus]
Last night, I dreamt I died
Alone
Through all my talk of self-defeat
A fearful bomb ticks underneath

Last night, I dreamt I died
Alone
From now on, I'll curb the cynical speaking
Seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me

[Verse 2]
Someone once said I don't have any feelings
Well, I think that emotions can be misleading
And thinking back
I might have nailed the coffin shut with that

As I tend to cry in a room full of laughter
Is the cheese finally sliding off of its cracker?
I don't know
I'll just prepare myself to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Then as I count sheep in my bed
A train of worry bullets through my head...

[Chorus]
Last night I dreamt I died
Alone
Through all my talk of self-defeat
A fearful bomb ticks underneath

Last night I dreamt I died
Alone
From now on, I'll curb the cynical speaking
Seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me

[Post-Chorus]
Seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me
It seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me...

[Outro]
Last night I dreamt I died
Alone
And apart from when I lost my virginity
I've never been known to frighten easily
