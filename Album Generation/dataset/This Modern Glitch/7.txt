[Verse 1]
She used to get her kicks
From a fall to the floor
But now she's always wasted
A total looker, but she's jaded

The kind of shivering wreck
That I adore
I can't offer you a rescue
But I can tell you what I'd do

[Chorus 1]
I'd tell my mother that I love her dearly
And tell my father that I need him back again
And if these words don't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip

And flowers might wilt when we walk past
And self-help might help when it makes us laugh
Only finding questions in answers
You and I are just walking disasters

[Post-Chorus 1]
You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters...

[Verse 2]
She only finds her love
In a downtown score
Consumption makes her stronger
You're the sweetest anaconda

The kind of lack of respect
That I adore
I can't offer you a rescue
But when you've lost all that you have left to lose

[Chorus 2]
I'd tell my mother that I love her dearly
And tell my father that I need him back again
And if these words won't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip

[Bridge]
As sharp as a knife and as blunt as a wheel
You be my calm, I'll be your pneumatic drill
And what we'll never want, we'll always need
Right now, we need some pop psychology

To keep us upbeat...

[Chorus 3]
So tell your mother that you love her dearly
And tell your father you won't lock him out again
And if these words won't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip

And flowers might wilt when we walk past
And self-help might help when it makes us laugh
Only finding questions in answers
You and I are just walking disasters

[Post-Chorus 2]
You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters
You and I are just walking disasters
