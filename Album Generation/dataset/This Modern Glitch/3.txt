[Chorus 1]
Please allow me
To be your anti-depressant
I, too, am prescribed as freely
As any decongestant

[Verse 1]
We kick back and let the pills do the talking
People hear a distinct rattle when we're walking
Then there's the extra two stone; that's our only guaranteeâ€¦

Our vivid dreams are just like big production movies
They get entangled well within our daily routines
So please re-think, or use my trademark strategy...

[Chorus 2]
And please allow me
To be your anti-depressant
I, too, am prescribed as freely
As any decongestant

[Verse 2]
It's hard to smile when you're as flattened as a panc-c-cake
The only tears come from our heads when we concentrate
Perhaps I'm being unjust, or perhaps you agree...

Still, I've thrown away my citalopram
I needed more than what was in those forty milligrams
So cast away with the doctor's plans...

[Chorus 2]
And please allow me
To be your anti-depressant
I, too, am prescribed as freely
As any decongestant

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Still, I've thrown away my citalopram
Although I felt as grim as the reaper, man
So cast away with the doctor's plans
Like me
