Oh my love, can't you see?
There's no fear past the meadow in my eyes of green
Take my hand, walk beside
Ain't no casanova, just a burn inside
I can't help what i'm feeling inside
When it feels so right, when you kiss me goodnight
I will take you to the sea to wash away a part of me that's been so lonely all these years
I've got a friend
Ain't no lie
Like the lies it's been telling
It keeps making me cry
Oh my love, follow me
See the love past the meadows in your eyes of green
I can't help what i'm feeling inside
When it feels so right, when you kiss me goodnight
I will take you to the sea to wash away a part of me that's been so lonely
And i'm alive
Thinking i'm holding on to this bird eyes view
In my cage
Say goodbye
Tell me a story
La da dee
La dee da
I can't help what i'm feeling inside
When it feels so right, when you kiss me goodnight
I will take you to the sea to wash away a part of me that's been so lonely
I'm alive
