You're as pure as pur can be
Honey such, wanna touch
Touch your innocence sublime
Perfume high, world collide

I only ever had a picture paranoid of you
I am true
And i want to collect them
So that I could be one too
I am true

And I want you to embrace
Blending your, face on face
Take your time to make the strain
Fool, fool

Go slow,Then turn around, make less changes
(I want you to)

Wave goodbye to Luna Park
Cheerio, time to go
Cos we grow only after dark
Sleep, sleep
