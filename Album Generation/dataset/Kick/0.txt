Kill, comfort, kill, I'm infidel
A simple sound
A scream to the sky
Slam, saccharine Sam
Pushing my pram
With your harlequin words
You turned and said
Sicko sycophants
With a poisonous rant
And a requiem of fear
The guns and teeth
Of London streets, come on
Come on
Oh, kill, comfort kill, I'm infidel
All the fireworks
Explode in the sky
Slam, fashion-cazam
Pushing my pram
With your harlequin words
You run in the dark
'Cos it makes you feel free
And the wind cuts your face
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
That out there something is real
The elixir of life
He licks down a knife
To her wet aperture
To her wet aperture
Kill, comfort kill, I'm infidel
Give me fireworks
Explode in the sky
Slam, fashion-cazam
Pushing my pram
Turning the wheel too fast
They're all sicko sycophants
With elastic banks
Kiss me with the kiss of death
Tell me I'm an individual boy
Come on
You run in the dark
'Cos it makes you feel free
And the wind cuts your face
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
'Cos you wanna believe
Out there something is real
Put your dog on a leash
Put your dog on a leash
Put your dog on a leash
Put your dog on a leash
This is pure
Just keep that man away from me
And keep that sound away from me
With your surgical tears
That callous me in
And when the people say
You're better out than in
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
'Cos your mouth is undone
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
But your blood is alive
