[Verse 1]
Don't you know
After picking the glass off the ground
Don't you know
After shaking the thing for a sound

Do we see what the clock makes you do
But I won't let this happen to you

[Verse 2]
In a town
Where I lost every shirt on the fence
Don't you know
I am bleeding a trail through the lens

When I see what I now know is you
I was caught in the eye as you came
Pulled by my name
I'm fallin' through

[Pre Chorus]
Traveling at godspeed
Over the hills and trails
I have refused my call
Pushin' my lazy sails
Into the blue flame
I want to crash here right now
The hourglass spills its sand
If only to punish you

[Chorus]
For listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song

Sing me Spanish techno

[Chorus]
Listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song

Sing me Spanish techno

[Verse 3]
Don't you know
After wiring the thing to explode
Wired for sound
Wide awake here for days in a row

Now we see what the engine can do
And I won't let this happen to you
I won't let this happen to you

[Pre Chorus]
Traveling at godspeed
Over the hills and trails
I have refused my call
Pushin' my lazy sails
Into the blue flame
I want to crash here right now
The hourglass spills its sand
If only to punish you

[Chorus]
For listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song

Sing me Spanish techno

[Chorus]
Listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song

Sing me Spanish techno
