[Verse 1]
Give me a home where the past won't pay no mind
In case I'm bringing my own
Bring me a team of replacements
Just in case the place I'm taking's my own, own, own
Own, own, own

[Chorus]
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us

[Verse 2]
Tell me I'm numb, I'll be back in just a shake
To see how my babies have grown
Circle the chairs to protect us from the law
In case you needed my own, own, own
Own, own, own

[Chorus]
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us

[Interlude with non-lyrical vocals]

[Chorus]
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
