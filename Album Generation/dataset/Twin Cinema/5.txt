[Verse 1]
Let me through
Paper in fist
Jessica numbers, tell me if
We're clear
Write me a storm
Just tape the letter to the door

[Chorus]
This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

[Verse 2]
Brave under the role
Jessica numbers to the wall
Slip through
Ever the thief
It's posted [hero / here, oh] but we'll see

[Chorus]
This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

[Verse 3]
Push me through
Counting the lines
Measuring all my shadows by
Old star
Shift into red
Just take the numbers to the bed

[Bridge]
Head-tripping on
The sadness as it passes
Ask her to cross
The window frosting out
Starting to feel
The kicking here at last, yeah
Something worth keeping an eye on...

[Verse 4]
Let me through
Paper in fist
Jessica numbers, give me lift
Let's fall
Look where we land
Just write the answer on my hand

[Chorus]
This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

[Chorus]
This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

[Outro]
Jessica numbers, are we due?
Jessica numbers, are we due?
Jessica numbers, are we due?
