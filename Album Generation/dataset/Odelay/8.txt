[Verse 1]
The last survivor of a boiled crown
Another casualty with the casual frown
The janitor vandals they bark in your face
Juveniles with the piles and paste

[Chorus]
It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs

[Verse 2]
Don't be confused
When the fuse is up
And you're taking a leak
Into your brother's cup
When the cup is filled
You can run and be killed
In the billion miles
Of the muscles that build

[Chorus]
Radiation
Feeling the force
Karaoke
Vomiting morons

[Verse 3]
The scalps of zero hear the call
Rubbing in a blind man's running hall
With the canker sores and the robot pill
Throwing imbeciles on the window sills

[Chorus]
It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs
Frogs, frog
