Verse 1:
I am the man you cant define
Slowly dissolving
A ghost in a shell
A ghost in a shell
The streets when I'm in them sleep at night
Bracing themselves
Taking the strength
Deep into the veins

Chorus:
I can describe it all for you
If you got the nerve to look into my eyes
I can describe it all for you
But when I'm coming back
Ill have to face my lies


I am the man you cant define.
Slowly dissolving
A ghost in a shell
A ghost in a shell
Covered in sheets I'm haunting the streets
The streets with my name
The streets with my name

Bridge:
(x3)
I can describe it all for you
If you got the nerve to look into my eyes
I can describe it all for you
But when I'm coming back
Ill have to face my lies
