Oh, what a world, I'm lost in your arms
I can't feel free
Oh, what a world, we're not who we were
If I can't feel free

Eyes fixed on the door slipping from sight
I can't quite grasp what you're saying
The door slams in my face, I've lost control
If I feel the slightest (?)

I can't live without you
I can't live without you

Oh, what a world, I'm lost in your arms
I can't feel free
Oh, what a world, we're not who we were
If I can't feel free

Dark shades fall on you, circle around
Leaving your face divided in two
Thoughts of leaving you, you're pulling me closer
It's/Gets so past (?) this without you

I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you

Oh, what a world, I'm lost in your arms
I can't feel free
Oh, what a world, we're not who we were
If I can't feel free
