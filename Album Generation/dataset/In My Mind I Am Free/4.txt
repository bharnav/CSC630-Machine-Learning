Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I can't face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I can't find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle
Youre missing your memories
You can't remember your name
Youve changed your tune
But youve stayed the same
Throw off your dead skin
Like a chrysalis
Metamorphosis
No use resisting this
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I can't face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I can't find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle
Your mind is ephemeral
You can't remember the game
Youve peaked too soon
But youve stayed the same
Throw off your dead weight
From the precipice
Metamorphosis
No use resisting this
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I can't face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I can't find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle
