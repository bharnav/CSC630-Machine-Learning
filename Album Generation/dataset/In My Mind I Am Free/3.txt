Come and dance, come

I was all alone, going for a ride
Travelling solo, off my guard
I had to follow this calling from the wild
Into the shadows
Into the shadows of my heart

I needed all my strength to
Stand up to your agenda
I said it, I said it again
I never wanna become
Stuck in your machine
I said it, I said it again

Come and dance, come

And as I moved on, thought I'd blow my mind
But as it turned out, I was wrong
I met my sorrow, saw her in the eyes

She tried my courage
She tried my courage, but left me stronger

(You better stand up straight and you gotta be strong
You gotta fight for your right and reclaim your own song)

I needed all my strength to
Stand up to your agenda
I said it, I said it again
I never wanna become
Stuck in your machine
I said it, I said it again

Come and dance, come
