I saw a man turning somersaults
I saw a couple holding hands in the air
I heard a rumor going round the streets
What will become of us all

It's just a hand across the century
It's just a hand
It's just a hand across the open seas
It's just a hand

Somebody told me that I remember it all
Praying for the sound of a rescuers call
I heard a whisper about the next big thing
What will become of us all

It's just a hand across the century
It's just a hand
It's just a hand across the open seas
It's just a hand
