[Verse 1]
I knew it must've been some big set-up
All the action just would not let up
It's just a little bit back from the main road
Where silence spreads and the men dig holes

[Chorus]
I start to spin the tale
You complain of my diction
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)

[Verse 2]
My eyes are like telescopes
I see it all backwards, but who wants hope?
If I ever catch that ventriloquist
I'll squeeze his head right into my fist

[Chorus:]
Something come a-tracking in
What is it? What's the prediction?
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction!)
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
Hide the snake, get out a skin
(Oh, it is a fiction)

[Verse 3]
Oh, stop this head motion, set the sails
You know all us boys gonna wind up in jail

[Chorus:]
Well, I don't wanna grow up
There's too much contradiction
And too much friction (Friction!)
But I dig friction (Friction!)
You know I'm crazy 'bout fiction (Friction!)
F-R-I-C-T-I-O-N

[Outro]
(Friction!)
(Friction!)
(Friction!)
