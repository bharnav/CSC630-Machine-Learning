[Verse 1: Eric church]
Never realized how much she brought to the table
Till I went to sit my cup of coffee where the table use to be
No cats, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle
An' no more hope for one day starting' that family
Bet she's gaining' fast on Memphis with a trailer-load in tow
Who says you can't take it with you when you go

[Chorus: Eric church]
Cause she got away with everything that I had going'
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright
An' I got away with leaving' what needs said unspoken
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah, she took her heart an' took off down that road
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go

[Verse 2: Eric church]
Good news is: arenâ€™t much here left for packing'
Bad news is: she left behind a million memories
All the echoes of her crying', loving' an' laughing'
Left me with nothing' left to do but leave
That old' house is in the rear view: riding' shotgun is her ghost
Who says you can't take it with you when you go

[Chorus : Eric church]
Cause she got away with everything that I had going'
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright
An' I got away with leaving' what needs said unspoken
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah, she took her heart an' took off down that road
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Eric church]
Closing' in on Dallas, now, is the best love I've ever known
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go
