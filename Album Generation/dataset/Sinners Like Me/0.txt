[Verse 1]
I believe that gas is too damn high
Ain't nothing more American
Than Mama's apple pie
I believe in love, I believe in peace
But I don't believe we'll ever see it
In that Middle East
I believe the Bible is cold, hard fact
And I believe that Jesus is coming back
Before she does
I believe the Sabbath is a day of rest
The taxman and the Devil share the same address
I believe don't start if you're gonna quit
I believe in keep your mouth shut
And carry a big stick
I believe dogs are better than cats
And I believe that Jesus is coming back
Before she does

[Chorus]
There's absolutely, positively
No doubt in my mind
That OJ did it Lee Harvey didn't
And she's really gone this time

[Verse 2]
I believe that cold, cold beer
Tastes better on a bar stool
Than it does anywhere
I believe hard work really makes the man
But everyone should wet a line every now and then
I believe it's best to pay in cash
And I believe that Jesus is coming back
Before she does

[Chorus]
There's absolutely, positively
No doubt in my mind
That OJ did it Lee Harvey didn't
And she's really gone this time

[Bridge]
Yeah, I believe she was a real good thing
Can you believe I let a girl like her get away?
I believe she meant the night she packed
And said Jesus is coming back
Before she does

[Outro]
Before she does
Before she does
Yeah
