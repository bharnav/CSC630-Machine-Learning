[Verse 1]
I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock trying' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I arenâ€™t got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 2]
I still say: "Yes, Ma'am" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red, White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 3]
I like my country rocking'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof
Hell, I might just stay all night long
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
