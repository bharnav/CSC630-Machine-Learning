These boots have counted off many a band
Playing one night roadhouse stands
For tips in empty rooms
These boots have stood toe-to-toe
With the biggest baddest Joes
Like they had some things to prove
These boots

Yeah these boots more than once have saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
From those cops in Tupelo
And these boots have danced with the devil
And nearly lost that battle
To a Wild Irish Rose

I wore out more soles than I care to count
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damndest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you

These boots had to see California
And an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
Thought that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes

I wore out more soles than I care to count
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damndest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you

Now these boots are one step from the door
They walked out of years before
I can almost see her now
These boots ought to kick that door aside
Stomp out my foolish pride
But they just turn around
Damn these boots
Damn these boots
These boots
