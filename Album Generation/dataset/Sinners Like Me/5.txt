[Verse 1]
Only fools would race down Grist Mill Road
Let alone in angry weather
That what I tell everyone I know
Now that I know better
That's a lesson I wish I would learned
Without having' to watch my Mustang burn
Before my best buddy had to wind up hurt
An' his whole life changed

[Chorus]
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way

[Verse 2]
Only a fool would keep a diamond ring
In a box on the top of his closet
He came so close; he almost asked
It was right there in his pocket
That's a lesson I wish I would learned
Before standing in the back row of that church
Watching her daddy giving her
To the man who took my place

[Chorus]
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way

[Bridge]
Regret's been known to give a man a beating'
But I ainâ€™t in the mood for fighting' back this evening'

[Verse 3]
Only fools don't take the time of day
They stay too busy running'
An' to stop just once to tell their Dad
Just how much they love him
That's a lesson I wish I would learned
Before that phone call came an' it was her
No, Mamma never had to say a word
I knew it was too late

[Chorus]
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way

[Outro]
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
