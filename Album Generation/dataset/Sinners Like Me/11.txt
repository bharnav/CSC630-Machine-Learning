[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
I woke up early this mornin’
And I’m already runnin’ late
There's a list of things long as my arm
I won't get done today
Is it Tuesday? Is it Wednesday?
They’re runnin’ into each other
Somebody tell me, when is my day
Man, this life is sure bein’ a mother

[Hook]
So tomorrow I'm taking me fishin’
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I’ve gone missin’
And I won’t be back for a while
I’m so tired of only wishin’
I could leave my trouble behind
I wanna be front porch rockin’
With a big sun droppin’ in a blue sky
Kick back and get high
On the livin’ part of life

Yeah, c’mon

[Verse 2]
They say to keep your spot on the ladder
And keep that money rolling in
They say keepin’ up with the Thiles, boy
You can’t back off one inch
But I been puttin’ in my time
And I built up a pretty good deal
I'm gonna spend some, maybe waste some
Before my time comes and I wind up dead
Yeah

[Hook]
So tomorrow I'm taking me fishin’
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I’ve gone missin’
And I won’t be back for a while
I’m so tired of only wishin’
I could leave my trouble behind
I wanna be front porch rockin’
With a big sun droppin’ in a blue sky
Kick back and get high
On the livin’ part of life

(Yeah)

[Bridge]
When I get home tonight
I’ll open the window and let whatever roll in
And if there’s no breeze, that’s cool with me
I’ll just raise my sail, and wait on the wind, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah tomorrow I'm taking me fishin’
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I’ve gone missin’
And I won’t be back for a while
I’m so tired of only wishin’
I could leave my trouble behind
I wanna be front porch rockin’
With a big sun droppin’ in a blue sky
Kick back and get high
Kick back and get high
On the livin’, livin' a part of life

[Outro:]
Yeah, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop...
Yeah
