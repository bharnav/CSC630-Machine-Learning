[Verse]
She was pacing back and forth on her front porch
I pulled up slinging gravel in my Daddy's Ford
She cried all the way to Johnson's store
I kept the motor running and parked by the door

Yeah I was foolish and wild
She was classic and regal
We were fresh out of school, both barely legal
We were young and on fire and just couldn't wait
Six weeks in, she was three weeks late

One means none and we're home free
Two means three and a diamond ring
Yeah i wonder what fate is going to decide
We're just sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines

Yeah her Daddy's going to kill me and that’s a fact
Maybe we'll just leave town and never come back
Or I could stand there and tell him
Face him like a man
Oh who am I kidding, he'll never understand

Yeah that’s second hand just keeps slowing down
I swear it stopped twice the last time around
Yeah we'll know the truth in three minutes time
We're just sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines

Hot summer nights, whispering her name
Under the blanket by the river bank
Hearts beating fast we never thought twice
But she pulled me close and I held on tight

When the moment of truth finally comes
She gives me a look and then comes undone
She says looks like were lucky
Someone’s smiling down
She grabs her coat and says see ya around

Yeah these days the rabbit doesn't die
You just sit around waiting on two pink lines
Praying that fate is on your side
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
