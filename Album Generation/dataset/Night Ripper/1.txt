When I hit the club all the girls show me love
Buying out the bar, got drank by the jug
In the V.I.P. with the chicks and the drugs
This is T-I-P, Bun B and Slim Thug

We blowin purple stuff, we pouring purple stuff x5

We blowin purple stuff
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out!
We pouring purple stuff
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out!

Go DJ, that's my DJ (bring 'em out, bring 'em out) x4

Go DJ (knuck, buck), that's my DJ(knuck, buck) x4

Knuck if you buck x8

Lil' J on the track, nigga

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
