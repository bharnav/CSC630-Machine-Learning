[Verse 1]
Oh River!
Beat the bright out of me
I've discovered the silhouette of the face of me
Everybody wants a taste of the light
But me!

[Verse 2]
Mr. Crowley
I've found a sister for me
In the jungle in the trunk of a mango tree
Kissed a finger just to savor the bite

[Verse 3]
You've suffered the best for last
Furious and too fast
You've suffered the best for last
