[Verse 1]
All day everyday breeding like a curse
You're still wrecking all our averages making us look worse
Burst!
Brandishing your cavendish, yellow over white
Throwing feces at the rhesus making babies every night
Burst!

[Verse 2]
Burst! in the park burst in the zoo
Furimuitara camera ni dashiteru
Burst! in the plane burst into flames
Dokodemo dashitemo iinoda, geemu da
Dokodemo dashitemo Burst
