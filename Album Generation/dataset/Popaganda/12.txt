Answer me
Body, why do you ache me?
To keep ambition alive?
Relentlessly, it's you forsaking me
But you'll never eat me alive

You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me

Breathlessly, I ran from a seething sheik
Two rats at odds for the prize
Believe you me, the cancer of which you speak
Will never eat me alive

You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me

It's a thousand to one
It's two hands on one gun
Socialize, dollar prize
Yelling onward
Telling lies
Then you've got a thousand to one

You've seen a thousand to one
Well I've seen a fuck fest in the sun
Cause it's American surprise
Side of Islam
Side of lies
And you've got a thousand to one right here

You'll never reach me alive
You'll never eat me alive

You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me
You're never gonna see anything like me

It's been a crazy winter
It's gonna be a crazy summer
It's been a crazy winter
It's gonna be a crazy summer
