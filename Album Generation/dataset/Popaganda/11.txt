She told me all the things she knew
You give her one, she'd reach for two
The Cold War on the sofa is getting closer
And she's the hardest thing to do
When the mantis in her preys on you
An appetite fit for the king and his love

I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl, you've been eating me alive
I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl

So lately I've been meaning to say a few things to you
She gets all the good attention
And I get honored with the mention
And she's the hardest thing to do
When the mantis in her preys on you
An appetite fit for the kid you love

I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl, you've been eating me alive
I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl

That's what hearts are for
You give her one, she breaks more
It's the changing of the guard
And I'm the last one to know when
It's all just for show
And I'm trying to be so hard

I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl, you've been eating me alive
I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl, you've been eating me alive

I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl, you've been eating me alive
I don't want to bore you, but here I go again
Cannibal girl
