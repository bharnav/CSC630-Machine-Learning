[Verse 1- Daryl Palumbo]
Smudged funnies in a broken bottle
On the dot at nine
So Daddy throws clothes, throws on an old stove
I'm crying in the corner at five
Well I've seen black
And I've seen blue
But fine lines I don't see
And just because I am in misery
Don't it mean a thing

That I wanna know
That I wanna know

[Chorus- Daryl Palumbo and Gerard Way]
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you

[Verse 2- Daryl Palumbo]
September, as far as she remembers
They don't teach humility
And just because her only signal is mayday
Don't it mean a thing
That she's seen love
And she's seen war
But fairness she don't see
And just because she is in misery
Don't it mean a thing

That she wants to know
That she wants to know

[Chorus- Daryl Palumbo and Gerard Way]
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said to...

[Bridge- Daryl Palumbo and Gerard Way]
The camaraderie's old
Doing what I'm told
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand
Everybody is dying for
The chance to be heard, not ignored
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand

[Chorus- Daryl Palumbo and Gerard Way]
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said to...

[Outro: Daryl Palumbo and (Gerard Way)]
(Graduation Day)
I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna
I ain't goin' to school
(Graduation Day)
I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna
I'm not goin' to school
