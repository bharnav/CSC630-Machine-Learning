You came and went
Too much time was spent
In the throes of a runaway holiday
But you came before me
Now you can't afford me

Oh, I can't believe I'm responsible
If you even care, let me know
I loved you so
But I was too proud to go
And now you're asking me
Asking me

Who made the million dollar decision?
I made it deep inside my heart

If you see a man with his head in his hands
That's the portrait of a runaway
There before you making your demands
You came before me
Now you can't afford me

Oh, I can't believe I'm responsible
If you even care, let me know
I loved you so
But I was too proud to go
Now you're asking me
Asking me

Who made the million dollar decision?
I made it deep inside my heart
Who made the million dollar decision?
I pay for it when we're apart

You're falling to your death
For giving what you get
You took the fall
You're falling to your death
And now you're asking me
You're asking me

You're falling to your death
For giving what you get
You took the fall
You're falling to your death
And now you're asking me
Asking me

Who made the million dollar decision?
I made it deep inside my heart
You tried to get the best of me
And killed the man who's next to me
I pay for it when we're apart
I made it deep inside my heart
I made it deep inside my heart
