I needed just a hit, one hit
It's a very little hit, I'm sure I won't like it
I needed to be heard, one hit would send me flying

I got away with murder last night in the parking lot
In cold blood, I have murdered parts of us that we forgot

I walked into a kiss, one kiss
From the very lovely miss who lives to fulfill my wish
I needed to be hurt, one kiss would send me flying

I got away with murder last night in the parking lot
In cold blood, I have murdered parts of us that we forgot

I will be going nowhere
I will be going nowhere
I will be going nowhere, nowhere fast

I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going nowhere, nowhere fast

I had to write a hit, one hit
It's a very little hit, I'm sure you won't like it
I needed to be rehearse, one hit will send me flying

I got away with murder last night in the parking lot
In cold blood, I have murdered parts of us that we forgot
And in the end I grant you a farewell and final kiss
I got away with murder, who's the next to make the list

I will be going nowhere
I will be going nowhere
I will be going nowhere, nowhere fast

I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going no
I will be going nowhere, nowhere fast
