Everybody knows you're a liar
Why don't I?
I just heard about
Your lovin' on the side
You're tellin' tall tales girl
Spinning webs too big to climb
Everybody knows you're a liar
Why don't I?

I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a fraud

You're, you're, you're
Lying through your teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem
You're lying through your t-t-t-teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem

Girl, your love's so cheap
We've been passing you around
There's cheating on your lips
And you've been the talk of my town
Fix your mask, girl
It's crooked on the sides
And everybody knows you're a liar
Why don't I?

I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a fraud

You're, you're, you're
Lying through your teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem
You're lying through your t-t-t-teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem

Everybody knows you are a liar
Why don't I?
I just heard about
Your lovin' on the side
Fix your mask girl
It's crooked in the side
Everybody knows you're a liar
Why don't I?

I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a...
I always knew you were a fraud

You're, you're, you're
Lying through your teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem
You're lying through your teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem
You're lying through your teeth
You're not at all
Not at all what you seem
You're lying through your t-t-t-teeth
