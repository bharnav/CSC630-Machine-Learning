Welcoming you to Cardboard City
Where I think they're laughing at your band
Did you have a clue
That it was pretty on the gritty bottom of a van?

I'm feeling sorry for your band
Like really sorry 'bout your band, oh

You don't gotta a clue
They're laughing at you
Laughing, yes it's true
You don't even see
They're laughing at you
Laughing at you to me

Your following is fleeting
Watch what you're reading
You might start believing what they're saying about
You and who you know
I'm talking shameless
In the thick of it
You can't get rid of it

Desperation is calling you
Desperation is calling you

You don't gotta a clue
They're laughing at you
Laughing, yes it's true
You don't even see
They're laughing at you
Laughing at you to me

You don't gotta a clue
They're laughing at you
At everything you do
You don't even see
They're laughing at you
Laughing at you to me

There are some things you gotta know
They will surround you when you fall
And they will steal your Heaven's toll, oh

You don't gotta a clue
They're laughing at you
Laughing yes it's true
You don't even see they're laughing at you
Laughing at you to me

You don't gotta a clue
They're laughing at you
At everything you do
You don't even see they're laughing at you
Laughing at you to me

I'm feeling sorry for you band
Like really sorry 'bout your band
I'm feeling sorry for your band
Like really sorry 'bout your band
