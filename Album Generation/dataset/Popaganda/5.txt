Speaking of heaven, she looked like a god on Earth
It was something I could not understand, or explain
I mean you
Don't know
The things I do for you while you are out cold
The things I do for you will lead to my breakdown

But I'm still curious, I'm curious
I'm still curious, yeah

My baby kisses like a heart attack
Running like that
Squeezing till my face turns black
She pulled me under, she pulled me under

Girl, I mean you
Gotta know
The things I do for you while you are out cold
The things I do for you will lead to my breakdown

And I'm still curious, I'm curious
I'm still curious, yeah

Breakdown, breakdown
My breakdown, breakdown, yeah

Curious, I'm curious
I'm still curious, yeah
'Cause I'm still curious
I'm curious, I'm still curious
