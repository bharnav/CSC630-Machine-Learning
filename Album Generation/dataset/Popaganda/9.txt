She's not it
She's really not it
She ain't it
She's really not it

You know I'm glad that she's not alive
She quit her job when she was 45
This kind of drama hits me everyday
She had a job, I got a salary

But you know me
I will do what I gotta do, in spite of you
By then you will be patiently dreaming of me in spite of you
Miserably

She's not it
She's really not it
She ain't it
She's really not it

I got a couple things I really need to say
One of them is funny and the other is pass√©
"Walk the plank!"
She had me swimming in the holding tank

Yeah, but you know me
I will do what I gotta do in spite of you
By then you will be patiently dreaming of me in spite of you
In misery

She's not it
She's really not it
She ain't it
She's really not it

'Cause I'm leaving
I'm leaving
And I just can't help these feelings
I'm still breathing
No more deceiving
And I just can't help these feelings

She's not it (No, she's not it)
She's really not it (No, she's not it)
She ain't it (No, she's not it)
She's really not it (No, she's not it)

She's not it (No, she's not it)
She's really not it (No, she's not it)
She ain't it (No, she's not it)
She's really not it (No, she's not it)
