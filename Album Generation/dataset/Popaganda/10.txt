There's a suicidal Taliban on the cusp
Egyptian musk, Egyptian musk
When the village came with fire, you were hiding on the right
We knew you might, the blood of Christ
I tell you lies, I have found
I've seen a million religions on the ground
There's a suicidal Taliban for talent on the cusp
Egyptian musk, Egyptian musk

Is that your love down on the ground?
I see forever coming down
Look around, look around
It makes everything okay

So celebrate the ignorance
And drizzle it in violence
And pledge a sore allegiance with every auto and appliance
Because they win if we don't go about life like we should
I knew you would, I knew you would
I tell you lies, I have found
I've seen a million religions on the ground
There's a suicidal Taliban with talent on the cusp
Egyptian musk, Egyptian musk

Is that your love down on the ground?
I see forever coming down
Look around, look around
It makes everything okay

Is that your love down on the ground?
I see forever coming down
Look around, look around
It makes everything okay

Where does your high school stand?

Lies, I've seen a few
I've seen a million, in a nation, in a feud
So if happiness is knowing, then knowledge I have not
We knew you'd pop, your head went pop

Is that your love down on the ground?
I see forever coming down
Look around, look around
It makes everything okay

Is that your love down on the ground?
I see forever coming down
Look around, look around
It makes everything okay
