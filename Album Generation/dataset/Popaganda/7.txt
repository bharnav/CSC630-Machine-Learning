Now, I am just creative
Or was I meant to be
A killer
Killing lovers in the street?
Sometimes the most unlikely
Prove themselves to be a liar
Everything you said to me

I'm glad I'm alive and there's no way I'm touching ground again

I saw a blind man shackled
Up by his hands and feet
Escaping when his face hit the concrete
And the same way you play vicious
Well, that's the same way you agree
Endearing an endearing empathy

I'm glad I'm alive and there's no way I'm touching ground again
I'm glad I'm alive and there's no way I'm touching ground again

I've been shot in the back by my fears
Shot in the back by my fears
Shot in the back by my fears
I've been shot in the back by my fears

I'm telling you, I'm glad I'm alive and there's no way I'm touching ground again
I'm telling you, I'm glad I'm alive and there's no way I'm touching ground again
