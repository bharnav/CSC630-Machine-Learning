You ain't loved me right for a while
For your hand and word I'd crawl a mile

For all that I know
For all that I know
For all that I know
You're still scandalous

You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
I just can't handle it

You ain't loved me right for a while

For all that I know
For all that I know
For all that I know
You're still scandalous

You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
I just can't handle it

You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
I just can't handle it

Grin and bear it
I will wear it
My crown of thorns
They better be pointed
They gotta be pointed
No mercy
No mercy
My crown of thorns
I gotta be hated
I gotta be hated

You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
I just can't handle it

You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
You're so scandalous
I just can't handle it
