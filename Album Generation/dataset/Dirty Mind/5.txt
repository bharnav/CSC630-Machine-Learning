[Verse 1: Prince and Lisa Coleman]
I remember when I met you, baby
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked the things you said
I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
"But I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk
So full of spunk"

[Chorus: Prince]
I'll give you head till you're burning up
Head till you get enough
Head till your love is red
Head, love you till you're dead

[Verse 2: Prince and Lisa Coleman]
You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But uh, I came on your wedding gown
And you said:
"I must confess
I wanna get undressed and go to bed"
With that I jammed, you fool
You married me instead

[Chorus: Prince]
Now morning, noon, and night
I give you head till you're burning up
Head till you get enough
Head till your love is red
Head, love you till you're dead

[Bridge: Prince]
Head
Head
Head
Head
Whoa!

[Synthesizer Solo]

[Chorus: Prince]
Head till you're burning up
Head till you get enough
Head till your love is red
Head, love you till you're dead

[Outro]
Head
Head
Head
