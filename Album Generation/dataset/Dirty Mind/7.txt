[Verse 1]
We don't give a damn
We just want to jam
Party up
That army bag
Such a double drag
Party up
Party, got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Going uptown, baby
How you going to make me kill somebody
I don't even know?
They got the draft, uh uh
I just laugh
Party up
Fighting war
Is such a fucking bore
Party up
Party, uh uh, got to party down, babe
Ooh, it's all about what's in your mind
Going uptown, baby
I don't want to die
I just want to have a bloody good time

[Chorus]
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up

[Verse 2]
Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream, no cake
All lies, no truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?

[Chorus]
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up

[Bridge]
Revolutionary rock and roll

[Chorus]
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up
Party up
Got to party up

[Outro]
You're going to have to fight your own damn war
Because we don't want to fight no more
You're going to have to fight your own damn war
Because we don't want to fight no more
You're going to have to fight your own damn war
Because we don't want to fight no more
You're going to have to fight your own damn war
Because we don't want to fight no more
