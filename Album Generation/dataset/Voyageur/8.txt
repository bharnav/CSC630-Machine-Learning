Get out a map, carve out a path
Highlight it in fluorescent yellow
From the mountain pass to the prairie grass
Anywhere you'll go I'll follow

And if we don't speak after you leave
I'll look to the sky for smoke signals
If I fall behind, could you leave me a sign
Breadcrumbs in the shape of an arrow

See I'm going to hell
In a basket I made
Woven from the letters
And it spells your name

When the weather breaks we can sail the great lakes
I'll make a white flag from your pillow
Plug the holes of your leaky boat
Use your t-shirt for material

See I'm going to hell
In a basket I made
Woven from the letters
And it spells your name

I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell

I will let go when your leaky boat reaches the shore
I will let you know when the map says you're [?] anymore

See I'm going to hell
In a basket I made
Woven from the letters
And it spells your name

I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell

I will see you there
I will see you there
I will see you there
