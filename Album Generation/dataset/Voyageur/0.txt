[Verse 1 - Kathleen Edwards]
The hottest days of the summer
They brought us here together
You know it's true
But this cold it's getting warmer
Maybe come September I will feel brand new

[Hook - Kathleen Edwards]
I'm moving to America
It's an empty threat

[Verse 2 - Kathleen Edwards]
In the city I once said "never"
I'm learning to say "never never never ever"
Cause now I'm its favourite flower
I'm blooming through the concrete cracks of this condo tower

[Hook - Kathleen Edwards]
I'm moving to America
It's an empty threat

[Verse 3 - Kathleen Edwards]
Over the course of hours
By bright lit thundershowers
I hit that head until it bled
I press reset, goddammit

[Hook - Kathleen Edwards]
I'm moving to America
It's an empty threat

[Outro - Kathleen Edwards]
The hottest days of the summer
They brought us here together
You know it's true
