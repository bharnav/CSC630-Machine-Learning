Wake up! Wake up! I want to take you
To all the places I thought we could

I was feeling so lost for so long
I was feeling so lost for so long
I didn't know what to do

Sit up! Sit up! Sit up! I went and made you
Breakfast in bed, coffee and juice

I was feeling so lost for so long
You were feeling so lost for so long
We didn't know what to do

You and I will be sidecars
There to chase down the hard stuff
There to chase down the hard stuff

Wait up! Wait up! You let me show you
All of the monsters I was holding on to

So get up! Get up! Get up it's gonna be good
Cause you all know what nothing nothing no one owes you

You were feeling so lost for so long
I was feeling so lost for so long
You were feeling so lost for so long
We didn't know what to do

You and I will be sidecars
There to chase down the hard stuff with you
There to chase down
You and I will be sidecars
There to chase down the hard stuff with you
There to chase down the hard stuff
