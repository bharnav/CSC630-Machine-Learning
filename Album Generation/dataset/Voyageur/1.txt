I know your heart
It is a sacred thing
You're a comedian
You hide behind your funny face

Every time

Out of the shadows
Out of the cameras and the lights
You're a chameleon
And you hide behind your darker side

Every time
Every time I don't need a punch line
I don't need a punch line

Everybody's watching
The way that I see you could not change
I'll be your medium
For everything you wanted to say

Cause out of the shadows
Out of the cameras and the lights
I'm a chameleon
I just hide behind the songs that I write

See me smile
It's not for a funny joke
It's for every time I don't need
I don't need a punch line
Every time I don't need a punch line

See me smile
It's not for a funny joke
It's for every time I don't need a punch line
