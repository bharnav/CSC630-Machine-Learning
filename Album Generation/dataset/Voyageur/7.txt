Top it up, a white carnation
I borrow my mother's clutch
Thinking the grass could be greener, at last
Now that I'm all grown up
But expectation and idle'll be the death of me
In a dress to kill and a glass to fill
I wasn't ready but I didn't fight

Pink champagne tastes the same
I don't want to feel this way

Looking back, it was such a dumb idea
Five girls in the same-colored dress
Book a honeymoon and find yourself thinking
My life is a perfect mess
Cause when you're far from the [?]
I start feeling at home where I am
Thinking the grass would be greener, at last
If I were on my own

Pink champagne tastes the same
I don't want to feel this
I don't want to feel this way

Everybody's saying, if I were you
Cause now you're such a good judge
When it comes to love
And everybody's thinking they know me and you
Oh, I can be cruel
So can you

Pink champagne tastes the same...
And I don't want to feel this
I don't want to feel this
I don't want to feel this way

Pink champagne tastes the same...
I don't want to feel this
I don't want to feel this
I don't want to feel this way
