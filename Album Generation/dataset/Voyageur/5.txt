The taste of mint, you were a field of it
Why I couldn't say no, to the taste of it

God knows I want to, aah
God knows I need to, aah
God doesn't know you like I do

You're the taste of mint, under a midnight flirt
And why I couldn't just go, and try to sleep on it

God knows I want to, aah
God knows I need to, aah
God doesn't know you like I do

And I do, sha la la la la la la la
I do, sha la la la la la la la la

And it's like, pure heaven sent
Nothing could, could have replaced
Lord knows I tried, to be true

God knows I want to, aah
God doesn't know you like I do

And I do, sha la la la la la la la
I do, sha la la la la la la la la
[x2]

Sha la la la la la la la la...
