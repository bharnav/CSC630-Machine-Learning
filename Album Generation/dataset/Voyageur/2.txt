Calling it quits
You think this is easy
I swear I heard you calling the jury
Call it a catch
Without any strings attached

Well I'm looking for a soft place to land
The forest floor
The palms of your hands
I'm looking for a soft place to land
I call it an ace
You've gotta believe me
But you're calling me names not to my face
But you're calling my spade a bluff
Calling it love

Call me in the night
I don't mind, I don't care, I can't sleep
Call me in the day, in my car, on my way
Call me by name, all I want is to hear you say

Well I'm looking for a soft place to land
The forest floor
The palms of your hands
I'm looking for a soft place to land
The forest floor
The palms of your hands, palms of your hands
