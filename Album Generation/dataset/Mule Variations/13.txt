[Verse 1]
Well I hung on to Mary's stump
I danced with a soldier's glee
With a rum soaked crook
And a big fat laugh
I spent my last dollar on thee
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell
Kehoe spiked the 'nog
With a chain link fence
And a scrap iron jaw

[Chorus]
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

[Verse 2]
Spider rolled in from
Hollister Burn
With a one-eyed stolen Mare
Donned himself with chicken fat
Sawin' on a jaw bone violin there
Kathleen was sittin down
In little Red's Recovery Room
In her criminal underwear bra
I was naked to the waist
With my fierce black hound

[Chorus]
And I'm cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

[Verse 3]
Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road
Fill it with madrone and bay
Stinks like hell
And the neighbors complain
Don't give a hoot what they say
Gotta slap that hog
Roll 'im over twice
Gotta baste him with a sweeping broom
You gotta swat them flies
And chain up the dogs

[Chorus]
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

[Verse 4]
Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig
T'ain't the mince meat filagree
And it ain't the turkey neck stew
And it ain't them bruleed okra seeds
Though she made them especially for you
Worse won a prize for her bottom black pie
The beans got to thrown to the dogs
Jahesus Christ, I can always make room

[Chorus]
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin' up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
