What's he building in there?
What the hell is he building
In there?
He has subscriptions to those
Magazines He never
Waves when he goes by
He's hiding something from
The rest of us He's all
To himself I think I know why
He took down the
Tire swing from the Peppertree
He has no children of his
Own you see He has no dog
And he has no friends and
His lawn is dying and
What about all those packages
He sends. What's he building in there?
With that hook light
On the stairs. What's he building
In there I'll tell you one thing
He's not building a playhouse for
The children what's he building
In there?

Now what's that sound
From under the door?
He's pounding nails into a
Hardwood floor and I
Swear to god I heard someone
Moaning low and I keep
Seeing the blue light of a
T.V. show
He has a router
And a table saw and you
Won't believe what Mr. Sticha saw
There's poison underneath the sink
Of course But there's also
Enough formaldehyde to choke
A horse What's he building
In there. What the hell is he
Building in there? I heard he
Has an ex-wife in some place
Called Mayors Income, Tennessee
And he used to have a
Consulting business in Indonesia
But what is he building in there?
What the hell is he building in there?

He has no friends
But he gets a lot of mail
I'll bet he spent a little
Time in jail
I heard he was up on the
Roof last night
Signaling with a flashlight
And what's that tune he's
Always whistling
What's he building in there?
What's he building in there?

We have a right to know
