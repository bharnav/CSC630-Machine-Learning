I've seen it all boys
I've been all over
Been everywhere in the
Whole wide world
I rode the high line
With old blind Darby
I danced real slow
With Ida Jane
I was full of wonder
When I left Murfreesboro
Now I am full of hollow
On Maxwell street
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home

I walked from Natchez
To Hushpukena
I built a fire by the side
Of the road
I worked for nothin in a
Belzoni saw mill. I caught a
Blind out on the B and O
Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so
A 44'll get you 99

And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home

I run my race with burnt face Jake
Gave him a Manzanita cross
I lived on nothin
But dreams and train smoke
Somehow my watch and chain got lost
I wish I was home in Evelyn's Kitchen
With old Gyp curled around my feet

And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home
