There were islands where we spent the days
There were hunting hounds by the palace grounds, believe me
She had circles like Romany Marie
She would start the day with the Novocaine, believe me

By the end of the day
There were coming shocks from the palace clocks, believe me
There was nothing we could do or say
We were holding hands in the garbage cans, believe me

You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase
While the innkeep follows us the road gives in to haze
And the smell of water comes
You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase

La la la la, la la la la

Youâ€™ll never win the game
When you wander off keep your ballots soft, believe me
Believe me

La la la la, la la la la

You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase

La la la la, la la la la

You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase
