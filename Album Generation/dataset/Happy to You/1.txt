The first strike of the hammer
Make my heart beat faster
The rat-tat to remind me
That there was something behind me

[Hook]
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be sane
We'll all be staring at the wave

Buried at the wave
They told me I wasn't anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a thief of the master
I was a walking disaster

I know you hear them come
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel it coming
Don't let me get you down

[Hook]
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be sane
We'll all be staring at the wave

Buried at the wave
They told me I wasn't anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a thief of the master
I was a walking disaster

I know you hear them come
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel it coming
Don't let me get you down

I know you hear it coming...
