[Verse 1]
The Blinds Here Are So Sharp And They Cut
The Light From The Primitive Sun
You Know I Really Wanted Her
Society Thinks So Highly Of
This Hotel I Vomited On
Before I Lost The Sight Of Her

[Pre-Hook]
My Man, He Quietly Closes The Door
Now The Pharaoh Is Woken
My Hands, I Feel Like I've Been Here Before
She Has Already Spoken

[Hook]
Anyway
There's No Reason To Get Hurt
You Don't Need To Sell Your Shirt
To Do The Devil's Work

[Bridge]
You Finally Found Your Place
You Know It Always Works
You Know It Always Works

[Verse 2]
I Saw Someone Who Looked Like You On
The Platform At Bondi Station
But From A Younger Era
The Lights In The Bellhouse Were Still On
We All Need Somebody To Love
Be We Clothed Or Naked

[Pre-Hook]
My Man, He Quietly Closes The Door
Now The Pharaoh Is Woken
My Hands, I Feel Like I've Been Here Before
She Has Already Spoken

[Hook]
Anyway
There's No Reason To Get Hurt
You Don't Need To Sell Your Shirt
To Do The Devil's Work

[Bridge]
You Finally Found Your Place
You Know It Always Works
You Know It Always Works

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
You Finally Found Your Place
