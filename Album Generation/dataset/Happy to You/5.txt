Can we still find it
Is there a way in
It’s gone so long now
With our faces at the wind
Would you come over
Forgive my hard ways
And stay up all night
Like the chinatown parades
Say you will
I won’t climb out through the other door
If I ask you to say you will
I can’t be trusted
To wait on hard times
I’d rather run out
And be caught behind the lines
Open corridors light up the paintings
Aww come on over
And keep away the shakes
Say you will
I won’t climb out through the other door
If I ask you to say you will
They gave us their machines
They tried but they won't save us
The locked-up luxuries
You’ll find that you don’t need them at all
If you say that you will
