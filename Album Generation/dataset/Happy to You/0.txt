To us the world is everything
It’s dangerous to be on your own
To dream of home
I watch it and I can’t help but play favourites:
A hand-changing card, a face, a heart

I don’t remember how I got down
I only know there’s been some kind of harm done
I don’t remember how I got down
I only know there’s been some kind of harm done
