Her beauty is blinding but she means nothing wrong
She's looking for love just like I am
Amazing in the sunlight, a gift for a man
She's looking for love just like I am

Just like I am, like I am
Just like I am, I am
Hey, hey
All the best intentions are no match for your skin
Hey, hey
Well how am I supposed to love you if I don't even know you?

She walks in the shadow of a beauty so bright
But she's looking for love just like I am
An obvious blessing but a curse in disguise when you're looking for love

Just like I am, like I am
Just like I am, I am
Hey, hey
All my best intentions are no match for your skin
Hey, hey
You know I thought I knew what love was, but sometimes I get confused
Sometimes I get confused yeah, sometimes I get confused yeah

Hey, hey
All my best intentions are no match for your skin
Hey hey
And how am I supposed to know you if I can't even love you?

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
