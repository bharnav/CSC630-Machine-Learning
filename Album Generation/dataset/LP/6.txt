It's not my desire; it's not my choice
It's not intentional; I'm hypnotised by your voice
The same old thing, but always new
It's unbelievable how strongly I feel for...toward you

It's more like magnetism than anything else
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will
It was not my decision, if you couldn't tell
It's more like magnetism; I can't even control myself

Cannot keep away; I feel the tension grow
It's getting stronger now, it's getting stronger now
It's getting stronger now, you're all I see
You have so much power over me

It's more like magnetism than anything else
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will
It was not my decision, if you couldn't tell
It's more like magnetism; I can't even control myself

It's more like magnetism between you and me
I can't fight; I'm pulled against my will
My appetite to coincide with you grows stronger every night
And I can't fight magnetism, you know I can't even control myself, oh, myself
