I don't why I do what I
I don't why I do what I do
It feels so good to me
I guess that's why I do what I
I guess that's why I do what I do
'Cause it feels good to me and it's right there for the taking

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's true
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?"
The tin man's got nothing on me
Heart, I hope you wake up soon

I don't know why I feel like I should change
I don't know why what I need and what I want can't be the same thing, oh
I don't know why I don't miss my friends
I don't know why I cannot comprehend how special love can be
And it's right there for the taking

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's good
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?"
The tin man's got nothing on me
Heart, I hope you wake up soon
The tin man's got nothing on me

With a hammer and a nail a man left to die
With a hammer and a nail I eat this coconut, yeah it's good
I'm looking at the sunset wondering, "So what?"
The tin man's got nothing on me
Heart, I hope you wake up soon, please
