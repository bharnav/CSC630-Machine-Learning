Please don't do what I say
Cause if you don't love me, it's worthless anyway
Please don't trouble yourself
You'll only go away in the end

Please don't follow all my commands
Cause what's the point in that
I keep hoping that all of your plans
Will fall through the roof

Chorus:
Like two ships passing in the night were gone
Only the moon and the stars in the sky did know
To cry for me
As I sailed on

Please don't trouble yourself
I only want your love
You keep giving me your help
Oh please stop playing along
You know you're wasting your energy
And you're breaking my heart

(Chorus)
Oh I can just see it now (I can see it now)
You're recklessly in love
Your heart's boiling over
Oh I can just see it now
You're coming around

(Chorus)
