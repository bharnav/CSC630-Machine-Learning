I can't move on, Afraid to Lose
I'm Breathing but I'm dead
Yeah, there is a difference between leaving
And leaving in your head
Don't let life pass you by

If you're feeling all alone, then
Just look in the mirror at yourself
And you'll remember all the reasons why
You're sharing your life with no one else

There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
But you'll feel better on the other side...
On the other side

You'll never know what's on the inside
If you never open up the box
And why do you expect the box to open up
If you won't even knock?

If you're feeling all alone, then
Just look in the mirror at yourself
And you'll remember all the reasons why
You're sharing your life with no one else

There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
But you'll feel better on the other side
On the other side

There, there
I don't want to make you cry
There, there
There, there

(You got a long ways to go)
But on the other side
(You're gonna find what you're looking for)
On the other side
(You don't have to hide the tears in your eyes)
'Cause on the other side
(They're gonna turn into something more)
On the other side
(You're gonna toss and turn)
On the other side
(You're gonna find what you're looking for)
On the other side
(You don't have to hide the tears in your eyes)
'Cause on the other side
(They're gonna turn into something more)
On the other side
