You're wonderful
You're good at everything you do
Everyone is equal, but not as equal as you
You're the best
You're the best
And every town's got one like you

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things
And expose yourself to the pleasures and pain of this life
You can let down your guard to the night

Paranoid perfectionist people they can only put their very, very best foot forward
And as a result they're rather easy to detect
They'll be the only ones hopping down the streets of New York
And every town's got one like you

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things
And expose yourself to the pleasures and pain
If you're walking on the line, you'll never know what's on either side
You might be wrong or might be right
You can't pass this up, you gotta give it a try

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things
And expose yourself to the pleasures and pain of this life
You can let down your guard...

Just take trip far away where no one really cares about those things
And expose yourself to the pleasures and pain
If you're walking on the line, you'll never know what's on either side
You might be wrong or might be right
You can't pass this up, you gotta give it a try
