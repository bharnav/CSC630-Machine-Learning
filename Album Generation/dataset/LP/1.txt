I write a million songs about the weather
But when it comes to you
I pick up all the pieces of the chords I didn't use

I pick them up and glue them back together
I sure hope this will do
Here's piece of trash I cleaned and polished just for you

Cause it's the last stop of the night
I sure hope this will do
Yeah, I sure hope it will do
It's the last kiss of the night
I sure hope it'll do
Cause after this I'm through

This distance is the best thing that could happen
When it comes to us
I was getting tired of pretending it was love

One girl's trash is some other boy's treasure
When it comes to skin
Against a tiny shirt, you know the boys don't often win

Cause it's the last stop of the night
I sure hope this will do
Yeah, I sure hope it will do
It's the last kiss of the night
I sure hope it'll do
Cause after this I'm through

With you

Can't you see I'm killing you
Can't you see I'm dead
Goodbye love, goodnight hate, just let me go to bed

It's the last stop of the night
I sure hope this will do
Yeah, I sure hope it will do
It's the last pointless kiss of my life
I sure hope it'll do
Cause after this I'm through

With you...with you...

I'm through
