They say your life is like a yellow brick road-
That's nice, mine's like a maze
Is there some secret handshake that I do not know?
'Cause I stop and ask for help and people tell me different ways

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong to me
Well it's like a game, they're winning best of three

'Cause trickery's always triggering sirens in my head
In my head
And trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head
Cloud my head

I'm like a homeless man caught in a storm
With no point to run for cover
As I stand motionless under the gray
This H2O invisible army infiltrates my brain

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong to me
Well they're coming fast, they're only pickin' up speed

'Cause trickery's always triggering sirens in my head
In my head
And trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head
Cloud my head

I wish I could discern the things I cannot see
Or am I too concerned with finding clarity?
All these questions are killing me
And everyone tells me different things

Sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong
They're coming fast, they'll be here before too long

Trickery's always triggering sirens in my head
In my head
Yeah, trickery's trying to cover my eyes and cloud my head
Cloud my head

Trickery's always triggering sirens, and
Trickery's trying to cover my eyes, yeah
Trickery's always messin' with my head
