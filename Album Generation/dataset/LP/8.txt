It's not that you lost a friend
I just need some time to lick my wounds
I'll be out of service for a little while
I'm sure I'll be up and running soon

He's just an amateur these days
Not used to dealing with this pain
He's just an amateur these days
Never thought that he'd see it go away

And our history will never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never ever fade
So I love, and so I hate

What we were I never knew, nor did you
And that's exactly what you hated
For three years you were confused
And for three years, my intentions left unstated

And our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never ever fade
So I love and so I hate

So this is the end
Of an innocent era, an innocent era
I didn't want you but I did
It's never wrong
But then it is

And our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never fade away
You were a great companion

And our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never ever ever fade
