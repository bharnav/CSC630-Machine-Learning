[Verse 1]
A heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling Inside, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I've never heard, too hard to say

[Refrain 1]
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo

[Verse 2]
Each way I turn I know I'll always try
To break this circle that's been placed around me
From time to time I find I've lost some need
It was urgent to myself, I do believe

[Refrain 1]
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo

[Refrain 2]
Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes, oh, you've got grey eyes
Oo, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes, you've got grey eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

[Refrain 3]
Bolts from above
Hurt the people down below
People in this world
We have no place to go

Bolts from above
Hurt the people down below
People in this world
We have no place to go

[Refrain 1]
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
[Refrain 3]
Bolts from above
Hurt the people down below
People in this world
We have no place to go

Bolts from above
Hurt the people down below
People in this world
We have no place to go
[Outro]
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before
Oh, no, I've never met anyone quite like you before
