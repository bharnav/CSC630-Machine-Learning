[Verse 1]
This is why events unnerve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom for wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she ask's the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
Word will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time

[Verse 2]
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time

[Verse 3]
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever
