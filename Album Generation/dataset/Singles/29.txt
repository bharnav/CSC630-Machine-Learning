[Verse 1]
Hey, you, what is the matter?
Tell me the truth, I won’t laugh at you
Where these words grew?
Were they unkind?
That guy’s a fool, he’s crossed the line

[Chorus]
I’ll stay with you
Till hell freezes over
We’re at to each other
Like sister and brother
You’re one of a kind
High on my agenda
Oh, I’ll change your mind
When will you surrender?

[Verse 2]
We never left in
Your world felt unharmed
It cut like a blade
Right through your heart
And where your friends
Just when you needed them?
They were not there
Why did you believe in them?

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
