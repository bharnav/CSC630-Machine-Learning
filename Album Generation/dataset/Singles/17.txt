[Intro]
Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch
Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch
They think it's all over... well, it is now!

[Verse 1]
Express yourself, create the space
You know you can win, don't give up the chase
Beat the man, take him on
You never give up, it's one on one

[Pre-Chorus]
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good it's never gone

[Chorus]
Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

[Verse 2]
Now is the time, let everyone see
You never give up that's how it should be
Don't get caught make your own play
Express yourself don't give it away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good it's never gone

[Chorus]
Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true
Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

[Interlude: More Commentary from 1966 World Cup match]
We want goals
A beauty scored by Bobby Charlton
We want goals

[Verse 3: John Barnes]
You've got to hold and give but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them, get round the back
Catch me if you can, cause I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans, this ain't a football song
Three lions on my chest, I know we can't go wrong

[Outro]
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
They think it's all over... well, it is now!
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
