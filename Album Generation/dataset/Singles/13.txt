[Verse 1]
I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face
I couldn't look at you
I guess you knew it
But I never realized that we were through
And I'm now down here all alone with every feeling that I own
You can't take that away
And with every breath we take
And the illusions we create will come to you someday

[Hook]
And I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

[Verse 2]
I never hoped to do the things in this world I wanted to
Because everything I own, it belongs to you
I've never looked at you in a sexual way in my life before
And I've never woken up like this so desperately before

[Hook]
And I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
Touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched (touched)
I was touched (touched)
