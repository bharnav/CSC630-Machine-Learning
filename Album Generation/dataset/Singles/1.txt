There is no end to this
I have seen your face
But I don't recognize all these things
You must have left behind

It's a problem, you know
That's been there all your life
I try to make you see the world without you
That just turned black and white

At night it gets cold and
You'd dearly like to turn away
An escape that fails
And makes the wounds that time won't heal alone
Alone, alone, alone

There is no end to this
I can't turn away another picture
But the scene
Is still the same

There is no room to move
Or try to look away
Remember, life is strange
And life keeps getting stranger every day

I try so hard but this attitude's
A type that won't subside
No matter what they say
You knew your heart beats you late at night
Your heart beats you late at night
Your heart beats you late at night
Your heart beats you late at night
