A stable place in the scheme was all that you asked for
You find it hard to concentrate through the laughter
Use the height of confidence, to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience, an answer can be found

Typically a few will stop your momentum
With solid focus broken, why would you let them?
Use the height of confidence to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience, vengence swings around

Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
See me lashing at will, even after the kill
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?

Tragically mistake you for a man
Suddenly the satisfaction stands
Tragically they'll catch you if they can
Suddenly mortality's a scam

A sad attempt at esacaping from all disaster
Complications restraining all that comes after
Use the height of confidence to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience an answer to be found

Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
See me lashing at will, even after the kill
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?

Tragically mistake you for a man
Suddenly the satisfaction stands
Tragically they'll catch you if they can
Suddenly mortality's a scam
