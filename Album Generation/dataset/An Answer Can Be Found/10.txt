I create to destroy at hand
This path I made in the sand
(Tragedy haunts its prey)
And I'm off to the deepest depths
To forfeit my place on this land
The tide pulls you into be
As one adrift in the sea
(We finally float away)
The feeling is free, yet
You'll find yourself drifting with me

Don't hold your breath for long
If the undertow's getting too strong
There's no reason for you to come along

The horizon is just ahead
The end of the dry lives we've led
(Tragedy haunts its prey)
You know what I think of them
You sutured my wounds when they bled
So what's to become of us
The answer has yet to be seen
(We finally float away)
As fate puts us side by side
You'll find yourself drifting with me

Don't hold your breath for long
If the undertow's getting too strong
There's no reason for you to come along

Don't hold your breath for long
If the undertow's getting too strong
There's no reason for you to come along
