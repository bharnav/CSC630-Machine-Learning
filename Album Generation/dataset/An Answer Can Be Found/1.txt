There's 10,000 reasons to survive
But you only needed one to Die
It's too late to change what you've become
It won't always be this mourning

The way you lived your life, it mezmerizes me
Now won't you take some time,and cast out your regrets
Why did you leave our lives, it mezmerizes me
So won't you take the time, and cast out your regrets

I hear the creaking through the door
I see you slipping through the floor
It's not easy,asking you to leave
Cuz you'll always be the only

The way you lived your life, it mezmerizes me
Now won't you take some time, and cast out your regrets
Why did you leave our lives, it mezmerizes me
So won't you take the time, and cast out your regrets
