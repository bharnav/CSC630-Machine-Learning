Target locked a ruthless act
You're poised to get your basis back, how detrimental
Pathetic basket case that went unheard
As innocence, a dirty word, is annihilated
Gumption used for wrong result
To carry out the cruel assault, the blood to be frozen

Creeping in with added sense
Your conscience just a smal pretense, it's fabricated
Insate forgiveness right before the sin
The state your brain is in, it's complicated
Here's a change of plans instead
When someone else is steps ahead the hunter's been hunted!

Didn't you get to see your (faceless crime turned on you? sniped from behind)
(sniped x5)
You didn't get to see your (faceless crime turned on you?, sniped from behind)

Didn't you get to see your (faceless crime turned on you? sniped from behind)

You didn't get to see your (faceless crime turned on you? sniped from behind)

Precision of the bullet block without a chance to
Sense the shock
Living is fleeing
A human being snuffed for game
You only have yourself to blame, it's so deceiving
Gumption used for wrong result has failed to nail
The cruel assualt
Your blood is freezing
Taken up before the strike
The sickest minds they think alike, your plan deleted
Unbeknownst to those below, the innocent are free to go
Unviolated
Let this be a lesson learned for all content to let it burn
You get yours first!
