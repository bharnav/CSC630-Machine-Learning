An enhancement of emotions by your primitive regime
Experiments procede to exploit my silent screaming
A medical advance designed to ease the human mind
A glitch in operations multiplied my anger three more times

Tripled manic state
Resonating through me
Doctors horrified, are still unsatisfied
Poison as a cure, the failure to control me
Tripled manic state
Outrageously created for me

Skin is now a prison and I'm never to be free
Immobilized in body and I'm overflowing energy
The agony is understated, no one understands
My tripled manic state is multiplying all my violent plans

Tripled manic state
Resonating through me
Doctors horrified, are still unsatisfied
Poison as a cure, the failure to control me
Tripled manic state
Outrageously created for me

The agony is understated, no one understands
My tripled manic state is multiplying all my violent plans
