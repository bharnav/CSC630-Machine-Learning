There's no need to be thinking for yourself
Or at all
The overrated are locked inside of man
The weak and small
The universe is stalled
But your standards still stand tall
The digression of the civilized
Preparing for the fall
The fall

Expanding the boundaries of only one side
Seeking the real and exposing their pride
If no one's around to fear what they say
All power to slaves

We're freed from the inferior shell
There was no way to tell
A sacred new beginning when their feeble kingdom fell..
They fell

Expanding the boundaries of only one side
Seeking the real and exposing their pride
If no one's around to fear what they say
All power to slaves

We firmly established the dull and behaved
Now no one's around to fear what they say
All power to slaves
