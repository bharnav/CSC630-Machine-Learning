With the pressure on
Intent is to run
When you're feeling ineffective and dumb
You bet it's true
The event is you

Invaded by a swarm of confliction
Been penciled in but never begun
Infected sense the insistant one

If grieving is today
You've entered a familiar realm
With pessimistic views
You've entered a familiar realm

Break out and carry on

If responsibilities are ignored
Then the penalties will soon be endured
Potential risks beyond control

Fortune isn't fame
You've entered a familiar realm
If they've told you who to be
You've entered a familiar realm

Break out and carry on

Invaded by a swarm of confliction
Been penciled in but never begun
Potential risks are beyond control

If nothing's left to say
You've entered a familiar realm
If they all get in the way
You've entered a familiar realm

If they've told you who to be
You've entered a familiar realm
Fortune isn't fame
You've entered a familiar realm
