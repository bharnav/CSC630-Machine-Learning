Speaking gibberish, the shrieking drivel almost making sense
Let down your guard and sign the donor card
My hand denied one too many times
Hear what you're told, the truth is getting old

A simple victim
Just can't defeat them
So late to unlock this with empty pockets

To be detained and finding pleasure in the fact
Sad soul on loan but never on your own
You've made mistakes many repetitously
As the truth unfolds deceit is striking gold

A victim
He didn't defeat them
He's obligated, and terminated

Calling this a day at twenty-two
Quit existence at the proper cue
The heartless wish that there were more like you
Better forfeit all your goals, you're through

I can't bare the shame, or the error of your choice
Infliction spree has seen the last of me
Who makes your moves if you eat out of their hand
Do what you're told, deceit is striking gold

A victim
He didn't defeat them
He's obligated, and terminated

Calling this a day at twenty-two
Quit existence at the proper cue
The heartless wish that there were more like you
Better forfeit all your goals, you're through
