Tonight
Why not pretend
We're alone in the world
And that we're safe
From the storm out there
You'll be the only love
That I've known in the world
No clocks to measure
The time we share

Out there the winds
Are bitter cold
And there is too much pain
And far too little love
To few others who care

The here and now
Is all that we own in the world
And love's the refuge
That sees us through
Sleep inside my arms
Kiss the world away
Let tomorrow come
Let me face the day with you

The here and now
Is all that we own, in the world
And love's the refuge
That sees us through
Sleep inside my arms
Kiss the world away
Let tomorrow come
Let me face the day, with you
