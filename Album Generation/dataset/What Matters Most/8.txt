Say "Goodbye?"
Why, I can barely say "Good night"
If I can hardly take my eyes from yours
How far can I go?

Walk away?
The thought would never cross my mind
I couldn't turn my back on Spring or Fall
Your smile, least of all!

When I say "Always,"
I mean "Forever"
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I'm not afraid to say "I love you,"
And I promise you I'll never say
"Goodbye"

We're dancers on a crowded floor
While other dancers live from song to song
Our music goes on
On and on
And if I never leave your arms
I really will have traveled ev'rywhere
For my world is there

When I say "Always,"
I mean "Forever"
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I'm not afraid to say "I love you,"
And I promise you I'll never say
"Goodbye"

How could I ever say "Goodbye?"
