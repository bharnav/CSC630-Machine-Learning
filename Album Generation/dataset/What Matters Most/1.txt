I guess I wanted something new in my life
A new key to fit a new door
To wake and see a different view in my life
What I've been waiting for

Dreams like everyone I had a few in my life
Who knew that this one would come true in my life
I knew the moment when you touched me
You touched me

You're like a sudden breeze that blew in my life
A new face, a new smile, a new song
And now I know I wanted you in my life all along

You're like a chance I had to take in my life
I found you and couldn't lose you
And all the difference that you make in my life
The feelings I never knew

I guess I must have saved an empty place in my heart
For you to come and fill the space in my heart
That long before I said, I loved you
I loved you

Whatever happens this is true in my life
When all the springs have come and gone
Whatever doors I may go through in my life
Whatever else that I may do in my life

You'll always be the something new in my life
From now on
I know there always will be you in my life
From now on
