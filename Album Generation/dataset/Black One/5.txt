Something comes
Something That you should never have known calls
Summoned by a vastness that kills certainty without thought
The boulders of blood open their gates
For it is here that the universe fears to believe
The gateway to the infinite hunger opens
The eternal swarms that darken darkness beckon with their flawless misshapen menace
A knowledge that is so certain it has been locked away
Here it dwells
Draped in the void
The very flesh of darkness
Where the unholiest caress their nightmare
The resting place of all that is damned
For here you are unwelcome
Un-alive and incarcerated in the place where the murdered stones bleed onto the tongue of damnation
