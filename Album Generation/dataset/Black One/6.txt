Here
Decompose forever
Aware and unholy
Encased in marble and honey from the swarm
A thin coat of infernal whispering that bleaches from within
A darkness that defiles thought
Stolen by the wingless harpies whose memories lay waste the valley of diamonds
Where the great One sleeps
Her eyes
Placid pits of violent tar and bitumen regurgitated by demons chained to misery
Eyes that see nothing for there is only darkness that wells up from inside
A thick viscous cloud smothering hope
A blanket woven from the dung of the old ones
Their disease the tapestry of all that is futile
Her gaze burning holes in the veil that protects the chosen
Her breathe a plague that unleashes the frozen wolves
Blind
Their tongues paint your heart with scorpions
Their pestilence an invitation for the only one that matters for She is the presence that is all that is un-named
For it is Her
The begotten Mistress of eternal hunger
Dwell forever in her great unholy stomach where the damned befoul themselves in the glory of her fecund and bloody history
Worship in the torment of a million wasted lives
Bathe in the horror that the blood of time carries with the plague
And befoul yourself with worship
For she hate you eternally with the ferocious lust that binds all that inhabit the waste and forgotten
The blissful loathing of you is now all that remains
Alone
Forgotten and damned
