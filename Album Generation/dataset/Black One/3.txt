Face down where the ancient soil meets the discarded flesh
The great stench of all that is rotten
And forgotten
The unburied clamber into what you were
Feasting on the joy that is stolen forever
An alchemy of disgust and hatred
The unceremonious
The smell of all final moments at once
Embedded in the great beast's flesh
The carrier of the tormented
The final journey through the impossible
A silence so vast
That deafens with its roaring certainty
To the unnamed place
Guarded by ancient carrion and their minions of vomit and pestilence
