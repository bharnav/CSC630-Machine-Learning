Alone
Unalive
Forgotten and abandoned where only the discarded dwell
The scurrying of footsteps so large planets fall into the great pit
Entire civilizations consumed in the slow frenzy of despair
An unholiness that judges without reason
Digested by something so hungry
So insatiable
A gleeful darkness that knows you have arrived
And has always known
Something that should never have been
Something waiting with a patience truly terrifying
That is everything and nothing
A darkness that binds all together in fear and eternity
Await
