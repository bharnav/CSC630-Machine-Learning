A walk in the clouds
Walking together
You feel yourself
Walking forever
The feeling that this is
Everything to amaze
And the Universe shines bright in your face
The love we had was once in a lifetime
When I held you close you were so precious

I will still be here
When the love has gone
I will always care
Holding on
What we had we share
When the love has gone
I will still be here
Holding on

We had our time
Captured the moment
You heard yourself
Talking of omens
We were bound to lose faith
Cos love is for lovers
Aimlessly open
With one another
Deeper yet, As deep as the nighttime
When you held my heart like it was precious

I will still be here
When the love has gone
I will always care
Holding on
What we had we share
When the love has gone
I will still be here
Holding on
