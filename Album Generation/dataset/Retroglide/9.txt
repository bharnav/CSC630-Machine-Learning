Oceans deep
Drifting as you sleep
Up on the eternal sea
A ship sails

When your ship comes in
Will you be ready to sail with the tide
And when your ship comes in
Will it be a galley full of slaves
Or a sun streaked schooner

You came so far
Between the rocks and shoals
In the blinding night
A may day

When your ship comes in
Will you step on board with a smile
Or will they have to pressgang you
Will the flag that flies in the wind
Say friend or foe
Will you know
Or bear the mark of a pirate bold
With a treasure chest full of fool’s gold
Fool’s gold

When your ship comes in
Don’t try to pack your case with hopes and dreams
It’s all behind you now
This ain't no Sunday cruise this time you
Don’t choose your destination
And will a silent wave carry you away
Or will the storm crash down so cold
I spent a lot of fool’s gold
Fool’s gold

Will you be ready when your ship comes in
When your ship comes in
Will you be ready to sail with the tide
When your ship comes in
Will you be ready when your ship comes in
When your ship comes in
Will you be ready to sail with a smile
When your ship comes in
