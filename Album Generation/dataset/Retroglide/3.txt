I'll dream another day for you
I'll peel another skin for you
I'll bare another soul just for you

I'll bleed another heart for you
I'll even play the fool for you
I'll act so crazy just for you

There's nothing I will not deny
If you're the sun I'll be the sky
So many times I've walked right by your side
So many times I've been a superfly
But I am not your candy coated crazy little guy

I'll be the martyr to your cause
I'll be the star that has to fall
Anything you want I will be

I'll fill my head with thoughts of you
I'll steal the moon and paint it blue
I'll pull my own strings all for you

There's nothing I will not deny
If you're the sun I'll be the sky
So many times I've walked right by your side
So many times I've been a superfly
So many times I've wandered thru your heart
So many times I've wondered where to start
So many times I've walked right by your side
So many times I've been a super fly
But I am not your candy coated crazy little guy

There's nothing I will not deny
If you're the sun I'll be the sky
So many times I've walked right by your side
So many times I've been a superfly
So many times I've wandered thru your heart
So many times I've wondered where to start
So many times I've walked right by your side
So many times I've been your super fly
But I am not your candy coated crazy little guy

I will not deny...
