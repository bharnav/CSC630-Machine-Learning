I'm moving slowly
Trying to find my own way
Itís a struggle to get there
When I'm feeling this way
Is there someone to call
I can't seem to think
How can I go on
When Iím on the brink
Pale mornings stale with memories
I pick up my life and it's empty

I've had a lot of luke warm
Faded mutations of love
I've gone as far as I can
I need something I am sure of
Subtle as crows
Teach me again
I've learned about lonely
And nothing 'bout friends
Pale mornings stale with memories
I feed off the lies that were fed me
I feed off the lies that were fed me

Can't go on
On and on
How can I go on
I'm calling
All our lives
We will strive
Tell me what it means
The danger lies
In trying to fly
When you've no wings
In your eyes
There's a smile
That's all I need

I want something to believe in
I'm tired of feeling this way
I got nowhere left to get to
Nowhere to go anyway
Time moving on
I reach for the past
Will you be there
If I call you at last
Pale mornings stale with memories
I pick up my life and it's empty
I feed off the lies that were fed me

Can't go on
On and on
How can I go on
I'm calling
All our lives
We will strive
Tell me what it means
The danger lies
In trying to fly
When you've no wings
In your eyes
There's a smile
That's all I need

Oooh
All I need
