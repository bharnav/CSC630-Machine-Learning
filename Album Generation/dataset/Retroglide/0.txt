You think like a loaded gun as your mind is over come
Unzipped by stellar fields infinity and love
They put the big into the bang and said that chaos is the way
I wanna hide
I wanna run before I come undone
So I fall thru' the edge of the day and stare into the night
In the abysmal atmosphere the stars don't look so bright
Feeling small wanna crawl now I got nowhere to run
Let's turn around and dive into the sun

Dive into the sun
You know that life's what you make it
So make it happen the way you want
Dive into the sun
You got to know how to take it
To take it all and be grateful – yeah-e-eah

You dream in catastrophes you want eternal guarantees
That don't mean much to me, eternity is free
A giant leap a step too far? you can count your lucky stars
I'll read the signs for all our times and count on who we are
I know
You you know me gotta help me find a light
With convoluted attitudes we may as well as might
Turn it up turn it down now you know you are the on
Let's turn around and dive into the sun

Dive into the sun
You know that life's what you make it
So make it happen the way you want
Dive into the sun
You got to know how to take it
To take it all and be grateful – yeah-e-eah

Dive into the sun
You know that life's what you make it
So make it happen the way you want
Dive into the sun
You got to know how to take it
To take it all and be grateful – yeah-e-eah
