You gone and told me 'bout the Hollywood Hills
The thrills and chills
The passion and the pills
Keep talking

You told me all about the men you met
The come and get
The kiss that you regret
Keep talking

You went and told me 'bout the fame in Spain
The plain in Jane
The losing it again
Keep talking

You told me all about the sweet sunset
In love and debt
The one you can't forget
Keep talking

Now you keep talking in your sleep
You've had it rough
It went too deep
I pray the lord your soul to keep
I've heard enough
I'm in retreat

(You) keep talking me right out of here
Sleep talking

You went and told me bout the Italian job
The Pope and God
Spaghetti and the mob
Keep talking

And how about the little brokedown shack
The hack 'n smack
The scratching Daddy's back
Keep talking

You gone and told me bout the Broadway hits
The diva fits
The lovers and the splits
Keep talking

You went and told me bout the Paris in the spring
And the nearly thing
And the diamond in the ring
Keep talking

I don't know what I can say
Cos I can't take it away
I don't know what I can say to you
Cos you just took it away from me
Now you keep talking in your sleep
You've had it rough
It went too deep
I pray the lord your soul to keep
I've heard enough
I'm in retreat

(You) keep talking me right out of here
Sleep talking

Fell apart in St. Tropez
That kind of gave the game away
Met the set in Martinique
Couldn't hack the chic-to-chic
New York new walk big town talk
Your perfect face was white as chalk
Trailer trash to all time smash
Now you're waiting for the burn and crash
Tragedy in harmony
You gonna bling til you're back on your knees
You gonna sing til you're back on your knees
You gonna ring when you're back on your knees
Tragedy in harmony
You gonna bling til you're back on your knees
You gonna sing til you're back on your knees
You gonna ring when you're back on your knees
Monte Carlo boom to bust
Lost the lustre lost the trust
Went to Phuket went to hell
Had to get back into your shell
LA tripped over your head
Wanted to jump but you made it instead
Trailer trash to all time smash
Now you're waiting for the burn and crash

A tragedy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep talking
Sleep talking
Keep talking
Sleep talking
Keep talking
Keep talking
Keep talking
