Your small time view is so oblique
You think your thoughts are so unique
Your squeaky lies are sneaky clean
Cos you won't say just what you mean
Now, I don't recognize you

Oh, I don't recognize you
You bled me dry and left me high
Your dirty heart is by the by
You trash your friends like it's a game
Then you cry and claim the pain
Now, I don't recognize you
Oh, I don't recognize you

All around it's all around
All ready to be found
All ready to take you down
Down, down, down, down
All around it's all around
All ready to be found
All ready to bring you round
Bring you round now

You break your beats and drop your bombs
Cos everybody else is wrong
You hawk your dove and say your prayers
Like you're the only one who cares
Don't like your TVocricy
Your karaokeosophy
Can't take another minute of what you say
I won't be the bait today
Now, I don't recognize you
Oh, I don't recognize you

All around it's all around
All ready to be found
All ready to take you down
Down, down, down, down
All around it's all around
All ready to be found
All ready to bring you round
Bring you round now

Hypno trips a psycho blitz
You tried it all but nothing fits
You got a little habit that burns your nose
A bony fido freaky pose
You hide your hat behind a stare
You take the heat out of the air
A solid state electric sigh
What made you so angelized
Well, I don't recognize you
And I won't angelize you
And I won't angelize you
Because I don't recognize you anymore
