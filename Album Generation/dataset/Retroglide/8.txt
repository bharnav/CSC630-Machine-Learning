Daddy's little manikin likes a good time
Stretched out in the limousine head all gone
Hair is pretty astrokhan for the boyfriend
He is a zoot suited zoon politikon

Mama's mini Babylon hits the kitchen
(Can't) find the pills
That she lives on, it's a plot
See her world come crashing down, she's looking older
The Prom Queen ain't so pretty now, like it or not

It's just another little hell town story
Another blaze of hopeless glory
You don't have to end it for me
It's gonna end all by itself

Daddy's busy taking it, don't need the money
Embezzles for the sake of it, its his job
Tonight he's out and on the make, got a yearning
Cruising for some cabaret Billy Bob

Freddy's on the run again, tearing his way
Thru the streets for fun again, cross that line
Borrowed Daddy's gun again, no consequences
Money buys you everything, even crime

It's just another little hell town story
Another case of rich man poor me
You don't have to end it for me
It's gonna end all by itself

Can you feel the heat tonight, its aggressive
Hot enough to start a fight, and it does
Mama's shooting Daddy now, bang and it's all over
Turns the gun upon herself, and it's done

(The) kids find out there's nothing left, all alone now
Freddy jumps a freight train west, to Hollywood
Daddy's little manikin still craves the good times
She's so scared it's frightening, it ain't no good

It's just another little hell town story
Another blaze of hopeless glory
You don't have to end it for me
It's gonna end all by itself
