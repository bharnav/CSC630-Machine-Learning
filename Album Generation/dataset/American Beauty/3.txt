[Verse]
Operator, can you help me, help me if you please
Give me the right area code and the number that I need
My rider left upon the midnight flyer
Singing like a summer breeze

I think shes somewhere down South, down about Baton Rouge
But i just can't remember no number, a number I can use
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it
I've gotta find a number to use

Trying to check out her number, trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine
Its flooding down in Texas, poles are out in Utah
Gotta find a private line

She could be hanging round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland, talking to the night
I don't know where shes going, I don't care where shes been
Long as she's doing it right
Long as shes doing it right
