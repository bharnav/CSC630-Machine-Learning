I was the porter for centuries
Bagman for wars never won
I carried the noose
Buried the gatling gun
Duration

I lived off dust & tumbleweeds
Dressed in a denim suit
Bothered the gents
Pulled up their towns by the roots
Sensation

Always did well with the womenfolk
Promises never i made
Tried when i could
Left when i said i would stay
Salvation

The fish feast on
The bodies of
The dead down in the sea
While i walk the land permanently
Vibration
