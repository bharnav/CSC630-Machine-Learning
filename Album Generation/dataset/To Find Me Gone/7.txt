Tell me know, spell it out
Are you waiting for that one?
Love to lift your life about
Well it won't be, tell you now it won't be me
Hard times have been mine
I tried to keep them far from you
Did the best that I could do
But it won't be, don't you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, don't you know it won't be me

I've done (?) to ever cheat your mystery girl
Gave all that I knew to give
Still it won't be
Oh you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, oh you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, tell you now it won't be me

I won't lie, I won't deny that I led you farther on
Thought I heard them bells a'chime
But they won't be, oh you know they won't for me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, oh you know it won't be me
