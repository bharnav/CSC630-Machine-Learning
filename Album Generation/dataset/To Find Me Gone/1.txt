You may be blue
But you dark my day
Throw shadows my way
Break my mind
While you say that you've been treating me kind
Who are you foolin'?

My time with you
Beat a thorn-filled path
Blood filled where we passed through
Blood red with wrath
You all knew that we'd be fine
Find by nothing at all

I know my way
And it won't be long
You're gonna wake one day
To find me gone
And there won't be nothing but goodbye
Nothing nothing but goodbye
