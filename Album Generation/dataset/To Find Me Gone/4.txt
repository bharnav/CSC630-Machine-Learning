If you need, Maureen, I'll recount you all the ways that I mean to be true
Though my eyes wonder why, my heart keeps inside the reasons why I'm free with you

Nobody wants to see trouble where none should be
My Maureen, don't dream that I could ever be leaving you

You were saved by doubt and you needed an out to help you get through the day
I may offer you sense but it's love you miss and my talking just gets in the way

Nobody wants to hear farewells ring in their ear
My Maureen, don't dream that I could ever be leaving you
Nobody wants to hear farewells ring in their ear
My Maureen, don't dream that I could ever be leaving you
