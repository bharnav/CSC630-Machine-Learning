All my highs came from you
Came within troubles
Thrills held still
Uncertain stead
Not a nice word in a double, double....

We started out happy and true
To one another
Days, strange ways, moved in between
Darkened that dream, of a double, double...

We pair and pull up through
The twine and rubble
Call and through, what could we do?
Binded by two, in a double, double...

Born too rough, baby two is true enough
Sworn above, ??????, two is but enough
Torn for love, maybe two is but enough
Born too rough, baby two is true enough
