I can't believe that you're knocking
Knocking on my door
Oh it's been so long, been so long, oh
Fate has a way of showing i'm where you belong
Oh it's been so long, been so long, oh

I can't believe that you're knocking
Knocking on my door
Oh it's been so long, been so long, oh
Fate has a way of showing i'm where you belong
Oh it's been so long, been so long, oh

The sound of my heart stopping is surprising some/so?
It's been so long, been so long, oh
Time has a way of knowing
What we have in store
Oh it's been so long, been so long, oh
