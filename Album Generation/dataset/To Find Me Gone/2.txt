I walk alone, but I feel ya there
Smiling upon me, I wonder
What you have drawn on your hands today
Runes to show you remember

Idle ties, ink and dyes
Woven arms, open wide
You're with me tonight

Put on a tape that you made for me
It's got Marc Bolan and Vashti
Ringin' my ear like a mission bell
Come and go dive in the inkwell

Idle ties, sink and sigh
Token charms kept near by
You're with me tonight

Now the wind answers your telephone
Come on, sing the city soft now
Well it'll get to her once you're underground
Signal can't hear what you rained down

Idle ties, sink inside
Open arms, open wide
You're with me tonight
