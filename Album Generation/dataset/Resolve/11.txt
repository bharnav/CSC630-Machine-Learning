The days are full of storybook romance
The myriad of thoughtful acts
A million ways I'm into you
I'm never getting over you
I'm sorry for exposing you
I know you hate it when I do
But I had to write one for my better half

The days are new, the nights unwind
You break my world, you change my mind
Run out of love, come down from life
Run out of pain, my life has changed

It's obvious it's all been said
In cheesy poems and chick flicks
The mushy shit that people say
It makes us chuckle everyday
So how can I express to you
The recent dramas we've been through
I wouldn't have been fine without your help

The days are new, the nights unwind
You touch my world, you change my life
Run out of love, run out of life
Come down from hate, the world has changed

But we may never have met if it weren't for him
Hey Derrick, maybe somehow you're listening

Today's mantra is gratitude
You changed my life
I'm sure you knew I'll never forget the words that you said
The life that you lead

I'll never forget I'll never forget
I'll never forget I'll never forget
