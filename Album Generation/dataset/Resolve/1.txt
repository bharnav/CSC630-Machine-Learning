Get up, smile, find a need
Wash your hair, bleach your teeth
Develop habit
Automatic

Compromise, build a bridge
Sacrifice, sacrilege
Sell yourself
Automatic

Nobody out there knows
None of them have intent
Pretension and purpose
Fashioned in plastic heads
Everyone drives all day
None of them have a goal
Everyone's lost their way
All of them play the game

Set a goal
Make it happen
Imagine love
Fake a passion
Change your name
Stay in fashion
Make a deal
Make it happen
Compromise, build a bridge
Sacrifice, sacrilege
Same cars
Same clothes
Same desires
Same woes
Lose it all
Automatic

Nobody out there feels
None of them sees the end
Pretension and purpose
Fashioning plastic heads
Everyone drives all day
Searching their empty hearts
Everyone's lost their way
All of us fall apart
Automatic
Automatic
