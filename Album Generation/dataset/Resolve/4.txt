Used to recognize the gun in your hand
Promise, squandered
Used to understand the stake in your heart
Mileage, road worth

But it's hard to recognize the massive burden
Born of bad deeds
And it runs in the family from beginning to end It is just revenge

Everybody build a monument to pain
Flowers, fast cars
Everybody raise the thief in your heart
It's just a beating

And it sounds just like a million other tributes
Customs and demons
And it runs in the family with a million regrets
It's just (It's just revenge) revenge

Everybody build a monument to fear
Unsafe people
Everybody raise a paranoid child
It's just an over-stimulated mind

It sounds just like a billion people starving with no resource for love
And it runs in the family with a million missteps
It's just revenge

Everything echoes
Everyone emulates
Everyone is a victim of their blood
Everyday initiate
Everything echoes
Everyone echoes

All of us are running with the wolves
All of us are running out of life
