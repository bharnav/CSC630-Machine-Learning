One more time, falling on new ground
Bracing a chase lounge, I'm a member
This one truth, I can be discrete
Words that escape me, I remember

Clarity watching eyes, I can't see I can't read
Passionless vacation, you're not telling anyone
The sum falls in a hole, it's chemistry chemical
Follow the pattern if you can
Stick around it will change again

One more line stable guess
Hollow, why did I feel sick?
Misunderstanding tempting tolerance
You're not telling anyone
I'm not telling anyone

This sounds atrocious, the miles horrific
They exercise those last words, I'll hang on to mine
One more line, I can stay focused
Words are atrocious, I'm a member

Lying out in the sun, keep it like a secret
And I may seem not full well, all dried up and
Here comes the chemist again
This is everything I am
