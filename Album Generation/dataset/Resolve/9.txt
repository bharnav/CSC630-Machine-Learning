What if I had nothing left?
What if I had no one left?
Why would I:
How would I survive?

Dead man, he leaves his home
Hopeless, he holds his goals higher, higher, low

I just wanted to see you wake up one day
With a real smile on your face

What if you felt certainty?
Granted trust when you were young
Why would you:
How would you let go?

I just wanted to see you wake up one day
With an expectation
I just wanted to see you wake up one day
With a real smile on your face
