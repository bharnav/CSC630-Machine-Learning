Controlled, consumed
Thoughts unattached
Each one a failed synapses detached from fact
One positive, one negative
Desperate, holding on to healthy images

Remember witness, wattness, matters, we're not gonna make it
Provoking everyone but no one gives a:

Half laugh, half sigh
Half-sad, half-smile
Losing ability to recall his half-life
Burn from the stove
Keys locked inside
Dazed as impending anger turns up in reprise

Remember green light, keeper, easy and eyes on the road ahead
Provoking everyone with all the words he said

Infectious
I won't speak of all that would have been
Gained, lost, spent
But I won't think of all that could have been

Controlled, consumed
Thoughts unattached
Outburst, these images are melding in my head
Remember Franken, Milkweg, Lintfabrik
The weirdest we have seen
Fires and blown-out tires
Perfect tragedy

Infectious
I won't think of all that should have been
Waste, lost, spent
But I won't think of all that could have been

Goodbye old friend I won't speak of all that could have been
