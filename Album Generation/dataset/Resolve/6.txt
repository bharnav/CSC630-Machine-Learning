As you sat on the bed
Moments from your end
Inconceivable dread
Inches from your head
I can't bear to imagine you

In that horror scene
One too sad to be
In my mind's eye I am there
Embracing you so scared
Now you kill me too
You killed me too

Decidedly willing to lie for you
Absolutely willing to cry for you
Ill at ease in saying goodbye to you
A part of me will never know

I am there again, intervals of red
An accomplice to
Things I couldn't do
In a fable disabled

I say words like foolish son
God what have you done
I'm a thin blue clich√©, hopelessly
I'm a mouthful of doubtful

Decidedly willing to lie for you
Say again
Willing to cry for you
Finally saying goodbye to you
A part of you I'll never know

Looking through the spyglass in a punctured sky
While your garden died
You couldn't see the sky for your fallen stars?
Endless in your arms

You were still alive even as the sad astronaut
