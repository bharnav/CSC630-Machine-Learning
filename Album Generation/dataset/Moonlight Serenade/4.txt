Music by: Arthur Schwartz

Alone together
Beyond the crowd
Above the world
We're not too proud
To cling together
We're strong
As long as we're together

Alone together
The blinding rain
The starless night
We're not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear
Together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather
The great unknown
If we're alone together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather
The great unknown
If we're alone together
Together

As long as you're close to me
Our love is as deep as a love can be

As long as you're close to me
Our love is as great as a love can be
Alone together
