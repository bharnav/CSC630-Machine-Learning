I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Listen you, tell me do
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills, I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven, I've been hurled
Now, I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break for heaven's sake
How long has this been going on?

What a kick, what a buzz
Boy, you click like no one does
Hear me sweet, oh I repeat
How long has this been going on?

Lover, when in your arms I creep
What a rendezvous
Don't wake me up if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true

Kiss me twice, then once more
Oh, that was nice, let's make it four
What a break for heaven's sake
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
