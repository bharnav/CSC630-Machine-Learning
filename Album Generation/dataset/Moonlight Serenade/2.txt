Music by: Harry Warren

My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here

So am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here
So am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes
Yes, I only have eyes
I only have eyes for you
Only have eyes for you
Only have eyes for you
Only for you
