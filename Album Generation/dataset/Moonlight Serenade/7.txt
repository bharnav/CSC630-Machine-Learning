Music by: Richard Rodgers

Sometimes you think you lived before
All that you lived today
Things you do come back to you
As if they knew the way
Oh, the tricks your mind can play

It seems we stood and talked
Like this before
We looked at each other
In the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling
You were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happen
For the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when

Some things that happen
For the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when
But who knows where or when
