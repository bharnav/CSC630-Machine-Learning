Music by: Will Hudson/Irving Mills

It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you

I still hear you saying
My love, hold me fast
And I start to praying
Oh Lord, please let this last

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moonglow gave me you

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moonglow gave me you
That moonglow gave me you
That moonglow gave me you
