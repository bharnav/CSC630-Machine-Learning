[Verse 1]
There she goes she ran in her room
She'll probably stay in there the rest of the day
It sounds like it must have been something you said
You know she's awful used to getting her way

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you kiss her
(Why don't you kiss her
And while you kiss her
(Tell her you miss her
Why don't you treat her
(Why don't you treat her
Treat her nice

[Chorus 2]
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister

[Verse 2]
You know she digs you and thinks you're a real groovy guy
But yet I'm not sure that I feel the same
We both know that you've been making her cry
I hope you don't think it's some kind of game

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you love her
(Why don't you love her
Like her big brother
(Like her big brother
Why don't you tell her
(Why don't you tell her
Tell her you're sorry

[Chorus 2][x3]
