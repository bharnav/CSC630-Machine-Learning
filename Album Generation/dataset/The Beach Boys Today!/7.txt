[Verse 1]
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
We want to get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction

[Chorus]
So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon now
I'll go to sea
Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me

[Chorus]
