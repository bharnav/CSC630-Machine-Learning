[Chorus 1]
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

[Verse 1]
They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean
But all they know is from what they've seen
And when I get her alone now
You know we're happy as a couple could be
And when I give her my love it's between her and me

[Chorus 2]
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

[Verse 2]
Some guys may think they'd be better for her
But she knows just what she wants for sure
And when we're out with our friends now
You know that we never have to put on a show
And we stay together while other couples come and go

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby[x2]
