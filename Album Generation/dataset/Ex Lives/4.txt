I'd rather beg your forgiveness
Than solicit permission
I'd rather know that it broke your heart
Than doubt that it will

Every time we divide
We put zeros under the line
And we publish it as our proof
That nothingness is divine

I can't find a way
To grind your heart to a halt
It was probably just the wind
I don't ruin you like I did

I would rather be a jealous man
Than an off duty cop
I tried to be a babe-in-arms
Not a bull in a china shop

A sheep in wolf's clothes
I'm a hangman without a rope
Who am I trying to kid?
I don't ruin you like I did

When you live your life being scared to death
Then you might as well be wounded
If you spend your nights being short of breath
Then I'll keep these shadows moving

If only you could see me now
I'll take what I can get
Even if it's restraining orders

Hold your fire
What do you take me for?
What do you take me for?
Did you think I could garner attention with tact?
What do you take me for?

What am I trying to prove?
What have I done to you?
Left at the altar and asked for a bed
What did I expect you to do?

Give me an audience
Black, loveless eyes
I have hundreds of costumes
But not one disguise

Places, everyone (Who am I trying to kid?)
Fangs out (I don't ruin you like I did)

I'd rather beg your forgiveness
Than solicit permission
I'd rather know that it broke your heart
Than doubt that it will

I would rather be a jealous man
Than an off duty cop
I tried to be a babe-in-arms
Not a bull in a china shop

I will see you in the dark

A castrated stranger with candy hearts
