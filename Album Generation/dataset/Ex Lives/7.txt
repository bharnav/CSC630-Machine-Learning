[Hook]
Thanks, Lord
But I don't need anymore
Poor advice, poor advice

Caught in a cannon with a one way ticket
Four riders in a town with one horse
I wagered a sure thing against what was behind the first door
Stack the chips, let it ride
Out of sight, out of mind
It's fool proof and it won't do to make safe bets
While I'm towing the line

[Hook] x2

I had a lock on a dirty little secret
A raging bull who was fixed to fall down
I've been waiting at ringside
My whole life, but he's still swinging on
I've got debts piling high
I've got addictions and ex-wives
But I've stayed true
So I thank you for bearing witness while I waste my fucking life

I'm ready to pay the judge
To pay the judge
To pay the judge
Now

I need to tip the scale
Some sort of bribery
I'm not waiting this out

I need to pay the judge
To pay the judge
To pay the judge
Now

I need to grease a palm
Some sort of certainty
I'm sick of waiting this out

I should have learned a more noble craft
Out of the library into the lab
Will the machine gunners please step forth?
Will the machine gunners please step forth?
There's only room on this rescue boat
For butchers and bakers and men with hope
And will the machine gunners please step forth?
Will the machine gunners please step forth?

[Hook] x2
