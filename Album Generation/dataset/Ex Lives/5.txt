At the bottom of the first drink, I found my nerve
At the bottom of the next one, I met my girl
At the bottom of the third drink, I found a fourth
And at the bottom of that one was a Trojan horse

That carried in demons who brought their brides
And they tempted darkness where I lost my mind
Well the fifth drink found it and carried it home
Where my girl was waiting, one foot out the door

Another night spent gathering dust
Mug shot of a marble bust
Ruination leaves the lantern lit
So I know where the good lovin' is

I used to be a god damn saint
I said my prayers, and I handled snakes
Until the road introduced me to sin
I only shook hands with drink, but he had his friends with him

I curse the day we raised our glass
Up like a bridge to let the devil pass
Because he ain't never left this town
And only beaten and unborn are living with him now

I used to be a holy man
"Once put an onion in a beggar's hand"
But now I'd rather not believe
How could a man I've never met be so cruel to me?

At least I'm in good company
I'll drink to that

Dash the cup
Fifteen years has been long enough
Put the child in an unmarked grave
And burn the black book, page by page

Go alone
There is your road

For once, I'm awake
And I will not serve madness

I am not the company I keep

Dash the cup
Fifteen years has been long enough
Put the child in an unmarked grave
And burn the black book, page by page
