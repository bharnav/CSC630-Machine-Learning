I need a new rock bottom
I've got to find a beloved back alley
I'm bored as hell in Sodom
And Eden is just another dry county

The local haunts have been blessed
All their spirits dispossessed
Even our bed is the second best
And the end isn't near, it is now

These drugs won't even bring me down
I want to dance, but I don't hear a sound
You can't fuck when your friends are around
But my slow death drew a crowd

You can't take two sins off of one ox
Pile them on because she won't spare the rod
You don't drown faster the deeper you sink
So you best make peace and take in the sea

Nurse that stray black dog

Stay low
Keep digging

Divine light continued to shine
For so long that the battery died
And no spark could be seen in my eyes
So it waved death down

The rapture came and it went
While my faith was treading cement
I'm hell bound, but I'm heaven sent
So I'm lifted back into the ground
I've ascended back into the ground

Oh, there was whiskey in the devil's blood
And there was blood in my cup
So I will make me a better grave

I will find my own way
