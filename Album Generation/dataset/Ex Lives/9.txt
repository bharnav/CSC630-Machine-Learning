The stand-in will suffice, I suppose
A tunnel painted on a brick wall
And when the crowd arrives in droves
They don't question the depth at all

I got a weak heart
So I've heard
I wouldn't know because it hasn't said a word
All these winters
Not a sound
It probably never had a chance to thaw out

You don't touch what you want to survive
So this distance is keeping me alive
Until the ones that have loved me are dead
I will hold my breath and pray that my aim is true

The meat sits in my blind spot
The maze around it is the meal I want
The meat sits in my blind spot
Hallelujah, got a trophy kill

Maybe the flesh will have its day
Maybe the meaning will not get in the way

God saves every third person
But he won't help us if we help ourselves

I only marvel at existence in the language existence permits
Most hearts make terrible sounds
So I laugh
An army of images stalks the land in search of ideas
I am struck only when I think to step back

The stand-in will suffice, I suppose
A tunnel painted on a brick wall
And when the crowd arrives in droves
They don't question the depth at all
