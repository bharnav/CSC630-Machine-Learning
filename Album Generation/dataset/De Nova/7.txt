Holding up the bank in Belgrade
She lost her mind between the battle lines
And the telephone rings. A bell rung out
As they talk about 16 kids gone in a school yard
The papers read, she shakes her head

And I said in the darkest night
Come the darkest days. In the worst of ways

Close that town for good, the plagues here
The skin from beneath all the way to the mouths that feed
Then they're filtered clear, the boys will try
In the judge's eye. Get out while you can
She tells me you're wasting time. That's fine

In the darkest night
Come the darkest days, in the worst of ways

From the silent cry, to the naked eye
She waves goodbye

Holding up the bank in Belgrade
I played a tune, when, how, did it happen soon?
She said now we find a way to make it down
The place smokes and the palace burns
And the world keeps turning around, and around yeah
Around, and it's bringing me down

In the darkest night
Come the darkest days
And the last bell rings out
