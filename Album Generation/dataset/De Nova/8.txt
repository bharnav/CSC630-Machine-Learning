Have you ever been to Harlem?
Have you ever been to Rhodes
In the falling rain?

Blowing like a hurricane
Blowing down the road that you left behind
Think of me and you know it, I'm not for anyone
But love is all around, and it's for everyone

Have you ever been to Stalingrad?
Have you ever seen the light
That you knew was there?

Blowing like a hurricane
Blowing down the road that you left behind
I'll be on my way this time tomorrow
But know that all is free and up to you my friend

I don't care about you, I know it
If this is love, then why not show it?
This is how the story goes

Blowing like a hurricane
Blowing down the road that you left behind
Think of me and you know it, I'm not for anyone
Love is all around, and it's for everyone

I don't care about you, I know it
If this is love, then why not show it?
This is how the story goes, oh
This is how the story goes, yeah
