Well I, I had my hands tied tight behind my head
And she, she sang me a song then took me off to bed
And when I said to her "tomorrow girl, I just can't stay"
But don't be sad now my darlin'
I'll be back someday
I guess love has a-taken it's toll
Well, oh no. well, alright
Two more steps and I'm on my way
Well, ok. alright
Oh, I love her. yes I do
Oh, I love her. and it's true
Oh, and when I sing this song
You know I've been moving on
And it's true. I want you
Oh hey, hey!
Oh hey hey hey
Oh hey hey hey
Oh no no no
Well she, she told me a story how we won this war
And I, I got another drink and I layed down on her floor
And when I said to her "don't you bother when we're apart"
And don't be sad now my darlin'
I won't a-break your heart
Well, I think I'm a-leavin' today
Well, ok. Well, alright
Two more steps and i'm on my way
Well, ok. alright
Oh, I love her. yes I do
Oh, I love her. and it's true
Oh, and when I sing this song
You know I've been moving on
But it's you. I love you
Oh hey, hoo!
Oh hey hey hey
Oh hey hey hey
Oh hey hey hey
Hey!
