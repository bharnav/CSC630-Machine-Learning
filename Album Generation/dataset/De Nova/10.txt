One, two, three, four

If we hadn't won the war
And I was calling all the shots
And what I believe was done
If we hadn't sent 'em there to die
You'd be sure that we'd be doing it again

So let the union stand alone to be it
While alone my brothers singing
This is the glory of war

Though no man picks his birth
Nobody and he'd be tied
And for it he must hold the line
I guess some men be born to dyin'
'Cause livin' wasn't up to them

So know, we're all born as brothers
Livin' just to kill each other
This is the glory of war

If our flag was wavin' free
And we'd marchin' all the way
For what? I doubt they knew
If we hadn't lost a generation
You'd be sure that we'd be losin' one again

So let them all go down for nothin'
And watch that blood keep comin'
This is the glory of war

So let the union stand alone to see it
While all my brothers screamin'
This is the glory of war
