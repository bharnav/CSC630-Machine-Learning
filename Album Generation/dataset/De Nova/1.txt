These days it seems as though
I've lived a lonely lifetime
All because I never had a girl like you
To hold me tight

And since you came around
And showed your way to me
I'm beginning to think that I'll
Never be blue anymore

Now that you're in my life
You are my brightest day
When you came, you chased my blues away

And you know you're all that I been waitin' on
And all the stars I wish upon
And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
Thank you for lovin' me
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright

Anytime of day
Since I heard you spoe
And you know that you're all
You're the queen of all my dreams

And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
On my knees, it's days like these
When all I see is you and me

These days it seems as though
I've lived a lonely lifetime
All because I never had a girl like you
To hold me tight

And since you came around
And showed your way to me
I'm beginning to think that I'll
Never be blue anymore

Now that you're in my life
You are my brightest day
When you came, you chased my blues away

And you know you're all that I been waitin' on
And all the stars I wish upon
And so I say Thank you for bein' there
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
So thank you for lovin' me (like you did before)
'Cause you and me are gonna be alright
