I need to get away, everyday
All you got to do is play the jukebox player
Come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Well, if you don't mind, anytime
Shakin' up the crowd to the rhythm and rock
I said, come on come on
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Listen to what I mean
Won't you listen to me
'Cause it feels so good
Oh get back on your feet
Break out on the floor
Now I'll come over to ya
And I'll dance some more

Got to get away, everyday
Darlin' don't you listen to a thing we say
I said come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Now you don't feel shy
When you shake it around
'Cause it feels so right
Oh, I'm in this blues
She having a sure great time
Rock and roll
'Cause I'm about to go

Oh we gotta go
Does she know
Everybody waitin' for the place to blow
Come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Got to get away, everyday
Everybody drinkin' while the jukebox's playin'
I said come on come on
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

I'll teach you how to rock and roll
Hey baby girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll
