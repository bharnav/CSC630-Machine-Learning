There's nothing you can do
That isn't in your mind
There's nothing you can do
But try
There's nothing you can say
That isn't what you said
And everything that you say
Is a lie

And it's all up and down with the weather
We was glad to hear you're feeling so much better
Yeah, better late than never

We're just so glad that everyone's back together

There's nothing you can do
That isn't in your mind
There's nothing you can do
But try

And it's all up and down with the weather
We was glad to hear you're feeling so much better
Yeah, better late than never

We're just so glad that everyone's back together
