What's this shit goin' down 'bout the FCC
Gone to war against obscenity
Well, in times like these
You better watch what you say
Watch 'em take your fucking rights away

Darlin' I've been falling down
Darlin' we've been and I'm falling down
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh

Just a shame, just a drag, just the USA
More concerned about the things we say
And the lies they tell
I'll tell you that's what's unjust
What the fuck they've been telling us

Darlin' I've been falling down
Darlin' we've been fallin' down
Don't you take it away
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh

And it's a long way down
And it's a long way down

Here come the witch hunt, black listin' fcc
Callin' out the fucking cavalry
When they come for you
Why don't you come to me?
As you sit through this insanity

Darlin' I've been fallin' down
Darlin' we've been fallin' down

Don't you take it away
Don't you take it away
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh
