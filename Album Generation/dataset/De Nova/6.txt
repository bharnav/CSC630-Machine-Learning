Well you don't want to go to school
It's alright
Oh you're so tired of playing the rules
It's alright
Well I see you coming around here about midnight
Telling me that everything's alright
Well I'm born (and you're born)
And I die (and you die)
And I live (and you live)
To get high, oh my

It's alright
It's alright

He's a man in an awful way
He'll help you everyday
I see the man in an awful way
I'll take you back where you wanna stay
Hey

It's alright
It's alright

Well you don't want to go to school
It's alright
Oh you're so tired of playing the rules
It's alright
Well I've been stuck here on my floor
I cannot move no more
Well I'm born (and you're born)
And I die (and you die)
And I live (and you live)
To get high

It's alright
It's alright

He's a man in an awful way
He'll help you everyday
I see the man in an awful way
I'll take you back where you want to stay

It's alright
It's alright
