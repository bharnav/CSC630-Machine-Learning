Hung up on the way I'm feeling
Hung up on the way
Oh
Hung up on the way I'm feeling
Hung up on the way
Oh

And I said lean on my shoulder
But I told her as she walks away
And though I'm down
I pull it all the away
And I will
And I said I'd like to be there
But I can't get back to where I'm feeling now

Hung up on the way I'm feeling
Hung up on the way
Oh
Hung up on the way I'm feeling
Hung up on the way
Oh

And I said lean on my shoulder
But I told her as she walked away
And I will
I'm spinning 'round
We're spinnng all the way
And I will
And I said I'd like to be there
But I can't get back to where I'm feeling now

And I said I'd like to be there
But I can't get back to where I'm feeling now
