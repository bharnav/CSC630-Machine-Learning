Oh, all the time we spent sitting back
Oh, we had a lot to learn
Cause all along we had our fun
And then it turned
It turned around and
Now we find the love we had
Oh, has slipped away
Oh, sometimes we lose the games we play
What can I say?

Anyway

Oh, build a bridge to bring both sides together
Yeah, build a bridge to bring both sides together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Well
