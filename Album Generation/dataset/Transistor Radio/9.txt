Well I've been pushed to the edge by my headache blues
And I got pulled by the pull of the tide
And I got stripped of my soul, standing in my shoes
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind

Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind

And I've sent signals and signs from the mountainsides
Now I'm gonna try this old microphone light
And now i'm callin' out your name on this radio campaign
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind

Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind

Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
