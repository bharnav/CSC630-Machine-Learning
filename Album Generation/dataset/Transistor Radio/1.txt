To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people walking up and down the graves

Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one step away

To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people breathing the air today

Well one of them is mine
I'm visiting my Fraulein
She's only one breath away

And I say...

Too all the people underground
Listening to a sound
Of the living people living their lives away

Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one life away
She's only one life away
