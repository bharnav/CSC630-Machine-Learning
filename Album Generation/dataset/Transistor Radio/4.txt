My heart is always on the line
I've traveled all kinds of places
The song is always the same
Got lonesome fuel for fire

Got 45s to play at night
Got books to spend with every weekend
The story's always the same
Got lonesome fuel for fire

Fuel for fire, a bitter ending
To a sweet, sweet day
Fuel for fire, the sour note inside
The orchestra wail
Fuel for fire, the uncomfortable pulses
Between famous last words
Fuel for fire, missing persons
In a small, small world

I dug beneath the wall of sound
I ended up back where I started
The song is always the same
Got lonesome fuel for fire

And so my heart is always on the line
I've traveled all kinds of places
The story's always the same
Got lonesome fuel for fire
