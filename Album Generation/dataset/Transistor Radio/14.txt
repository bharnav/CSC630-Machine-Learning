Oh a trance is a spell
With a thrill wrapped up inside it
And try as you might to fight it
Love will get you in the end

And then the sound of a bell
Could sound like angels crying
Or sunlight multiplying
Through Virgin Mary in stained glass

And then a lullaby on Broadway
Could sound like an exile out on main
Oh when that curtain closes
You'll be back in your seat again

And then the band starts the ball
When the chandelier starts glowing
With or without you knowing
Who the partner, what the dance

Oh a trance is a spell
With a thrill wrapped up inside it
And try as you might to fight it
Love will get you in
Love will get you in
Love will get you in
The end
