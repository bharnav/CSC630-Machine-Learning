Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Gone down behind the mountain
And it won't be back till morn

Oh hand me that long distance phone
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Gonna talk to my honey
All night long

Oh, take me back and try me one more time
Oh, take me back and try me one more time
And if I don't do
Then send me down the line
