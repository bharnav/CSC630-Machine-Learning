[Verse 1]
I was just waiting for your phone call
When they came along to say
That a rose done chased you clear away

[Verse 2]
You had said I was gamine
But we didn't mean the same thing I think
Broke my choux pastry heart
Guess life's, no picture post card

[Chorus 1]
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
I don't wanna lose you
Don't even own you
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns yeah

[Verse 3]
I was just waiting for your answer still
You made your own apologies
I cried so much I had to leave

[Chorus 2]
Three for a girl
Four for a boy
Sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
I don't wanna lose you yeah
Don't even own you
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns yeah
