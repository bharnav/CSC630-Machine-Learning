[Verse 1:]
How does it feel being in these arms?
What's it really like to be loved?
I've been alone now, how long?
Have you ever loved the way that i have?
And i have often wondered who
Who could love you the way i do?

[Chorus:]
Now i just want you to know
How i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
And i need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

[Verse 2:]
I've got all this poetry now i didn't know then
I kept inside. guess i had never seen anything beautiful
Till i first saw you asleep at night
And i have often wondered who
Who could love you the way i do?

[Chorus:]
Now i just want you to know
How i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
And i need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

[Verse:]
I just wanted to know what it was like, what's it really like to be loved?
These little volcanoes came as a surprise to me
I never thought i could be this way
And i have been cautious and i've tried to keep to myself, but who could love you the way i do?

[Chorus:]
Now i just want you to know
How i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
So much more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

Now i just want you to know, how i'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you
(And i need you ) need you more each day
If you're still awake
Call me when you get this
