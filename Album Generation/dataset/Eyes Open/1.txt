It's hard to argue when
You won't stop making sense
But my tongue still misbehaves
And it keeps digging my own grave

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
The best thing that I have
Well, it makes it easier
To know exactly what I want

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

Put Sufjan Stevens on
And we'll play your favorite song
"Chicago" bursts to life
And your sweet smile remembers you

My hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right (With my hands open)
Gotta be more than hoping it's right (With my hands open)
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it (With my hands open)
Collapse into me, tired with joy (With my hands open)

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right (With my hands open)
Gotta be more than hoping it's right (With my hands open)
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it (With my hands open)
Collapse into me, tired with joy (With my hands open)
