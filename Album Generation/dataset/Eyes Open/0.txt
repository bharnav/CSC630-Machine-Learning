Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Strain this chaos, turn it into light
I've gotta see you one last night
Before the lions take their share
Leave us in pieces, scattered everywhere

Just give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear 'cause you are all that I have (Ooh)
It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear 'cause you are all that I have (Ooh)

You're cinematic, razor sharp
A welcome arrow through the heart
Under your skin feels like home
Electric shocks on aching bones

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear 'cause you are all that I have (Ooh)
It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear 'cause you are all that I have (Ooh)

There is a darkness deep in you
A frightening magic I cling to

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear 'cause you are all that I have (Ooh)
It's so clear now that you are all that I have (Ooh)
I have no fear now you are all that I have (Ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh...
