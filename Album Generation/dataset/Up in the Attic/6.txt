The cameras picked you out of this place
Now you're rising
Lo and behold! Your smile is fake
How surprising
If we could rewind back to your roots
Admission...
You locked it up and turned the dial
I know the combination

[Chorus]
Lord knows I'm weak
For trusting you
Lord knows I'm weak
To believe in you

Develop the film and there you are
All your glory
Your negative's dark and just like you
What's the story?
I wanna just rip down the walls and your photos around me
Then there will be nothing left to hold
When I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Maybe it's alright
Maybe it's okay
Lord knows I'm weak...

[BRIDGE]
Snap! Take a picture
Cause you won't be seeing me around
No more. Did you ever picture
You and me on the cutting room floor?
I lose my composure every time
You're overexposed and no longer mine
Your red eyes cut me
It's no surprise that I am weak...

[Chorus]
Maybe it's alright
Maybe it's okay
Lord knows I'm weak...
