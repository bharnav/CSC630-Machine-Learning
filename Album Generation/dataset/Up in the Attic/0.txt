Wiping the sleep from my eyes
Waking up to no surprises
The feeling of compromise
Telling you my dear, you don't brighten my day
Step into the water cold
These mornings are getting old
Turning the motor over again and again
I just have to get away
My mother told me that
There would be days like this

And it's true
There's no feelings
Shackled to the sheets that
Bind me to you
No more dreaming

1, 2, 3 Bad Morning

Turning and tossing at night
Falling asleep with my eyes wide
Bad moods are justified
Telling you something I don't feel the same
Step in my dream for a while
The nightmare of every child
Finding the monster under again and again
I just have to get away
My mother told me that
There would be days like this

And it's true
There's no feelings
Shackled to the sheets that
Bind me to you
No more dreaming

I wish I never woke up this morning
I wish I never spoke up today
I have seen better days...

And it's true
There's no feelings
Shackled to the sheets that
Bind me to you
No more dreaming

And it's true
There's no feelings
Shackled to the sheets that
Bind me to you
No more dreaming

1, 2, 3 Bad Morning
