We should have waited
We should have waited
Its alright
We should have waited

Chorus:
We love to break the season
We used to shake the behive
To relax and rewind

We should have waited
Its alright now

See why you cry. see why you save
Your regimen is gunna die
See what you know
Let's see what you throw
Your regimen

Waiting? So
Waiting? I know

Chorus
We love to break the season
We used to shake the behive
To rewind

We should have waited
Its alright now

See why you came. see why you go
Your regimen is oh too slow
See why you cry. get sting from the hive
Your regimen

Waiting? So
Waiting? I know
And I dont mind!

Chorus
We love to break the season
And your the reason
We used to shake the behive
To relax

We love to break the season
And your the reason
We used to shake the behive
And rewind

See! And we dont mind
Are you sane? Are you ashamed?

See! And we dont mind
Are you sane? Are you ashamed?

See! And we dont mind
And we dont mind
And we dont mind

And we dont mind!
We love to break the season
And your the reason
We used to shake the beehive
To relax and rewind
