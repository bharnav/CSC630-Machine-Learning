Dog day afternoon
I can see your face
I know you'll get here soon
And we'll leave this place
I would just lay in the mustard seed
And watch you climb the trees
Look for fool's gold in the scary creek
Splash you, cold, and hear you scream

[Pre-Chorus]
No one's here to see us
I'm kinda liking you too
No one's here to believe us
And I don't wanna share you

[Chorus]
Years gone by and this creek's all dried
Funny little things never work out
Years gone by and this creek's all dry
Funny little things never work out

Monday's came to soon
And you went away
Lord knows I think of you
Every single day
We would just lay in that beat up car
And laugh until we cried
We took our shoes off and went a bit too far
I see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Years gone by and this creek's all dried
Funny little things never work out
Years gone by and this creek's all dry
