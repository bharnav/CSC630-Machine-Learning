Welcome to the state of emergency
Telepathic pace stresses urgency
I use your head to make you feel intruded
Now no one's useful, and you're polluted

(Pre-Chorus)
What did you think when you entered?
How did you feel?
What did you think when you entered?
How did you feel?

(CHORUS)
Ignore the signs around you
So you don't have to leave
There's always room inside this State of Emergency

(spoken) Welcome to the state of emergency!

Welcome to the state of emergency
Realize the fate of this urgency
A manic journey puts you in my hands
How did you get here? You don't quite understand

(Pre-Chorus)

(CHORUS x2)

(BRIDGE)
Maybe you should have got directions
But now you're here and you know my intentions
Walls go up around your head
This ain't the place that you expected
And when all is said and done
The population will all be gone
I know you from your license plate
Don't forget your in my state
Of emergency

(CHORUS x2)
