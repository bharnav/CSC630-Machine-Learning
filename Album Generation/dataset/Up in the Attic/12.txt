This repercussion's messing with your ghost
I feel you through the air now

Wish I could tell you that I miss you most
I miss you most, all the time now
Sleepwalker miss you much
I can almost feel your touch
It's killing me
And I want it
Sleepwalker miss you most
I can almost see your ghost
Scaring me and I'm haunted

You left me nothing but a broken soul
An empty hole, memories bleeding
And all our friends they say to let you go
But they don't know
You're still breathing
Dead or awake, you said you'd always be
Right with me
Asleep or alive you swore you'd never leave
But I can see you

Dead or awake, you said you'd always be
Right with me
Asleep or alive you swore you'd never leave
But I can see you
And all our friends they say to let you go
But they don't know
You're still breathing...
