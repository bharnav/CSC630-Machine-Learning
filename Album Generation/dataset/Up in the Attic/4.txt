Wonderful as it may seem
I've never been alone
Open wide and look closely
This is what I'm shown
I've got friends in this cold city
That won't pick up no slack
I've got friends on every street
That wanna stab my back
Oh, oh, oooh
I've been around the block, oh oh
So many times I forgot my address
So many times I don't know where I live

Terrible as it may be
Don't wanna leave this misery
I've got friends in the highest places
They all got their goals
I've got friends with two faces
But don't have one damn soul
Oh, oh, oooh
I've been around this town, oh oh
I'm so high I will never come down
(But) When I do, I hit the hard ground
I've been around the block, oh oh
So many times I forgot my address
So many times I don't know where I live

Never feel at home

No I don't
I know it's true
I'd leave if not for you
Nowhere else to go
I swear baby
No one's got no soul no more
No on'es got no soul no more...
Oh, oh, oooh
I've been around this town, oh oh
I'm so high I will never come down
(But) When I do, I hit the hard ground
I've been around the block, oh oh
So many times I forgot my address
So many times I don't know where I live
