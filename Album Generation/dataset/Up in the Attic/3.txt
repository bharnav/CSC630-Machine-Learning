Technology won't save you
Or your atmosphere
You carry on like nothing's wrong
But it could happen here
Do you live for love?
Do you live for fear?
It's on the other side of life
But it could happen here

[Chorus]
Maybe too late
Better find some shelter
Maybe it's fate
But it could happen
Will we ever pick up all these pieces?
I look around and all I see is pieces
And if you think that you are free
Don't be so naive

Catastrophes don't phase you
Make you realize
There's more to life than causing strife
To build and enterprise
Do you live for change?
Or do you live for fear?
History can prove this
And it will happen here

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE]
Don't be so naive
(no we never have and we never will)
Don't be so afraid
(no we never have and we never will)
Don't be so naive
(no we never have and we never will)
Don't be so afraid
(no we never have and we never will)

[2nd Half of Chorus]
(Do you live for love?
Do you live for fear?
It's a long way to the bottom
But it could happen here)
