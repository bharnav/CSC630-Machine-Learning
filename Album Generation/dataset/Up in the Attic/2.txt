I've spilling all my guts for this
And every time I miss
I swear it's maddening
I can't feel beyond my fingertips
Under my feet I trip
But am I stopping?

[Chorus]
Please save me
From this relationship
Let me have just what I feel is mine
Lay down
Under the bluest sky
I wanna feel the sun until I'm blind

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So when it comes to you
I'm at a still-stand
Time well spent is getting far and few
Don't know what else to do
It's out of my hands

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE]
Everyone needs a time of rescue
Why do I feel stuck with this?
And maybe ours is overdue
I don't want to leave this mess
There's only one thing left to do
Why do I feel stuck with this?

[Chorus]

[Chorus with BRIDGE as back-up]
