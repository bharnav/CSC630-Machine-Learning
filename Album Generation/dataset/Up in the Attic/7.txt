I used to think that the end was near
But years gone by and I'm still right here
It always seemed like the day would come
To end my trials and tribulations

Now I'm older and wiser...
This could be over in a heartbeat
In the blink of an eye

It's getting closer
To the last time

I used to be such a thief
And wear an ugly disguise
And yes I even believed
In my own alibis

Now I'm older and wiser...
This could be over in a heartbeat
In the blink of an eye

It's getting closer
To the last time

Moving over, getting closer
Moving over (Sorry if things change, sorry if things change)
Getting closer (Sorry if things change, sorry if things change)
Never thought I would leave you dear
Always said I would be right here
Moving over, getting closer...
