This temptation
Proves to be too much
And all the avenues explode, yeah
My situation hard to touch
And you don't want me anymore
And I can't take that anymore

This is my mission statement
Just listen and don't negate it
My woman, tis of thee
Sweet land of you and me

[Chorus]
I don't want your friendship
I'm still wanting more
Why don't we just end it
It's you I can't ignore

This aggravation's got me stuck
And nothing seems to be alright
My imposition's just bad luck
Explosive feelings rage inside
I've got to talk to you tonight

This is our constitution
Just listen without intrusion
My woman, tis of thee
Sweet land of you and me

[Chorus]

[Chorus Fill]
Yeah eplosive feelings rage
I can't move on and I won't contain
How can you just walk away?
The life we had is now erased

[BRIDGE]
It's like I never had her
And it don't matter
It's like I never had her..

This is my mission statment
(listen baby don't negate it)
This is my mission statment
(listen baby don't negate it)

[Chorus]

[substitute last two lines of Chorus Fill for last two original lines of Chorus]
...I threw a rock at window
Missed and hit the light...
