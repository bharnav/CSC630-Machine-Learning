Last time this happened
Thought it wouldn't happen anymore
But that was before
And now once again
As it happens
Well why do I listen anymore
Facing the door
I wonder again

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else
And you can trust in me

Think back and remember
All the disappointments you've been through
Well I felt them too
And all I can say
Is crazy stories
Really shouldn't get the best of you
I want you too
So I wouldn't let them

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else
And you can trust in me

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else with you
(You can trust in me)
Its me

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
(You can trust in me)
You can trust in me.. well

(Isn't it time.. you got the news.. isn't it time)
(Isn't it time.. you got the news.. isn't it time)
