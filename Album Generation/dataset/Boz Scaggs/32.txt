Goodnight Louise
It's lights out for me
It was hot for a minute
We were right down there in it
But hey Lou c'est la vie

Sweet romance
One last dance
I should be moving on
But they're playing our song
I might Louise I just might

What's in a moon one lonely night
What's in a heart that is true
Some would say that means everything
Don't mean a thing without you

So flies love
And stars up above
You were first but not the last
You're the queen of my past
Goodnight Louise.. goodnight

You were first
But not the last
You're the queen of my past
Goodnight.. Louise.. Goodnight
Goodnight
