Winding down the Drury Lane
I fall with the evening rain
My thoughts with the water flow
Like steam rising off the road

Passers-by watch their step
To see that they don't get wet
And I'll just sit beneath this tree
Let the drops fall all over me
And watch the city lights flick on

The crowds collide just out of my reach
The taxi's lights flash up and down the street
I sit and watch the faces go by
I don't wonder where to or why

Cos it's me the rain my warm dark pain
Alone at ease and nowhere at all
My thoughts just drift on back to you
It seems you're here so it must be true
We never parted you never went away

So I order up another glass
Not to let the moment pass
Turning around in love with you
Oh I know you loved me too
And it's always been this way

Here sitting in my wet cafe
I catch a spark across the way
A string of tiny painted bells
Seem to have a tale to tell

A string of tiny painted bells
On someone that I once knew well
Is all that's left
The rest's not true
I smile I see it's really you
The rain will go
And you will too

And I order up another glass
Not to let the moment pass
Turning around in love with you
Oh it got too hard to do
And it's always been this way
Yes it's always been this way
