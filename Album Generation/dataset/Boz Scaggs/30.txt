There is nothing I can do if you leave me here to cry
There is nothing I can do if you leave me here to cry
'Cause my love will follow you as the years go passing by

I'll give you all I own, that's one thing you can't deny
I'll give you all I own, that's one thing you can't deny
But my love will follow you as the years go passing by

I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye
I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, farewell, goodbye
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing by

Yes, my love will follow you as the years go passing by
