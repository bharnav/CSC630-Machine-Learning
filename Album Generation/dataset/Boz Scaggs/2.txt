(I want to be near you) I want to hear what you have to say
(As long as I'm near you) Nothing will seem to pass away
Long as I'm near you, longing to hear you
Long as I'm near you

(I want to believe you) When you say the things you do
(And so I believe you) You make it all appear so true
Glad that I found you, it's good to be around you
Good to be near you

When it comes to making time
Little girl, you sure made mine
You made my day, you made my way to stay

(I want to be near you) You're my all, you're my everything
(As long as I'm near you) There's a song in my heart to sing
The song of your laughter is all that I'm after
I want to be near you

Love is such a happy song
And when love comes along
It's good to be alive, it's good that you arrived on time

(I want to be near you)
I want to be near you, I want to be near you
(As long as I'm near you)
As long as I'm near you, as long as I'm near you

(I want to believe you)
I want to believe you, I want to believe
(And so I believe you)
And so I believe you, and so I believe you

(I want to believe you)
I want to believe you, I want to believe
(As long as I'm near you)
As long as I'm near you, as long as I'm near you
