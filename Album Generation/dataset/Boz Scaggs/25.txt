One day you may find true love
That will last forever and ever
Till then you'll spend
A lifetime wishing one together

You never thought she'd say goodbye
And you'll never understand
The reasons why

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Love plays cruel games
You can't believe
She's found another lover

Does she miss me?
Sometimes you just
Can't help but wonder

No, you can't hold
The hands of time
And you'll always be
The one she left behind

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

And you will never
Understand the reasons why

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

(Heart of mine)
Oh, heart of mine
(Heart of mine)

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Heart of mine
