I have had my eyes on you
Oh, since the day I learned to laugh at myself
Caught you laughing too
Then you went your way, oh, and I went mine
ItÂ´s strange that in another place
That joke should hit me in my face

But you, oh, you make it so hard, baby
To say no, no, no, oh
You, yes, you, baby, make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no

All that glitters is not gold
Just like good jokes get old
That spark that makes you think of me
Don't make things like they used to be

You might say that I have changed
It's just that things are rearranged
And as I once looked out for you
Now it's your turn to see me through

Cause you, oh baby, you make it so hard, girl
To say no, no, no, no
You, oh baby, you make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no

You know I tried to get you out of my mind
But now I'm to the point I find
I just can't leave and not have kissed you
You know I could never resist you

Cause you, oh, you make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no
You, oh, you're making it so hard, baby
To say no, oh, to say no, no, no, no

You are making it so hard
(Girl, you know what you're trying to do)
To say no, no, no, no....
