It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me

I told you
Don't be buying no more rides
Till you got this ticket
You ain't been alive
Oooh it's awful
I did not think I would survive
Got off so fast
Had to kiss my past goodbye

It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me

See you waiting in line there
Till they lead you to the gate
When the nurse arrives
The crowd can hardly wait
Then you blast off crash and it's over
And if you do not survive
Your body's there
But your head does not arrive

It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me
