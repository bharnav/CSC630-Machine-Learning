Taxis lights pull out of sight
Around the lane and into the night
Goodbye this time may be the last

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little

Evening song didn't last long
Dreamed I was right sussed I was wrong
So I make my way through an empty day

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little... this time

Never believed she would leave
I forgot about last time
When she walked out this morning
I went out of my mind

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
I'll try to fight down to the last

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little... this time

Some people live and learn
Never was lucky that way

Wanted so hard to believe her

But other rains will come
And wash it all away
Other loves will come and go
You must believe me when I say
Didn't want it that way

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
Goodbye this time may be the last

Might have to cry
Might have to lie
Might have to die a little

Might have to cry
Did you ever have to lie
Did you ever have to die a little
Whoa whoa did you ever have to cry
You know you have to lie
You know you gotta die just a little... a little
You know you have to die whoa you gotta cry
Whoa you gotta die
