We were always sweethearts
Different in our ways
Together we spent happy hours
And oh happy days
Laughing in the sunshine
And crying in the rain
Together we knew happy days
We never knew no pain... yeah

Cloudy day
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same

I was her man
And she my queen
Together we knew happy days honestly
Lying in the grass
And laying on our butts.. yeah yeah

We were always different
Different in our ways
Together we knew happy hours
And oh happy ways
Lying out together
And never mind the weather
Together we knew happy days
We never had it better.. yeah

Cloudy days
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same
No no no no no
Aaah.. get it

Oh times can be
So hard you'll see
Never never know in stormy weather
Times can be
So hard to be
Never never knowing weÂ´re together... yeah
Mmmm

We were always sweethearts
Different in our ways
Together we spent happy hours
And oh happy days
Laughing in the sunshine
And crying in the rain
Together we knew happy days
We never knew no pain.. yeah

Cloudy days
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same

Na, na, na, na, na na yeah...
Na, na, na, na, na na yeah...
Na, na, na, na, na na yeah....
