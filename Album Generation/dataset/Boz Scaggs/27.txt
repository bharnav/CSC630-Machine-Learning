I've been out here so very long
Lost all of my direction
Baby, when you came my way
Thought I'd found protection

But a strong wind came into my life
Took me, took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
Falling from my eyes

Going down one time
Going down two times
Now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Baby, I depended on you
For our love navigation
Now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you feel my desperation?

I'm in the middle of a love storm
Miles from the shore
I look around and all I can see
Is water coming over me

One time
Going down two times
Now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Listen to me now

I'm in the middle of a love storm
Miles from the shore
I look around and all I can see
Is water coming over me

Been one time
I've been down two times
Right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Going down one time
I've been down two times
Right now I'm worrying
Hey, hey, the sea of love

Listen to the man
There it goes one time
Going down two times y'all
Can't you see the man drowning?
Can you see his desperation?
Drowning, drowning, hey, hey

Can't you see the drowning man?
Drowning right there on dry land
Getting kind of worried
Down in the sea of love

Hey, down one time
Been down two times
Yes, I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
