Listen to me lady
So it's understood
This runnin' round life
Ain't doing me no good
I get tired
Get so tired of paying dues
But it seems there ain't no way around it
No end to runnin' blue

But I like to have my fun
Like to run around
And I ain't no stranger
In nobody's town
But I get tired
Get so tired of changing views
And the road don't get no shorter
Runnin' round and runnin' blue

Well this runnin' round life
Might seem nice and easy
But when you're blowing with the wind
Sometimes it gets real breezy
A man gets tired
I feel like I was born to lose
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue

Got no holes in my pockets
No holes in my shoes
But I don't know if I'm leaving Detroit
Or coming into Baton Rouge
I get tired
So tired of changing views
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue

Left my billfold at the airport
My suitcase on a train
Now I can't find my umbrella
And it sure looks like rain
I get tired
So tired of playing to lose
And the road don't get no shorter
When you got the runnin' blues

Well the night life ain't a good life
But it's my life too
Once you're bound to this highway
Ain't nothing you can do
Except get tired
Oh get tired of paying dues
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue
