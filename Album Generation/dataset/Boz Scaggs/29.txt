Some change comes down for the better
You feel it move
Then some come around like the weather
You take that in too
But like some change in your pocket
Sometimes it seems to be too little too late

I guess it's time to break out a few pesos
Cause I'm getting to where I like the view
And if you're feeling lucky and
You ain't just passing through
You might change some too

There was a time I was lowdown for action
Red hot as a rule
Certified guaranteed satisfaction
One happening fool
And now I know I was missing the boat
Now I know I was missing it by a country mile

Like Noah said you'd better wake up
You don't want to get stuck in this zoo
Cause when he leaves the dock
He ain't waiting round for you
Be prepared to change some too

Some change comes down for the better
You feel it move
Then some come around like the weather
You take that in too
Well well
You take that in too

And if you're feeling lucky
Be prepared to change some too
Mmm hmmm

Yeah well
Alright
Yeah well

Some change...some don't
Yeah well
