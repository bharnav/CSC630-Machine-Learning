Cause of fear is fear itself
Check out your own back yard
Before you check out someone else
Railroad tracks in my neighborhood
Ain't no trains around, that boy just ain't no good

Wanna know what's going down
And the pimp on the corner
Looks like the sharpest cat in town

Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook or the crook
Hot time for cool (hot time for cool)
Look out Jake what you say
What you carrying brother
I hope you're clean cause the man is mean
Don't have another brother

We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load along with mine
Thank you ma'am, mister please
But I must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Like a bird on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing
I can feel the pressure on every side
If you not gonna help, don't hurt, just pass me by

Hercules (Hercules)
Must be must be Hercules (must be must be Hercules)

Jungle rules, can't be no fool
The devil is on the loose, no cool
Got your feet in the sand
Got to be down with the cats around
And you still gotta face that man

Talk about me if you please
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Pitching rocks catching stones
Living, How can I survive, what's going on
Beg, steal, borrow
Somehow I've gotta make it 'til tomorrow
Just like Hercules (just like Hercules)

Thank you ma'am, mister please
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Talk about me
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
