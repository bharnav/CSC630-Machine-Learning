I am down in the sea of confusion
'Neath the waves of no recovery
Swept away by a distant voice calling
Ain't no use in trying to rescue me

I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

I still see you
Reaching out to take your hold on me
Through a crack in the moon
I believed you
But I know this time there ain't no use

I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into a cell of no return
No way to rescue me

Falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me
