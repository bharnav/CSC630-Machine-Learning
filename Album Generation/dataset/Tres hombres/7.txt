Rumor spreadin' a-'round in that Texas town
'bout that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talkin' about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls ah

Have mercy
A-how how how how

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
And the ten to get yourself in
A hmm, hmm
And I hear it's tight most ev'ry night
But now I might be mistaken
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Ah have mercy

[Instrumental]
