[Verse 1]
When I hear that Santa Fe start blowing
I wonder where it's been and where it's going

[Chorus 1]
I tell you, boy, every time the feeling sure is fine
Just move me on down the line[x2]

[Verse 2]
Then I heard Red Rooster start his crowing
Around the curve that cloud of smoke was blowing

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I'll be where the big wheels keep on turning
And the diesel drivers keep them engines burning

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x4]
Move me on down the line
Move me on down
