[Chorus]
Hot, blue and righteous
An angel called me aside

[Verse]
Hot, blue and righteous
Said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guide tonight"
I heard the words as I closed my eyes
Down on my, down on my bended knees
It fit like a glove and I realized
Something good's happening to me

[Chorus]
Hot, blue and righteous
Angel called me aside
