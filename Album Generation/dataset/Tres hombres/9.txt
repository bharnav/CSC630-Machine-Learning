Have you heard about Jo Ti Mahr?
Yeah yeah yeah
Well, then you could not be lost
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse]
Which way are you coming from?
Going up or getting down?
Well, have you thought about it some
Or have you put it down?

[Chorus]
Have you heard about Heaven?
Yeah yeah yeah?
Seven come eleven
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Have you heard, dear brother?
Yeah yeah yeah
Well, let's help one another
Yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
Have you heard? Oh yeah[x3]
