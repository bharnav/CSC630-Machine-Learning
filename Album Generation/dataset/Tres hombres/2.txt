[Verse 1]
And if you see me walking down the line
With my favorite honky tonk in mind
Well, I'll be here around supper time
With my can of dinner and a bunch of wine

[Chorus]
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yea
Uh huh huh, baby, don't you want to come with me?

[Verse 2]
And the crowd gets loud when the band gets right
Steel guitar crying through the night
Yea, trying to cover up the corner fight
But everything's cool because they just tight

[Chorus]
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yea
Huh, baby, don't you want to come with me?
Aah, play it boy

[Verse 3]
The joint was jumping like a cat on hot tin
Lord, I thought the floor was gonna give in
Sounding a lot like they got House Congressional
Because we're experimental and professional

[Chorus]
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yea
Well, baby, don't you want to come with me?
