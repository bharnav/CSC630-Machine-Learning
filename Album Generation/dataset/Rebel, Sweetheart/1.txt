[Verse 1]
Permission now to let this thing land
I'm too far gone to know where I am
Conditions are worse than we planned
Permission now to let this thing land

[Chorus 1]
Oh, heading straight into the blackness
Beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

[Verse 2]
Now Adam took the apple, I was not involved
I'm not responsible for how lost we are
Batten down the hatches, extinction calls
Yeah, but Adam took the apple, was not involved

[Chorus 1]
Oh, heading straight into the blackness
Way beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

[Bridge]
Maybe a rumble
Maybe nothing more
Maybe a thunder
There before she blows
Maybe not a big bang
But just a little white noise

[Verse 3]
Into the furnace of red twilight
Threading like a needle through searchlights
Fading further and spinning right
Into the furnace of red twilight

[Chorus 2]
Oh, heading straight into the blackness
Too far gone, now there's no coming back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards

[Chorus 1]
Oh, heading straight into the blackness
Beyond the point of ever turning back
Slipping off the radar through a hole in space
Goes the passenger sitting backwards (passenger sitting backwards)
