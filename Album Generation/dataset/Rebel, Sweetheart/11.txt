[Verse 1]
A new heaven over a brand new sky
A new breed of wonder on the vine
Now, among the living (among the living)
There is new promise in this night

[Verse 2]
There's new arms to hold back the revolution
There's new eyes to recognize what you've become
Blood to recover (blood to recover)
A new will to honor all God's creations

[Chorus]
All things are new again (within and without)
Well, all things are new again

[Verse 3]
A new shepherd roaming through the tall grass
A new temple rising through the fallen ash
That buries the tracks (buries the tracks)
Of millions of boots marching in packs

[Verse 4]
Where clear water rolling through the dam's collapse
Out to the harbor where they're sailing back
New flag on the mast (new flag on the mast)
Without any secrets
Without any past

[Chorus]
All things are new again
Within and without
Sooner or later the ending begins
Just then it can be said that all things are new again

[Bridge]
There's new ghosts returning to the earth beneath the haze
There's new poets burning through the lines of every page
I'm an unpainted portrait
I am staring at a new sunset
Without any memories yet

[Chorus]
All things are new again (within and without)
Sooner or later the ending begins
Just then it can be said that all things are new again (within and without)
Sooner or later every season ends
Then forever it can be said that all things are new again
