[Verse 1]
A quarter moon on a city growing thick
With good advice that won't stick
From the ballrooms to the suburbs and the abandoned mines
Atlantis may be rising but we're all outta time
Oh, colored lights on the fire escape
And bodies move behind drapes
And the light is uneven and we're safer in pairs
We're no match for what is waiting for each of us out there

[Chorus 1]
Whistle, baby, while we walk
Now, don't say anything
Do not talk
The journey is over
It is time to exhale
Wherever we were going
We're already there

[Verse 2]
It's over the turnstiles
And through the guardrails
And into Washington Square
Oh, 'cause no amount of nightmares could ever compare
To the thought of only silence in this ghost-filled air

[Chorus 2]
Whistle, baby, while we walk
Now, don't say anything
Do not talk
The journey is over
It's too late to prepare
Why can't you see that baby
We're already there

[Verse 3]
Here comes your silhouette and more pillow talk
Here comes the ticking of these clocks
They say the quickest way to end a war is just to lose
Another chamber locks and I already withdrew
Here comes the booming and the hunger of each night
Here comes the burden of might
Now this day was not divinely made to leave you impressed
We may become someone someday but we haven't yet

[Chorus 3]
Whistle, baby, while we walk
Now, don't say anything
Do not talk
The journey is over
It is time to repair
Whatever we were building
Baby, we're already there

[Outro]
We're already there
We're already there
We're already there
