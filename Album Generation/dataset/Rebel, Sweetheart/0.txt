[Verse 1]
Cherry picking through the stars and falling cannonballs
Waiting for the break of dawn to start its morning crawl
Polluted rays of filtered light
Tropical and warm
Making shadows through the snow-white resin-covered skulls

[Pre-Chorus]
Happy birthday to the war

[Chorus 1]
Standing by the wall
A rainbow made of stars
Under seven different shades of gray spreading out across the arc
Days of wonder spent
Out there killing time
This may not leave a mark on me
But I sure as hell was there

[Verse 2]
Caravanning on the moonlit locust-covered trail
We came out like a stream of bats
Exploding from the well
Slipping through the whirlpools of trees and floating cars
Behind a winter coated mule down
A record breaking falls
Into oblivion's open jaws

[Chorus 1]
Standing by the wall
A rainbow made of stars
Under seven different shades of gray spreading out across the arc
Days of wonder spent
Out there killing time
This may not leave a mark on me
But I sure as hell was there

[Pre-Chorus]
Happy birthday to the war

[Chorus 2]
Days of wonder stand
A rainbow made of stars
Under seven different shades of gray spreading out across the arc
Standing by the wall
Out there killing time
This may not leave a mark on me
But I sure as hell was there

[Verse 3]
I'm educated under God
To walk a neutral line
Now give me neither poverty nor riches in my time
Take my body and my mind
My heart is far behind
With one dozen poems in my ears
Ricocheting wild
(Days of wonder)

[Outro]
(Days of wonder)
Take my body and my mind
My heart is far behind
(Days of wonder)
My heart is far behind
(Days of wonder)
(Days of wonder)
(Days of wonder)
