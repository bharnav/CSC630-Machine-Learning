[Verse 1]
Here comes your drunken marionette
Dragging his mess of threads
There at the bar pulling smoke to his lungs
He says, who will ignore me when you're gone?
Now come on, lift me up
Well, I wanna dance by your tin cup
Your tower of beauty with a split in your tongue
Who will ignore me when you're gone?
He says, who will ignore me when you're gone?

[Chorus 1]
Here he comes
Here he comes
He's still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
With the drunken marionette

[Verse 2]
Been mainlining bad thoughts
Been drinking things I wish I'd not
Intoxicated with sad songs
Who will forgive you when I'm gone?
They sing Auld Lang Syne
I've got mutiny on my mind
A guilty conscience means at least you've got one
Who will forgive you when I'm gone?
He says, who will forgive you when I'm gone?

[Chorus 2]
Here he comes
Here he comes
He's still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
He's waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet
For the drunken marionette

[Bridge]
Now carry on
And turn the lights low when you go
In the hours left
I hope you feel the things that I know I won't

[Verse 3]
What you give is what you get
These days I'm worried 'bout your debts
Who carries evil out evil will come
Who will defend you when I'm gone?
He says: who will defend you when I'm gone?

[Chorus 3]
Here he comes
Here he comes
He's still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
He's waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet
Now, here he comes
Here he comes
He's still the wooden heart
That wouldn't ever part
He's waiting on a spark
That hasn't happened yet
For the drunken marionette
