[Verse 1]
Now, tomorrow is gonna make you cry
It's gonna make you kneel
Before it breaks you from inside
Still pressing on, arm over arm
Still trying to get both feet back onto the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
They are harvesting these fields in autumn
We're different now than when we started

[Chorus 1]
I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby

[Verse 2]
There on the pavement, underneath the yellow moon
I think of you and just how easily we bruise
The folded address in my pocket, I have stopped
Trying to believe for you that the bottom didn't drop

[Pre-Chorus]
I am on the platform, covered with dust
I pray they take the both of us, and

[Chorus 2]
I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby
And I am ready to come down
You'll see us both somehow (see us both somehow)
On the beautiful side of somewhere, someday (somewhere, someday)
(Beautiful side of somewhere)

[Verse 3]
I am lighting matches for the rescue
Some are candles, some are fuses
Acting on my best behavior
Switching over every breaker

[Pre-Chorus]
As we're plowing through these laws of nature
Disregarding every acre
I'm lying in my Sunday best
Assuming this was not a test, and

[Chorus 2]
I am ready to wake up
There in the exodus
On the beautiful side of somewhere, baby
And I am ready to come down
You'll see us both somehow (see us both somehow)
On the beautiful side of somewhere, someday (somewhere, someday)
(Beautiful side of somewhere)
