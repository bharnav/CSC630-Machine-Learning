[Verse 1]
Seems like the world's gone underground
No gods or heroes dare to go down
As teardrops from a hole in heaven come
Overhead like ravens dropping down like bombs

[Refrain]
Now through the morning's silver frosted glow
Well, God says nothing back but I told you so
I told you so

[Verse 2]
Now God bless the void of my daydreams
Head back in the snow making angel wings
As slow motion dancing lights of dawn
Sail beneath a burning yellow sun

[Refrain]
I'm calling out from the deep ends of my bones
Now, time says nothing back but I told you so
I told you so

[Verse 3]
The still waters rising in my mind
Black and deep, smoke behind my eyes
Now, last night I could not sleep at all
I hallucinated that you were in my arms

[Refrain]
To be in your heart I failed my own
Now, love says nothing back but I told you so
I told you so

[Verse 4]
I'm still here re-climbing every rung
Now, someone saw something
Now, someone speak up
Back over the rotted bridge I cross
Open up these graves, let these bodies talk

[Refrain]
Buried under leaves blood-red and gold
Well, death says nothing back but I told you so
I told you so

[Instrumental]
