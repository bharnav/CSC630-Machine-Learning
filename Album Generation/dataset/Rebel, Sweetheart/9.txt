[Verse 1]
Now last night I dreamt one thousand lines
I could see the dawn through a different set of eyes
There in my slumber passing time
Long live the world resting on its side
I walked the orchard with you
Your hand in mine
In the evergreens drinking wine
I saw the snow falling black and white from the auburn sky

[Refrain]
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived

[Verse 2]
Up through the earth at dawn I came
I crossed the kingdom through venom pouring rain
When the vacuum of my own brigade
Resurrected to make you mine again
Orpheus looked back once
She sailed the underworld
No second chances will be earned
I have returned as a phantom now to walk the bow and stern

[Refrain]
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived

[Bridge]
If we could do better I know that we would
Maybe admit it now, we're not that good
We keep the needle between zero and one
You play your fiddle, baby, I'll play dumb

[Verse 3]
Into the pastures of our minds
Goes my nearly beloved and I
Blazing two parallel white lines
Through this broken heart split open wide
Time may be on my side but it's mostly far behind
I was the apple of your eye
Now I'm the boy spinning on a wheel that's stuck with knives

[Refrain]
Last night I lived more than one thousand lives
Not one of them survived
