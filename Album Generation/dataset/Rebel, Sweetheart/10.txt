[Verse 1]
You'd have a wonderful day
If you could see how lucky you are
Now, don't get carried away with your heart
You're better where you are

[Verse 2]
You're not the only one
Who's failed to hang on to a moving star
Now, don't be sorry
What's done now is done
And this is who you are

[Verse 3]
These days feel numbered and long
There's no one to speak of
There's no one at all
But you're not the reason that everyone's gone
That's not how they are

[Verse 4]
There is no system to change
No conditions are made
No permissions to start
Now don't go drawing lines in the sand
That's not who you are

[Bridge]
Sometimes a high wall is just a wall
Sometimes it's only there to make sure you feel small
But may be there to save you from the depths of a much deeper fall

[Verse 5]
The truth will not set you free
It's okay to believe that you're not good enough
God is not angry, not blind, deaf, or dumb
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come
