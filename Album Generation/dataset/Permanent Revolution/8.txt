Push me as far as you can, far away from yourselves
But keep these words of mine in mind when it's your time
I'm not the first and I won't be the last I assure you
It won't be long before they're knocking at your door

(Chorus)(x2)
You're fighting a war now, a war over nothing
A war that you're fighting with yourselves
And you know it's a war that you can't win

You have been feeding the monsters
Without even knowing, that our futures
Were the price that we would pay
Now they are breeding the next generation of killers
Without heart, without soul and without mind

You're fighting a war now, a war over nothing
A war that you're fighting with yourselves
And you know it's a war that you can't win
