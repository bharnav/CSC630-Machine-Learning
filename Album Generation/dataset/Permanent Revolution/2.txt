Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

I can feel the world's desire as it's heart is set afire
Let it burn as it beats and we'll never be defeated
If we say that it will happen and we know that it will happen
It will happen just the same. And we'll be here to lead it

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

If the government can't fight it they will only try to hide it;
But we're looking in their eyes, through their moderate disguises
Let the new will of the people overcome this evil
The stage is set for battle as the curtain slowly rises

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Anyone can be another flower on the wall
Stay true to principle and give your all for all!

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going...

Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives
