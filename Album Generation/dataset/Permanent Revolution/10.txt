(Two, Three, Four)
Why would a man who believed in no god
Sacrifice all he had
To kill or be killed in pursuit of a cause
Was the fate that called to him

And you can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less than all you can would be a waste

There's only one way to truly succeed
And it's not through intervention
To influence the minds of the rest of mankind
Will best serve your intentions

And you can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less than all you can would be a waste

If you just can't make the world what you want
At least you can make yourself
An example for others to learn from and see
The future for themselves...

And you can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less than all you can would be a waste
