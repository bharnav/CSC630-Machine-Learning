[Chorus 1]
So I submit you've failed us twice
Once is for your brothers
One is for your brothers and the second's for your sons

[Verse 1]
Isolation, mis-education; and for the very clever there is looming liquidation
You put the light of Socialism high up on a shelf
And in effect prevented it from spreading somewhere else

[Chorus 2]
What have you done? What do you say to those who've died along the way?
Should you tell them that they've died in vain?
Now is when we should all be moving forward, but instead you're falling back
Don't stop now when we're almost up the mountain, though the view here might seem nice

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Expatriate one hundred and then shoot a thousand more
Expel the opposition to your centrist Thermidor!
The rudeness and disloyalty about which Lenin wrote
Have now become the cords that are wrapped around your throats

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
