Hardships faced. We've been disgraced
Our plans for the land are degraded by menacing hands
But history's compelling us, telling us to do it all again
As far as I can see, everything that we had believed
Is more true now than ever before
If the truth be known, we would do it all again

We got low, down in Mexico
It seems so far after having been so close
We got low, down in Mexico
We lost everything except the things that matter most

Bureaucracy and hypocrisy are contagious and make us all victims eventually
You can take my life from me, but we will do it all again
The seeds of truth will grow
The people will know of the visions that we have endeavored to show
And like the river we will flow
We Will do it all again

Faceless men who represent no idea or purpose intend
To prevent revolution though revolution
But we could do it all again
Even when I die, I hope you won't cry
For my life has been happily spent in the struggle...
And I love you so I would do it all again
