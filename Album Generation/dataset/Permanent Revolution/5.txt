Goodbye my friend and mentor, we'll never see a man quite like you again
In an age of revolution, restitution we sought
You were the spark we were the fuel and we burned bright as the sun
Those were the days we could have fought anyone anywhere on anything
And after all these years how could we try, should we try to follow someone else?

I can see the shadows on the foothills east of here;
Stormy clouds and thunder in my heart
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold

Push push push until we get just what we want, we always
Push push push 'til we can get them what they need
We can take the lives of others so that all may truly live
But the will to truly live.. is something I can't give to them

I can see the shadows on the foothills east of here;
Stormy clouds and thunder in my heart
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold

Staring at the pieces of my dim reflection as I look into this Black Sea of atrophy
I just got the message of your passing from the man who digs our-
They are digging graves for all our dreams and it seems that they are digging by the clock
I can feel the old corruption peering from the crack, and I don't know if we can fight it back again

I can see the shadows on the foothills east of here;
Stormy clouds and thunder in my heart
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold
We're on this train to nowhere and I don't know if we'll make it back again
Because the fire's burning low and the wind is blowing mighty cold
