[Verse 1]
Some may want to say that we're killers
But we do what we must and we feel we are just
Cutting off the head of the imperial serpent
Taking back the land for the hands that have worked it

[Chorus]
Critics cry of bloody days
But people still die anyway
The ones who understand their roles
Can help us save the world

History has afforded us this opportune occasion
To form a new foundation
You must first tear down the walls

Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

[Verse 2]
Some may want to say that we're heartless
That we're staking our claim for political gain
But they don't see the power we've harnessed
With the masses united, it's pointless to fight it

[Chorus x2]
