[Chorus 1]
Don't forget how we got here
We've built this on the backs of the unrewarded
They saved their sacrifice and died a fruitless death
So with my dying breath I beseech you, soldiers
Don't lose your nerve as you get older
The battle that you fight today is the most important

[Verse 1]
Though their numbers seemed so strong that winter afternoon
Before the end they all stood on their own
Don't make the mistake of ideological compromises
Consensus won't do you justice
Your passion for your cause does all the talking

[Chorus 2]
Men without conscience will deceive your mind
But not your heart-unless you let them
The struggle will go on as long as you keep fighting
Just don't forget how we got here

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
The Decembrists' struggle of so many years ago
Was a battle to convince themselves the cause they chose was worthy of their blood
When faced with odds they didn't like they stood and paused in indecision
Our hearts and dreams sank faster than the sun

[Chorus 2, Chorus 1, Chorus 2]
