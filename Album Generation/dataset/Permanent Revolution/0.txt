A hero was born of a movement from the not so distant past
He and others like him felt the world was changing fast
So, they embarked on a journey with their very best intentions
And thought that what began with them would never find an end

[Chorus}
Ready, set, go, it's easy you know
It's easy to get wrapped up in the madness
Ready or not, it's all that they got
And so it goes

Suspend your disbelief in revolution
Their solutions were a way for them to change the world they lived in
The rich stay rich, the poor got even poorer
And the world engulfed in war, only added to the horror

Unlike the more moderate movements that proceeded theirs
They were absolutely unconcerned with splitting hairs
But they fought for the rights and belief that
They might even change the human race
But global revolution never seemed to show its face

[Chorus]
Ready, set, go, it's easy you know
It's easy to get wrapped up in the madness
Ready or not, it's all that they got
And so it goes

Suspend your disbelief in revolution
Their solutions were a way for them to change the world they lived in
The rich stay rich, the poor got even poorer
And the world engulfed in war, only added to the horror
