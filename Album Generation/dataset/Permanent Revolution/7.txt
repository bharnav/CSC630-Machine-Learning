A man came by this evening, dancing like a puppet on his strings
He spoke of engineering. It's obvious he'd never built a thing
I had to smile and think a while
I finally shook my head and said
"Men like you can't build your peace."

His personality, while charming, still betrayed an air of confidence
Inconsistent with criminal political dissent
I had to smile and think awhile
I finally shook my head and said
"Men like you can't fake your peace."

A man came by this evening, we spoke about my future in this place
He asked if the party and the opposition could ever reconcile
I had to smile and think awhile
I finally shook my head and said
"Men like you can't make your peace."
