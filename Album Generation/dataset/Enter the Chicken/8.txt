[Verse]
Three fingers on a swollen hand
Beside a dented garbage can
A blind man staring at something only he can see
I spotted him like night sky, plotted and star struck
Sits at alone, eats at home
Rafted in a sea of blackness

Three fingers on a swollen hand
Beside a dented garbage can
A blind man staring at something only he can see
I spotted him like night sky, plotted and star struck
Sits at alone, eats at home
Rafted in a sea of blackness

He rattles his cup just enough to call your bluff
You can't pretend you didn't see him
Catch his smile in the rear view
Out of the blue his guitar entering hard
With three fingers he plays
Praise what he says might scare you

[Chorus 1]
You better lie!
You better lie!
You better lie!
You better lie!

[Verse]
Three fingers on a swollen hand
Beside a dented garbage can
A blind man staring at something only he can see
I spotted him like night sky, plotted and star struck
Sits at alone, eats at home
Rafted in a sea of blackness

He rattles his cup just enough to call your bluff
You can't pretend you didn't see him
Catch his smile in the rear view
Out of the blue his guitar entering hard
With three fingers he plays
Praise what he says might scare you

[Interlude]
(Get that thing right from [?])
I will kill you, I will kill you
You know I'm ill, you better not cross me

[Solo/Chorus 2]
You better lie!
You better not cross me now
Better not cross me, oh no no no
No no no, don't cross me

[Bridge]
Don't cross me, don't cross your heart and hope
Or dream, or fear, or brain, I say
I see through you, I can see
You better, better not [?]
You better not cross the street in front of me, boy

[Verse]
Three fingers on a swollen hand
Beside a dented garbage can
A blind man staring at something only he can see
I spotted him like night sky, plotted and star struck
Sits at alone, eats at home
Rafted in a sea of blackness

He rattles his cup just enough to call your bluff
You can't pretend you didn't see him
Catch his smile in the rear view
Out of the blue his guitar entering hard
With three fingers he plays
Praise what he says might scare you

With three fingers he plays
Praise what he says might scare you
What he says might scare you
