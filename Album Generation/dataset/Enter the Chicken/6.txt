[Verse 1: Shana Halligan]
I talked to you today
About all the troubled times
When nothing goes
Nothing goes away
And all the things
You've told me to believe in
I'm alone
In my reveries
I'm alone
In the pain you brought on
I'm afraid
That you won't see me
And all the times we've had

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I've been waiting here
Waiting by the phone
I've been touching you
In my only thoughts
Don't you know
That I'm still here
Waiting for you to
Call me into your
Life insincere

[Chorus: Shana Halligan, Serj Tankian]
Left your stormy days
Don't you know you're mine?
You see it all behind
Don't you see the sky?
I want us all together
Do you know we're right?
You leave us all denied
Let you all decide

[Verse 2: Shana Halligan]
You call me today
With your enemies
You call me today
With your infinite dreams
We talked about it
You're in my mind
Digging caution
Leaving you behind
Taking caution, leaving you behind

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I've been waiting here
Waiting by the phone
I've been touching you
In my only thoughts
Don't you know
That I'm still here
Waiting for you to
Call me into your
Life insincere

[Chorus: Shana Halligan, Serj Tankian]
Left your own today
Don't you know you're mine?
Left your own behind
Can't you see the sky?
It's a stormy day
Don't you understand?
We're in all behind
Let you all defend

[Build-up: Shana Halligan, Serj Tankian]
Ah ah ah ah

[Bridge: Shana Halligan]
Take compassion
Take compassion
Take compassion
Take compassion
Leaving you behind

[Chorus: Shana Halligan, Serj Tankian]
Left your own today
Don't you know you're mine?
Left your own behind?
Can't you see the sky?
See them fall behind
Don't you know you're mine?
Left it all behind
Can't you do the same?
But can't you do the same?
Left your own behind
Leave us all behind
Can't you do the same?
