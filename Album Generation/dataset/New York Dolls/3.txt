It's hard
It's so hard

And it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from from the other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, you pick me up
Your out a-drivin' in your car
When I tell you where I'm goin'
You're always tellin' me it's to far

But how could you be drivin'
Down by my home
When y'know, I ain't got one
And I'm, I'm so all alone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin', baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's so lonely

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, can't you hear me callin'
I'm a thousand miles away
And I don't wanna stay
I'm thinkin' words I gotta say

'Cause I wanna be there witcha
And I know what to bring
I remember from the days
You got over everything

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin'
Can't y'see I'm dyin'
Baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Now you are lonely
