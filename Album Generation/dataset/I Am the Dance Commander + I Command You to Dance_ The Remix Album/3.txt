[Verse 1]
I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
And I am
I am starstruck with every part of this whole story

[Pre-Chorus]
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside
Let it live and die
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside
Let it live and die

[Chorus]
This is our last chance, give me your hand
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't want the concrete
I am alive
Comes with the tragic

[Pre-Chorus]
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside
Let it live and die

[Chorus]
This is our last chance, give me your hand
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die, oh
This is our last chance, give me your hand
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die, oh

[Outro]
Love
