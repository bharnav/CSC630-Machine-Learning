One man remains
And the stars seem to change
Far beyond our universe tonight

And the cries of the brave
And the skies filled with pain
For the silent ones we pray for all tonight

New dawn rising
Destruction and pain
Long days passing
The fear of the rain

Soldiers fighting on
The price they will pay
Nuclear meltdown
The world uncertain

For the power of the tragedy of man's creation
Rise from the suffering for our salvation
Fearless we stand
Strong 'til the end
At the trial of all our lives
Now say your final goodbyes

Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the hero stands, still blinding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

♪ [SOLOS]

Skies now blackened
The night turns to day
Nations fearful of global decay
Fires still raging on
In vain now we pray
Nuclear fire
The fortunes fading

As we stand at the edge of barren desolation
Fight for the future of our generation
Fearless we stand
Brave we defend
For a thousand years gone by
Now say our final goodbyes

Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the hero stands, still blinding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

♪ [SOLOS]

Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the hero stands, still blinding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

And the fate of the world in our hands
Rise again until the end of time
Until the last man stands for all mankind
