Outside of this world there's a life force still burning
Outside of this land there's a star shining free

In silence we stand on a golden horizon calling
This time there's a light for us
Still shining so bright for us again

Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and a life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise

Through the fires of hell between us, through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside beneath the sadness of our screams

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Cast aside this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of all creation now to save our lives
Fires of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain we'll tear the blazing skies

From the wastelands of destruction, with the fire we hold inside
Rise again still glorious for the power of all mankind

Through the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom

(solos: Herman/Sam/Fred)

Through the trials of fire behind us, in the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside within the memories of our lives

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom
