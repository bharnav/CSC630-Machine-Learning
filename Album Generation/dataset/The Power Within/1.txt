Soldiers of fire
Rage of the universe
Cold steel and bloodshed in a lost barren wasteland

Fear rising higher
Rage of the winter war
Death calls at nightfall our hatred still burns as we

March through endless skies
Mankind will fall death will arise

For a lifetime we fight without reason
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world

Flames burning higher
Curse of the winter land
Black torn and twisted in the fast fading twilight

Storm winds still blowing
Steel shapes our destiny
Death calls at nightfall our curse will be lighted

Disguise this timeless crime
Brave men will fall, evil will rise

For a lifetime we fight without reason
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world

Still heroes we're born with promises so blind
The light at the end of the road that we all must climb
