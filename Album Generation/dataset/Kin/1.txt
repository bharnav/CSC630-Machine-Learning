[Verse 1]
Give up, let down
Can't believe what I found
Keep quiet, be silent, these words from your mouth
Build up from ground
Wipe clean of your frowns
Turn around before we run aground

[Chorus 1]
One more wrong (Come back)
Costs you all (Come back)
Sticks like glue
Obstructs my view

[Verse 2]
Speak up, adapt
Watch closely, keep track
Streamlined, live by the rules applied
Thin line to walk
No time to stop
(This life, you glorify a waste of time)

[Verse 3]
Give up, let down
Can't believe what I found, found, found
Keep quiet, be silent, these words from your mouth
Build up from ground
Wipe clean of your frowns, frowns, frowns
Turn around before we run aground

[Chorus 2]
One more fault
Costs you all

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Until I'm through
