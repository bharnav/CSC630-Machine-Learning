[Verse 1]
Emptied one
At a single draft alone
Drain this ruin
The farthest one can come too close

[Verse 2]
Life could be better if I let me in
What is to hold onto?
But I force myself towards departing
Leaving is what you do

[Chorus 1]
I had to make dirty in this soil
I had to be the rascal taking all
I wanted us to live in times of bliss
I couldn't evoke the memories I have missed

[Verse 3]
Left this one
Abandoned my ideals for what?
Want to be just like you
Moulded like
I'm shaped in size with anyone
Standing in line right next to everyone just like you

[Chorus 1]
I had to make dirty in this soil
I had to be the rascal taking all
I wanted us to live in times of bliss
I couldn't evoke the memories I have missed

[Chorus 2]
Shut your eyes fast and all goes blank
And channel the vision, feel the scent of
Someone who dares to lose it all
And someone who's ready to take the fall for it

[Bridge]
Shut your eyes and all will be lost

[Outro]
I'm taking all, I'm taking all
I'm taking all, I'm taking all, as a rascal taking all
I'm taking all
As a rascal taking all, I'm taking all, as a rascal taking all
I'm taking all, I'm taking all
I'm taking all, as a rascal taking all
As a rascal taking all, I'm taking all
As a rascal taking all, I'm taking all, as a rascal taking all
