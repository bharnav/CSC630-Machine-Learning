[Verse 1]
Moving closer now
Your hand just knocked me off my feet
Yeah, like a puppet now
I cannot move to my own beat

[Chorus 1]
But I can dance tonight
I'll make up songs for us to sing
You hold my heart with cotton string
And to your rhythm I will shout
My love for play

[Interlude - Vocalisations]

[Verse 2]
Take off your hat
And pull a rabbit out for me
I'm like a lackey now
I'll lay on my back, get on my knees
I'll lay on my back, get on my, my, my, my, my

[Bridge]
So I will dance now, dance now
Dance now, dance now
Dance now, dance now
Dance now, dance now

[Chorus 2]
But I can dance tonight
Dance now
I'll make up songs for us to sing
Dance now, dance now
But I can dance
You hold my heart with cotton string
Dance now, dance now
I'll make up songs to sing
And to your rhythm I will shout
Dance now, dance now
My love for play
Dance now

[Interlude - Vocalisations]

[Outro]
Dance now, dance now
Dance now, dance now
