[Verse 1]
Where are you my long lost love
It feels like yesterday us parting
I held you closest to my thrusting heart
Now the withdrawal seems to be starting

[Verse 2]
Youâ€™re not like anyone I've known
With you I flourish into greatness
Extend my arms into immense delight
Making my future vast and weightless

[Chorus]
Quite an undertaking
All fair promises
I stopped hearing you grow
Quite an understatement
And harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

[Post-Chorus]
I should have kept you safe
Shielded from our trojan war

[Verse 3]
Where are you my partisan
The last I saw of you was sinking
Into a giant hole of nothingness
As my desire started shrinking

[Verse 4]
Or if I choose to take you back
If you can swallow all that pride
If I stand up for my believing
If you can still be what I lack
Can we make up for all the joy we lack
Where is the passion you were bringing?
Can we start giving and receiving
What is the purpose of me giving?

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Quite an undertaking
All fair promises
I stopped hearing you grow
Quite an understatement
And harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

[Bridge]
Emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti
Emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti, emas eht s'ti

[Outro]
Where are you my long lost love
It feels like yesterday us parting
