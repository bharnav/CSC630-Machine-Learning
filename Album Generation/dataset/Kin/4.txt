[Chorus]
We don't ask for anything
Your lives could have been unaffected
We don't ask you to give all
It won't make us more than what is reflected

[Verse]
Can you see the scar in the perfect sky?
And the hills align with a crooked smile?
Oh, oh why?

[Chorus]
We don't ask for anything
Your lives could have been unaffected
(We don't ask you to give all)
We don't ask you to give all
It won't make us more than what is reflected
