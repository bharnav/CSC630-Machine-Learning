[Verse 1]
You make a neat and tidy house
A good worker does
A pinion of labour's men
As capable as trust

[Chorus]
From a lower point of view
Comes the underlying truth
Keeping yourself unaware
Comforting we know you care
Locking out your inner man
Recognising time is plans
Ready for some further use
Denial is a virtue

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I make a good and steady friend
A companion through life
But who am I, when all I am
Is your designated wife?

[Chorus]
From a lower point of view
Comes the underlying truth
Keeping yourself unaware
Comforting we know you care
Locking out your inner man
Recognising time is plans
Ready for some further use
Denial is a virtue

[Chorus]
From a lower point of view
Comes the underlying truth
Keeping yourself unaware
Comforting we know you care
Locking out your inner man
Recognising time is plans
Ready for some further use
Denial is a virtue

[Outro]
Sadly, I have not defined where you're taking me
