[Verse 1]
I come bearing legacy
That we caused jointly in our dawning land
I come with delivery
And I have wrapped it in my mourning band

[Verse 2]
I bring you my history
That I expect your tender arms around
Give it love and think of me
These are the letters from our compound

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We see the dawning of novelty
Dawning of novelty
Where we embrace the grand of subtlety
Embrace the, the subtlety
Time finally caught up with me
Finally caught up with me
A mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive
Fleeing fugitive

[Refrain]
Toned down but playful
You say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
Sorrow stricken with a smile

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Verse 3]
Don't expect to hear from me
Cause I have got to feed our hungry mouths
I do enjoy your company
But we must work to keep you content

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I see the better and worse in me
Better and the worse in me
I embrace the grand of subtlety
Embrace the, the subtlety
But you finally caught up with me
Finally caught up with me
A mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive
Fleeing fugitive

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Chorus]
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given to the searchers who explore

[Interlude]

[Refrain]
Toned down but playful
You say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
Sorrow stricken with a smile
