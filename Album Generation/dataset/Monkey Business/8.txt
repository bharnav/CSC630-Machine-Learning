[Verse 1: Will.I.Am]
Johnny wanna be a big star
Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing it from the heart
Sooner or later, he's just gonna fall apart
'Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doin' what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material
And it's gone

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
You see yourself in the mirror, and ya
You feel safe cause it's looks familiar, but 'cha
Afraid to open up your soul, cause ya
Don't really know, don't really know who is (who is)
The person that's deep within
Cause you content with this being the name brand man, and ya
Throw this seed that is trival
It's significant that you would get too material
I seen your kind before
You the type who thinks a soul is sold in the store
Package up with inscent sticks
With a vegetarian meal to you that's righteous
You fiction like books
Need to go out to life and look, cause ya
What happens when I take your material
And you already sold your soul
And it's...

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
They say that "Time is money and money is time"
So you got cha mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about
That crime you did to get paid
And what about
I bet can't take it too your grave
Tell me about it

[Bridge: Jack Johnson]
What about those shoes you in today they do no good
On the bridges you walk along the way

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
All that money chu got
Gonna be gone
That ear that chu rock
Gonna be gone
That house upon that hill
Gonna be gone
The gold burns on your grill
Gonna be gone
The ice on your wrist
Gonna be gone
That nice little Miss
Gonna be gone
That whip that chu roll
Gonna be gone
What's worst is your soul already gone
Yeah, it's gone

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone-give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone
Gone...
