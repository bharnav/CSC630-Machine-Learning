Could you show me what love is about?
Could you show me what love is about?
No clue, no key, just a scent of a doubt
Could you tell me what it???s all about?
And if you haven???t got the time
And if you haven???t got the time it???s alright
Oh I???ll try to find some other
Working undercover
I???m a Lover Lover Lover

Could you show me what life is about?

Could you show me what life is about?
What???s true to believe have a scent of a doubt
Could you tell me what it???s all about?
And if you haven???t got the time
If you don???t want to spend the time, bare in mind
That I heard you had discovered
Your ??? cover
I???m a Lover Lover Lover
