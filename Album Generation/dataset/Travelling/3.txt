See at eight oclock I took the dog for a walk in the morning
I never really liked him but lets keep that between you and me
I ran into this woman at a crowded caf
Theres nothing else to say, she took my breath away
She said: Im Prudence, I just came out to play outta charm school
How on earth could it be?
Im touched by the hand of God
Really hard to believe
Hey, Im touched by the hand of God
Shes got a mind set on me
Yeah, Im blessed with the power of love
The power of love, yeah!
Heaven in her smile, I took a break for a while with good reason
Drowning in her eyes, I was mesmerized, Im buried and gone
I guess my kind of talking was misplaced like hell
Just like the funky ???Art Garfunkel???
Hey, sweet Prudence, youre doing so well outta charm school
How on earth could it be?
Im touched by the hand of God
Really hard to believe
Dont you know Im touched by the hand of God
Shes got a mind set on me
Yeah, Im blessed with the power of love
The power of love, yeah!
She said she had a 57 Chevrolet
Theres nothing more to say, she took my breath away
Hey, sweet Prudence, won't you come out to play outta charm school?
