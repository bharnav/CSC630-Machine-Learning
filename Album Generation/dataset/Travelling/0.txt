Terry is an old teacher
Hes reading the paper in the church
Julie used to be famous
Portraying the bright-eyed Mother Earth
But how about you?
Do you want a love that lasts forever?
But how about you?
Do you want to spend the night together?
With someone so blue
That she doesnt know what to do
Loves a big hole in her shoe
Thats the truth
How about you?
Terrys folding the paper
And yawns at a Headline ???cocking crew???
Julie thinks hes a charmer
Cause hes got the proper attitude
But how about you?
Do you want a love that lasts forever?
But how about you?
Do you want to spend the night together
With someone so blue?
That she doesnt know what to do
Loves a big stone in her shoe thats the truth
How about you
Whooo yeah
Whooo yeah
But how about you?
Dont you want a love that lasts forever?
Do you want to spend the night together
With someone so blue?
That she doesnt know what to do
Loves a big thorn in her shoe thats the truth
How about you?
