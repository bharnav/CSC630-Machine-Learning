She's an angel passing through the room
(Would you like to know her?)
She's an angel passing through my room
(Would you like to know her?)
The red settin' sun feathers down in field of heather
Beautiful
She's then and now, forever
When I ask I ask her for a dance
(Every time I see her)
We leave the beat, obey the laws of chance

(Every time I see her)
How sweet surprise ' she wears it so it shows
She never hides her eyes
She wears it where it shows
She's an angel passing through the room
Like an angel passing through the room
I wish I could save our souls alone and together
Beautiful
We're then and now, forever
Forever
