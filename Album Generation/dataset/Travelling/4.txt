This heart is sold very cheap to any loner
This heart is put up for sale by its owner
And its really a heart I could recommend
I promise I used to call it a friend
I take the easy way out
Id like to find a way to take comand
I guess Ill take the easy way out
I try to find a way to understand
This heart of gold is in perfect condition
This heart is bold and chosen for a mission
And if its been broken well no one can tell
Cause I know somebody who hides it so well
I take the easy way out
Id like to find a way to make a stand
Dont you know Ill take the easy way out
And try to find a way to understand
Ill take the easy way out
Id love to find a way to take command
I guess know Ill take the easy way out
And try to find a way to understand
