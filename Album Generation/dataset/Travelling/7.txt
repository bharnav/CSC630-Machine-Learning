The guy she married was an innocent man
A fake guitarist in an 80s band
He never knew when it got way out of hand with her love
She was a woman of the different kind
She had him looking where theres nothing to find
He always wondered why he was willing to die for her love
Now, that was his life
Excuse me, Sir, do you want me to check on your wife?
Now, shes doing fine!
Im sure shes doing alright
He was the silent type that tried not to speak
She made him promises she tried not to keep
She only wanted him to sugar her tea with his love
Now, that was his life
Excuse me, Sir, do you want me to check on your wife?
No, shes doing fine!
Im sure shes doing alright
