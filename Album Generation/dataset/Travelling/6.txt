I wouldn't come alone
I took my memories along
If theres something that Ive learned
You can't deny the way
The past dictates each dawn
Its not that Im afraid
God knows Ive made my set of rounds
Its just the way it feels tonight
That makes me lose the plot
Whats really goin down
Too hot to handle
Too hard to lose
Fallin in love with you
Is a perfect excuse
You make me feel at ease
But I know the final show
If theres something that Ive learned
Its better to have left
Before you have to go
Its not that Om afraid
God knows Ive made my set of rounds
You got that twinkle in your eye
That makes me lose my grip
Whats really goin down
Too hot to handle
Too hard to lose
Fallin in love with you
Is a perfect excuse
Too many heartbeats
Hidin the truth
Fallin in love with you
Is a perfect excuse
