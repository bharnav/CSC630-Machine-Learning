If you really need some water pray for rain
If youre waking up cold make a fire inside
If you want a tree that leads to heaven plant the seeds that grow
If you need something to believe in
To the turn of the tide
To the glow of the moon
To the sound of the rain
To the sweet scent of dew
Ive been walking alone
Thinking bout me and you
Love will never be easy how hard I try
To cover up my crying, to wipe the tears from my eyes
If you really need somebody I hope Im close behind
To put my arms around your world
To the turn of the tide
To the glow of the moond
To the sound of the rain
To the sweet scent of dew
Ive been walking alone
Thinking bout me and you
To the turn of the tide
To the glow of the moon
To the sound of the rain
To the sweet sweet scent of you
Ive been walking alone
Ive been thinking bout me and you
