[Verse 1]
Did you see the lights
As they fell all around you
Did you hear the music
A serenade from the stars

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our own
Whoa, whoa
Oh

[Verse 2]
Did you feel the wind
As it blew all around you
Did you feel the love
That was in the air

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our own
Whoa, whoa
Oh

[Verse 3]
The sun comes up
And it shines all around you
You're lost in space
And the earth is your own

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa
