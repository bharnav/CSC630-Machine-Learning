[Verse 1]
Ooh, mama
Well, look what's been done
You can only see the stars
After a setting sun

[Chorus]
You run for the money
You don't even know about wild mountain honey

[Verse 2]
Come on, mama
Heal this lonesome man
Grow the tree of wholeness
In this desert land

[Verse 3]
Come on, children
Now learn how to run
By heaven, the stars, the moon and the sun

[Verse 4]
Come on, papa
Your end is the means
Don't trade your love and goodness
For the golden machine

[Chorus]
You run for the money
You don't even know about wild mountain honey
