[Verse 1]
My grandpa, he's 95
And he keeps on dancing
He's still alive
My grandma, she's 92
She loves to dance
And sing some, too
I don't know
But I've been told
If you keep on dancing
You'll never grow old

[Chorus]
Come on, darling
Put a pretty dress on
We're gonna go out tonight
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
All night long

[Verse 2]
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a son of a gun
I've been working all week in the noon day sun
The wood's in the kitchen
And the cow's in the barn
I'm all cleaned up, and my chores are all done
Take my hand, come along
Let's go out and have some fun

[Chorus]
Come on, darling
Put a pretty dress on
We're gonna go out tonight
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
All night long

[Bridge]
Pick on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
All night long

[Verse 3]
Come on, darling, don't look that way
Don't you know when you smile
I've got to say you're my honey, pumpkin, lover
You're my heart's delight
Don't you want to go out tonight
You're such a pretty lady
You're such a sweet girl
When you dance, it brightens up my world

[Chorus]
Come on, darling
Put a pretty dress on
We're gonna go out tonight
And dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
All night long
