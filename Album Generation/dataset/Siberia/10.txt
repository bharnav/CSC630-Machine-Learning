Maybe I'm not the world
Maybe I'm not the stars
Maybe you're not the girl
What if you are?

Maybe I'm not the boy
Maybe I'm not the man
Maybe I'm not the one
But what if I am? What if I am?

Then it's love, yes it's love like it could be
It's love, yes it's love like it should be

Maybe a dream
Is only a wish
Not what it seems
So what if it is?

Maybe it doesn't fly
On the wings of a dove
Maybe it's just the life
What if it's love? What if it's love?

Then it's love, yes it's love like it could be
It's love, yes it's love like it should be
Is it love, yes it's love like it could be
It's love, yes it's love like it should be

'Cause I know I'm alive
I know I'm not dead
And I know I'm alive
I know I'm not dead

I know what's going down
I know what's going down
I know what's coming down
I know I'm coming down

Hey, have I hit rock bottom?
And hey, how to hit rock bottom?

Maybe I'm not the world
Maybe I'm not the stars
Maybe you're not the girl
What if you are?

Maybe I'm not the boy
Maybe I'm not the man
Maybe I'm not the one
But what if I am? What if I am?

Then it's love, yes it's love like it could be
It's love, yes it's love like it should be
Is it love, yes it's love like it could be
Love, yes it's love like it should be
'Cause I know I'm alive
I know I'm not dead
It's love, yes it's love like it could be
It's love, yes it's love like it should be
Is it love, yes it's love like it could be
Love, yes it's love like it should be
I'm not dead
