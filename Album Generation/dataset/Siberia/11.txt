[Verse 1]
I could take steps in this moon and that cloud
Look at my breath and still feel the warm out
This isn't about seasons
Or about rhyme and reason
Trying to be smart but my O's and my 1's
Only show start in my toes and my thumb
Nothing adds up but agrees
"You" becomes "us" and makes three

[Chorus 1]
Cheers, to such an old invention
Dear, we touched the fourth dimension

[Verse 2]
Bottle rockets and time bombs and warheads
We could go back, or keep on, or be led
Follow me to the chapel, we're the kings of the castle
It's a science, but there's room to believe
In the riots, I find you and I breathe
This isn't for the weak hearts
But everyone's here at some part

[Chorus 2]
Here's to such an old invention
Dear, we touched the fourth dimension
Cheers, to such an old invention
Here's an honorable mention

[Bridge]
I'm on moons and clouds where worlds wrap around
I'm on moons and clouds where worlds wrap around

[Chorus 2]
Here's to such an old invention
Dear, we touched the fourth dimension
Cheers, to such an old invention
Here's an honorable mention

[Outro]
We touched the fourth dimension
We touched the fourth dimension
We touched the fourth dimension
