[Verse 1]
All those sum ups, long days, short cuts
Love notes, strings struck, far aways, close ups
Troubles test me, time unrests me
But you kiss me, get the best of me

[Chorus]
We're just a mess of moments
That's adding up to where we are
And you're the frame and focus
That's making sense of it so far

[Verse 2]
I felt that scarecrow, in my marrow
Shot an arrow through a sparrow
I've crissed, I've crossed
I've kissed and it's cost
I've loved and I've lost
And I owe you a lot

[Chorus - Extended]
We're just a mess of moments
That's adding up to where we are
And you're the frame and focus
That's making sense of it so far
I'm not depressed or hopeless
I'm only walking in a blur
And you're the frame and focus
I'm the scene, you're the director
I'm the scene, you're the director

[Interlude]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'm not depressed or hopeless
I'm only walking in a blur
And you're the frame and focus

[Chorus - Extended]
We're just a mess of moments
That's adding up to where we are
And you're the frame and focus
That's making sense of it so far
I'm not depressed or hopeless
I'm only walking in a blur
And you're the frame and focus
I'm the scene, you're the director
I'm the scene, you're the director
I'm the scene, you're the director
