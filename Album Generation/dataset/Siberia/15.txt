[Verse 1: Lights]
I never meant to wither, I wanted to be tall
Like a fool, left the river and watched my branches fall
Old and thirsty, I longed for the flood to come back around
To the cactus in the valley that's about to crumble down

[Chorus 1: Lights]
And wipe the mark of sadness from my face
Show me that your love will never change
If my yesterday is a disgrace
Tell me that you still recall my name

[Verse 2: Owl City]
So, the storm finally found me and left me in the dark
In the cloud around me, I don't know where you are
If this whole world goes up in arms, all I can do is stand
And I won't fight for anyone until you move my hand

[Chorus 2: Owl City + Lights]
And wipe the mark of madness from my face
Show me that your love will never change
If my yesterday is a disgrace
Tell me that you still recall my name

[Bridge: Lights + Owl City + Both]
Oh, here, in the shadows, here I am
And I need someone by my side
It becomes so hard to stand
And I keep trying to dry my eyes
Come and find me in the valley

[Chorus 1 & 2: Lights + Both]
And wipe the mark of sadness from my face
Show me that your love will never change
If my yesterday is a disgrace
Tell me that you still recall my name
And wipe the mark of madness from my face
Show me that your love will never change
And if my yesterday is a disgrace
Tell me that you still recall my name
