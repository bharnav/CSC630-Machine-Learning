I don't want to run
I don't want to hide
I just want to kiss goodnight
Say goodnight one more time

Nothing gets you up
Nothing gets you high
Everything just comes to this
Final mis-taken lives

And it's goodbye, goodbye all my new days
Goodbye, all because of you days
Goodbye

You just can't get out
You just can't get in
Everything just has strung you up, hung you up
To watch you swing

One of us is you
And one of us is me
Broken frozen equal parts
Broken hearts breaking free

And it's goodbye, goodbye all my new days
Goodbye, all those chosen few days
Goodbye

Baby maybe someday
Maybe one day
We'll say hi

I don't want to run
I don't want to hide
I just want to kiss goodnight
Say goodnight one last time

Nothing gets you up
Nothing gets me high
Everything just comes to this
Final mis-taken lives
One last time

It's goodbye, goodbye all my new days
Goodbye, all because of you days
Goodbye

And it's goodbye, goodbye all my new days
Goodbye, all those chosen few days
New days

Baby maybe someday
Maybe one day
We'll say hi
Baby maybe sometime
Maybe next time
We'll say hi
Baby maybe someday
Maybe one day
We'll say hi
Baby maybe sometime
Maybe next time
We'll say hi

Baby maybe sometime
Maybe next time
We'll say hi
We'll say hi
We'll say hi

Baby maybe someday
Maybe one day
We'll say hi
