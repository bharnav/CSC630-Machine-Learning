Where were we
Fearless and only ever scared of me
Peerless and tearless

That was me
Cold as ice
On my knees
Every night
Snow white

Where were you
When all the doors were closing
You forced me to
Of all of us it's you who chose
It's you who chose

Not me
Cold as ice
On my knees
Everynight
Snow white

Where were we
When I was fearless and only ever scared of me
Peerless and tearless

Where am I
Still trying to find the light
That burns the northern sky
A rarer borealis

Born to be
Made of lights
On my knees everynight
Snow bright

Yeh thats me
Cold as ice
On my knees
Everynight
Snow white

Born to be
Made of lights
On my knees everynight
Snow bright
