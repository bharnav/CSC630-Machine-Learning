Ethereally mine
Magic trees
They really used to shine
My silver leaves

Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how

Scissors in the sand
Rubberised
Watch his other hand
Ventriloquised

Bet you're wondering who
Bet you're wondering who
Bet you're wondering who
Bet you're wondering who

Something on the roof
And in the wall
My silverfishing youth
Swim don't crawl

Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how
Bet you're wondering how

Scissors in the sand
Rubberised
Watch his other hand
Ventriloquised

Bet you're wondering why
Bet you're wondering why
Bet you're wondering why
Bet you're wondering why
