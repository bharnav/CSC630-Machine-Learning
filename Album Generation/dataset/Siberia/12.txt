[Verse 1]
Forty days and counting
I'm going to sleep when
I wake up there will be
Thirty nine more days left

[Chorus]
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
'Til I fall asleep and you are with me

[Verse 2]
Thirty days and counting
I'm going to sleep when
I wake up there will be
Twenty nine more days left

[Chorus]
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
'Til I fall asleep and you are with me

[Bridge]
I'll stay right here
Up all night, dear
I'll stay right here 'til you're right here

[Chorus]
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
When I fall asleep I feel you with me
'Til I fall asleep and you are with me
