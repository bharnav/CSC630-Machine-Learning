I hurt you, I didn't mean to
If I could take it back, take away all the sadness
God knows I would

I love you, it's something I always do
I'm sorry I made you cry, I wish I could make it right
God knows I do

They say everything will be alright
They say everything will heal in time
But that's not how it feels tonight

It's killing me to think I didn't see
The one who is like a child, a love that was sweet in mind
Is gone for good

They say everything will be alright
They say everything will heal in time
But that's not how it feels tonight

And that's not how it feels tonight
