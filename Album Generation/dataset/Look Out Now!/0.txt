Running, running, running in the morning sun
Up the hill and through a patch of grass around the bend
There's a feeling in the air, you know you don't know who's gay, ooh
Ooh, it's a good day

There's a crowd of people standing at the construction site
Something building on the city street up into the sky
There's a feeling on the sidewalk, everything is alright, ooh
Ooh, it's a good day

And it's easier to give it away, ooh
It's easier to give it away right now
It's easier to give it away, ooh
I wanna give it all to you

All the animals in Africa are getting along
The way zebra look like optical illusions
The elephants are squirting water out of their trunks, ooh
Ooh, it's a good day

Baby, in the E-N-C-Y-C-L-O-pedia
They have everything you want to know, what you can think of
But it won't contain a reason for the feeling of love, ooh
Ooh, it's a good day

And it's easier to give it away, ooh
It's easier to give it away, now, now
It's easier to give it away, ooh
I wanna give it all to you
