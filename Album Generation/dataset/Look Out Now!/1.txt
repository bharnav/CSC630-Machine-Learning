Do you remember the time we had?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
The sunny room and the single bed
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

I cut your ware and it looked so bad
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Wanted to cry but you had to lie
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away
So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away

Saturday night we were all dressed up
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
The only way to the black dance club
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away
So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away

Even though you know it's been a while
I see your face as clear as day
And I take along your tender smile
As I go on my way

Bent on a yellow, my beetle car
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
The window's down and the music go
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away
So long sugar, you are, you are, you are with me
Never so far away

So long sugar, you are with me
Ooh, ooh, you are with me
Ooh, ooh, you are with me
Never so far away
