This morning I got up and I filled my coffee up
And I felt like singing again
It's not a sunny day, I feel okay anyway
I don't have the rain coming in

I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah
I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah

I feel like celebratin' the great emancipation
My heart is finally free
I call up my old friends, start goin' out again
They'll be surprised to see me

I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah
I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa, you nearly had me
Under your phone
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you nearly had me
Comin' undone

I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah
I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah

I'm feelin' better, feelin' better today than I was
When I was hung up on you, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa, you nearly had me
Under your phone
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you nearly had me
Comin' undone

Feel my sweet sunshine inside
Oh, feel my sweet sunshine inside like I used to
Like I used to do, like I used to, oh, like I used to
Oh, sunshine inside, oh, sunshine inside
