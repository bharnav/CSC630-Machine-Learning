I can feel it, I can feel it in my heart and soul
I can't conceal it, I reveal it everywhere I go
I love you

Complication seem to come to every situation
People pushing, people pulling you, my one escape
I want to

More than anybody, more than anyone
More than anybody, more than anyone

Herculean, this is stronger than the doubts of demons
You're the reason, you're the reason that I keep believing

More than anybody, more than anyone
More than anybody, more than anyone

There really isn't any explanation
But I could give a million reasons why
There really isn't any explanation
The only thing that I can say tonight, I love you

More than anybody, I can feel it
More than anybody, I can feel it in my heart and soul
More than anybody, I love you
More than anybody, more than anyone

I can feel it, I can feel it in my heart and soul
I can't conceal it
