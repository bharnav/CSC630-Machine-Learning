It's been a while since I knew you before
Hindsight says I was so much to blame
But even then, you possessed so much more
I buried my guilt under my fantasies
I never knew what it would do to you, oh my God
I dealt a hand and played with fate
But I still feel, and I surrender to, your intoxicant
But I want you to really know me

Medusa’s home
Built out of hurt and pain
Welcome to the Firewall
If I get too close
I will go down in flames
Eh, just look at me now
I'm on fire
And if I could, I would get down in your soul
And clean up the mess that I made
Maybe will and grace
Will replace your faith
And we can embrace
You'll never get to know me
Unless you
Let me touch your face
A victim of your Firewall
The devil’s own
Destroy your enemies
I dance into your Firewall
When you’re done, there'll be nothing left of me
Suck me into your flames, and let me burn deep down inside until I...
