I stared into a mirror for three days, didn't eat or sleep
Just to see if I could see something down underneath
Yeah yeah
I saw angels and demons in fear and a torn blue little soul
In an ocean of your love

There were kings and killers, the face of a beggar
And everything I ever was
In there was heaven and hell, and the whole creation
Was Dying For Your Love
And now I'm Dying For Your Love
I said, I'm Dying For Your Love

And there's nothing I wouldn't do or go through to get to truth
But faceless things are in my way
Yes, I can see every little thing we never really knew
Is lying there buried in the silence
Waiting for time to decay

Lust and anger, a freak and a savior
And pieces of the universe
Black phantom creatures, trapped in a prison of desire
Are crying for your love

Now I'm Dying For Your Love
We all are Dying For Your Love

And I need to feel me in those arms again
I said, I need to feel me in those arms again

Because I'm Dying For Your Love
I said, I'm Dying For Your Love
I'm Dying For Your Love
We all are Dying For Your Love
