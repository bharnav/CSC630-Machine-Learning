A world so sad when there's no rebirth, it's weakening frame
So taste your fate, so eat your shit
We've come to this, oh what the fuck have we done?

Slave - from our birth to our grave
Slave - our tombs engraved, "enslaved"

Technology isolating human interaction turns to human decay
Tombstone skyscrapers breath exhaust vapors
We've finally reached the point of no return

We've reached the point of no return
The water, land, sky they burn
We've reached the point of no return
We're all gonna burn

We dig our grave
Now we lie in them and we roll in our own shit
