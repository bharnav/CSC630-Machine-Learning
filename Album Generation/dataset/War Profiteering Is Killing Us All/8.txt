Taken for granted, split the atom
Make a chain reaction of fusion or fission
A ticking timebomb is sleeping, ready to explode
And meltdown followed by fallout

Don't you know there can be no denial?
Don't you know they're polluting the earth?

Nuclear generators
Red lights flash
Foreshadowing the future

A smoking gun spewing its filth into the air
But they don't care as it darkens the sky
Appear a toxic cloud in the atmosphere
Encircling the globe come nuclear winter
