I've got my hands tied behind my back
You know doing what I wanna do has become so hard

As time goes by, I've less and less time to do what I wanna do
And how time flies when you're having a good time
Having a good time

You and I know that all the things we do will crumble into
Dust
In thin air they'll disappear, yeah time moves on and it waits
For no one

I just can't find enough time for myself

It's just our luck to get so lucky
We never have to grow up
But this time's mine
And I won't waste time saying things are fucked up
