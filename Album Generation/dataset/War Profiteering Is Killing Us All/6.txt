They're changing the rules, the conduction and flow is
They're making us pay for the wars of the world
But the laws of the world mean nothing
And nothing can stop them from taking what just isn't theirs

And this, regardless of what we say

They're looking for payback through world domination
Economy strangled by careless neglect
And a bitter regret for the things that we've done
Will be felt by us all in the years to come

All systems overload!
Fail-safe systems breaking down!

Nowhere is safe cause they'll just take
