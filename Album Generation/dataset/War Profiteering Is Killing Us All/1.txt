Free market trade will destroy itself
The way that we live will cease to exist
All that we know will come crashing down
As Wall Street's bottom drops out

Monopolies, technology, creates then it's all the same

Day after day, as time goes by
The closer we get, the nearer the end
The impending doom of our country
The corporate corrupt
They've sealed our fate now

Woah, total destruction
Woah, total collapse
Woah, total destruction
Woah, it's only a matter of time
(it's really just a matter of...)

Monopolies, technology, creates then it's all the same
