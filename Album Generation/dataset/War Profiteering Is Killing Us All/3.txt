Well I know that times are tough and it's hard to keep quitting
But you gotta get yourself together, it's true
You try to disguise it but we can all see it
Although you might think that nobody knew

It's become everything, you can't stop it
You're strung out on that shit

(Pick it up!)
You gotta do this on your own, there won't be an intervention
You gotta make up your mind soon to let it all go
You're a slave to the drug although you can't recognize it
While you're getting so high you'll end up sinking so low

Is all your integrity gone?

Now you're lying in the gutter and your life is going nowhere
And you haven't got a thought or a clue what to do
Many have tried only to meet with their demise, yeah
The solution to the problem is never do it at all
