War profiteering (is killing us all!)

Capitalistic intent gone wild
How much further down will we survive?
Death of 1000 we have mourned
Capitalist scumbag, you've been warned

We'll do what we gotta do to take our country back
By any means necessary, we'll take our country back

War profiteering (is killing us all!)

Revolution's in the air
Our government's in need of repair
Raise your voice, it's a call to arms
Preemptive though ends further harm

It's what you do, what you think, what you say
What you do, what you think, what you say, let's change it
There's no antidote?
That's a fucking joke
A shock to the head that'll cure the problem
