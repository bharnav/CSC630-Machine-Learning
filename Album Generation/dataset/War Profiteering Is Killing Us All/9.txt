How we love, we love to hurt ourselves
How we live, we live to hurt each other
And how it feels when it's you who hates yourself
It's hard to care when it seems no one else does
And I know how it feels when all the pressure is too real
With all these bad thoughts in my head
I try, but I can't quite get rid of them

I've hit the bottom
I'm at the bottom again
Can someone lend a helping hand?
I've hit the bottom
I'm at the bottom again

They're just scars, and everyone has got them, yeah
Just scars, we all try to hide them so that no one else can
See
Your scars are beautiful to me
I know that love can break your back
Especially when your soul is black
Just know that you destroy me
I wonder are you finally free?
Dirty dishes in the sink
He sang, he sang while his world, it sank

He's at the bottom
He's hit the bottom again
There was no one there to lend a hand
He's at the bottom
He's hit the bottom again
At depression's bitter end

It's been a long hard day
You free me from my pain
But I hold onto hope
It's all I've ever known
You free me from my pain

Free me
