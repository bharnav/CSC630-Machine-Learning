We're dying, We're dying out

Dying art, dying sea
Dying you, dying me
Dying hearts, dying minds
Dying sucks, dying times

Crash course in commercialism
Dumb it down
Crash course crashing head on
Spiraling down. (down, right now, watch out)
After all, it's just fashion
After all, it's just a trend
Come on and let's kill it together
Let's make the threat extinct
Let's let those fuckers win
This is not a commodity

We're dying, We're dying out

Exploit our culture and you buy into it
