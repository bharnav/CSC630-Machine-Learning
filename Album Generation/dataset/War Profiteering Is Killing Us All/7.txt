Drop out of mainstream society now
Think about the world and what's going around
Blood for oil - the stakes in this capitalist game
How can this ignorant mentality remain?

Together we must stand to avoid a catastrophe
This is a throwback, we'll throw down the kings
We gotta

Rise up
Rise up and fight the power
Rise up against this corruption

Those in high places act as gods among men
They'll play us for fools to keep the power they defend
Rich man, common man, defined by their genes
While another brother dies to feed the capitalist machine

It's what they don't wanna hear (the voices of the millions)
It's what they don't wanna know (the coming revolution)
So fly the red flag!

It all comes down collapsing in on itself
