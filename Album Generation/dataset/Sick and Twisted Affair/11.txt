So where did you sleep the night before?
I doubt that your phone was dyin'
I'm supposed to believe that was what you wore
Said you were alone I don't buy it
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, well why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

You might as well just stop cryin'
It Doesn't mean much to me anymore
A little too late to start tryin'
I'm takin' this love off of life support
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, well why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, well why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Trying to un-do the love that I'm tied to
Who haven't you lied to?

With every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, well why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, well why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay surrounded by no I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie
