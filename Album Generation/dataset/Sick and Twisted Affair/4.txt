Your needs need attention
I'm blinded by the truth
Let me release the tension
It's taking hold of you

It's only natural
To free the animal
(Locked up inside)

The nature of the beast is you want it
Nature of the beast is I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
Oh, it's the nature of the beast in you

You wrap yourself around me
You're tightening the noose
Trapped in the cage surrounding
The sinful side of you

It's only natural
To free the animal
(Locked up inside)

The nature of the beast is you want it
Nature of the beast is I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
Oh, it's the nature of the beast in you

It's only natural
To free the animal
(Let me fly, woah)

The nature of the beast is you want it
Nature of the beast is I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
Oh, it's the nature of the beast in you

The nature of the beast is you want it
Nature of the beast is I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
Oh, it's the nature of the beast in you
