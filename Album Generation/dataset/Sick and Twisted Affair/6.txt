We can try and talk
But the fighting always gets in the way
(The crying never stops
'Cause the fighting always gets in the way)

There's no need to clean it up
'Cause it's all running down the drain
(Everything is lost
When it's all running down the drain)

We turn harmony into silence
Over love, the love, the love, the love
Which led harmlessly into violence
Over love, the love, the love, the love

Hearts will always break
They're fragile in design

But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I always hurt somebody when I fall in love
(And that's just how it goes)
But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I said it wouldn't happen again
(That's just how it goes)
I said it wouldn't happen again
I said it wouldn't happen again

We pretend to get along
But the smile's getting harder to fake
(It's tough to play along
When the smile's getting harder to fake)

We're saying nothing's wrong
All the while fading further away
(Each day we carry on
All the while fading further away)

We turn harmony into silence
Over love, the love, the love, the love
Which led harmlessly into violence
Over love, the love, the love, the love

Hearts will always break
They're fragile in design

But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I always hurt somebody when I fall in love
(And that's just how it goes)
But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I said it wouldn't happen again
(That's just how it goes)
I said it wouldn't happen again
I said it wouldn't happen again

I said it wouldn't happen again
(All the long nights that I missed)
I said it wouldn't happen again
(All your painful loneliness)
I said it wouldn't happen again
(All the broken promises)
I said it wouldn't happen again

That's how it always goes

But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I always hurt somebody when I fall in love
(And that's just how it goes)
But I went and messed it up
(I've gone and done it)
I said it wouldn't happen again
(That's just how it goes)
I said it wouldn't happen again
I said it wouldn't happen again
