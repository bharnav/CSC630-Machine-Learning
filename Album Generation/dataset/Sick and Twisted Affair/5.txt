I was fine right before I met her
Never hurt and nothing could control me
You know I tried, but I can’t regret her
She’s the first, ask anyone who knows me
Terrified that she’d find my heart and break it
Paralyzed by the thought of her with someone else

(I wish I would’ve known)
I shouldn’t have fallen in love with her
It’s been nothing but trouble 'til now
I shouldn’t have fallen in love at all
But I couldn’t stop myself

Who gives you the right to tear up my life?
How dare she be so perfect?
What did I do to deserve this?
(I’ll never let her go)
How dare she be so perfect?

(Caught in the fire)

I haven't cried since the day she left me
'Cause that would mean that I admit it’s over
I tell myself that she’s trying to test me
She’d never leave, she still needs me to hold her
Horrified cause she found my heart and broke it
Mortified when I picture her with someone else

(I wish I would’ve known)
I shouldn’t have fallen in love with her
It’s been nothing but trouble 'til now
I shouldn’t have fallen in love at all
But I couldn’t stop myself

Who gives you the right to tear up my life?
How dare she be so perfect?
What did I do to deserve this?
(I’ll never let her go)
How dare she be so perfect?

Tell me why, tell me why
(You started the fire)
And played me like that

Tell me why, tell me why
(You started the fire)
And played me like that

I shouldn’t have fallen in love with her
It’s been nothing but trouble 'til now
I shouldn’t have fallen in love at all
But I couldn’t stop myself
(I gotta let her go)

Who gives you the right to tear up my life?
How dare she be so perfect?
What did I do to deserve this?
(I gotta let her go)
How dare she be so perfect?

Tell me why, tell me why
(You started the fire)
And played me like that

Tell me why, tell me why
(You started the fire)
And played me like that
