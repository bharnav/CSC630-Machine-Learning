You're out all night, how long can I wait
To justify another cold embrace?
Your love is a lie, and I can tell by your face
I've made up my mind and I've accepted our fate

(Somehow) I can read between the lines
(Two wrongs) Couldn't ever make it right
Now I'm gone, gone, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on, on, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on

Where did our love, where did our love
Where did our love go?
Where did our love, where did our love
Where did our love go?

You won't pick up the phone when I know you're with him
And you smell like cologne, it's all over your skin
You keep looking away when you're talking to me
And you said you would change, but I just can't believe

(Somehow) I can read between the lines
(Two wrongs) Couldn't ever make it right
Now I'm gone, gone, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on, on, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on

You will never break my heart again
You said forever and you'd always be there 'til the end
You will never break my heart again
But you'll come running when it happens to you in the end
The end

When he's out all night, how long will you wait?
(Somehow) I can read between the lines
(Two wrongs) Couldn't ever make it right
Now I'm gone, gone, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on, on, I'm gone
Yeah, I'm moving on

Where did our love, where did our love
Where did our love go?
Where did our love, where did our love
Where did our love go?

You're out all night, how long could I wait?
