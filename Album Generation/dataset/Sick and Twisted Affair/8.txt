Some say that love is blind
Some lovers live in lie
She meant the world to me
I've found my one and only

Felt no guilt inside
Can't tell the wrong from right
She stole my soul from me
Her heart is cold and empty
(Turn around and run away)

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)

Her smile, you can't resist
There's poison on her lips
Disguised as an angel
One night could be fatal

Next victim on her list
Gets caught with just one kiss
You'll never see it coming
To her, love is nothing
(Turn around and run away)

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)

Turn around and run away
Turn around and run away

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)

She'll get away with it
And take the city up
She'll go and make another victim of the love crime
