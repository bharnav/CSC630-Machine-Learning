My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I c-c-c-caught you, caught you
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I caught you

T-t-talk to me and tell me
Where you were (late last night)
Y-you just told me you're with your friends
Hanging out (late last night)
Y-y-you're lying, 'cause you're stuttering
Now where were you? (late last night)
Stop lyin' to me about where you've been
'Cause you're tickin' me off (t-t-t-tickin' me off)

[Chorus, x4]
I can see you're lyin'
'Cause when you're replyin'
You stutter, stutter
You stutter, stutter

I smell cologne, damn, it's strong
How'd you get it on? (I'm not done)
He messed up your hair, makeup's everywhere
Oh yeah (I'm not done)
You're crying 'cause you're lying
To my face (I'm not done)
Stop lyin' to me about where you've been
'Cause you're tickin' me off (t-t-t-tickin' me off)

[Chorus, x4]
I can see you're lyin'
'Cause when you're replyin'
You stutter, stutter
You stutter, stutter

My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I c-c-c-caught you, caught you
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I caught you

[Chorus, x4]
I can see you're lyin'
'Cause when you're replyin'
You stutter, stutter
You stutter, stutter
