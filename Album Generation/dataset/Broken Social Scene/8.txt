[Intro]
(Check in)

[Verse 1]
Disappear like I come in your world
Five is a number that I dream about
It looks like it could've been time
But that is a word that I dream about

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, felt good to fall life down
Oh, I think you like it, laughed when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but
But you can't get the feel

[Chorus]
Hotel

[Verse 2]
Disappear like a corner in the wall
Five is a number that I dream about
Sleep looks like a mescaline sun
But calm is a word that I dream about

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, felt good to fall life down
Oh, I think you like it, laughed when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but
But you can't get the feel

[Chorus]
Hotel
Hotel

[Outro]
