[Verse 1]
I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Put my suits right on the guest list
Sign my passport, became weightless

[Chorus]
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

[Verse 2]
Draper Street caught me believing
Split their eyes on all the ceilings
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you

[Chorus]
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

[Verse 3]
I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you

[Chorus]
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
