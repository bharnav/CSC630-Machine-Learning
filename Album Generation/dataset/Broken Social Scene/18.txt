[Verse 1]
All my friends in magazines
Got addicted to the word "leave"
And they all wrote songs that they believe
Little lies and massive dreams

[Chorus]
And they all request that you slow down
And they all request that you slow down
You've got to turn it around
And make a save

[Verse 2]
There's a whore inside their bed
The duvets wish that they were still wet
And all the songs they wrote instead
Your ex-lover is not dead

[Chorus]
And they all request that you slow down
And they all request that you slow down
You've got to turn it around
And make a save

[Outro]
All my friends in magazines
Got addicted to the word "leave"
And all the songs that you believe
Once they stop you can't repeat
Once you stop you can't repeat
