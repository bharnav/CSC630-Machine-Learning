[Verse 1]
Well, I got shot right in the back
And you were there, you were there
I said I was never coming back
And you were there, you were there
Well I know the eyelids are under attack
You were there, you were there
Well, it's like the pressure wants to retract
Because you were there, you were there

[Chorus]
And if God is what they made
Cut their hands off believers
Don't get high on what you create

[Verse 2]
Well, I saw Gaza turn into light
And you were there, you were there
All the subtractions made it on time
Because you were there, you were there
Well, all the nice boys wait for a sign
You were there, you were there
When I was out on the town, the town
And I needed it, needed it

[Chorus]
And if love is what they gave
Turn wives into healers
Don't get high on what you create
Or it might just steal ya
