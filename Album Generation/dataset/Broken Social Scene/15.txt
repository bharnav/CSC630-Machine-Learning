[Verse 1]
Mouth's like a cigarette
Hooked on a fever
So, devils, settle down
Mind is a broken cliff
Hearts full of semen
So throw yourself down
Mouths on a distant chest
Minus the breathing
So throw yourself down

[Chorus]
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns

[Verse 2]
Cloned in the water
The children are freezing
So throw yourself down
Canceled the other plans
Leaving the leaving
So throw yourself down
God is a good defense
Blood in the bleeding
So throw yourself down

[Chorus]
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Your mouth's like a cigarette
Your eyes are the fever
So throw yourself down
The mouth is a messenger
Your mind is a healer
So throw yourself down

[Chorus]
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, the big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, the big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
