[Verse 1]
I was
Waiting for you
I was
Standing around
I was
Getting older
I was
Going down

[Chorus]
If you always get up late, you'll never be on time
If you always make it after work
Ba ba dadada
After work

[Verse 2]
Oh, the day never comes
And I stand up
Waiting on
I saw you down there
I know you were tired
I saw you
You looked like a swimmer

[Bridge]
I want to be with you
All of the time
Why can't you satisfy?
You look good
But you sound better
You were the best I had

[Chorus]
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
And that's a shame
Because I like you
I never see you
