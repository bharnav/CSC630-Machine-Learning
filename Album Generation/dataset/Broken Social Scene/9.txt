[Verse 1]
Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
Try to surface the calm
We don't come inside

[Chorus]
Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

[Verse 2]
And is it coming alive?
Try to believe it
Was the question a point?
I don't want your love

[Chorus]
Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

[Bridge]
We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see
We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see

[Verse 3]
Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
It kind of takes the joy away
We don't come at all

[Outro]
