It's all gonna break
Well, it's all gonna break

When I was a kid, you fucked me in the ass
But I took my pen to paper and I passed
You know I love the shit because the shit tastes so good
I got pastures waiting in the woods
Because it's all gonna break
Well, it's all gonna break

Treat me like a sign, sounds like so well
I know times like these are the hell
And when you do the tricks, the tricks look so good
I got buried rumors waiting in the woods

And they try to climb awake and call me over
Skies they rape and skies are sober
Minds they fake and minds rolled over
It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to love

I know that you're dying, I know that it's true
I know there's seven thousand things you rather be and rather do
And I know that you fuck what you love and you love what you fuck

I'll keep them out girl, I'll keep it true
I'll do anything inside the skin of you
Because I know that the sound of your heart is a god I can trust
Like a man, not a boy, I don't love, I just fight with the violence in ourselves

It's all gonna break!
It's all gonna break!

And you all want the lovely music to save your lives
And you all want the lovely music to save your lives
Keep it coming, there is no lie to save your life
Keep it coming, this is the lie to save your life

Why are you always fucking ghosts?
Why are you always fucking ghosts?
Why, why, why are you always fucking ghosts?

It's been such a long
Life that we trust
Your heart is a whore
And love is just lust
You want what you can't
And you can't cause of fear
We've got to get
Out of here
Why are you always—
Why are you always—
Why, why, why?
Why?!
