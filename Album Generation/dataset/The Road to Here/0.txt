[Verse 1]
There's a cold feeling
Running up and down my spine
It seems to say "we're just wasting time"
Its like a bad movie
One I wish I'd never seen
The plot gets old, do you know what i mean?
Don’t try to tell me it isn't what it is

[Chorus]
I'm good
I'm good at seeing the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hanging on
Because you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone

[Verse 2]
On a lost highway
I don't know how I got where I am
Take the next splitsville exit ramp
It's like a cheap vacation
One I thought we planned very well
Now we've checked out the lovely love hotel
Don’t try to tell me it isn’t what it is

[Chorus]
I'm good
I'm good at seeing the signs
I'm good at reading between the lines
No use in hanging on
Because you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
