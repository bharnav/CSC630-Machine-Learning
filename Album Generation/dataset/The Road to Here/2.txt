[Verse 1]
What goes around comes around
Feel it breathing down heavy on you
You made that bed you're laying on
Deeds that you have done, now you can't undo

[Chorus]
You've got bones in your closet
You've got ghosts in your town
Ainâ€™t no doubt, yeah, they're going to come out
They're waiting for the sun to go down
You can't hide from your demons
Feel them all lurking around
You're running scared 'cause you know they're out there
They're waiting for the sun to go down

[Verse 2]
It's a long hard row to hoe
When seeds that you sow grow by the wicked moon
Be sure your sins will find you out
Your past will hunt you down
And return to tell on you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It all stands to reason
Every dog will have his day
But your day is leaving
Better hold on tight
Here comes the night

[Chorus]
