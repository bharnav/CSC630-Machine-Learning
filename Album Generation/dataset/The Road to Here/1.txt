[Chorus]
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

[Verse 1]
One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul
In the boondocks

I can feel that
Muddy water running through my veins
I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar

[Chorus]
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

[Verse 2]
I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowing

[Chorus]
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

[Verse 3]
It's where I learned about living
Its where I learned about love
Its where I learned about working hard
And having a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowing where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me
This is who I am
Give me a tin roof, a front porch, and a gravel road
And that is home to me, feels like home to me

[Chorus]
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

[Verse 4]
You get a line I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the craw fish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning
