[Verse 1]
Hear the train in the distance
Such a lonely sound it makes
When it's gone there is silence
You can hear the sound of my heart break
See these arms, now they're empty
Because they used to hold on to you
I said I'd never let go
But somehow you slipped on through
Now I know that's how love goes
When love goes away

[Chorus]
I'm going to cry some
Then I'm going to lay here and die some
All because I know there arenâ€™t no one else
Baby, if i can't live with you
Guess I'll have to
Live with the lonesome

[Verse 2]
There's a prayer that I'm praying
There's a dream that I always will dream
And the hope keeps me waiting
For the day when you come back to me
It's a curse and a blessing
To find love above all the rest
Now I'd rather have nothing
Than to settle for less
Now I know that's how love goes
When love goes away

[Chorus]
