[Chorus]
Looking for to make some sense out of nothing
Looking for the hunger to hang on
Looking for to know if you're really worth it
Looking for a reason not to be gone

[Verse 1]
Your signs are fading, baby
I can't read them anymore
Can't you see where I'm standing, baby
I got one foot out the door
You better show me something fast
'Cause my patience for you arenâ€™t going to last

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If there isn't nothing there
Well, that's my time you are wasting
If you say you're giving all you've got
Well, that's my chain your yanking
Love is on a slippery slope
Barely hanging on at the end of my rope

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So tell me what you're going to do keep me around
And baby, whatever it is you better do it now, now, now

[Chorus]
