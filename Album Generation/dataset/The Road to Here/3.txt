[Verse 1]
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
You got willing arms that'll hold you tight
A hand to lead you on through the night right here
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside
But don't you keep it to yourself

[Chorus]
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 2]
You know I know you like the back of my hand
But did you know I'm going to do all that I can right here
I'm going to lie with you till you fall asleep
When the morning comes I'm still going to be right here (yes I am)
So take your worries and just drop them at the door
Baby leave it all behind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby let me be your safe harbor
Don't let the water come and carry you away

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
