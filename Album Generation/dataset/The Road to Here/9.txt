[Verse 1]
I don't know who I am
Staring at a million broken pieces here
I don't know where I stand
While I'm still, the world goes round so free so cavalier
Aimlessly I wander, like a drifter
On a narrow winding road
I've got plenty of direction but I don't know where to go

[Chorus]
I'm so lost without you
I'm so lost without you
Baby, I'm so lost without you
That I can't find myself

[Verse 2]
No it don't seem right this canyon of lonely lying in our bed
Lord how I've cried a waterfall of tears until my eyes turn red
Ever since you left me it's been like a bullet through my heart
And I know I should move on, but I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
