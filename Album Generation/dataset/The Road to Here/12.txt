[Verse 1]
How can I bear to wake up and you're not there
What will I do when I turn and reach for you
I lay my tears on the windowsill
I'll only cry until I get over you
But how long will it take me
Won't you save me

[Chorus]
Stay just a little bit longer
Till I'm a little bit stronger to take all this and
Stay just a little more time
Till I can find a way
Please stay

[Verse 2]
Will I ever smile again when losing love takes my best friend
To wonder where, wonder how, I wonder what you're doing
One more night just before you break me
Hold me safely

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So I'll be a big girl and close my eyes
As you walk away don't say goodbye
God save me, please won't you

[Chorus]
Stay just a little bit longer
Till I'm a little bit stronger to take all this and
Stay just a little more time
Till I can find a way
Won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
