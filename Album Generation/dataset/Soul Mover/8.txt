LAND OF THE LIVIN' (Wonderland)

Holy Moses, I think I do relate
In the early morning
I'll be on the interstate
I feel the rush over me again
I love the taste of the cinnamon

I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
I just wanna believe
That we live in wonderland
We live in wonderland
I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
I just wanna believe
We live in wonderland
We live in wonderland

Down in the valley or
Up on the boulevard
My inhibitions, I know I will discard
I said yeah yeah yeah
And I don't want to compromise
I just want you to realize

I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
I just wanna believe
That we live in wonderland
We live in wonderland
I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
I just want to believe
That we live in wonderland
We live in wonderland

I just want to be free

I feel the rush over me again
I love the taste of the cinnamon

Now I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
I just wanna believe
That we live in wonderland
We live in wonderland
I just want to be free
In the land of the living
I just want to believe
That we live in wonderland
We live in wonderland

I just wanna be free
In the land of the living
Everything's going to be alright
Yeah yeah, it's all right
It's going to be alright
