ISOLATION

In this world
It's so hard to make a plan
Every time now you know
I understand
There's no way I would
Go there on my own
Such a place
I refuse to be alone

Don't live in isolation
Don't live in isolation
Don't live in isolation
Cos it's not good for me

I'm in grace
And I never will regret
I won't fall
And I hope I don't forget
Won't you stay
I will occupy your mind
Night and day
It's my life I have designed

Don't want to live there anymore
You'll never find out on the shore
