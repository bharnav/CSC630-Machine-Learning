CHANGE YOURSELF

Don't, confuse, me with, the drama
Now, and then, you lose, your karma
Don't, you trust
Yourself at all
The life you've lead
Why, do you, keep looking back?
You move ahead

Don't throw your life away
You got so much to say
Anticipatin'

In this crazy world
You must change yourself
In this open road, you must change yourself
In this crazy world
You must change yourself
Nothing lasts forever

Confiscate, your malady, your blindness
(open up your eyes)
Kill, the root, of evil and madness
(open up your mind)
You, have worn, the color black
For far too long
So, you go, no turning back
You won't be wrong

Don't throw your life away
You got so much to say
Anticipatin'
In this crazy world
You must change yourself
In this open road, you must change yourself
In this crazy world
You must change yourself
Nothing lasts forever (but the song)

In this crazy world
You must change yourself
In this open road, you must change yourself
In this crazy world
You must change yourself
Nothing lasts forever

In this crazy world
You must change yourself
In this open road, you must change yourself
In this crazy world
You must change yourself
Nothing lasts forever (but the song)
Nothing lasts forever (but the song)
Nothing lasts forever

You've gotta change yourself
Yourself
