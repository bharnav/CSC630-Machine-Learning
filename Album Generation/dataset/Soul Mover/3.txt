ORION

High, highest in the open sky
Fate, is a world you can't deny
Bring, you will bring the axle down
We, escalate to hear the sound

Standin' on my shoulder
I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona
I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away
Orion, Orion

Born, you were born within the light
I, plant the seed before your flight

Standin' on my shoulder
I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona
I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away

High, highest in the open sky
Fate, is a world you can't deny

Standin' on my shoulder
I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona
I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away

Standin' on my shoulder
I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona
I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away

Orion, Orion, Orion, Orion, Orion
Orion, Orion, Orion, Orion, Orion
