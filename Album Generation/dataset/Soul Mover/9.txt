I hear no sound, but I feel your thunder
Take no offence but I see the code is blue
Now you've finally broken through
Somebody told me that your
Name is Wanda
So motivated, that you burned your own tattoo
Now it's where or when or who?
You are the last messiah
The steeple, church and spire

Say goodbye to the summer
In the mornin' rain
Don't know what's come over you
There's something wrong with your brain
You've been dyin' in vain
You're miss little insane
We need to do an intervention
Someone should put the fear of god in you
What are you going through?
Now can you tell me
Give me confirmation
Or am I dreaming is the speculation true
Did you make a bitches brew
You are the last messiah
The steeple, church and spire
