Goin' today, just passin'
The road I know so well
Seems the more I ride you
You give me more
You'll tell
And if I try
Soon it will show
To keep me strong
And know that I've had times
So good
From coast to coast
Leavin' my hard times behind

And if I try soon it will show
To keep me strong
And know that I've had time
So good from coast to coast
Leavin' my hard times behind

Oh I love the coast
I love the coast

Oh yeah, oh yeah
I love the coast
