SHE MOVES GHOSTLY

We live forever
Now I want to know who you are
I thought you'd never
Come back so soon from afar
You are my savior
Gone is the scratch
From my wound
How long does it take ya
To materialize in my room?

I am so sorry
Why do you take so long
I'm in no hurry
I cannot see and I'm ready to break

She moves ghostly
Oh so slowly
She moves ghostly, ghostly

Eternal lover
I have a burning desire
There is no other
I'm standing too close to your fire
The dawn is breaking
Your presence I feel in this place
You know I believe
So why won't you show me your face
