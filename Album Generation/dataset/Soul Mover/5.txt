So long ago, from another time
I lost all control
The devil in the wilderness
Put his hands around my soul
He took me down
To the blood red fountain
Water tastes like wine
And it tastes like wine
Like wine

Then I saw myself in the broken glass
I was never gonna last
Let it go
Then I heard a voice
Inside my head
Soon I will be gone
Let it go
St. Peter stood beside me
And I could not let it go

For 30 days and 30 nights
The sand did turn to snow
And somehow god did show his face
But how was I to know
It's all in my past

In my past
It's all in my past

Then I saw myself in the broken glass
I was never gonna last
Let it go
Then I heard a voice
Inside my head
Soon I will be gone
Let it go
St. Peter stood beside me
And I could not let it go

So long ago, from another time
I lost all control
The devil in the wilderness
Put his hands around my soul
It's all in my past

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it, let it go
