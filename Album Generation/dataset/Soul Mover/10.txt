LAST MISTAKE

You went down to ol' Mexico
I said you should not go there alone
29 in the midday sun
I'm not the only one
I should of have known
(That's when I heard a voice say to me)
And the wind gently whispers
And the sky being to crack
I've been far and wide
Now you throw me aside
It's just a lie

This was your last mistake
This was your only break
This was your last mistake
Now it's over, it's all over

I heard you went sailin' to the Ivory Coast
It's where you make the most of your time
Soon you'll be flying on a silver bird
You know I never heard of such a crime
(That's when my inner voice started talking to me)

Then the mountains did crumble
And the earth moved at my feet
I've been far and wide
Now you throw me aside
It's just a lie
