DON'T LET ME BLEED

I only wanted to be with you
And I just want you to know
That I can still hear your promises
In the fire glow
I need a shot of some Novocain
You twist the knife in my back
I feel the blood rushin' to my brain
There's an overflow

Don't let me bleed, don't let me bleed
No no no, don't let me bleed
Now how could I be such a fool?
You tell me, I've got no pity for you!

I heard a tale from a friend of mine
As he was crossing my path
He whispered words from the gallery
It's still haunting me
Too many seasons behind the door
You are a curse, now it's holy war
But there will be no resentment here
This is meant to be
