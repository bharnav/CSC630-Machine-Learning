DARK STAR

Don't want to shout it now
Cos I am not a fool
You're asking me the questions
And I will overrule
Down in Mississippi
On a road they watch the sky
There's something in the distance
And they choke and wonder why

Call the military
And the secret war defense
Let's make a big production
And capture the events
I'm not a fortuneteller
Now don't you hesitate
There's no communication
And I hope it's not too late

It's important to you
It's important to me
It's important to everyone

Another dark star fallin'
Another dark star callin'
Another dark star fallin'
Another dark star callin'

Take it to the government
The General's in a room
Take it to the preachers
Let 'em hear the sonic boom
Slipping into darkness
The hours getting late
Now tell me do you understand
We must Evacuate
