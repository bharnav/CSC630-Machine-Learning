"The Story"

Can i get a new head?
Cause the one i've got
Is worn out and so very broken
And now my mind feels dead
It's like an arcade game
An arcade game that won't take a token, no

We get lost
Lost along the way
It happens everyday
Lost along the way

How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will this life end?
How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will our lives end?

Can i get a new soul?
The one i got's been trampled on
The push and the pull
Like a bottle of gin at Al Anon
Can i get a new heart?
The one i got works way too hard
Like a prisoner of war
That's come home bruised and scarred

We get lost
Lost along the way
It happens everyday
Lost along the way

How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will this life end?
How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will our lives end?

(woah) yesterday seems so long ago
(woah) like a childhood dream, that shrank as you began to grow

How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will this life end?
How will the story end?
Where does the time go?
How will the story end?
All we really wanna know
How will our lives end?

Where's my voice?
Has it lost it's way?
As if we have a choice
Our character is measured by the words we say
It happens everyday
Lost along the way
Lost along the way
