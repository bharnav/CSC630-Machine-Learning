This weekend, we'll have a ball
We'll hit the town and see it all
So let's go out on Friday night
We'll go see a show, or get in a fight

So hold on tightly to me
We're going for a ride
In the sound (In the sound) of the stereo
Let the rhythm (Let the rhythm)
Let it take control of you
'Cause you ain't got nothing to lose

It's nice enough for the drive-in
Watching movies with my friends
Or times are good, and times are bad
But these are the best times that I've ever had

So hold on tightly to me
We're going for a ride
In the sound (In the sound) of the stereo
Let the rhythm (Let the rhythm)
Let it take control of you
Don't say this isn't happening
'Cause you ain't got nothing to lose

One of these days I'll be out of your way
And you can rest your head...
One of these days I'll be out of your way
And leave my weds unsaid

Don't let, Don't let, Don't let go 
Of the sound (of the sound)
Coming out your stereo
Let the rhythm (Let the rhythm)
Let it take control of you
Don't say this isn't happening
'Cause this is your weekend
'Cause you ain't got nothing to lose
