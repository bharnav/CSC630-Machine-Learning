Oh how I missed you
Oh how I needed you today
Oh how I missed you
Oh how I needed you today

'Cause life is like a waste of time
When you're not by my side
When you're not on this ride

So pack your bags there's nothing to it
Call in sick and stay
With me everyday
Call in sick and run away

Have you been dreaming?
Have you been wondering the same?
Oh how I missed you
Oh how I needed you today
It's never felt more to see your face
To wake up next to you
Inside your roaming grace

So pack your bags there's nothing to it
Call in sick and stay
With me everyday
Call in sick and run away
Call in sick and be
On the run with me
Call in sick and run away, away, with me

I've spent and i'm tired of getting bent
And i'm tired of always looking forward to a better day

I've spent and I hate feeling so used
And I hate my attitude
I've gone and lost and run away

(Call in sick and stay,With me
Everyday,Call in sick and run away.)

So pack your bags there's nothing to it
Call in sick and stay
With me everyday
Call in sick and run away
Call in sick and be
On the run with me
Call in sick and run away, away, with me
Runaway with me
