Drawing closer, end of days, with much still left undone
Even as I turn this phrase, the end has now begun

History is history, tomorrow never comes
Today's the only day we have, but now that day is done

Waiting for the world to end
Searchin' for the signs, devistation right on time
Waiting for the world to end
Ignoring what's been said, blind to rivers runnin' red
The doc did what he could, but we've lost too much blood

Large starin' eyes and love surprises, silence before sunrise
When you pay the highest prices, it's too late to open your eyes

History is history, tomorrow never comes
Today's the only day we have, but now that day is done

Waiting for the world to end
Searchin' for the signs, devistation right on time
Waiting for the world to end
Ignoring what's been said, blind to rivers runnin red
The doc did what he could, but we've lost too much...

The blood in my vains, burnin' aflame (4x)

Waiting for the world to end
Searchin' for the signs, devistation right on time
Waiting for the world to end
Ignoring what's been said, blind to rivers runnin' red

All creation will collide, and then begin again
