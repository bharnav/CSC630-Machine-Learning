You say you want me to say "I'm sorry."
But I don't have to and I don't want to say it
'Cause I'm not sorry

I play the game and I can't really say that I like it
Can't really say that I hate it
Can't really say that I paid attention

When grey skies turn blue
I'll come back for you
My mind can't change my heart there's nothing I can do

When grey skies turn blue
When dreams do come true
Will you be the way that I remember you

You say that life with me is driving you crazy
But I don't see it and I don't want see
So I, I must be crazy

I didn't mean a thing when I said "Nothing is fleeting."
Or worth repeating (Or worth repeating )
Or worth repeating (Or worth repeating )
When grey skies turn blue
I'll come back for you
My mind can't change my heart there's nothing I can do

When grey skies turn blue
When dreams do come true
Will you be the way that I remember you

The cold wind on my face
Is the only thing I felt
In such a long time
In such a long time
It's been a long time
Yeah, yeahâ€¦. Yeah

When grey skies turn blue
I'll come back for you
My mind can't change my heart there's nothing I can do

When grey skies turn blue
When dreams do come true
Will you be the way that I remember you

Will you be the way that I remember you
