Maybe it is dangerous, to invite us and to enter the room with us
But nothing's gonna light up and I'm not scared at all

When there's no more money in politics
They'll be tearing down the union brick by brick
There'll be city's running clinics about where we have been
With every self proclaimed historian
You know I know, you don't want this, you don't need this

I'm shining the light on the darkest places
You know and I know we have to face this now
We have to face this now

The days are growing dark what are we gonna do
The countrys in a bag when I turn on the tube
So maybe I'll just wake up in the afternoon (whooo)

You can change the channel on your tv
Push all the little buttons till your fingers bleed
But you won't change me (whooo)
There's nothing I would do for you, cause you don't wanna see
You know I know, you don't want this, you can't dismiss

Shining the light on the darkest places
You know and I know we have to face this now
We have to face this now
Shining the light on the darkest places
Putting the word out we have to face this now
We have to face this now

A generation, taking numbers, making calls
A shadow grew across my bedroom wall

Shining the light on the darkest places
You know and I know we have to face this now
We have to face this now
Shining the light on the darkest places
Putting the word out we have to face this now
We have to face this now
