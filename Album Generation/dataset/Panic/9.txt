Stack your bricks up to the sky
Name each one and throw them high
The trouble with trouble is it comes down fast
So watch out where you're goin' or you just won't last
(WOW-OH!!!)

[Chorus:]
You're an emotional anarchist
You're pissed cause you've never been kissed
You're drowning in a sea of anarchy
With your heart above your patches and a faith in democracy

Cover your eyes and block your ears
We've been lied to all these years
The trouble with trouble is you had a good time
You knew what you were doin' at the scene of the crime
(WOW-OH!!)

[Chorus]
[Interlude Part:]
Ashes To Ashes
We All Fall Down

[Chorus x2]
