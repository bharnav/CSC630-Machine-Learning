Late again
Forgive me friends
For I am late again
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try
'Cause I'm still late again

When they call my name outside those gates
I'll be on my way
Well that's all I can say
'Cause I'm late again

Late again
Forgive me friends
For I am late again
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try
'Cause I'm still late again

With all the saints, that don't place blame
On sunshine, rain or snow
Believe me 'cause I know

That I'm Late again
Forgive me friends
For I am late again
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try
'Cause I'm still late again

I was late coming into this world
I'll be late going out
I was late trying to put this record out

Go

Late again
Forgive me friends
For I am late again
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try
'Cause I'm still late again. [x2]

Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try
'Cause I'm still late again
