Without a window to see through
I did my time, in here without you
Slept on the floor down in the LEC
Meet me back home under the marque

It seems like misery loves misery
My favourite songs they keep me company
So many memories come down to this
I maybe be lost but i'm not hopeless

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away

Came in like static off the tv
This kinda thing never goes easy
I meant to tell you but you were gone
I tried to get it right, I got it all wrong

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away

Sat outside the show
With nowhere else, nowhere else to go
Don't say "can't see"
It sure does sound, good to me

(Whoa oaaa) Na Na Na Na Na (Whoa oaaa)
Don't save yourself....good to me
(Whoa oa) Na Na Na Na Na
Good to you....good to me

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
A mile away
