I hear the cold streets calling me, (cold streets)
I hear the cold streets calling me
I feel the dark dark swallow me, (dark dark)
And now the black it colours me

Whoa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa

I might push up screaming
'Cause I don't feel so alive
This is wrong not right
I'm all alone tonight
And i'm still dreaming

But when the cold streets fade away, (Cold streets)
When will the sun come back again
And all the back streets and alley ways, (back streets)
I see the cold streets night and day

Whoa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa

I might push up screaming
Wake me up from dreaming
'Cause I don't feel so alive
This is wrong not right
I'm all alone tonight
And im still dreaming
'Cause I don't feel so alive
This is wrong not right
I'm all alone tonight
I'm not alone tonight

Whoa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa (Whoa-oa-oa)

'Cause I don't feel so alive
This is wrong not right
I'm all alone tonight
And I'm still dreaming
'Cause I don't feel so alive
This is wrong not right
I'm all alone tonight
I'm all alone tonight
