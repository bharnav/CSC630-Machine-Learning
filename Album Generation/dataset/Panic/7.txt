Lie to me just one more time and maybe, I'll believe you
Promise me the world and what you're saying now is true
You can't hold me down

Kicking and screaming like a child
I'm out of control i'm running wild
Kicking and screaming and I want more
I've done things you can't ignore
So drag me around swing me out the door

Stab me in the back i've grown accustomed to the feeling
Time is ticking slowly, I feel older, but i'm dealing
You can't drown me out

Kicking and screaming like a child
I'm out of control i'm running wild
Kicking and screaming and I want more
I've done things you can't ignore
So drag me around swing me out the door
Kicking and screaming

Please don't marry me
Until you're sure im really dead
And don't complain to me
'Cause you won't get my sympathy

Kicking and screaming like a child
I'm out of control i'm running wild
Kicking and screaming and I want more
I've done things you can't ignore
So drag me around swing me out the door

Kicking and screaming like a child
I'm out of control i'm running wild
Kicking and screaming and I want more
I've done things you can't ignore
So drag me around swing me out the door
Kicking and Screaming
