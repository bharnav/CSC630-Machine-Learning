Get Me Out
I don't wanna move, I just wanna lay here
Shacky hands, sweaty sheets, can't get my mind in gear
My legs went numb 3hours ago
Blank starw, don't care what you think you know
Get me out!
I'm feeling around, alone in the dark
Can't find the switch, all I need is a spark or a match
To find a way out, just a silver of light
I'll crawl and I'll fight and I'll scratch and I'll bite
Get me out!
