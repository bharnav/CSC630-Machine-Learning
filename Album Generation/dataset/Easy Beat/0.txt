[Verse 1]
I can't remember what is wrong
I've been happy now for way too long
And oh, we got a lot more to go
I put a trash can by the road
And filled it up just to lighten my load
But oh, I got no where to go

[Chorus]
Someone alone fell asleep by the phone
Waiting like a dog for a bone
How can it be that a fish in the sea
Could feel like it's completely alone?
The world may never know

[Verse 2]
I know it hurt you, cause you cried
I know it killed you, but nobody died
And oh, the city is nothing but show
I found a needle in the hay
I found the sunshine at the end of the day
And oh, I found a pearl in the snow

[Chorus]
Someone alone fell asleep by the phone
Waiting like a dog for a bone
How can it be that a fish in the sea
Could feel like it's completely alone?
The world may never know
