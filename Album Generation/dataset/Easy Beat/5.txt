[Verse]
If i told you all my secrets they'd be lies
If i die a happy man, it's cause i finally learned to die
I've lived a fool's life, I have lived a fool's life
Now I am dying
Wanted you to turn and walk back in
Oh, they have come here by mistake
But I will take what i can take
I have lived a fool's life, I have lived a fool's life, baby
And now I am dying

[Bridge]
Would you say dark has sunlight?
(sun in dark and light)
Have i ever done anything right?
I ought to kill me
(i haven't got the right)
And do you mind if we come along?
(i wouldn't mind at all)
Would you please sing that song you just sung?
(waa-waa-waa)

[Outro]
Oh life is just some living with an end
I would've done so many things
You would've done if you were me
I have lived a fool's life, I have lived a fool's life, baby
And now I am dying
I am dying![x3]
I am dead!
