[Intro]
I recall the moment
Though I can't recall the day
Every other song to say
Okay

[Chorus]
Wait because
Another lifetime of words
We'll be forgotten, burned
By the time you read this letter

[Verse 1]
Sing because
Oh, but the scent of your past
Will be forgotten, gone
By the time you reach the pretender
Oh, my berries again
Will be razed and be burned
By the time you reach the pretender
If I'm not there
To remind ourselves
I'll send a friend
With a plan
I only wanted you to be obvious
I only need you to let go

[Chorus]
Wait because
Another lifetime of words
We'll be forgotten, burned
By the time you read this letter

[Verse 2]
All the scenes of our past
Sing because
Oh, but the scent of your past
Will be forgotten, gone
By the time you reach the pretender
Oh, my berries again
Will be forgotten. burned
By the time you reach the pretender
The coffee's gone
And the rooster's rich
I only call if I could work
I only want you to be obvious
I only need you to let go

[Chorus]
We don't need the shelter
And we barely feel the rain
We've been soaked to long to care
Or complain

[Outro]
We don't need the morning
And we barely need our names
I won't call the cause of comfort
Oh no, I'm not afraid
Ahhhh[x3]
