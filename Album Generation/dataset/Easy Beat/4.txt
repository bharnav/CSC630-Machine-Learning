[Verse 1]
Oh, in the cornfield beneath
Hangman Street
Is a rock with some initials
And beneath it is me
I need all your forgiveness and most of your love
You see, the hangman
You saw hanging
That wasn't who I was

[Chorus]
But nobody noticed
Nobody cared but me

[Verse 2]
Well, I knew she'd been unfaithful
But he knew she had to pay
So I grew to be more like him
With each passing of each day
But I slipped out on some side road
I thought things I'd never dared
So I went to a tool shed
Put shellac in my hand

[Chorus]
Oh, but nobody noticed
Nobody cared but me

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, ohhh
Well, I came to Dutchman Falls
With my hatchet and my dog
Well, she must have raised her hands
I must have cut her down like cake
And you know the man I was
He left me long enough
Was sad enough to say
Now we were a virtue
In pride and murder sin
I have no need for redemption
I had no need for you
