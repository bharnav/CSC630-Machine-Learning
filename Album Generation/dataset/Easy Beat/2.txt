[Verse]
If you're dead make a sound
I can put my ear to the ground
And sing a long now
Sing a long now
We were peas in a pod
Got to thank almighty god
That we're together
We're together
Oh no[x2
Fell a glance in the air
You can see what's way up there
In the stars now[x2]
There's no reason or rhyme
That can keep up with the time
So run along now
Run along now
Oh no[x3]

[Outro]
Heartbreak it looks like a snake in the grass
Oh no la la la la la
Oh no
Sweet dreams falling asleep at the wheel again
La la la la la oh no
Oh no alright come on
Ba da da da da da[x2]
Yeah[x2]
