[Verse 1]
It's all here
Today is the only day
The old times make way for the new
Some fruit punch
Spills on a tablecloth
But there are no no mess to clean up
Garbage in a can sticks together
The tiniest of things are forever

[Chorus]
Drop a couple coins and a feather
And watch them float away at the same time

[Verse 2]
Song is made with sugar and lemonade
Sing on the porch, swing along
Me and you having a barbecue
Sticking our thumbs in the air
Meeting of some notes on a pocket
Sitting in the sun with some chocolate

[Chorus]
Drop a couple pens and some pencils
And watch it all fall right into place
