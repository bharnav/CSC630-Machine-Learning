[Verse 1]
I just stayed there
And I was born at the scene of a crime
Every witness, well he was deaf and dumb
And blind

[Chorus 1]
Every highlight leads the high life, yeah
Doo-we oo-wee a baba (x2)
Every moment was a moment, ah
Doo-we oo-wee a baba (x2)

[Verse 2]
Well, how'd I get here?
You know I followed the billboard sign
Every product, well it follows me down the line

[Chorus 1]
Every daydream, every bad one, too
Doo-we oo-wee a baba (x2)
Every wish that you could wish for came true
Doo-we oo-wee a baba (x2)

[Bridge]
Every daydream, every bad one, too
Every wish that you could wish for came true

[Chorus 2] (x3)
Oh, wake up
Wake up, wake uuuup
We are only part of a dream
All the things in your heart
Like the things in your head
Are only what they seem

[Outro] (x4)
Hey, c'mon, man, everybody wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake uuuup
We are only a part of a dream
All the things in your heart
Like the things in your head
Are only what they seem
