[Verse 1]
Long distance, no need to shout
Close quarters, are not talking out loud
And I got to know
All over your open mouth
Words hang like they're just hanging out
But I got to know

[Chorus]
Where are you going crazy
In your mind or in everybody's mind?

[Verse 2]
Cold shoulders have run out of luck
Who knows what they're running from
I got to know
You're holding up an endless line
Putting pressure on my precious time
But I got to know

[Chorus]
Where are you going crazy
In your mind or in every inch of your body?
Say something
