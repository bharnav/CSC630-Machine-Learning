[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you

[Refrain]
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Verse 2]
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness

[Refrain]
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself

[Verse 3]
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me

[Refrain]
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself!

[Verse 3]
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me

[Refrain]
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
