[Intro]
Oh
Oh
I Like it
I like it a lot
Oh
I like it a lot
Oh
I like it a lot

[Verse 1]
I liked it
I liked it a lot
Steep there, sooner or not
Right there, there on the ground

[Chorus 1]
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did

I like it
I liked it a lot

[Verse 2]
I like everything about you
I like everything we try
I like everything we did then
I liked it so good inside
So good inside
I liked it
No, I liked it a lot
I liked it
Oh way to go
Take this
You did it a lot
It's better
Better then once

[Chorus 2]
I liked it
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot

[Verse 3]
Did I say I liked it?
Did I say that now?
Did I say I loved it?
Did you understand?
Did you get it right now?
Did it make sense?
Did it feel good now?

[Chorus 2]
Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot

[Chorus 1]
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did

[Chorus 2]
Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot
Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot
