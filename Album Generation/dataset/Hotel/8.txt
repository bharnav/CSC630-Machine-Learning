[Intro]
You would never make it
Inside , oh inside
Love you won't be alone
Inside, oh inside

[Chorus 1]
Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

[Chorus 2]
Pain
It's warm in here
So come inside
So come inside

[Verse]
How we will make it
Just you, you and me
Soon we'll take it
Just you, you and me

[Chorus 1]

Pain
Yeahhh
Pain
Yeahhh

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
