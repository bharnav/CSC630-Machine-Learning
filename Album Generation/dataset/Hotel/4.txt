[Intro]
Some things fall apart
Some things makes you hold
Somethings that you find
Are beyond your control

[Verse 1]
I love you and you're beautiful
You write your own songs
But if the right part is leaving
Turned out to be wrong

[Chorus]
If I could kiss you now
I'd kiss you now again and again
I don't know where I begin
And where you end

[Verse 2]
Thought I fell in love the other day
With an old friend of mine
I was running kisses
Down every inch of the spine
We had the roof down
The sun came shining in
The black fact is[?]
That I was thinking of you

[Chorus]
If I could kiss you now
Oh I'd kiss you now again and again
I don't know where I begin
And where you end

[Verse 3]
I slept in the sun the other day
I thought I was fine
Everything seemed perfect
Until I had you on my mind
I tried to love you
I did all that I could
I wish that the bad now
And finally turned into good

[Chorus]
If I could kiss you now
Oh I'd kiss you now again and again
I don't know where I begin
And where you end

[Outro]
If I could kiss you now
If I could kiss you now
If I could kiss you now
Oh where you end
Is where I begin
Oh where you end
Oh where you end
Oh where you end
