[Intro]
Two simple places
We wanted to go
Two simple things
You wanted to know

[Verse 1]
Everything around
I could not see
I wish I'd known
How much you loved me
Oh
We could feel this way forever
[2x]

[Verse 2]
I watched the sun
Cause it touches you while you sleep
You gave me something
That I wanted to keep
I see you smile you smile like a little child
And hold you crying when it all goes wild

[Outro]
Oh
We could feel this way forever
[6x]
