[Verse 1]
Babe
Oh, dream about me
Lie on the phone to me
Tell me no truth
If it is bad
There's enough in my life
To make me so sad

[Chorus]
Just dream about
Color fills our lives
Just dream about
Someone else tonight

[Verse 2]
Babe
Oh, dream about me
On the phone
Talking quietly
I want to be yours
Oh, won't you be mine
Against red skies
For all time

[Chorus]
So dream about us
When we're old
Just dream about
How I will let go

[Interlude]
And..
And...

[Verse 1]
Babe
Oh, dream about me
Lie on the phone to me
Tell me no truth
If it is bad
There's enough in my life
To make me so sad

[Chorus]
Just dream about
Color fills our lives
Just dream about
Someone else tonight
Just dream about
Color fills our song
Just dream about
How I will let go
