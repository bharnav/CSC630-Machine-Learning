[Intro]
Heaven
A gateway of hope
Just like a feeling
I need, it's no joke

[Verse 1]
And though it hurts me
To see you this way
Betrayed by words
I'd never heard
To hard to say them

[Pre-Chorus]
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone
To find my soul desire to go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone
To find my soul desire to go home

[Chorus]
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time

[Verse 2]
Each way I turn
I know I'll always try
To break the circle
That has been placed round me

[Verse 3]
From time to time
I find our lost
Semeaning
That was urgent

To myself
I don't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone
To find my soul desire to go home

[Chorus]
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time

[Bridge]
And I have never met anyone quite like you before
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
And I have never met anyone quite like you before
And I've never met anyone quite like you before

[Chorus]
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
