The world is always changing, you can see it every day
But in a tragic situation you just can't hide yourself away
So try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard
You're shining in the darkness when you open up your heart

Your love is all we need to bring us together
Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free, it comes down to us

Hungry babies on television, can you feel the shame?
We've got to keep on giving to one another, 'cause it's all gonna happen again
Why don't you try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard
Just think about what binds us and find a new place to start

Your love is all we need to bring us together
Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free, it comes down to us
Your love is all we need to bring us together
We're not indestructable, we're some kind of miracle
Happens every day
