At the devil's party nothing's a sin
At the devil's party we know where you've been
If we're all right then tell me who's wrong
The love in a war, where do we belong?

I might believe it's love, you might believe it's war

At the devil's party there's no light from the sun
At the devil's party, now, life's a loaded gun
More or less? No, less is more
Go on and be my guest
Where do we belong?

I might believe it's love, you might live a little more

Dreams of yours, dreams of mine
Dreams of all that shine on the other side, on the other side

At the devil's party watch them stare in vain
At the devil's party, now, you're no friend of mine
Oh, lonely days of the road to excess
When you're on fire you burn like the rest

I might believe it's love, and you might believe it's war
Why don't we take a little less? Then we could live a little more

Dreams of yours, dreams of mine
Dreams of all that breathe on the other side, on the other side
