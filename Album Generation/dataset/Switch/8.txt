Sex is sex and love is love, mix 'em both up, baby, that's the stuff
I can't believe I'm seeing the world come tumbling, crumbling down
Yeah, this love the world's receiving, more chance of it on shutting down
Shutting down, yeah, yeah

Like it or not, love is the God
Love is the, love is the God
Like it or not, love is the God
Love is the God

So put your guns down on the ground, yeah, peace, it makes such a pretty sound
I can't believe I'm seeing the world come tumbling, crumbling down
You won't believe the feeling when it's all coming back around
Coming 'round, yeah, yeah

Love is the God, yeah, like it or not
Love is the, love is the, yeah, love is my God
Like it or not, love is God

Love is my God, yeah, yeah, like it not
Love is the, love is the, yeah, like it or not
Love is the, yeah, like it or not
Love is the, love is the, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, love is the God
Love is the, oh, like it or not
Love is the, love is the, yeah
Love is the God

Love is God
