[Verse 1]
I'm stranded at the edge of the world
It's a world I don't know
Got nowhere to go
Feels like I'm stranded

[Bridge]
And I'm stranded between that Ol devil And the deep blue sea
And nobody's gonna tell me
Tell me what, what time it is

[Chorus]
Every day, every day
It's hustle, hustle time, hustle time
Every day and every way, one more
One more mountain to climb

[Verse 2]
It's leaving me stranded
In my own little island
With me eyes open wide
But I'm feeling stranded

[Bridge]
Every, every
Every day it's hustle time
Every way
One more mountain to climb

[Outro]
I'm stranded between the devil
And the deep blue sea
There ain't nowhere else to be
'Cept right here and I'm stranded
