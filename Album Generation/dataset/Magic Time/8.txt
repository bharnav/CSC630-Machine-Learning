Old empty bed, springs hard as lead
Something I said made you see red
What did I do
To feel so lonely and blue

Even the mouse
Up and ran from the house
Laughed at me so scornfully
What did I do
To feel this lonely and blue

I cried and I sighed
But that don't help my game no no no no
I tried to hide
But things don't seem the same, oh

How will it end, I ain't got no friend
My only sin is your grin
Oh what did I do
To feel this lonely and blue

I cried and I sighed
But that don't help my game
I tried to hide
Things don't seem the same, oh

How will it end, ain't got no friend
My only sin was in your grin
Oh what did I do
To feel so lonely and blue, oh yeah
