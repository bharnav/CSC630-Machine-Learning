Evening Train by Van Morrison

Love to hear that evening train go by
Love to hear that evening train go by
Specially when I babysit my mind

Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow
Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow
Then I make my way on down the road

Chorus:
My, my, bye, bye
Don't cry, don't sigh
When I hear that evening train go by….alright!

Love to hear that evening train on time
Love to hear that evening train on time
Specially with those worries on my mind

Chorus:
My My, Don't cry
Why why? Don't sigh
When you hear that evening train go by

Love to see those fields I used to roam
Love to see those fields I used to roam
Now I know I'm on my way back home

Chorus:
My my. Good bye
Don't cry, Don't sigh
When ya hear that evening train go by………..one more time

When you hear that evening train go by
