I'm confessin' that I love you
Tell me do you love me too
I'm confessin' that I need you
Honest, honest I do, I do, oh yeah

In your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
I read such strange things
But your lips deny that they are true
Baby will your answer
Really change things
Making me blue

I'm afraid some day
You're gonna leave me
Saying why can't we still be friends
If you go
You know you're gonna grieve me
'Cause all my life on you depends

I'm guessing
Guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams, dreaming dreams

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
Woohh, I'm confessin' that I love you
Over, over, over, over and over again

Woohh, I'm afraid some day, some day
You're going to leave me
Saying baby, can we still be friends
Old friends now
If you go, if you go
You know you're gonna grieve me
'Cause all my life on you depends

I'm guessing that you love me, yeah
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
Oh, I'm confessin' that I love you
Over and over and over and over
And over and over again
I'm confessin' that I love you
Over and over and over
All over again, oh yeah
