{Chorus}
You gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay
Got to fight with all your might
Not to get in the bleeding heart's way

[Verse 1]
You gotta fight for your rights
You can't bury your head in the sand
You gotta fight for your rights
You can't just bury your
Head in the sand
Politics and religion, superstition
Go hand in hand

[Verse 2]
Well you're going through the motions
And they can't hear a word you say
Well you're going through the motions
They don't want to hear a word you say
Got to keep boredom at bay
And keep mediocrity away

{Chorus}
Gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day
To keep mediocrity at bay
Got to fight with all your might
Not to get in the bleeding heart's way
