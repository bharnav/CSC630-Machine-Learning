[Verse 1]
What if
What if I never slept around, never cheated on you girl
What if
What if I didn't break your heart and never ever ruined your world
What if
What if I always was a real man, faced you face
To face told you the truth?
What if
What If I never ever tripped when you said you wanted
To go out and hang with your crew?
What if
What if I was a different man, than I was?
What if
What if I wasn’t so selfish and took one second just to listen to you
What if
What if I was alone? On my own
What if
What if I wasn’t so damn controlling, you would still be right here

[Hook]
We would still be together, be together, be together right now (3x)
We would still be together, we would still be together girl

[Verse 2]
What if
What if I didn’t have lame excuses for all the stuff that I do?
What if
What if I had no baby mommas, no damn drama and I never brought it round you
What if
What if never called you out your name and treated you like you were my queen
What if
What if I woke up from this madness and this shit was just a dream
What if
What if I really went to work and didn't spend a whole day creeping?
What if
What if you were at the beauty shop and you didn't hear about me last weekend?
What if
What if you ever asked me a question and I didn't stut-stut-stutter all of the time?
What if
What if I wasn’t so damn controlling, you would still
What if
What if I never said I do when I knew that I wasn’t ready for you
What if
What if I gave a damn to my church and did to get off in the VIP

[Outro]
We would still be together girl
