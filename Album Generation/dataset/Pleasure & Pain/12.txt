Is it me who never compromise
Only see things through my eyes
Which means it's my way
Or is it you who's always shutting down
Never wanting to talk about
The problems we've got

Pre-chorus
Or is it we to blame for all that's goin' down
Always say that I love you but
We can't work it out
It's making us not wanna stay around
We need to sit down

Chorus
Why can't we, why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long
Why can't we, why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we've gotta go home
X2

Tell me why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat
Is it true that I'm sorta unreasonable
And I don't know how to love
Even though God sent me to you

Repeat Pre-chorus
Repeat Chorus

I just can't see it in why just go at each other this way
'Cause you know, like I know
We're better than that
Girl I have tried everything
In the humblest way
To be more than just your man
'Cause you deserve the best
To get with the best
Who just can't throw it away

Repeat Chorus

You know I love you
And I know you love me
Girl we gotta believe
Ohh why can't we get along
When we both know that this is home
Baby why why why

Why can't we, why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long
Why can't we, why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we've gotta go home
