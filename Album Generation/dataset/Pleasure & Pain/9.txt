(feat. T. I.)

[Intro:]
Yo, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay it's T. I. P man, king of the south
Rubber band man, boing
With my 4 1-12
Letting all those suckers for lord know man
Keep you girl out the club if you want 'em
Make no mistake we will take your broads

[Verse:]
We be rolling with T. I
See you come through
Baby quit your man he be cuffing you
And we like wow, jeans on you
Chick got a fat ass what she needs too
Baby don't care in them streets
Seeing how bad you wanna give it to me
I was saying no
To get in there sweet
She better know what the rules gon' be

[Hook:]
When you stick, when we split ain't no hits
Won't you come here with me
I'm a chill, how cite you are
What you don't know how to let it go
You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know

[Chorus:]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

[Verse 2:]
Say it, don't flinch, let me shirt this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you wanna front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you started grabbing it
I already know how to handle you
Can do you
Before I put the hands on you
I'm a beat that thing
Like your man should do
But I don't want a repercussion when we do

[Hook:]
When you stick, when we split ain't no hits
Won't you come here with me
I'm a chill, how cite you are
What you don't know how to let it go
You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know

[Chorus x2]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

[Rap: T. I.]
The grey goose make you wanna get loose
Got your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe
'Cause the rims same colour as the ride and the roof
Or maybe 'cause your friend wanna ride with me too
Maybe it's the way a nigga shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like ro or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cufflinks like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell 'em once, have 'em finished like a G
You're running with the baldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
What you have to understand

[Chorus:]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

[Outro:]
Body sick
Gotta come here with me
112
We can hit
Body thick
Gon' be tripping with me
