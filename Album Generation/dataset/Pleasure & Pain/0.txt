[112 + (Slim)]
Let me show you that I care
(Baby, let me show you)
Make you feel so right
(Girl, you feel so good to me)
You and me tonight
Baby, I wanna know if you can come with me
Baby, I'm ready (Baby, I'm ready)
I'm ready for your love
I wanna know if you can come with me
(Can you come with me? Can you come with me?)
Baby, I'm ready (So ready)
You know the time is now (Woo...)

Time is right
Don't be shy
Spend the night
And let me come in-side tonight
Turn down the lights
I wanna love you, girl (I wanna love you)
Time is right
Don't be shy
Spend the night
And let me come in-side tonight
Turn down the lights
I wanna love you

[Outro: Slim]
Oh, oh, I wanna love you
Oh girl, you feel so good to me
I'm so ready, so ready...
