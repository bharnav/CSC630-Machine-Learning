Crossword puzzles done in ink
Down across a waste of thinking power
It's precisely those who can
Who should be doing something else

Little heard, nothing to gain
Tell me which side's which again
Silent wars that we can't use
Come in colors we refuse to see

Dirty world
Look away
Disappear
Turn the page
Let's hang up
On what we're not
They're not us
It can't hurt like it would to us
Is this where I'm supposed to cry
Is this where I'm supposed to cry

Cherries, almonds, dates and apricots
Mesmerized by Cali's dream geometries
Highway 5's ghastly slaughter fields
Roll the window up
Your nightmare's come to take your breath away
Breath away

Dirty world
Look away
Disappear
Turn the page
Let's hang up
On what we're not and what we'll never be
It can't hurt like it would us
Is this where I'm supposed to cry
Is this where I'm supposed to cry
Is this where I'm supposed to cry
Is this where I'm supposed to cry
