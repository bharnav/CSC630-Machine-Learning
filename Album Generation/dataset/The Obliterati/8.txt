She said fuck it all
Who's gonna hear me when I call?
Someone's locked out in the hall
It's me, I am

I never get the message
It never comes
I only hear the howling wind

She said fuck it all
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
Someone's locked out in the hall
It's me, I am

Oh it's you
Now it's gone
I careen
Towards the dawn

I know where to go
It's the rest that I don't know
Someone said I'm gonna blow away
Careening with conviction

I know where to go
It's the rest that I don't know
Someone said I'm gonna blow away
Careening with conviction

Now I'm here
Now I'm gone
I careen
Towards the dawn
