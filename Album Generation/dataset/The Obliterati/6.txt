I know you
...
You are mine

Luck survives
Luck arrives
Walk to the beach
What will you see
What will you see
See through those eyes

I know you
...

I know you
...
I am yours

I see you
Framed through time
Live ever live?
Fields full of days
...
...

I know you
...
Pluck your eyes
Luck survives
What will you see
See through those eyes
