Ooooo

I stood on the bridge but I could not see
Stood on the bridge but could not see
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

It could've been a bad telemarketing joke
A bad telemarketer's joke
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

The coffee shop was there but it had bad electronics
Really really bad electro
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

The thousand nights spent on the floating ship
I wish I had another night
Another night, another night
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

You said my name was hyperallergenic
You said I was not hyperreal
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

I need another night on the floating platform
I need to float another night
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

Ooooo

I stood on the bridge but I could not see
Stood on the bridge but could not see
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

It could've been a bad telemarketing joke
A bad telemarketer's joke
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

You said my name was hyperallergenic
You said I was not hyperreal
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

I need another night on the floating platform
I need to float another night
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)
(One thousand & one, a thousand & one pleasant dreams)

Ooooo
