Ho!

Out of the troubled waters
Out of the swirling gloom
We may find within the world
In that tangled room

I wanted everything
You want everything
We need everything
And we'll get everything

You said it is your birthday
Let's make it last and last
We need a calm place to call home
Call home

I wanted everything
You want everything
We need everything
And we'll get everything

Pulled, two worlds collide
They stick together

If two worlds collide
They stick together

PUlled, two worlds collide
They stick together

When two worlds collide
They stick together

The tensioned wheel collapses
The tensioned wheel collapses
The tensioned wheel collapses

I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
I've found a home
I've found a home

She's comin' home
She's comin' home
This is that home
This is that home
