Yeah
Ba-ba-ba bah-bah-ba-bah bah bah ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba bah-bah-ba-bah bah bah ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba bah-bah-ba-bah bah bah ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba bah-bah-ba-bah bah bah ba-bah
Yeah
Ba-ba-ba bah-bah-ba-bah bah bah ba-bah

All enveloping water all encompassing love
It's a vise-like grip inside your glove
I'm just a rabbit caught in the headlights
Encased in stone, encased in air
Encased in some kind of lead

Noooo

I'm just a kamikaze
Sneakin' out the door
Oh look out! Geronimo!
Let yourself go
Let yourself go

Well the organs are playing
But nobody knows
This thing is gonna blow
Let yourself go
Let yourself go

I wear the shackles
Of your uptight age
Now look what you did!
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
