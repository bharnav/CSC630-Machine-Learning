Feelin' kinda punk
Maybe 'cuz it's good not great
You say I never think to say this or that like you told
Think you're gonna set you free
Perhaps you have forgotten it's been fully documented and admitted that it's not about
Me me me me me me me me me
(Yeah, and we all know it)

You can look it up
Fight number forty-seven
Chapter two, section three

Here we go again
Take you down the track again
You say I never like to talk gotta fidget move around cannot sit for just three secs
Have you considered that I just might have the OCD or ADD please pass me the DSM
And how 'bout a little compassion while we're at it

You want verse again
Please refer to forty-seven
Chapter two, section three
