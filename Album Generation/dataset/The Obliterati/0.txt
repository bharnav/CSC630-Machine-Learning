Take a look inside
What did you think you'd find
F-ed up on coke and cigarettes
With all that passes here for lies
Jet planes that fall out of black skies
And vanish without trace
You've got me dead to rights
I'm a liar

You go, I'll follow
You hide, I'll find you out
You dare find your way
You've got me dead to rights
I'm a liar

It's the leisure of the mind
Don't make me say the same thing twice
It's far quicker to pretend
"Haven't things always been this way"
Take my hand, repeat after me
"don't make the same mistake twice"
Don't make the same mistake twice

If you step outside
What's left of what was right
There's no more north, east, south or west
The cup is gone, the heart grows tired
The mind is weak, the skull's on fire
We're damaged without trace
You've got me dead to rights
I'm a liar

You go, I'll follow
You hide, I'll fuck you up
You dare, find your way
You've got me dead to rights
I'm a liar
You've got me dead to rights
I'm a liar
You've got me dead to certain rights
I'm a liar
