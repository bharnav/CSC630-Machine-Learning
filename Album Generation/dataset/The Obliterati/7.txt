And it probably works to the better
That you're there and I'm over here
Continentalistical prophilaxis
Courtesy of the great divide

History repeats itself
Fast forward through tragedy
'Cause farce is waiting there for us
With open arms and guarantees
Of such ridiculosity
To make eyes roll and bowties spin
We're the last to see

Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey-oo

And it doesn't seem to get any better
Little action loads of talk
Time to step up to the plate and take your haggis like a man

Itself repeats history
Fast forward through tragedy
'Cause farce is waiting there for us
With open arms and guarantees
Of such ridiculosity
And dignities in full retreat
We head up the ??

What the harm in stumbling
Blessed with two left feet
And as the cookie's crumbling
It never tastes so sweet

Aoooooo

Pursuits of happiness
Mortal embarassments
History repeats itself
A man in decline

Will it ever or never get better?
Will it ever or never get better?

Can I tickle your ass with a feather?
Can we make up and make up forever?
Will it ever or never or ever or never
Or ever never ever or never get better?
