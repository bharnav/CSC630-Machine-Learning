This picture just got fuzzy
Blurred and gray
So let's cut the books
Slip one by
Who cares anyway
Maybe there's a time and place
To punctuate

Late at night we all sleep fine
As long as zany lines can be erased
Or just defaced
Bounding over boundaries
Bounding over boundaries
...
...
...
...

Let me introduce you
To the wall
Where you all
Begin and I end
At a spot
A black dot
A full stop

Yeah the great divide
It's all black and white
They get away with chopping lines
It all comes to light
Bounding over boundaries
Bounding over boundaries
...
...

Let me introduce you
To the wall
Where you all
Begin and I end
At a spot
A black dot
A full stop

Yeah

Preaching the philosophy of the stop sign
They ...
We're all the structures of obstructions
And they won't get out of your way
Well the absolute, the finite, the immovable
They don't care what you have to say
They shuck off jive
They sweetly stride
It's all gonna hit someday
We all gotta learn
