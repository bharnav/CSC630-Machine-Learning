I'm amazed, inside your gaze alone
Eyes stay wide when I'm inside and on and on
Pull up a chair, next tune is gonna be mine (?)
Eating dinner on Matador's dime
I kinda knew what was in store, oh yeah
Body and soul all hidden inside, well come-on
The cycle spins like an insane machine
But I can ride it now because I know what it means
The world flips when an animal gets its soul

I wanna give and live with you today
I wanna find the place where we're ok
I wanna shred that Spider's Web
I wanna set the freeze-dried kittens free

I kinda knew what was in store, oh yeah
Body and soul all hidden inside, well come-on
The cycle spins like an insane machine
But I can ride it now because I know what it means
The world flips when an animal gets its soul

I wanna give and live with you today
I wanna find the place where we're ok
I wanna shred that Spider's Web
I wanna set the freeze dried kittens free
