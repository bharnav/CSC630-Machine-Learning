Mmm-hmm, looking back at you

Looking back at you
I've lost a lot
You've got a lot
Miss you a lot
I miss you
(x2)

A-ha-ha-hey, Smokey, when I speak your name
Ah, Smokey, you do something to my brain
Hey, Smokey, I'm like a dog on your chain
Smokey baby, you got me singing this sweet refrain

Looking back at you
I've lost a lot
You've got a lot
Miss you a lot
I miss you
(x2)

Hold on, Smokey, baby, I love you
Hold on, Smokey, baby, I can feel you go
Ah, hold on, Smokey baby
Smokey baby, you got me playing this sweet refrain

Smokey baby, you got me playing this sweet refrain

Looking back at you
I've lost a lot
You've got a lot
Miss you a lot
Whoa-whoa-whoa whoa whoa-whoa
(x15)
