[Hook]
We are back in our minds, again
We are back in our minds, again
We are back in our minds, again

[Verse]
We don't fight no more
We done close that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brother
Livin' in this world we all live in

[Hook]
We are back in our minds, again
We are back in our minds, again
We are back in our minds, again

[Verse]
We don't fight no more
We done close that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brother
Livin' in this world we all live in

[Outro]
Back in our minds again
