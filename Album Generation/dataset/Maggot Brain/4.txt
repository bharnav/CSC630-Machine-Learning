Super stupid bought a five cent bag
Thought it was coke, but it was smack
Super stupid took a one and one
Then his eyes begin to book, his nose begin to run

Oh, stupid with your ups and downs
Your maggot brain, your grins and frowns
Super stupid you're here today
You've lost the fight and the winner is fear
