[Band intro]

[Verse 1]
You know I woke up this morning, people
The first thing I did was to look into your eyes
In that space where I used to find so much truthfullness
Was a stone cold pack of lies

[Chorus 1]
You know there's somethin's goin' on
Somethin' goin' on but I don't know what it is
Somethin' goin' on, people

All right

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
I went on down to the mailbox
Seems I got the phone bill yesterday
Charging me for some hour conversation
From someone in L.A

[Chorus 2]
I know there's somethin' goin' on
Somethin' goin' on, but I don't know what it is
Somethin' goin' on behind my back
I better get to the bottom of this

[Long guitar solo]

[Short bass break]

[Piano solo]

[Break]
Now, wait a minute

[Call and response between lead vocal and saxophone]
I wanna hear you blow now
Go ahead, go ahead
I want you to blow for all the men whose women who don't keep a true love now
I want you to blow for all the people who have to face an empty bed now
Go ahead, blow one for yourself
Blow one for me too

[Vocal ad-lib]
Yeah, listen
You got to love your woman in the morning
You got to love your woman in the night
You got to love your woman all the time
To make her feel all right
You got to give her what she wants
When she wants it
How she wants it
Anytime she might think she wants it
Wah!

[Verse 3]
When you're lovin' your woman people
Both of you know the score
You know it can make a long-time man suspicious
To come home to an unlocked door

[Chorus 3]
You finally know somethin' goin' on
Somethin' goin' on, but you don't know what it is
Somethin' goin' on people
I better get to the bottom of this
Look out!

[Call and response between lead vocal and band]
