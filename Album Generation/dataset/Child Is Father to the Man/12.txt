If I ever leave you
You can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you baby
You know I hurt myself as well

Is that any way for a man to carry on ?
You think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't makin' too much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on ?
You think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not tryin' to be any kind of man
I'm tryin' to be somebody you can love, trust and understand
I know that I can dream, yeah
A part of you that no one else could see
I just gotta hear, hear you say : 'It's all right, yeah, yeah, yeah'

I'm only flesh and blood
I can be anything that you demand
I could president of General Motors baby, heh
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that any way for a man to carry on ?
You think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you babe, I love you babe
I love you more than you'll ever know

Yeah
Yeah, yeah

If I ever leave you
You can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you
You know I hurt myself as well

Is that any way for a man to carry on ?
You think he wants his little loved one gone
I tried to tell I love you baby, love you baby, yeah love you baby
I love you more than you'll ever know, ooh yeah yeah ...

I love you, I love you, I love you baby

Well all right!
I told you so many times before
I love you, I love you, I love you
If you don't know then I'll tell you one more time
I love you, I love you, I love you ..
