[Verse 1]
My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold

[Verse 2]
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?

[Verse 3]
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could understand

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

[Outro]
When will I see you again?
