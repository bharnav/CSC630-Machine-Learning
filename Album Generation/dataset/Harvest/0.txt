[Verse 1]
Think I'll pack it in
And buy a pick-up
Take it down to "L.A."
Find a place to call my own
And try to fix up
Start a brand new day

[Pre-Chorus]
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
She got pictures on the wall
They make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road
Trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head

[Pre-Chorus]
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
Oh

[Harmonica Outro]
