[Chorus A]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

[Verse 1]
Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings
Could be good things
In the air for you

[Chorus B]
We are leaving. We are gone
Come with us to all alone
Never worry. Never moan
We will leave you all alone

[Verse 2]
In the mountains, in the cities
You can see the dream
Look around you. Has it found you?
Is it what it seems?

[Chorus A]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard
