[Verse 1]
It's been a blast
But we've been caught
Packing up your suitcase
Hard day, long face
Get the story right
Get the story right
Get the story down

[Chorus]
Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June

[Verse 2]
It's been alright
But we have fought
Ways of the samurai
Perry thrust, do or die
Not the fighting type
Not the killing kind
Get the story down

[Chorus]
Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June

[Verse 3]
I heard the news
I'll send a card
Cellar door, Friday night
Long johns, hold tight
Put it on a page
Put it on a line
Get the story down

[Chorus]
Waltzing right out of the room
Be good when your parents stay over in June
