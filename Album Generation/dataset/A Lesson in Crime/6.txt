[Verse 1]
Don't forget to write
Don't forget to write
They buried me
In southwest France
La Ferrassie you know I am

[Verse 1]
Don't forget to write
Don't forget to write
They buried me
In southwest France
La Ferrassie you know I am

[Ending]
The kids were teething
When they put me underground
No one ever saw breathing
La Ferrassie you know I'm found
