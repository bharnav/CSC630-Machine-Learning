[Intro]
(Operator, get me the President of the world. This is an emergency.)

[Verse 1]
Do your neighbour a favour
Collect their morning paper
Clip out all the sad bits, no one wants to read that
Let them take their kids to school and the zoo in peace

[Chorus]
When you're standing near
Tokyo Police Club
When you're standing next to me
Tokyo Police Club
When you take the tunnel
Arresting you for being in love

[Verse 2]
Caught the fever that's spreading
Do you have a warm bed we could stay the night in?
It's all sick boys in this house, no one wants to feed us
Dumb kid you should have hid you'd stand a better chance there

[Chorus]
When you're standing near
Tokyo Police Club
When you're standing next to me
Tokyo Police Club
Lost in the Pacific
Arresting you for being in love
