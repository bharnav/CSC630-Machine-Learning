(No we can't!)

[Verse 1]
See the ruins of the old world below
That's what our ancestors left us
But our robot masters will know
How to clean this mess up
And build a better world
For man and machine alike
For the boys and the girls
Who are slaves building spaceships at night
In the fluorescent light
That's 2009

[Break]
No we can't
No we won't
No we can't
No we won't

[Verse 2]
Cold frosty Martian mornings
The chill on my breath is red
Redder than my mother's blood
When she turned to me and said
“This is not how we planned it
We've gotten ahead of ourselves
Computers rule the planet
And the moon and mars as well
We lost the fight”
That's 2009

[Verse 3]
I have a microchip
Implanted in my heart
So when I try to escape
The robots will blow me apart
And my limbs will go flying
And land before the ones that I love
Who would wail and would weep
But the robots would keep them at bay
While I shut my eyes
For the very last time

[Outro]
Citizens of tomorrow
Be forewarned
