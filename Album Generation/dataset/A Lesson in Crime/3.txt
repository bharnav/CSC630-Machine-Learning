[Verse 1]
Another stone rolls over
The republic is just one more year older
But way out in the distance
We see your white boots glisten in the sun

[Chorus 1]
We know you've come here with a plan
To lift our city out of ruin
Shoulders back and arms at our sides
We sincerely hope you know just what you're doing

[Verse 2]
Another stone rolls over
The republic is just one more year older
But way out in the distance
We see you draw your pistols and aim at us

[Chorus 2]
At first we try to reason with you
But you suggest we say our prayers
Shoulder back and arms in the sky
We sincerely hope you live a better life

[Outro]
Cause you
You're so calm
I don't know where you are from
You
You're so young
I don't care what you've done wrong
