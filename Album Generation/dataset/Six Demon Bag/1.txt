Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman

He traveled across the sea in the belly of a Japanese (say wha?) businessman on a pleasure ship to France

Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman

My house!
My house!

Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fee Fi Fo Fum (growls)
