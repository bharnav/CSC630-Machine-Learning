Please don't go and build a fence around your heart
Like you've done before
When you're losing ground
I know i can't wait
I don't even have the strength to begin to imitate the dying little bird you've saved when the night breaks
And the clouds shake
And your hopes ache to someday be redeemed
Please don't go and build a fence around your heart
Like you've done before when your losing grace
And i know i can't wait
I don't even have the strength to begin to imitate the dying little bird you've saved when the night breaks
And the clouds shake
And your hopes ache to someday be redeemed
Her face is a curtain of this truth i'm certain i know i know i know
So please don't go and build a fence around your heart like you've done before when you're losing ground
I know i can't wait
I don't even have the strength to begin to imitate the dying little bird you've saved
