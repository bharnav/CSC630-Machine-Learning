Say goodnight to those bittersweet days
When you could tell someone that you loved 'em
And you wouldn't lose your shame
And now you gotta bite your tongue
And feel the cold blood running down your face

Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider

You drink yourself sideways to try to remain
For a turn at birth you unearth
The beast you'll never tame
And now you've found someone to hold
Who's gonna leave you empty and alone

Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider

But you've got the fever, girl
And I've got the fever
We've got the fever, girl
Now we're cursed to the bone

Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider

You should always run
With a loaded gun in your mouth (repeat)

I'll fight off evil snakes
Break bottles at your wake
Tell the black widow spider on the pillow
I love her, I'll die for you
When the cops come around
Questionin` your whereabouts

Well I will lie, I will lie, I will lie
I will lie in the dust for you

You should always run
With a loaded gun in your mouth

Kiss on the lips
Oh, these cold, chaotic times!
You cannot run the holy war
So what's the use of trying?
And all the world goes to shit
You've already lived with years and years of it

Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider
Spider Cider

You've got the fever, girl
And I've got the fever
We've got the fever, girl
Now we're cursed to the bone
