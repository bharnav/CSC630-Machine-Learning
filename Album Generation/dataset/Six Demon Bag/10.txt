I can smell your blood
You're gonna do bad things tonight

Crawl back to the cave
Crawl back to the cave

I'll hide in the dark
And I'll carve out his heart
And I'll wear it 'round my head like a nape of pride

Crawl back to the cave

I can smell your blood
You're gonna be a filthy beast tonight

When they come to arrest me I black out!
Thank god for my own protection I black out!

Lady, we will pray on your grave
Lady, we will pray on your grave
