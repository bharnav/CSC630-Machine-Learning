I don't wannna know your name (my vice grips)
I don't wanna know your name (bad vice cops)
I don't wanna know your name (the prescription doesn't scan)
We start shrinking
When we hit that grill you know we will
Don't beat around the black jack night
Don't beat around the black jack night
Don't beat around the black jack night
Don't beat around the black jack night
(My brain hurts, you're own your own from here)

Black Jack Night x 8

(My maid works faster than yours.)
(My face looks better than yours.)
(My feet beat louder than yours.)
(My grandmas better than yours.)

Mustache, Mustache, Mustache, Mustache, Mustache. x 4

The carney's not my son x 8

Don't beat around the Black Jack Knight
Don't wanna shave my mustache ride
Don't wanna see my head in lights
Don't wanna be the "Son of Sound"
