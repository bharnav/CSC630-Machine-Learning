Am I supposed to close my eyes as you walk away from me?
Am I supposed to blind myself so I'll never have to see
You walking side by side with a different kind of man
Who'll redefine your body in ways I know I...

What if I don't want to go now
Will you come put these eyes out

So don't go and blame your mother for what's your father's fault
Or all of your daughters will turn out just like you
Bent on destruction and burning through your beauty
And looking beyond your years by the time you're only...

What if I don't want to go now
Will you come put these eyes out

Oh, c'est la vie, please don't go and abandon me
When the bridge burns down and the bad blood tastes like wine on the wind
(And they say) Beware of the man in shades, beware
Beware of the man in shades, beware

I stutter step my way across desert lakes to try to sweat the ghost of the past
So I can lay my anchor at last at your feet

(As they say) Beware of the man in shades, beware
Beware of the man in shades, beware

I am the man in shades, yes I am
I am the man in shades, yes I am
I am the man in shades, yes I am (and this ship will sail, and this heart won't die)(x5)

Oh, c'est la vie, please don't go and abandon me
When the bridge burns down and the bad blood tastes like wine on the wind

I am the man in shades, yes I am (and this ship will sail, and this heart won't die) (x3)
