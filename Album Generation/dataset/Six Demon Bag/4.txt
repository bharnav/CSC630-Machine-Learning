Will we ever find the one that we were meant to love like
We want to be loved?
Take this flight into the sun
Or did they die in a dry hump fire years before we were born?
When all the hogs devoured the dogs like lightening after the storm

And her lips were wet, like a rose with summer sweat
And when our eyes met, I knew I was dead

Tiptoes on cobblestones in glass stilettos, it breaks my knees when she
Hides her nosebleeds in my dreams as I sleep

And I know I'll never be the man that she thinks she really needs
But it don't stop me from trying to be
And I scream (I scream)

Oh goddamn you, miette, goddamn
I let down my guard and you lifted this heart so now it can break again
Oh goddamn you, miette, goddamn
I let down my guard and there goes my heart straight out the window again

Goddamn
Goddamn
Goddamn
God bless
