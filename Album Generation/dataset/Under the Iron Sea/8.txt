[Verse 1]
Who is the man I see
Where I'm supposed to be?
I lost my heart, I buried it too deep
Under the iron sea

[Chorus 1]
Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall

[Verse 2]
Lines ever more unclear
Not sure I'm even here
The more I look, the more I think that I'm
Starting to disappear

[Chorus 2]
Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong

[Bridge]
I don't know where I am
And I don't really care
I look myself in the eye
There's no one there
I fall upon the earth
I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare

[Chorus 2]
Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong

[Instrumental outro]
