[Verse 1]
An old fairytale told me
The simple heart will be prized again
A toad will be our king
And ugly ogres our heroes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then you'll shake your fist at the sky
"Oh, why did I rely
On fashions and small fry?"

[Verse 2]
All promises broken
Feed your people, or lose your throne
And forfeit your whole kingdom
I'd sooner lose it than still live in it alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You were our golden child
But the gentle and the mild
Inherit the earth while

[Chorus]
Your prince's crown
Cracks and falls down
Your castle hollow and cold
You've wandered so far
From the person you are
Let go, brother, let go
'Cause now we all know

[Bridge]
Soon someone will put a spell on you
Perfume, treasure, sorcery, every trick they know
You will lie in a deep sleep

[Chorus]
That's when your prince's crown
Cracks and falls down
Your castle hollow and cold
You've wandered so far
From the person you are
Let go, brother, let go
'Cause now we all know
