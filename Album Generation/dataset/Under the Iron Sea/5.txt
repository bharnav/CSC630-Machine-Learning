[Pump organ intro: Tom Chaplin]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be adored
Don't want to be first in line
Or make myself heard
I'd like to bring a little light
To shine a light on your life
To make you feel loved

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No, don't want to be the only one you know
I want to be the place you call home

[Chorus 1]
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
I give much more than I'd ever ask for

[Verse 2]
Will you see me in the end?
Or is it just a waste of time
Trying to be your friend?
Just shine, shine, shine
Shine a little light
Shine a light on my life
And warm me up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
You know that it could be so simple

[Chorus 2]
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for

[Instrumental bridge with piano lead: Tim Rice-Oxley]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Do you think that you could see a way

[Chorus 3]
To lay yourself down and make it so?
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
