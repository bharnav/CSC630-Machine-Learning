[Verse 1]
Why do I have to fly
Over every town up and down the line?
I'll die in the clouds above
And you that I defend I do not love

[Chorus 1]
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind

[Verse 2]
Where will I meet my fate?
Baby, I'm a man; I was born to hate
And when will I meet my end?
In a better time you could be my friend

[Chorus 2]
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it
If you were by my side
But you're long gone
Yeah, you're long gone now

[Bridge 1]
Yeah
Where do we go?
I don't even know
My strange old face
I've been thinking about those days
I've been thinking about those days

[Instrumental interlude]
Ooh

[Chorus 3]
I wake up, it's a bad dream
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
But you're long gone
Yeah, you're long gone now
Yeah

[Instrumental outro]
