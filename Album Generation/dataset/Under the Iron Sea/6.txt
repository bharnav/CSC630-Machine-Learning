[Verse 1]
Time goes by at such a pace
It's funny how it's easy to forget her face
You hide the cracks, the facts will find you
Turn your back and leave the lonely days behind you now

[Chorus 1]
You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, hold on to
You better put it behind you now

[Verse 2]
All the things you took for granted
Hit you like a bullet in the gut
You can't get up
Well, are you even going to try?
Because if you never even try
Time will pass you by

[Chorus 2]
You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, hold on to
You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, to hold on to
You better do what's best for you

[Bridge]
Don't care what she said
Only in your head
Time will help you out
Still you don't see how

[Chorus 2]
You better put it behind you now
You better put it behind you now
Too much to hold on, to hold on to
You better do what's best for you
