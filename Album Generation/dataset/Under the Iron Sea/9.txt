[Verse 1]
I fell asleep on a late night train
I missed my stop and I went round again
Why would I wanna see you now?
To fix it up, make it up somehow

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time

[Verse 2]
What I was isn't what I am
I'd change back, but I don't know if I can

[Chorus]
Still I'll try, try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time

[Bridge]
But I was made the way I am
I'm not a stone; I'm just a man
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
Rip back the time that we've been wasting

[Verse 3]
God, I wish you could see me now
You'd pick me up and you'd sort me out

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time
