[Verse 1]
It's a bit like a trip, but you hit it with a slip of a tongue
Like a whip, and we're sinking
It ain't cool to be cool, though you may think it a laudable tool
Of self evaluation, of ego cultivation
And I'm rolling my eyes like the stones for the lies
Is it really all about the size or just a simple vice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, and it makes the news
Oh, ’cause it sings the blues

[Chorus 1]
I feel the fire flare alight inside me
Higher, so I can see
And aspire to survive this fight in spite of
Liars and travesty
Oh, fire

[Verse 2]
Did you think that I'd blink, that I'd go and take the ink to your control
That I'd sell my soul
And does it ring any bells that it sells
That we're living out of shells in a shotgun
If we couldn't shoot, we'd have to run
And finally the cerebral fantasy
Better genes and machines, so we can die looking like we're teens
Like snapshot scenes in smithereens

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, and the ones we choose
Oh, witch hunting fools

[Chorus 2]
Fire, flare alight inside me
Higher, so I can see
And aspire to survive this fight in spite of
Liars and travesty
Oh, fire

[Bridge]
Oh, there it is in the news again
Look, there it goes singing the blues again (yeah)
[Repeat x2]
There it is in the news again
Look, there it goes singing the blues again
[End repeat]
There it is in the news again
Look, there it goes singing the blues

[Chorus 2]

[Coda]
Fire, return my joy, ’cause I'm so
Tired, tired of me
Inspire the weary eyed to see the
Ire and irony
Oh, fire
