When darkness
Is no less
Than everything you've built become undone
There's no fight
And no flight
Disaster leaves your passion overrun

It's time to let go
Time to carry on with the show
Don't mourn what is gone, greet the dawn

And I will be standing by your side
Together we'll face the turning tide

Remembrance
Can be a sentence
But it comes to you with a second chance in tow
Don't lose it
Don't refuse it
'Cause you cannot learn a thing you think you know

A new light is warm
Shining down on you after the storm
Don't mourn what is gone, greet the dawn

And I will be standing by your side
Together we'll face the turning tide
