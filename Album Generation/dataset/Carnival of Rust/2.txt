[Verse 1]
Do you breathe the name of your saviour in your hour of need
And taste the blame if the flavor should remind you of greed?
Of implication, insinuation and ill will, 'til you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil come closing in for a kill

[Chorus]
Come feed the rain
Cause I'm thirsty for your love dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
Cause without your love my life ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

[Verse 2]
It's all a game, avoiding failure, when true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior and the things we don't need
I lust for after no disaster can touch, touch us anymore
And more than ever, I hope to never fall, where enough is not the same it was before

[Chorus x2]
Come feed the rain
Cause I'm thirsty for your love dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
Cause without your love my life ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

Yeah, feed the rain
Cause I'm thirsty for your love dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
Cause without your love my life ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

[Outro]
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the heart is yearning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the heart is yearning
