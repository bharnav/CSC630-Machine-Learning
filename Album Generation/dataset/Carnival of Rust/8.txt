Seems to matter what I do, so I'm saving this 4 U
Cos it seems to be the last piece there is
And you haven't had a chance yet to taste this
Fragments of a life you shouldn't miss

Seems to matter what I say, so I'll hold my tongue at bay
And rather use my mouth to kiss your frown away
So your doubts no longer darken your day
So you can hold your head up high come what may

So please remember that I'm gonna follow through all the way

Cos it seems to matter where I go, I will always let you know
That the place where I am is never far
You know, you're not alone, don't be alarmed
I'll find you no matter where you are

So please remember that I'm gonna follow through all the way

Oh my love, if it's all I can do, I'll take the fall 4 U
Cos I will soar when I lay down with you and give my all 4 U
