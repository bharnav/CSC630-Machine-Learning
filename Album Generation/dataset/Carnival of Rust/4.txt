[Verse 1]
Here at the station, standing in the rain
Lost in my train of thought
Looking around for a better time again
But yesterday ain't running on this track

[Pre-Chorus]
Unpredictable fortunes, my past
Lights up my future, at last
Ending my torture

[Chorus]
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall
Like gravity like love
I'm not afraid anymore
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more

[Chorus]
Out of no reason I've decided to stay
Present a solution, to the problem
Typical of me, that I concentrate on the destination
So much that I miss the journey there and back

[Pre-Chorus]
Unpredictable fortunes, my past
Lights up my future, at last
Ending my torture, torture, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall
Like gravity like love
I'm not afraid anymore
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more

Yeah, if gravity was love
Yeah, if gravity was love
If gravity was love

[Pre-Chorus]
Unpredictable fortunes, my past
Lights up my future, at last
Ending my torture, torture, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall
Like gravity like love
I'm not afraid anymore
Like gravity like love
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more

Yeah, if gravity was love
Yeah, if gravity was love
Oh, if gravity was love
