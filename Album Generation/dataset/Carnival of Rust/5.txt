[Verse 1]
I worry that I can't give you what you need
That you'll find nothing underneath the peel
That I can't undo the times we disagreed
That I can't ignore the way I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what I feel is the only truth I know
And I get by on this naiveté of youth

[Chorus]
If what I feel is the only truth
And what I give out will make up what I'll receive
Can I leave behind my naiveté of youth?
Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
I believe

[Verse 2]
Could you hold us up if I would drag us down?
Resurrect emotions from our past
And if they had a king for fools, would you wear the crown?
Build us up again and make us last

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what I feel is the only truth for me
And I get by on this naiveté of youth

[Chorus]
If what I feel is the only truth
And what I give out will make up what I'll receive
Can I leave behind my naiveté of youth?
Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
I believe

[Bridge]
And if we don't worry about a thing
Will we be sorry when the rain is falling again?
And what does it matter if fortune should favor?
It is never the final amen

[Chorus]
If what I feel is the only truth
And what I give out will make up what I'll receive
Can I leave behind my naiveté of youth?
Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
I believe
