What rot
Speak up, child
Can you not see
This is maddening?
Hello, muffin
Hello, Lame One
Hello, ornament
What utter and complete rot
How much more
Can be left unsaid?
Surely, something must suffer
All your dreams may come true
And don't you doubt it
The Earth is slowing now
And your mind's crowded
We're going to celebrate
Just wait and see
Your dreams just may come true
If it's meant to be
So, this is magic?
Your great mystery
I'm coming around now
As an illiterate adult
Hello, anything
Hello, dirty money
Rest assured
These lips are sealed
How much more
Can be left unsaid?
Surely, something must suffer
What bother...
