Who aren't you today?
Where and what are we?
Under a pile of worn clothes
This is how I find you
Spinning vomit-webs
Blabbering on and on
You need more than vitamin D
Is there not anything you love?
Come OUT
Dog, you know what this is
What are you hiding from?
You were once such a merry prince
Just tickled pink by life
Take , remember her?
She never could listen
It's been years upon years
And she's still suffering
Come OUT
Look at the apples on the tree
Wait 'til they fall
Just find what makes you come alive
And that is all
Swing on a chandelier
You are in perfect health
Don't give up on your friends
Don't give up on yourself
Open hearts...
