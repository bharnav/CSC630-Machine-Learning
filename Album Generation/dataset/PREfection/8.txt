So you fell out of the nest
Pigeon feathers in your mouth
This considered Son Of Letters
Is taking you out
Our father who art in heaven
Made a circle around my brethren
A circle you did cross
Let me be more specific
I'm the model, you're the mythic
And NOW you get tossed
Welly, welly, well
Who doesn't owe to you?
No guardian nor craft
Yes, I've read my Plato, too
This battle-talk that I'm spitting
Is my war correspondant ambitions
Coming to light
Semper Fi, E Pluribus Unim
My arm's extended; who am I fooling?
And NOW you get wiped
City Of Brotherly Love
