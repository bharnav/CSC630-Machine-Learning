[Verse 1]

Of all the creatures in the wood
One law is commonly understood
Deep in the heart of Fontainbleau
The marriage of a whore and Jew
The bride's true dowry black rocks
Equinox

[Verse 2]

The wedding is followed by gifts
Catherine de Medici lives
Silverfish quilting testicle
Despotic owl conducts the wolves
And mulls attacking a fox

[Chorus]

Equinox
Equinox
Red birth mark
Equal light
Equal dark
North to south
Thoth with pen
Let us give praise and thanks, Amen

[Verse 3]

Celestial bodies transform to flesh
And commune with the wedding's guests
They twist and thrust and whine and grope
As if under a microscope
In hope to to catch small pox
Equinox
