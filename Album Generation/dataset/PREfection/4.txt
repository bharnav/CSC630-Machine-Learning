Sacred Heart, surveyed from the summit
A pantheon, distant as ever
Echoing up the mountainside
Escaped sound, like a vulcan kiss upon the forehead
Alas! Jimmy
And all the members of the covenant
Noble scholars
Without you I'd have drowned in gutterwater
Alas!
You, of course, have my infinite gratitude
You, My Most Sacred Heart
Yet I piss and moan for I have ____
Dearly Departed
We are gathered here today in reverence
Dearly Departed
We all will return to the soil
Alas!
Alas!
For all my Alas!-es
I cannot mend this massive slashing
Futile beacon!
Cinderella's in the doghouse
The doghouse
The doghouse
No, love doesn't always boomerang
