Dawn in Albany
Statesmen are still asleep
The first noise heard
Through the dew: "cuckoo!"
A rattle follows
The coroner's office glows
This is my portrait of you, Cuckoo
Cuckoo is your given name
Christened in the solitude of Fame
Ah! Friends as such!
Whose love is without touch
All four horsemen are you
Cuckoo
Like Brughel's Miser in the frame
Quite literally, you're insane
A cop-out?
So flippantly talked about
Stand up, here comes your cue...
"cuckoo!"
