[Verse 1]
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Verse 2]
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling

Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

[Chorus 1]
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2]
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

[Verse 3]
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Outro]
Oh
Oh
Oh!
We all fall in sometimes
