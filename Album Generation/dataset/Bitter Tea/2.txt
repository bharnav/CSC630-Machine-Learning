Darling black-hearted boy
All the color's gone out of my ribbon loom
As I've only got the worst to assume
Take your sheet metal sheers;
Cut a slit up the the side of my dark blue dress;
For a last time lie your love confess

Get your gut
Some home made twine-
String up silk your tiger bow
Don't paint your board
Moonlight white-
Go dangle your fishhook out in the gutter again

You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave and now you're gone and
Now I'm-

See the smoke from your kiln-
Pine boughs burn the bricks dead hard in their fog
As I stand cold with my back broke by the bog
Find your cross cut saw-
Come blunt and jagged dry and try
Cut my tongue out to keep on your wall up high

I tipped my toe
On the bamboo strip;
I took stone honey in exchange for my rags
Don't dare paint your board
Moonlight white-
Go dangle your fishhook out in the gutter again

You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave and now you're gone and
Now I'm-

Darling black hearted boy
I went down to wash my robe in the river;
I thought of you and started to shake and to shiver
Leaning there on the rocks
I see myself slip down and float
'til the brackish warm current stops up my throat

You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave
You swore you swore you'd never leave
