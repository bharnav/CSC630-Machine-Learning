Come away;
Teach me, sweetheart
Come on past
Brave young bachelors
I'm alone;
Teach me, sweetheart

My mother in law was standing by the stove
Hissing like a snake, hissing like a snake
Hissing like a snake
She gave orders to spill my blood;
She gave orders
To spill my blood, I thought

I thought, I thought, and I thought some more

Come away;
Teach me, sweetheart
Come on past
Brave young bachelors
I'm alone;
Teach me, sweetheart

My father in law was lying on his bed
Growling like a dog, growling like a do
Growling like a dog
My mother in law was standing by the stove
Hissing like a snake, hissing like a snake
Hissing like a snake
He gave orders to spill my blood;
He gave orders
To spill my blood, I thought
I thought, I thought, and I thought some more

Come away;
Teach me, sweetheart
Come on past
Brave young bachelors
I'm alone;
Teach me, sweetheart

My sister in law was sitting on her stoop
Crawing like a crow, crawing like a crow
Crawing like a crow
She gave orders to spill my blood;
She gave orders
To spill my blood, I thought

I thought, I thought, and I thought some more

Come away;
Teach me, sweetheart
Come on past
Brave young bachelors
I'm alone;
Teach me, sweetheart

My brother in law was leaning on the love-seat
Tapping with his tail, tapping with his tail
Purring like a cat
He gave orders to spill my blood;
He gave orders
To spill my blood, I thought
