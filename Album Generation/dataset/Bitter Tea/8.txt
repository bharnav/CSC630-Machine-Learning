I was so bored with my old life;
I was so bored with decent odds

My new roommate left her debit card:
Some sort of test for me. It's too hard
Try to run an errand. Nervous sweat
I rush back home and if I win I'll give her half (I bet.)
Online casinos in the Caymans;
Legal disclaimer writ for layman's

I moved back into New Canaan;
Babysit my sister's kids; it's rainin'
They fuss a bit while I put them to bed
And grumpy, sitting on the couch, I get it in my head:
Take Metro North. A silver candlestick
To Aqueduct on LIRR Pick

I was so bored with my new life
I felt like I new all the odds

I bet 'gainst myself I wouldn't wager
My boyfriend's mother's mansion (nothing major)
I stole the deed one night when she was drunk
I drove onto the reservation with it in my trunk
Sensors beep the threshold when I crossed it;
Thirty thousand marker soon I lost it

Baltimore inner harbor (sports) zone:
Being courted. He's talking on his cell phone
"let me tell you why I think I love her:
She knows you always take the bye week dome home team to cover."
Go up to Pimlico and I choose
It's no fun if it's fine when you lose

I was so tired with all the angles;
I was so bored with losin' easy

So I gambled on going further a-field
So I flew to Sydney and then to Bali and then to Jakarta
And called on my step-father's ex-business partner
Major Timmy Sastrosatomo
And he set me up as a silver smith/batik dabber
In a house once owned by the Princes of Mataran
And he told me all his trobles

We bribed a CFO at Semen Cibinong
To get them to buy a 40% stake
And we got a 5 million dollar order from Nieman Marcus
Which we filled about 10% of
But I did sell them my children's book
Which I said was a South Sumatran
Folk tale- which went like this:

I played cards for seven days straight
Was up $47 dollars late
Evening as the sun went down I saw
The ace of diamonds up his sleeve - black velvet on his paw
I fold, say goodbye politely
They bark, you don't get off that lightly

I dreamed of a casino way up in the hills of Borneo
Where I lost with the giant flying squirrels and orange orangutans and great mormon butterflies all day long
'Til the bulldozers turned us into Whole Fruit Fruit Bar sticks and china markers
