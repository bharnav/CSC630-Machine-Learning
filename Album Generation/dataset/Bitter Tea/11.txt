As I try to fill all of my empty days
I stumble round on through my memory's maze;
Of all my past, only the sadness stays

I went moping down by the bridge;
I rode a bike in the snow to the mini-mart;
I thought of the ways that I have broke my own heart

It's not for me to fill the blue sea with tears
But when I think back on all the wasted years
All the good cheer and all of the charm disappears

I wore the exact same clothes for five days;
The bailbondsman gave me a smile;
I was just thinking of only my sins all the while

As I try to fill all of my empty days
I stumble round on through my memory's maze;
Of all my past, only the sadness stays
