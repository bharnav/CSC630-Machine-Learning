Forget the dogs and forget the sheep-
It's only you who affects me
On the fun fair track road, a helter skelter fall
On my ice skater's bruised knees

Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me what time is it now
Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me baby what time is it now

Blood love silver locket and police sweater blood vow;
Nativity jingle, carole and cry;
Chain smoking ashes all over himself
Laugh and hug your white wine wife

Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me what time is it now
Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me baby what time is it now

Parking lot reading, cover my eyes;
You're a sick moaner, now hold your sides
On Christmas Eve and dizzy escalator malls
Retraced steps for not lost gloves

Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me what time is it now
Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me baby what time is it now

Well aye, went to sleep sitting up
See the diary and cry out:
That's not right! You're here and i'm there!
That's not right! You're there and I'm here!

Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me what time is it now
Vibrate buzz buzz ring and beep
Tell me baby what time is it now
