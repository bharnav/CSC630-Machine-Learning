I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
Damn it all, damn it all to hell
Damn it all, damn it all

I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
Damn it all, damn it all to hell
Damn it all, damn it all

Preserve me, preserve me; protect me; save me
So vile, so violent
Whose thoughts are spent
So vile, so violent
In thinking how they may
So vile, so violent
My steps betray
So vile, so violent
How in a foul mishap may me entrap
Who hid in traitor grass their cunning cord may catch me as I pass

I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
Damn it all, damn it all to hell
Damn it all, damn it all

I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
I thought myself an unworthy thing
Despairing of my case all the time boys
Damn it all, damn it all to hell
Damn it all, damn it all

I went to the Right Road Ministry at 4801 S. Normandie;
I went to the Armenian Brotherhood Bible Church at 5556 Harold Way
And while I was at it went to St. Sarkis;
And then I went to the Inglesia Evangelica Rey de Reyes y Seńor y Seńores at 2605 W. 7th St;
And the Alpha y Omega - and the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star and Kingdom of God in Faith at 3810 W. Slauson;
And I drove around listening to the Greater Bethany Tape Ministry
And to the Sweet Hour of Prayer mission;
And I went to St. Innocent Orthodox and Jesus in Delight;
And then finally I called up the Vietnamese Telephone Ministry
At 323-221-7625;
