I'm waiting to know you far away
Send up the balloon, says "write to me soon"
I'm waiting to know you far away
Set up to the pier, wait till you get here yea

And when I'm about to give up hope
But note with my telescope
I'm standing guard the Navy yard
To see could there one for me be

Baby, oh no
Where did you go?

I'm waiting to know you far away
Flashlight the cave, listen short wave
I'm waiting to know you far away
Dredge up the lake, all the trees shake, yeah

And when I'm about to give up hope
But note with my telescope
I'm standing guard the Navy yard
To see could there one for me be

Baby, oh no
Where did you go?

I'm waiting to know you far away
Send up the balloons, says "write to me soon"
I'm waiting to know you far away
Flashlight the cave, listen short wave

And when I'm about to give up hope
But note with my telescope
I'm standing guard the Navy yard
To see could there one for me be

Baby, oh no
Where did you go?

Baby, oh no
Where did you go?
