Most of our lives
We await your embrace
And to know what it's like
When we meet face to face

And to know what it's like
When we meet face to face
Is it a beginning, a continuing
Toward the end
Is it a beginning, a continuing
Toward the end

Most of our lives
We await your embrace
And to know what it's like
When we meet face to face

Is it a beginning toward the end
