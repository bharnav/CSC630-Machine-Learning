One big mistake some people make is when they take for granted
Love will always stay the same
Because eventually love needs attention or it has a tendency
To fade away
That is why I'll always give you
Every little thing you may have only dreamed of
All I wanna give you
Every little thing
All I wanna give you is everything

Some peoples' needs can never be pleased but we both agree
We're not that way
As I suspected my secret weapon will be
To keep you satisfied every day
That is why I'll always give you
Every little thing you may have only dreamed of
All I wanna give you
Every little thing
All I wanna give you is everything

Why would I chose to ever deny you
It would only risk our happiness
I feel compelled to overwhelm you
And to never let you catch your breath
That is why I'll always give you
Every little thing you may have only dreamed of
All I wanna give you
Every little thing
All I wanna give you is everything
