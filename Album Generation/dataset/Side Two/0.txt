"Hello, honey, I hope I didn't wake you up
But I had to hear your voice
I'm standing in another phone booth
Somewhere on the moon

I'm alright, I guess, except for all the stuff I miss
The things we used to do
I never knew I could be this blue

It's so quiet here
Like the stars are sayin'
"shh, be quiet"

So, how are the kids?
Did I miss his birthday again?
Aw, no...could you tell him I'm sorry
Sometimes my mind gets blurry
And I lose all sense of time

Time moves slowly
Like the curve of the earth

Aw, honey, I wish I really could
Reach out and touch you...but that's not real
Like the moon is blue...like this lonely view
From a sad phone...out here on the moon

And it feels like one long lonely night
You know what I mean
That's why I called"
