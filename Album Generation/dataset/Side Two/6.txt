Sometimes I'm paralyzed

With life speeding by

I never seem to get anywhere

No matter how hard I try

Oh it used to be, I thought, I was in command

Now I know I'm up to my chin

In quicksand

Is there no thread of hope

That we control?

Oh if you could only pull me up...

I will never let you down, let you down

I will never let you down

Oh if you could only pull me up...

I will never let you down, let you down

I will never let you down

I will never let you down, let you down

I will never let you down

I will never let you down
