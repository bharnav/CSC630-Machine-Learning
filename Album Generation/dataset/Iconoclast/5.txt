[Verse 1]
Screaming at the walls around me, broken and alone
Fighting with my inner demons is all I've ever known
All I am I give to you, oh, all my dreams and nightmares, too

[Verse 2]
Disconnected life of anguish, the mirror fades to black
Feels like I'm sinking deep into illusion, no one's staring back
Somewhere unseen, there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie?

[Chorus]
Can't you see, you and me
We're Children of a Faceless God?
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God, huh!

[Verse 3]
Just another faceless shadow, I'm desensitized
And I don't feel the pain, am I insane? My nightmare's realized
Somewhere unseen, there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie?

[Chorus]
Can't you see, you and me
We're Children of a Faceless God?
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

[Bridge]
(Let us embrace)
All I have I give to you
All my dreams, my nightmares, too

[Verse 3]
Wretched promenade, watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction
Laugh at tragedy, worship sin with me
Let us share in selfish addiction
Spitting on the shrine, drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins, tattered and torn
Completely interfaced to a God without a Face
In his image of darkness, I'm reborn

[Chorus]
Can't you see, you and me
We're Children of a Faceless God?
Misery is our destiny
We're Children, Children of a Faceless God

[Chorus]
Can't you see, you and me
We're Children of a Faceless God?
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God
