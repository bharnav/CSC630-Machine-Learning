[Verse 1]
Bite your tongue, the blackened sun will curse the moon
Skies of Fire, nothing's worth a damn
Calculate, anticipate your every move
Beware, the ruthless hearts of man

[Chorus]
Feel my pain, my words are in vain
I believe it's the End of Innocence
Don't look away, oh hear what I say
I believe it's the End of Innocence

[Verse 2]
Cut and splice, a fierce device, degenerate
Sons of Light, synthetic Gods of Man
Crushed beneath the Dragon Beast, breathing hate
Your blood, your blood is on their hands

[Chorus]
Feel my pain, my words are in vain
I believe it's the End of Innocence
Don't look away, oh hear what I say
I believe it's the End of Innocence, oh!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
The World is dying
The precious sands of time are running out
We are the fallen
Made obsolete, methodically phased out
(Feel my pain, feel my pain, feel my pain...)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Feel my pain, my words are in vain
I believe it's the End of Innocence
Don't look away, oh hear what I say
I believe it's the End, it's the End of Innocence
