[Verse 1]
Rise of the One, the Dark Iconoclast
Forging a cult of fear, with legions unsurpassed
Shouting the word, with vicious tongues of fire
Born of illusion and deceit, fiendish soul of a liar
The chaos unseen rips the midnight sky
Infernal machines arise, flesh and steel collide

[Chorus]
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
Oh!

[Verse 2]
With rage, we ride into the flames
Striking with Spears of Hate at the heart where evil reigns
Holding the line from the charge of armored steeds
Gather around this deadly ground, come watch the War God bleed
The chaos unseen rips the midnight sky
Infernal machines arise, flesh and steel collide

[Chorus]
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
Stand and fight!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Victory or death, oh, only time will tell
Synthetic resurrection from the heart of hell
Slowly they fall, as we watch the daylight die
We spit and curse this hallowed earth with our final Battle Cry
The chaos unseen rips the midnight sky
Infernal machines arise, flesh and steel collide

[Chorus]
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)

[Chorus]
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
We are strong (we are strong)
We will stand and fight (fight, fight, fight!)
Stand up and fight!
