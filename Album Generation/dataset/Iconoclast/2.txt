[Verse 1]
Tap the vein, inject my brain
And let the poison flow
Torn apart, you're ripping out my heart
It's painless, let it go
Come one, hit the switch, you son of a bitch
I'm devoured, broke in two
You take control and resurrect my soul
Becoming something new
What's done is done, I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become
Mindless and mesmerized, dehumanized

[Chorus]
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and Victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me
Dehumanized, yeah!
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Ripped to shreds, the venom spreads
Release the system plague
Shed your skin, electrified within
Complete the final stage
I will break my shell and unleash Hell
There's nothing you can do
Just a cut above this sacred New Blood
Becoming something new...
What's done is done, I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become
Mindless and mesmerized, dehumanized

[Chorus]
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and Victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me
Dehumanized

[Bridge]
I'm what you've all become
Is this life worth the question why?
Or is this life just a lie?
'Cause my eyes are cold and numb
And I don't know what the hell I've become

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize we're all Dehumanized
Enslaved and Victimized
You can't break us
No, you can't unmake us
We have all become Dehumanized
