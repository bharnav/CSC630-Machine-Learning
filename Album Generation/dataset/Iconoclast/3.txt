[Verse 1]
You can be all you desire
An honest man, a vicious liar
Seek out the Light or seek the Dark
You can honor or desecrate
Sympathize or manipulate
Carved in your flesh, embrace the Mark

[Chorus]
Enslaved and hypnotized
Chained to artificial lives
You are the Bastards of the Machine, oh-oh
The Bastards of the Machine

[Verse 2]
Be a saint for those in need
Or spin them webs of lust and greed
Yeah, you've restored my dying faith
With a Kiss of Death, a last farewell
Hand in hand, through the Gates of Hell
You'll pay the price for the choice you make

[Chorus]
I see your demons rise
Deep within your burning eyes
You are the Bastards of the Machine, oh-oh
The Bastards of the Machine

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
The Bastards of the Machine
Oh, you know that you are!
The Bastards of the Machine, oh!
The Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine, oh!

[Outro]
You righteous bastards!
