[Verse 1]
The human infection
Soaring on winds of woe and pestilence
Remove imperfection
Parasites with lives of little consequence
Even though we know the sky is falling
Still, we choose not to believe

[Chorus]
On your knees, Heretic, devil in disguise
Never quit tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies, Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise

[Verse 2]
The flesh breeds corruption
Irradicate the insect prey, exterminate
Crawl with the Leeches, you cry
Shattered to pieces, you die
Here I stand, god of man, the Perfect Beast
Even though we know the sky is falling
Still, we choose not to believe

[Chorus]
On your knees, Heretic, devil in disguise
Never quit tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies, Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise, oh!

[Instrumental]

Oh, burn!

[Bridge]
Watch me burn, live and learn
As the night surrounds me
No escape, nowhere to hide
Feel the sting of severing
Become one with Darkness
No escape, I'm dead inside
(I'm dead inside, I'm dead inside...)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Heretic, devil in disguise
Never quit tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies, Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise, uh!
