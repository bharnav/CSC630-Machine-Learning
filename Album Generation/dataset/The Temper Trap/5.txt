Stay close, wait for the daylight
A cup won't fill in my empty hole

[Hook]
Whatever it is, it never is the best
This isn't happiness
However it feels, it leaves me feeling less
This isn't happiness

Alone, in a room full of people
They talk, lips move but the words don't come out

[Hook]
Whatever it is, it never is the best
This isn't happiness
However it feels, it leaves me feeling less
This isn't happiness

However it feels, it leaves me feeling less
This isn't happiness, no

[Hook]
Whatever it is, it never is the best
This isn't happiness
However it feels, it leaves me feeling less
This isn't that no no no
This isn't happiness
Happiness, happiness, happiness
Happiness, happiness, happiness
