[Verse 1]
No, never again will your walls
Be left abandoned by these hands
No, never again will I scale
The sleeping tower where your heart lays

[Hook]
Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in

[Verse 2]
No, never again will you draw
Down your bridge to let their horses in
Dead or alive, the captives I thought I had freed
Made their bed in mine to haunt me when they please

[Hook]
Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in

[Bridge]
Oh, I came to let you try once again
It's the end

[Outro]
No, never again
No, never again
