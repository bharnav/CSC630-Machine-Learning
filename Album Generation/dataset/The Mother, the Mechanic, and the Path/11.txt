All my life, I waited for something great
Here I am with nothing showing
And all I want, yes it is all I wanted- it's us
I lost my chance maybe a month ago
I waited long but I got to thinking
I waste my time because I'm always thinking I'm wrong

And it's tough being alone when you're naive
And you just want to believe everything everyone says
Oh, it would be great if I could just deal with it

I'm packing up almost everything
I'm moving out and starting over
And all I want, maybe it's all I want, is love
If that was it, then it would all be great
But I can't walk without feeling lost
And I don't know, I'm thinking it's all I know is us

And it's tough being alone when you're naive
And you just want to believe everything everyone says
Oh, it would be great if I could just deal...

And it's tough being alone when you're naive
And you just want to believe everything and everyone
