I've got some deep scars from a little black heart that's miles away
I sent it packing after I saw what it did and I couldn't believe
And now my chest hurts from the hole that I dug, it's getting harder to breathe
I'm really gasping, wishing I could turn back and that would fix everything
For once...

My life
I might as well live it
Along with the bad times
Just happy to be living
So it's my time, I know it sounds selfish
I'm really not like that
We live and we die for this

So now my head hurts and it's only getting worse every time that I think
I feel like choking every time I have to sing, it's getting harder for me
And now my stomach hurts, as long as I'm in love it's so hard to leave
I feel a bad pain moving through my chest and my knees start to shake
My knees start to shake, it's bringing me down

This is my life
I might as well live it
Along with the bad times
Just love to be living
So this is my time
I know it sounds selfish
I think I'll have some ice cream
We live and we die for this

There's one thing missing every time I step outside
One thing missing every time I leave and drive
One thing missing every time I'm far from home
There's one thing missing every time I leave for months
One thing missing every time I lose control
There's one thing missing every time that I stay home

I've got some deep scars from a little black heart that only make me stronger
And now I don't sleep, seeing any relief that gives me some perspective

This is my life
I might as well live it
Along with the bad times
Just glad to be living
And this is my time
I might as well share it
I'll give you all my money
We live and we die for this
