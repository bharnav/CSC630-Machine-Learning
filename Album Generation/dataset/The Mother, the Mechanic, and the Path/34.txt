I just came to say I love you and see if you would be needing anything
To say thank you and how grateful I am for everything you taught me
It's those long talks I won't forget
Just to see you smile, it brings me right to them
So I'll sit here now and hold your hand
It's these few long hours that make me what I am

We laugh about the times
We laughed so hard until we fell asleep this evening
And then I watch you there alone, in fear, wishing I could speed your breathing
And all the wind blows through the trees
I swear they're angels talking back to me
And I scream please don't leave me here tonight
I need you now, I need you in my life

But you're gone and you're never coming back again
But you're gone and you're never coming back again
But you're gone and you're never coming back again
But you're gone and you're never coming back again
But you're gone and you're never coming, you're never coming back
But you're gone and you're never coming back again
