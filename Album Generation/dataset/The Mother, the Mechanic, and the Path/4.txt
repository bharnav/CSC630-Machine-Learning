Your mission is set
You've only two hours
'Fore everything is lost
And swallowed by light
So do this with care
But don't waste your time
'cause this is all we've got

You're making time
You've got the cure
But the virus by your side
You wait till it's right
Then you strike
And you bring out all you've got

Maybe someday you'll find a way to balance pressure
But you're slow and you're jealous like a child
Waking up things that found a way to dream forever
Get your gun, 'cause the flock is flying in

Your dress is nice
Casual, but then strangely elegant
Your eyes are wide
You got them once
Got them twice now three's a charm

Maybe someday you'll find a way to balance pressure
But you're slow and you're jealous like a child
Waking up things that found a way to dream forever
Get your gun, 'cause the flock is flying in

I'm watching you now
You're right in my sight
I'm supposed to take you out
And end this tonight
But given this thought
It's harder to fire
'cause you don't have a clue

Maybe someday you'll find a way to balance pressure
But you're slow and you're jealous like a child
Waking up things that found a way to dream forever
Get your gun, 'cause the flock is flying in
