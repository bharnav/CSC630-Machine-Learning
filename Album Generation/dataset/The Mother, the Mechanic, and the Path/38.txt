(After I learned about my parents, they asked me to live with them. And I didn't want to but I really had no choice. So I finished out the school year, where I was, I lived with my grandfather, and uh, then I moved in with them. And you know what, it was great. I was happy. I was happy and I knew it. I clapped my hands.)

(Yeah, if it was only like that. Oh well, what can you do. It was hard then, and I was already really bad with people skills. And I had to start all over pretty much. Anything I felt secure with was gone. And you know what it was probably the only time in my life that I was actually excited to go to school. Not to learn, or get made fun of, but to get out of the house and get away from them. And now that I think about it, I don't think school was any easier.)
