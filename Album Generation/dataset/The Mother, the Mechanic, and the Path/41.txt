Not like he would ever do that, right? He would tell me I was wasting my time with her, I should concentrate on where I'm going to college. You know, I didn't want to go to college. So when graduation came around, I saw a completely different side of him. The side I always knew was there. He would say that I was going to throw away my life and I was going to make a terrible mistake. I guess something he was familiar with. He would tell me I was going to be a loser and people wouldn't respect me. That was also the day he told me about the mistake he made, me. I guess that was supposed to scare me straight. Oh well.)

"No, you're just being selfish prick"

Selfish? You didn't even raise me. You dumped me off so you could go and make something of yourself and care about no one but yourself

"You don't have any idea what my life was like. When I was 18 I was on my own. Supporting myself and your mother, working two jobs and going to school. You know how hard it was to watch someone else raise my son. You think it's easy to live with that decision."

Shut up, at least you were able to make a decision

"You want to make a decision. What are you going to do? Huh? You're not going to get anywhere playing patty cake all day with that girlfriend of yours. You wouldn't be able to survive one day in the real world. You have no money, have no job, no common sense. You have no idea what it takes to survive on your own."
