[Chorus]
It's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

[Verse 1]
Tell me what my name can mean
In the dictionary scene
Yeah, that's like over 40 million sold
Are we doing right?
But why write when we can type?
Computers get me psyched
They'll probably make us slaves in 40 years

[Chorus]
And it's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

[Verse 2]
Throw the window through the door
We don't use this anymore
I'm not throwing stones
And it means the world to me
Oh, three due in time
With the love of love gives life
Oh, your heart, it helps so much
When we're barely scraping by

[Chorus]
And it's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

[Bridge]
Open, open, open, open
And it means the world to me

[Chorus]
And it's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast

[Outro]
It's time to (oooh)
If that's what we never had
We gotta get used to it
I'm glad to get used to it fast
And it's time to go outside
I'm gonna be sick for a while
It's gonna be quite some time
