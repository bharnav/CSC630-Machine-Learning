God only knows what I would say to you
You'd hear just some scattered parts of words I'd mumble to you
Of words I'd mumble to you
I thought that at first it would be good for me
I've come to find out that I just lost my feelings
I've lost all feeling

This is the closest I have come to giving it all away
To giving it all away for someone else
This is the closest I have come to giving it all away
To giving it all away for someone else

God only knows what I would say to you
I've waited so long, I'm feeling numb to this lonely tune
I'm numb to you
I thought it would help if I could sweat it off
Like a fever, I would wake and it would be gone
Yeah, it would be gone

This is the closest I have come to giving it all away
To giving it all away for someone else
This is the closest I have come to giving it all away
To giving it all away for someone else

God only knows what I would say to you
I've waited so long that I forgot what I should do
