Every time I wake up
I must remind the smile on my face
That I was only dreaming
And this is something I don't know how to face
'Cause every time I see him
I get so nervous I can't look at his face
Grew up calling him uncle
That would be great if I didn't have my aunt's eyes
Oh why must I know everything?
