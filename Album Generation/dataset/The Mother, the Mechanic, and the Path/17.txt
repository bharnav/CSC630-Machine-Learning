For the record I'm tired
I've been running for days
But I can't hide anymore
It's time to just settle here

The rain beats on my head
And I'm tired and cold
But I need shelter and sleep
So I can dream of a day when I return and I'm so bitter to you

I bet you left me out here
Along with the wolves
But I have a book on skills
To survive in the woods

Winters right around the bend and I'm scared
I'm planning for a storm that will blow the roof and doors off of every home
From here to L.A
From here to L.A

Should I follow you here
But I don't know you like that
Should I give you my keys
And see if you will come back
This time
