Hello, how are you?
Like your shoes, love your hair
Hello, how are you?
Love that shirt, you look great
Hello, how are you?
Love your pants and your smile
Hello, how are you?
How's your wife and your kids?
Hello, how are you?
Love that hat on your head
Hello, how are you?
Missed you so; it's nice to see ya

All we have at the end of the game
Is a lonely road out
All I know at the end of the day
Is the love to smile now, even if that's fake
All I know is I'm done acting
And I'll be happy for your life, even if I hate it all

Wait for me, I've got to see
The looks that you will get
When you turn down the key
To the town and your social being

All we have at the end of the game
Is a lonely road out
All I know at the end of the day
Is the love to smile now, even if that's fake
All I know is I'm done acting
And I'll be happy for your life, even if I hate it all

All we have at the end of the game
Is a lonely road out
All I know at the end of the day
Is the love to smile now, even if that's fake
All I know is I'm done acting
And I'll be happy for your life, even if I hate it all

Hello, how are you?
Like your shoes, love your hair
Hello, how are you?
Love that shirt, you look great
Hello, how are you?
Missed you so; it's nice to see ya
