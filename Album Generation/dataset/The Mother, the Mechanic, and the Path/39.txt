Everybody looks at me
Like they're so surprised that I can breathe
I need to get out of this town
I need to run for miles now

And all my lack of style, I blame on him
And all I want is this...
I need to have my time
But I'm glued, I'm glued to the script

Everybody looks at me
Then turns to their friend and says something
I hate this town and my new life
I'm tired of waiting all the time

And all my lack of skill, I blame on him
And all I ask is this...
I need to feel alive...
But you're glued, you're glued to the script
