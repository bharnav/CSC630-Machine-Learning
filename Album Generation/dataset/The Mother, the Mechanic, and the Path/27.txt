"Sounds like he made out pretty good"

(Yeah I guess. Started a life, went to school, had a job, got married. He was even going to be a lawyer. Everything seemed great. The only problem was he went from wanting nothing to wanting everything, more than he even knew what to do with. You see, sometimes when you get that taste for wanting things, you only want for yourself. And if you ask me that's where it gets dangerous.)
