Is it my fault if it was planned and yes it was
Well then because of me your selfishness ruins everything

Well if every moment always counts for something, then we lost this running around

All these settings never change for better; I sent you a place and time
I thought you could use it to learn how to love your worst despite
I sent you down with that kid
The one that you hated, I thought you could raise him just like you

I can change this I swear, now that's just the voice of all your fear
No that's not quite it. I promise ill build his tights the best
Well if all your money power gives solutions like this

And all these settings never change for better; I sent you a place and time
I thought you could use it to learn how to love your worst despite
I sent you down with that kid
The one that you hated, I thought you could raise him just like you

Then bring him back to me exactly how you wanted him to be

All these settings never made it better; I sent you a place and time
I thought you could use it to learn how to love your worst despite
I sent you down with that kid
The one that you hated, I thought you could raise him just like you
