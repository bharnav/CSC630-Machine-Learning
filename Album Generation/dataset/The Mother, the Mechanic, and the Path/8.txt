A man stays in his house
He says no, I'm not leaving
You'll never scare me out
Not even if you throw your worst
I'll throw it down and take it like a champion
So here's your chance right now
Come on and make me foolish

(Chorus:)
Run while you can
Forget your work
Learn to live
Fall to your knees
Forget your love
Let it fade away

The world will slowly see that life can be so easy
Without our fancy plates we never eat off
Stop me when I've said enough
We create our own prison
We're locking people up for needing money

(Chorus x3)
