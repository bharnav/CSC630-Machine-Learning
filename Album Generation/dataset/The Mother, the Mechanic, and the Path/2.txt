[Verse 1]
So take the boy to the back, cover up his ears
We got some dirty little secrets we don't want him to hear
In this business, you don't question someone's wealth
We'll chain him to the bed so he won't run away
Then, we'll take the piggy bank and cash it in on our way
So chase your dreams and never let them go down here

[Verse 2]
But you can kick it in the back, make it will all go away
Take some pills for the pain and throw your voice away
Someone else is paid to write the hits
So you can talk until you're rich, until your cheekbones hurt
And then a little baby talk to make sure you still work
It's all about the pointless perks that we all pay for to pay for ourselves
