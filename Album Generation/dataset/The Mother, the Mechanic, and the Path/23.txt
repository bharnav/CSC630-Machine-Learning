And now it's time I go
I've had enough of this lie
So I'll get up
So I'll get up
And I'm no longer a child
So now it's time I say what's really on my mind
What's on my mind

I guess you're not to blame
See we grew up just the same
But a useless mind and a waste of space
That walked us to this day
So today I face my fear
And prove it's not fate that brought me here
But a ruthless heart and a careless mind
That left me in this bind

(Spoken:)
-Okay, let's do it
-Alright, well, how are you today first of all? I hope your trip was good
Can you believe this weather? It's 65 and sunny
But anyway, lets pick it up where we left off last week. Is that okay with you?
-Yea
-Anyway, I mean I really just think we were getting close so whenever you're ready, take it away
-Okay

Raised to feel like trash
By a drunken man and his drunken friends
He found strength in numbers

(Spoken:)
So I guess it was a normal night, only difference was it was the last
See from what it seems, him and his friends were hanging out in the living room
So he figured a simple walk through wouldn't hurt, but there it wasâ€¦

Sitting around the card table
If you saw his eyes they were glowing bright
He was ready for this fight
Tried to leave the room
But before the door he was on the floor
Screaming, "I hate you"

(Spoken:)
Now, see at this point it was more than the money, or being lazy, or a waste of life
He disrespected his love. Right there in front of everyone, in front of his love
