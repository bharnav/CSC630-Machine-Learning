Guess what?
We're your parents
And you're going to come live with us
And we're going to have a great time
Wait, wait, wait, wait

Guess what?
I already knew that
I could tell the first time I saw my mother's eyes
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait
Alright...

Sorry, see we were just kids then
We were just kids and we were in trouble
And we didn't know what to do
Wait

So trouble means you're in your twenties
With plenty of monies to support yourself
And your mother while she raises your little child
Wait
