[Verse 1]
First day of the rest of my life
I never wanted to go
A blank stare from a positive mind is all I want you to know
Passed down by the hands of the wise
And what they showed me was broke
Kicked out by the brute of the bunch
I never wanted a show

[Chorus]
Passed out from this use of the sunlight
Without a mechanical device
Anymore, comfort rolls in a pack of twenty
With all the hands to protect you
From the ghouls and the bears and uncomfortable stares
That will illegally taunt you

[Verse 2]
First sight of the rest of my life
I never wanted to go
A blank stare from a positive mind is all I wanted to know
Brought up by the love of my life
Though never knowing, it shows
In no time, I'll be counting the line
Between my sickness and goals

[Chorus]
Passed out from this use of the sunlight
Without a mechanical device
Anymore, comfort rolls in a pack of twenty
With all the hands to protect you
From the ghouls and the bears and uncomfortable stares
That will illegally taunt you

[Bridge]
All my life, I've waited for days that wait for days that wait forever
All this waitin' never got me paid
But I don't want money 'cause it gets you faster
All my life, I've waited for days that wait for days that wait forever
All this waitin' never got me paid
But I don't want money 'cause it gets you faster

[Chorus]
Passed out from this use of the sunlight
Without a mechanical device
Anymore, comfort rolls in a pack of twenty
With all the hands to protect you
From the ghouls and the bears and uncomfortable stares
That will illegally taunt you
