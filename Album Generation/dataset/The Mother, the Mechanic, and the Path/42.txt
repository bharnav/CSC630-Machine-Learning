Alright, now just take one good look at me
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see tonight, I'm leaving this house
And just think about it, you'll never have to see
The kid you didn't want from the beginning of my life (so thanks)
And the air will be better
It will feel much thinner
It will feel much smoother
And you, you go back to forgetting your son

And I'm going to run away with my baby
Get married and maybe someday we'll have kids that you'll never meet
And I'm gonna tell them stories of how their grandpop abandoned the only son he had (thanks dad)
And see the air will be better
It will feel much thinner
It will feel like heaven
It will feel so good when I am gone
Oh, I'm gone...

Now see, I don't know what you think, you're just a kid
Only 18, where do you plan on going?
And see, you won't have no ground to stand on
You won't have a better place to live
And you'll be missing the comfort of this place
See, the air will be thicker
It will be hard to breathe sometimes
You won't know what hit you
You'll be scared and miss home before you know it

Now, don't go making a decision that's going to leave your life down a collision course of failure
But you're a grown up now, you're 18
So please reconsider everything that you've been thinking
And open your eyes
See, the air will be humid
It will give you headaches
It will make you sweat
It will be a mistake if you go
Oh, but I can't stop you anymore

Dad, I'm leaving tonight
I won't trouble you anymore
And I don't need this in my life
I don't need it anymore
Dad, I'm leaving tonight
I won't trouble you anymore
And I don't need this in my life
I don't need it anymore
Goodbye
