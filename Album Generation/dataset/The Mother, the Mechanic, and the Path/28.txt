After school
I get a great, big house
Gonna paint the walls with my accomplishments
Gonna pay the bills with my perfect job
And all we want, we've got

Gonna practice law
I'm gonna get real good
Gonna make the bills
Gonna buy that car
I'm gonna buy the dreams that we always had
Just you and me and them

One, two, three
But today, we're finding something out
What needs to be again
He lives in different states, and you say:

We can't have this kid
He'll ruin everything
We worked so hard to get
And I won't live like that

We're gonna pack him up
We're gonna send him out
He's gonna live with mom in a little house
We're gonna go back to the way we were
And live life while we're young

We're gonna send him cards
We're gonna give him gifts
We're gonna pay my mom for all her help with this
We're gonna live our life just like we did
'Cause all we want, we've got. Yeah!
