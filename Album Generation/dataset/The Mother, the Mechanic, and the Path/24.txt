Alright, now take one look at me
Cause it's the last you'll ever see because I'm leaving tonight
And just think about it, you'll never have to be embarrassed
In front of your friends and family again, so enjoy it
And the air will be better
It will feel much thinner
There will be no more excuses
And no more covering up your face

And I'm going to run away with my baby
Get married and maybe someday we'll have kids that you'll never meet
And I'm gonna tell them stories of how the grandpa would bathe in the glory of all his power
And use his fake friends
And see the air will be better
It will feel much thinner
It will feel like heaven
It will feel so good when I am gone

Now see I don't know what you think, you're just a kid
Only 18, where do you think you're going?
See, you've got nothing to stand on
You don't have a better place to live
And you'll be wishing that you never left
And the air will be thicker
It will be hard to breathe sometimes
You won't know what hit you
You'll be sad and lonely before you know it

Now, don't go make a decision that's going to leave your life down a collision course of failure
But you're a grown up now, you're 18
Just don't come running back to me when you need something
My door is locked
And the air will be humid
It will give you headaches
It will make you sweat
It will be a mistake if you go
And I won't be there to cover up your tracks no more

Dad, I'm leaving tonight
You can't scare me anymore
And I don't need this in my life
I don't need it anymore
Dad, I'm leaving tonight
You can't scare me anymore
And I don't need this in my life
I don't need it anymore
Goodbye
