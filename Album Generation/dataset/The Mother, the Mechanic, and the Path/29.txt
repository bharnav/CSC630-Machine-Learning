"So what you're saying is, he grew up his whole life being tortured practically
And as soon as he finally gets a taste of what normal life is like
Something huge happens, like an unexpected baby
He gets scared, he thinks he can't do it, so he panics
And still being a kid himself, he does what any kid should do, he asks his parents for help
It seems pretty normal to me"

(No, you don't understand. You see they didn't just leave him there for a weekend
While they got the house straightened up for him
They left him for weeks, for months. They left him for years.)
