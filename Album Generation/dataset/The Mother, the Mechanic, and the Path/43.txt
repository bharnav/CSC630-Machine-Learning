(So that was it. I was on my own, just me and my girl. I had a little money left in my savings from all the checks my parents sent when I was young. My grandparents never used them, they just put them in saving account for me. And I never touched it. I guess because I always had a feeling that something like this would happen one day. Oh well. We were happy and maybe a little scared. We were kids out just out of high school. We just really didn't know what to do. I got a job at a coffee shop. Emily got a job at a pet shop. I mean, we weren't making any good money, but we were surviving)
