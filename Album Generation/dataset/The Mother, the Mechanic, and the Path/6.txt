All we know is change
And friends, faces, and names
So now I'm falling apart and dangerous
I never know where to turn
I mean for all that I know
We're on our own
We're leaning until we fall

But somebody's got to fall...

And we're jumping to know the truth
But we're lying to say to you
We're so far from the words tonight
That could then break the wall we hide

I love to watch some people read
Just knowing you're learning everything (there is to know about love)
Now I'm falling apart and dangerous
I never know where to turn
I mean for all that I know
We're all on our own
We're leaning until we fall

But somebody's got to fall...

And you're jumping to know the truth
But we're lying to say to you
We're so far from the words tonight
That could then break the wall we hide

Anyway
Anyway

I want it anyway you know it
I want it anyway you know it
I want it anyway you know it
I want it anyway you know it

I want it anyway you know it

And we're jumping to know the truth
But we're lying to say to you
We're so far from the words tonight
That could then break the wall we hide

And we're jumping to know the truth
But we're lying to say to you
We're so far from the words tonight
That could then break the wall we hide
