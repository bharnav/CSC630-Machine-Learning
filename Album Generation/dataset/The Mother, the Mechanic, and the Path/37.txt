(continued from "Session 6")
(You don't know what it was like, blah blah blah blah.)

See you don't know what it's like to be a man in the world
And be scared to lose everything
See you don't know what its like to build a life from nothing
And be scared to lose everything

I bet that's not what you said back then
And don't sing your blues to me
You have no right...

By the time I was old enough to run
Momma couldn't move and Dad was gone
So she sat me in a room alone to watch TV
By the time I went to school I had no friends
I didn't even know how to play with kids
They would all run around, and I would just sit alone
And do you know what its like to cry yourself to sleep at night at the age of six
And seven
And eight
And nine
And ten
And eleven
And twelve
