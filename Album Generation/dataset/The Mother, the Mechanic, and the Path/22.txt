(Spoken:)
A compelling or constraining influence
Such as a moral force on the mind or world, PRESSURE
To be undecided or skeptical
To tend to disbelieve and distrust, to regard as unlikely, that's DOUBT
The condition of being insufficient or falling short
Decline in strength or effectiveness, FAILURE
The instinct to run, to back away, or give up
To need, want, reach, steal
The feeling to always want more, and to take more
The loss of breath at the sight of a car accident
To drive by, never being able to feel satisfied
And to reject anyone who tries, and this is my life
