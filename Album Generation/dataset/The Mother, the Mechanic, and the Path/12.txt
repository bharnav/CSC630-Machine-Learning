I know my timing's bad
So I'm forcing up an, an apologetic smile
And just being myself
I've gone and made my own disguise
I was never good at talking
But the perks are so fantastic

Wait for me here, I'll find a home
Making a mix of the perfect 90's radio songs

Chalk this up to spite
And although I wasted time
I need some more of it
I thought I'd I'll yell a little
To show my hometown I'm alive
And through the sea of fingers
I find my own real life

Wait for me here, I'll find a home
Making a mix of the perfect 90's radio songs
Wait for me here, I'll find a home
Making a mix of the perfect 90's radio songs

Wait for me here, I'll find a home
Making a mix of the perfect 90's radio songs
Wait for me here, I'll find a home
Making a mix of the perfect 90's radio songs
