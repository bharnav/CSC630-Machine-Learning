The truth is you know I'm having a moment right now
Where everything makes sense
Well, I think some feeling from this sliding, smooth guitar would shred right now
And all those nights I lost by thinking way too hard and long
I finally realize just by adding some deep end, I feel alright

The truth is, you know we could never find a better friend to work with
You make us feel at home
It would make me so happy right now to hear some piano being played by my oldest friend
And all those nights I lost by thinking way too hard and long
I finally realize that I need some drums cracking, and I feel fine

The truth is, my love, that I love you so much that it hurts, oh
And as cheesy as I sound I've been practicing for the moment when I do, oh I do
And all those nights I lost by thinking way too hard and long
I finally realize as long as I have you, I'll be alright

The truth is, you know, I'd be nothing without everyone, oh
