All I know is I want it gone
It's wasting my time with all it wants
And if it's a game, well then I'm done
You know you don't win when you play for fun
But I'm all in this one

Timing was good to me
The lowly old man who was always lost and sold everything
And if it's a game, then I play it well
Running away with a pot of gold from somebody's guilt
Somebody's guilt

It's time for me to move away
To pack it up and run with grace
Along the way I treat myself
With some new lungs to clear my chest

Timing was good to me
The lowly old man who was always lost and sold everything
And if its a game, well then I played it well
Lo and behold will I never know when to quit
I'm going in (with everything)
I'm throwing down (more than I can carry)
I'm coming out (a brand new man)
To start from scratch (and just get beat again)

Timing was good to me
The lowly old man who was always lost and sold everything
And if it's a game, well then I play it well
Is it my fault that I never know when to quit, when to quit
