I figured it out when I drew the lines
I thought you should know because it came together nice
When I say when-- cut the strings
They're just twisted threads in a series of things

I figured it out it was a dream in my head
I thought you should know because your back was so good to it
So when I say when cut the strings
I'm not giving up, I'm just losing this

You should know
You should know
You should know, know. No
You should know, know. No, no
You should know, know. No
You should know, know. No, no
You should know, know. No
You should know, know. No, no
You should know, know. No
You should know, know. No. no
You should know, know. No
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No, no
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No, no
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No, no
(When I say when...)
You should know, know. No, no
