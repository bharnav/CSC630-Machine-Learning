If I just think about it, I'm always wasting time
Applying cream to this
It never stops the itching, the burning cracking skin
And I have had enough of it

We are the most challenged of friends
Taking what we need to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Pray for the time, I've got my mind, set, pay for the seats
I've got to see the way we pull through

We are the most shallow of friends
Taking what we want to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Anybody got a second wind for a tired man with a broken gift
Anybody got a second chance for a broken man giving up on it
