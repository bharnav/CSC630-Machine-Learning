[Verse 1]
And I just can't get this off my mind
My voice, it yells inside
It tells me all the time
That I could leave right now
Oh, it tears me up to see this place
Green and a machine washed gray
But all we know is this...

[Chorus]
I've been trying for the past four years
Broken a lie to get this here
It's not the heart that makes the man
It's the money in his hand
It's been a struggle for the past few nights
I had to quit to realize
That I can't waste no time on it
In case this is all I get

[Verse 2]
One year, one month and seven days
To lose the love it takes
And grow plastic from my hands
So I can leave right now
Oh, it tears me up to see this place
Green and a machine washed gray
With all the shine and ritz...

[Chorus]
I've been trying for the past four years
Broken a lie to get this here
It's not the heart that makes the man
It's the money in his hand
It's been a struggle for the past few nights
I had to quit to realize
That I can't waste no time on it
In case this is all I get

I've been trying for the past four years
Broken a lie to get this here
It's not the heart that makes the man
It's the money in his hand
It's been a struggle for the past few nights
I had to quit to realize
That I can't waste no time on it
In case this is all I get
I get...
