We're safe for now but that will fade away
It's the same old line that we bought yesterday
It don't take no time just what you think you save
You're still free to live if you can find a place
Quick to rise, quick to fall
Sometimes I don't even care at all

They don't need no lies to sell you anything
Cause I want it now more than I want to say
Don't need you blind, just take the light away
And that sweetness turns into a belly ache
