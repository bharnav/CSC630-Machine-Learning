She was stable and he buckled for nothing
Since nothing worth anything comes easy now
They got caught looking at time through a window
At someone they should know or they may soon forget

Bury the dying dread, steadfast instead of fatalistic
Bury the dying dread before the fall and final hour's gone

Some days we must surrender
Or start building a "take no prisoner" road
The weight of departure will help heed the warnings
The red lights and sirens that rattle cage and shore

Bury the dying dread, steadfast instead of fatalistic
Bury the dying dread before the fall and final hour's gone
