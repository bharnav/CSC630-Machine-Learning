Not understanding
Not anymore
Never believing
The plan no more
Cause we drown
We drown in it
Still hopeful
A little bit
Between kinda living
And really gone
Right off the deep end
Sunk like a stone
Cause we drown
We drown in it
Still hopeful
A little bit
Not understanding
Under the weight here again
Never believing
It means anything in the end
Cause we drown
We drown in it
Still hopeful
A little bit
