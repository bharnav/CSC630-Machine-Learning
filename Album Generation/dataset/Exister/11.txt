I said alright, cause you never know
You never find what you want if you stay too close
I headed out in the morning rain
Past all the stands on the side of the old highway
But they don't need to know
We see the ones waiting to greet you
All of the guns kinda give 'em away
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view
On another run to remember my name
Not holding on, or letting go
Just trying to find a little piece of what I don't know
It's all the same really anyway
We never bend till we feel like we're 'bout to break
But they don't need to know
We see the ones waiting to greet you
All of the guns kinda give 'em away
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view
On another run to remember my name
But it won't be long
Move right along
Like you've been here before
There's nothing to see
But what we leave
Ashes on the floor
But they don't need to know
We see the ones waiting to greet you
All of the guns kinda give 'em away
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view
On another run to remember my name
With everyone just counting the greys
