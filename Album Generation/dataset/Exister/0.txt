[Verse 1]
Never mind all the riddles
We're all sick the same
Bled dry and beaten
But still quick to blame
All the marks, all the nicks
On all the ragged excuses

[Verse 2]
Never mind all the railing
They'll all get their own
Shot down and plundered
Shipped out and sold
For all the marks
All the nicks by all the pessimistic tricks

[Chorus]
We are here and time is relevant
To mainline every worthy element

[Verse 3]
Never mind all the riddles
We're all sick the same
Bled dry and beaten
For there ain't no shame
In taking hits, cuts or nicks
As long as there's no excuses

[Chorus]
We are here and time is relevant
To mainline every worthy element

[Bridge]
Or are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?
When will it all end?
May we cure the catalyst?
Are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?

[Chorus]
We are here and time is relevant
To mainline every worthy element now
