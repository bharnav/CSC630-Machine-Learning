Better run, better tell the others
Cause I don't control it anymore
Gonna find some kind of cover
And let it burn
You live and you learn

Another time
Another place
Another time
Another place
They never change

Everybody say they're going
Gonna shut 'em down
They get around
Gonna come back with a story
If they return
You're gonna get burned

Another time
Another place
Another time
Another place
They never change
