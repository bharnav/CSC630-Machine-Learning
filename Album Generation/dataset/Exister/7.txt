Fire away
If you know where you stand now
Do you know where you stand?
Cause it's hard to make out
On this tired old ground
With no real changes
Just these strange arrangements
That fall right back down
Cause it's all wrong
But don't take it the wrong way
Wherever we go we find something wrong
Together

Fire away
This some bad business
Another night wasted
We fall right back down
Cause it's all wrong
It's all wrong
But don't take it the wrong way
Wherever we go we find something wrong
Together
