Out for blood
By any means necessary
Messing up, cause there ain't no choice
For any other way since
You got nowhere to go
You got nowhere to go
You burned up all you loved
You're burning up all you saved

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire
Paid in full and left for darker floods

Out for blood
By any means necessary
You'd trade your trust if
It meant that you would always get your way
All to sell your soul
All to sell your soul
You burned up all you loved
You're burning up all you saved

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire
Paid in full, bred in darkness for fire to rid the head
Of wreck from desire paid in full and left for darker floods

You let it all slip away
Burned up all that saved
To rid the wreckage inside the brain
There's no care anymore
The judging hour's come
To put us all in place and
Trade that fire to gratify
A penance paid in full

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire
Paid in full, bred in darkness for fire to rid the head
A wreck from desire paid in full and left for darker floods
