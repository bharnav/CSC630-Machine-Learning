[Verse 1]
Well I got my heart up in a beautiful mess
I should’ve known better when I took the risk
To wreck myself and to gamble while broke
Shaking something mental at a loss for the words I’d once known
I traded two steps forward for three steps back
To get to know the meaning of showing respect
I found the pedestals and burned them down
To kill my idols and to bury the thoughts underground
I’m no longer deaf to the sounds

[Chorus]
I’m hardly feeling human anymore
Enough to drag my body from the floor

[Verse 2]
Well I got my head up in a critical mass
Fighting like a demon in a shell I possess
Gnashing my teeth and speaking in tongues
Still shaking something mental at a loss of the words I’d once known
Something’s rattling my bones

[Chorus]
I’m hardly feeling human anymore
Enough to drag my body from the floor
I’m hardly feeling human anymore
Enough to drag my body from the floor

[Bridge]
Stand to hold steady now
To take a breath and somehow
Take a step to begin again
After all we can only do our best

[Chorus]
I’m hardly feeling human anymore
Enough to drag my body from the floor
I’m hardly feeling human anymore
Enough to drag my body from the floor

[Outro]
Stand and hold steady now
