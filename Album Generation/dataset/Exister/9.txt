Gotta get gone like a bat on a mission
Out of this hell not enough sedition
Give em all you got and you better believe they'll walk
All over you, leaving smoke and ashes and
Burning up faith with their "fine intentions."
A "noble cause" can bend as fast as the law

You're pledge wore thin
Now we're all in

Gotta get gone get stable, steady
I'd rather walk slow than to run with a cut throat
Give em all you got and you better believe they'll talk
All about you breaking skin on your back
It's just a little dagger; it's just a little blade right?
But there'll be more and they don't bend at all

You're pledge wore thin
Now we're all in
And time must mend
Truth must win
And we're all ears

Savor fever, savor the sin
Bleed for lessons and don't stop to fall into
Sanctimony, a self righteous story, condemned and surely
Holier than thou while screaming freedom
Far far away from the truth condition

Your pledge wore thin
Now we're all in
Your pledge wore thin
Now we're all in
And time must mend
Truth must win
And we're all ears
