[Verse 1]
Oh, I for one may not shy
Away from the fact that I'm sick
And too tired to stand this
It all seems contagious
I know a few would back that up
Can't say a few is not enough
To skip a beat in this motion sickness
I'd second that emotion

[Chorus]
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone

[Verse 2]
Oh, I for one don't want to die
Old and in the way from poison
'Cause I hate the taste of medicine
We all hate the taste of medicine
I know a few would back that up
Can't say a few is not enough
To skip a beat in this motion sickness
I'd second that emotion

[Chorus]
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone away

[Bridge]
Our state of grace is crumbling
I fear we're good for nothing
And simply disintegrating into the terra firma

[Chorus]
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone
Our state
Our state
Our state of grace is gone

[Outro]
May we combine tradition
Science and innovation
To benefit what's ailing
Our state of grace is gone
