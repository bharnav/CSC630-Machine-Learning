Boy, you're gonna hurt someone
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone

Everybody call your number
Everybody hunt for you
Everybody getting closer
No one ever wanted to

Life's getting strange
Flying backwards to the cage

Everybody getting closer
Everybody hunt for you
Everybody moving faster
Everybody learn from you
Gonna have to run like you've never run
Gonna have to fly or they'll find you
Gonna have to come down like everyone
Gonna have to fly or they'll find you

Life's getting strange
Flying backwards to the cage
