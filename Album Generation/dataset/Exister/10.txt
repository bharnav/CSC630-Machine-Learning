There's no end left in sight
Wipe the dirt from your eyes
Set your feet in the mud
Yesterday come undone
In the gathering flood
So much work to be done
In the lingering light
From somewhere else

There's no end left in sight
Won't be sleeping tonight
Don't get carried away
Everyone makes mistakes
In the gathering flood
So much work to be done
In the lingering light
From somewhere else
