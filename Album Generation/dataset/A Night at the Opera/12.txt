[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (yeah)
Keep yourself alive (ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
But honey you'll survive

[Verse 2]
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive (ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
Honey you'll survive (shake, ow)

Keep yourself alive (woah)
Keep yourself alive (aww)
It'll take you all your time and your money
To keep me satisfied

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money
Keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money, honey
You will survive
Keep you satisfied
Keep yourself alive
