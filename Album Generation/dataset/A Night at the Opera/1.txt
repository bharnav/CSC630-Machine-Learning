[Intro]

[Verse]
I go off to work on a Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon

[Outro]
