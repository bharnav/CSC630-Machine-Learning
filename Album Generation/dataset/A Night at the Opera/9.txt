[Verse 1]
Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo

[Chorus 1]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

[Verse 2]
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
Won't you keep me company?
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo

[Chorus 1]
Oh, marry me forever more
We'll be good company

[Bridge]
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year, by and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

[Verse 3]
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

[Chorus]
I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

[Bridge]
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

[Verse 4]
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity

[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
