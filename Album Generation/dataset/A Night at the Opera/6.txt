[Verse 1]
Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside Rendezvous

[Verse 2]
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie Mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

[Verse 3]
I feel like dancing in the rain, can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So tres charmant, my dear

[Verse 4]
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

[Outro]
Seaside Rendezvous
So adorable
Seaside Rendezvous, ooh ooh
Seaside Rendezvous
Give us a kiss
