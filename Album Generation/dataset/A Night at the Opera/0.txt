[Verse 1]
(Ahh)
You suck my blood like a leech, you break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts, you've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule with your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools
Of the first division

[Chorus 1]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Kill joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right? Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Talk like a big business tycoon but you're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn, you're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease, you're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? (Shark)

[Chorus 2]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good)
