How insensitive
I must have seemed
When he told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When he told me so sincerely
Why he must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say?
What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Now he's gone away
And I'm alone
With a memory of his last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All the heartbreak in his last look
How he must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say?
What can you say
When a love affair is over?
