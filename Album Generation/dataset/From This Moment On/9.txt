Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots
And come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evenin' for some Terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place
Come on, dance with me

Romance with me cross a crowded floor
And while the rhythm swings
What lovely things I'll be sayin'
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love
Set to music... playin'

When the band begins to leave the stand
Folks start to roam
As we waltz home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

Hey cutes, put on your dancin' boots
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
What an evenin' for some Terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place
So, come on and dance with me
Romance with me cross a crowded floor
And while the rhythm swings
What lovely things I'll be sayin'
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love
Set to music... playin'

When the band begins to leave the stand
Folks start to roam
As we waltz home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
