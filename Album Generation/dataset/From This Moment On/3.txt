I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
I pray each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend some money
On a show or two
No one plays those love themes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the world to you
You make me understand
Every foolish little dream I'm dreaming
Every scheme I'm scheming

I know why my mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
I pray each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend some money
On a show or two
No one plays those love themes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the world to you
You make me understand
Every foolish little dream I'm dreaming
Every scheme I'm scheming

I know why my mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
My baby, exactly like you
