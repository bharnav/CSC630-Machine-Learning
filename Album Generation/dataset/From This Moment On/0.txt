Hide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you

Don't count stars
Or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you'll tumble

Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you

All I did was wonder how your arms would be
And it happened to me

Hide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you

Don't count stars
Or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you'll tumble

Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you

All I did was wonder how your arms could be
And it happened, and it happened
And it happened to me
