Day in day out
The same old you do follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart
Whenever I think of you
And Darling I think of you
Day in day out

Day out day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awakeI wake up with a tingle
What possibility in view
That possibility maybe seeing You...

Come rain come shine
I need you and You me - the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar, a thousand drums...
Can't you see it's love - can there be any doubt?
When there it is, day in day out

Day in day out
The same old you do follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart
Whenever I think of you
And Darling I think of you
Day in day out

I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I wake up with a tingle
What possibility in view
That possibility maybe seeing you...

Come rain come shine
I need you and you me - the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar, a thousand drums...
Can'tyYou see it's love - can there be any doubt?
When there it is
When there it is
Day in day out
When there it is day in day out...
