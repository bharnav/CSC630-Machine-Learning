Although you say we're through
I'll always love you
And you can depend on me
Though someone you've met
Has made you forget
You know you can count on me

I wish you success and
Loads of happiness
But I must confess' I'll be lonely
But if you ever need a friend
I'm yours 'til the end
And you can depend on me

I wish you success
Loads of happiness
But darling I must confess I'll be lonely
But if you ever need a friend
I'm yours 'til the end
And you can depend on me
