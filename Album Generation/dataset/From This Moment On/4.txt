From this moment on you for me dear
Only two for tea dear from this moment on
From this happy day no more blue songs
Only hoopty-do songs from this moment on

For you got the love I need so much
Got the skin that I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me good night

Oh oh, from this moment on, you and I babe
We'll be riding high babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on

For you got the love I need so much
Got the skin that I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me good night

Oh oh, from this moment on, you and I babe
We'll be riding high babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
