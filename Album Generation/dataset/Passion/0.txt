There's something in my heart
That I'm burning to say
Loving you ain't easy 'cause
My pride gets in the way

Words are like butter
Rolling off my lips
Cut like a knife
And now I'm sinking battleships
(You know who you are, mmhmm)

Give me a reason to take you back
Give me a reason to share
Give me a reason 'cause love is in season
But give me a reason to care

I like my freedom
Yeah that's my style
My manifesto lullaby
Give me a reason 'cause love is in season
But give me no reason to cry

There's something in your kiss
That I can't let you go
My heart says yes
My head says no

Passion's so cruel
But so hard to resist
I'm fashionably cool
But it's you that I miss

Give me a reason to take you back
Give me a reason to try
Give me a reason 'cause love is in season
But give me no reason
My passion's in season
But give me no reason to cry
