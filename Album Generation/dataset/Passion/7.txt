[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel so blue inside
So when I'm lonely I drive to Saint-Tropez
I leave the world behind that's grey
Into sunshine, I know I'll be okay, I say

[Chorus 1]
Life is short
Too beautiful for you to worry
Don't give up
When love is unkind
There's always tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Don't let them bring you down that way
The view is golden, believe the old cliche
I need a little time to play
So kiss the moonlight, the night is young at heart, they say

[Chorus 2]
La vie est courte
Too beautiful for you to worry
T'en est bon
When love is unkind
There's always tomorrow

[Bridge]
Just let your imagination take a chance
It'll get you far
Step by step, the road is long
But at the end you can touch a star
I don't care where I came from
It's where I'm going that gets me through
It's all I need to get me through

[Break]
There's always tomorrow
Quelquefois je suis triste
There's always tomorrow
Il y a toujours demain
Il y a toujours de l'amour

[Chorus 1]
Life is short
Too beautiful for you to worry
Don't give up
When love is unkind
There's always tomorrow
