Baby, I can feel your thunder
Butterflies on your shoulder
Don't cry, I'll show you what love is
Sideways and under

Twist it just a little more
Cos baby we are heading for paradise
Soak it up and move it all
Tell me are you ready
Keep the beat rock steady
Baby set your heart on the vine

Surrender your groove
Surrender your heart
Surrender the super love that you've got
I'm making it better
I'm keeping it pure, I guess
My covers off the hook

You light me up like a firefly
I'm dancing out on the high wire
Sweet thing drink me like a fine wine
We're star-crossed and so sublime

Twist it just a little more
Cos baby we are heading for paradise
Soak it up and move it all
Tell me are you ready
Keep the beat rock steady
Baby set your heart on the vine

Surrender your groove
Surrender your heart
Surrender the super love that you've got
I'm making it better
I'm keeping it pure
I guess my covers off the hook

Surrender your soul
Surrender your mind
Surrender electric baby come shine
I'm taking you good
I'm taking you bad
I guess your star is rising now

I say a little prayer for you
Breathing in time with you, for life

Surrender your groove
Surrender your heart
Surrender the super love that you've got
I'm making it better
I'm keeping it pure
I guess my covers off the hook

Surrender your soul
Surrender your mind
Surrender electric baby come shine
I'm taking you good
I'm taking you bad
I guess your star is rising now
