The sky is gonna cry tonight
Flowing like a river, it softly sllips away
The sun won't shine so bright
'Cause she knows it would never start another day

Nothing lasts forever
It comes as no surprise
We were strong together
Now I realize so please just

Give me one more day, I've got to have my say
I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway
No I'm never giving up, cos I haven't had enough
I'm all alone, feel the fear and do it anyway

Anyway

Gonna say hello to my soul today
Sitting on a mountain saying goodbye to the sun
Before you throw it all away
Like to say sorry for all the things I've done

Nothing lasts forever
It comes as no surprise
We were strong together
Now I realize
Oh please just

Give me one more day, I've got to have my say
I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway
No I'm never giving up, cos I haven't had enough
I'm all alone, feel the fear and do it anyway

Do it anyway

Found the light that i like in my perfect life when I'm searching for the truth
There's a time and a place for the sacrifice
Well I don't want to

Give me one more day, I've got to have my say
I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway
No I'm never giving up, cos I haven't had enough
I'm all alone, feel the fear and do it anyway
Just Give me one more day, I've got to have my say
I'm not afraid to feel the fear and do it anyway
No I'm not giving up, cos I haven't had enough
I'm all alone, feel the fear and do it anyway
