[Verse 1]
I'm a sure-fire pussycat
I ain't gonna tell you that
I'm givin' myself away
You're a real catch, that's a fact
I ain't gonna tell you that
Baby, I want you to stay

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My fever's high
Your tide is low
Just don't forget to love me
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Whatever you sold me
Whatever you feed me
It's takin' me over and over
I'm the cat that can't fight it
Whenever I need it
Your kiss kills me with
Desire

[Verse 2]
Young gun, you're the one
Lift me up and take me on
Just like you did in my dream
Sweet man I know you can
But I would never tell you that
Baby, I'm diggin' your scene

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My fever's high
Let's roll the dice
But don't forget I love you
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Whatever you sold me
Whatever you feed me
It's taking me over and over
I'm the cat that can't fight it
Whenever I need it
Your kiss kills me with

[Bridge]
You're contagious
I'm confusing
We can take this anywhere we like it
You're amazing
So amusing
Your kiss kills me with desire
Oh

[Chorus]
Whatever you sold me
Whatever you feed me
It's taking me over and over
I'm the cat that can't fight it
Whenever I need it
Your kiss kills me with
Desire
