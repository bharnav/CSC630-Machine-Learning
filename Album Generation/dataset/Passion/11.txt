Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and boys you better listen

Names have been changed to protect the innocent
Just in case it's about you
I guess I'm in a little predicament
What else can this little girl do

There was Peter
He was a cheater
Who couldn't keep his hands to himself

There was Richie
Well he got bitchy
So I left him there on the shelf

So I give up on love
I guess I've had enough
And I don't give a... what can I do
Just when I've found the one
And I think loves begun
It's falling through

So I will dry my eyes
And I'll just fantasize
And I'll get moisturized and think of you
I'm lookin for the best
And I'll take nothing less
Baby what about you

A meeting of minds is so hard to find
Is there no such a thing as the one
They say love is blind cos the truth is unkind
I'm just a hot-loaded gun

There was Henry
Now he got friendly
While dancing in my pink underwear

And there was David
When he got naked
He didn't have much up - or downstairs

So I give up on love
I guess I've had enough
I don't give a..., what can I do
Just when I've found the one
And I think loves begun
It's falling through

So I will dry my eyes
And I'll just fantasize
And I'll get moisturized and think of you
I'm lookin for the best
And I'll take nothing less
Cos baby what about you

I said baby, what about, you
