Take a road where imperfections
Never where you feel that kept you 'round the middle
Makes you lose the beat
And then you're steppin out of time
Underneath my clothes there lies a river
It's my tits, my ass or never let it
Got me thinkin twice
A girls allowed to change her mind

What I got
Is what I need
And I know its good enough for me
What I got
Take it from me
Don't Get Any Better
This is it
This is me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
This is life
Take it from me
Don't Get Any Better

Under pressure, old debris and single
If you want to fit you better mingle
Don't be losin sleep
You know its gonna be alright

What I got
Is what I need
And I know its good enough for me
What I got
Take it from me
Don't Get Any Better
This is it
This is me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
This is life
Take it from me
Don't Get Any Better

Uh..uh uh
