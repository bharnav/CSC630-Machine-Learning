A little bit of something on a bad-ass day
Can help me please my my mind
Cos a big bit of nothing don't take blues away
It's just like killing time

I just wanna rock your celebrity
A little bit of jammin' live on on saturday night
That's my ecstacy

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby be my superstar)

Gotta go and get me some v.i.p
To road is long and high
We're running through a red, I'm playin with fire
I won't get out alive

Trash your room and smash a big tv
Feeling kinda flashy, do you wanna play God
Let's play celebrity

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

When your light shines on
So bright it burns my eyes
I need commercial waves
My soul is gonna fly

A little bit of you, just lick me up
You really blew my mind
Cos baby, you make my shine

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar
Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby be my superstar
Come on baby, come on baby, ooh come on baby be my superstar
