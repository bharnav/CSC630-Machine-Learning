I've been looking for love in all the wrong places
Different names, familiar faces
I've watched the moon go through its phases
But now I love myself enough to say

It's time to let you go
Gotta let my feelings show
Don't wanna say goodbye, I wanna thank you
For loving me back to life

Do you keep yourself warm with the bridges you're burning
Another day gone but what are we learning
Thank God for the young, they keep the world turning
To win the war is not to play the game

It's time to let you go
Gotta let my feelings show
Don't wanna say goodbye, I wanna thank you
For loving me back to life

Love to live, live to love, let it go
Learn to live, just forgive and we can grow
Love to live, live to love, let it show
Love to live, just forgive and now I know

There's no gold beyond the rainbow
But everybody needs to dream

It's time to let you go
Gonna let my feelings show
Don't wanna say goodbye, I wanna thank you
It's time to let you go
Gonna let my feelings show
Don't wanna say goodbye, I wanna thank you
For loving me back to life
For loving me back to life
