Cool water…

I want to fly like a scroll unfolding
Float to a stone ledge
Wait for a moment ‘fore spilling
Words to a hedge
And going away
Like a poem closed in a dresser drawer
You could say that's what they're for

You want to melt like bullion in a golden flow
And roll on down the hills
Back to the cracks
Back to the deep
Where you can harden and get your fill
Of cool water in surround sound…

Oh my mackinaw feels too tight
My frozen jaw begs for the break of night
Songbirds and sounds of dawning light…
