When you sing
When you sing
The stars fill up my eyes

Galaxies pour down my cheeks
Galaxies
Galaxies that flood the street
Galaxies

When we dance
When we dance
Eels and seagrass float on by
I'm ten thousand leagues beneath the sea
Ten thousand leagues
Ten thousand leagues
Ten thousand leagues beneath the green
Ten thousand leagues

When we kiss
When we kiss
Bears and boulders vibrate through the air

Gravity is dead you see
All I need is beating red
No gravity...
