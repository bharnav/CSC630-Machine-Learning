Check out the skylark
Riding and singing alongside
Salt cool breeze coming from the west
Ships and their lawlessness
Running wild and the waves
Wearing their bright blue summer best

Here come the sailors
Marching two by two by two
They pressed their pants
And shined their shoes
Aren't they strapping and deranged?
Too long at sea makes your eyes strange
Makes 'em strain
For the vision of your youth
Dripping castles in the sand

I could still go there
But my mind would be too loud
Sun on water
Bright colors drowning me out...

Now they're standing on the beach
In a wild colored wind
Sunrays stream
Ah the pretty boys gleam
Watching distant buoys toss
Water rolling on the rocks
Smoothing down the broken things

I could still go there
But my mind would be too loud
Sun on water
Bright colors drowning me out...
