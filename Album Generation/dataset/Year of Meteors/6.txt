Flat stone skipping the surface sink
Into the golden deep
Crawl inside like a honeybee
Creep into the heart

Give me snow and give me salt
Troubles cracks and creaks
Watch ‘em tumble to the sea
Come back ‘round you see

Can you hear the cliffside's heart
Bubbling red and deep?
When you're slow not stop and start
You can burn a memory

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…

Gather with me like the gathering clouds
Smooth the twisted lines
Float above the quilted plains
Up to the stars we'll strain

I can hear the sparkling dark
Calling me to swim
Through the sound waves
Through the glow
Into the undertow

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh…
