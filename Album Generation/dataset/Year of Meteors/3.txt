Slain
By your zirconium smile
I was slain
By your olivine eyes
Slain
I was lying in piles
Hoping shovels would cast me
Furnaces burn everlasting
Black tattoos of you onto me
Furnaces burn everlasting
Black tattoos

Burn
Brand my memory
Black
A tattoo of you
Wash
Me with your mouth
Brackish bright water from your eyes
I'll homing pigeon fly
To hover by your window white and shy
Homing pigeon fly
To hover by

Spill
My ashes to the wind
Ghosts
Can gather what they've found
Now
We can struggle in the web
We can struggle
With white spider stars coming down
And night blowing black from the groundâ€¦
