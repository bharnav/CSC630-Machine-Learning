It ain't the end of the world girl
You'll find your place in the world girl
All you gotta do is stand up and fight fire with fire

Big or small makes no difference
We're gonna tell them what shape you'll be
All you gotta do is stand up and fight fire with fire

You gotta run on
We're gonna find you
Who-ho-oh
You turn around
We're right behind you
Yeah-eh-ey
Can't you see that the bigger we are the harder you'll fall

Now it ain't the end of the world girl
You'll find your place in the world girl
All you gotta do is stand up and fight fire with fire

In the end no one is innocent
Big or small it makes no difference
Get up, stand out and hold your head up higher and higher - higher

You gotta run run
We're gonna find you
Who-oh-oh
You turn around
We're right behind you
Yeah-eh-ey
Can't you see that the bigger we are the harder you'll fall
