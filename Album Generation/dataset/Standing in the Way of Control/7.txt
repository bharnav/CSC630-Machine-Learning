Holy water
Smoke & mirrors
Boiling water
You'll disappear
I think by now i know
What evil really is
As pure as the snow
The taste on yr lips
By a small fires glow
When we were only kids
Someday everyone will know
Exactly what you did
Holy water
Smoke & mirrors
Boiling water
You'll disappear
Someday everyone will hear
Then they will know who you are
You'll have to bare the fear
Try to escape in the dark
Holy water
Escape in the dark
