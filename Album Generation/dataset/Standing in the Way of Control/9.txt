Heavy makeup
Doesn't cover up
The many sleepless nights
I can't hide
Under dark drawn on lines
The circles underneath my eyes

Ooh, why me?
Ooh somebody tell me why?
I go to parties, and all I see
Are a room full of faces, staring back at me
Tell me why, why me?

You paint a picture
Of a sad and long winter
Oh, when you were mine
Sometimes I hear you talking
Your reflection in my coffee
And I can't stop crying

Why me?
Why me?
I go to parties, and all I see
Are a room full of faces, staring back at me
Tell me why, tell me why me?
Ooh tell me why?
Why me?
Why me?
Mmmm
