These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed by
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands and his wives he's devoured

He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
At the virgins and the children he's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze
The Black Widow

These things he says are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The Black Widow
