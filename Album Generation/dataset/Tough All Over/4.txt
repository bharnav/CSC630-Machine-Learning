I'm out here everyday
Breakin' hearts along the way
I cause tears to fall
And some to lose it all
This whole world would be
Better off without me
Well, I'm the saddest words you've spoken
I'm a promise broken

I'm the ballgame that you missed
I'm the calls that don't come in
I'm every poor excuse you use to cover up the truth
I tell the people that you love
That they don't matter quite enough
There's no stoppin' me once I'm in motion
I'm a promise broken

Disappointment, disillusion
Despair, confusion
I've seen it all in their eyes
Don't promise you will if you won't
Don't say you do if you don't
It's alright to say you'll try

Well, I get pushed aside
When you move on with your life
But I'll stand the test of time
In your heart and in your mind
You'll think about me now and then
Wonder how your life might've been
But I will leave you never knowin'
Well, I'm a promise broken
I'm a promise broken
