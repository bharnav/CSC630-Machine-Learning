Well, I ain't too sure about this so-called trail seperation
I mean it's been three whole days
And I don't know if I can take anymore
And I know I'm the constant source of your frustration
But here I am again knockin' at your door

And I'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
'Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you

Well, who had the bright idea to do this kind of thing anyhow?
If it was me, well, then obviously
I was off the wall
Well, I dont blame you a bit for feelin angry now
You're right, I'm wrong, I wasn't supposed to call

And I'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
'Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you

No good at not holdin'
No good at not seein'
No good at not showin' you
How much I care

And I'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
'Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you

Everyday I go a little more crazy
'Cause I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you
