I remember the smile on her face
When I put you on her finger
I felt the love in her sweet embrace
And all the happiness you brought her
I still see it all in my mind
The way she loved me
All the time

Ring, ring
You ain't nothin' but a thing
Yesterday we used to hold her
LIttel band of gold
With a little blue stone
I'm sure gonna miss the hand
That you were on

She'd wear you when we were together
She'd wear you when I was gone
'Cause we believed in love forever
But I guess we were wrong
Now she's found somebody new
She doesn't care about
Me or you

Ring, ring
You ain't nothin' but a thing
Yesterday we used to hold her
LIttel band of gold
With a little blue stone
I'm sure gonna miss the hand
That you were on

She'd wear you when we were together
She'd wear you when I was gone
'Cause we believed in love forever
But I guess we were wrong
Now she's found somebody new
She doesn't care about
Me or you

Wish I could put it all behind
But I can't keep her off my mind
Oh, oh
What can I do?

Ring, ring
You ain't nothin' but a thing
Yesterday we used to hold her
LIttel band of gold
With a little blue stone
I'm sure gonna miss the hand
That you were on

She'd wear you when we were together
She'd wear you when I was gone
'Cause we believed in love forever
But I guess we were wrong
Now she's found somebody new
She doesn't care about
Me or you

Little band of gold with a little blue stone
Oh..
