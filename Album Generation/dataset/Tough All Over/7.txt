She was cool, she was hot, she was smokin' a lot
At the end of the bar
She had more than one too many buttons undone
On that blouse she wore
Starin' too long at her lost in that Skynyrd song
Was his first mistake
And when she shot him that, "Boy you don't want none of this" look
It was way too late

She's like a needle to a junky, she's like whiskey to a drunk
She's like poker to a gambler, she's like a bullet in a gun
She's in his blood, he can't explain the rush
When he gest with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted, man
He can't quit her

Well, she'd ocme to his house and he'd tell her
She belonged just with him
She'd get up and she'd get dressed, take five hundred
No less, and then leave again
He said, "Baby, I'll take care of you, can't stand the thought
Of sharin' you, with them other guys."
She laughed and said, "Well, maybe you shouldn't call me no more then baby."
And he didn't, that first night

She's like a needle to a junky, she's like whiskey to a drunk
She's like poker to a gambler, she's like a bullet in a gun
She's in his blood, he can't explain the rush
When he gest with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted, man
He can't quit her

She's in his blood, he can't explain the rush
When he gets with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted, man
He can't quit her

She was cool, she was hot, she was walkin' cross the parkin lot
With some other guy
Well, he was jealous, he was jonsin'
And he wound up on the wrong end of a forty-five
