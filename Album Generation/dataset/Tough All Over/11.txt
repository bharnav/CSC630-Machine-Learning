I live in my own world on 18 wheels
Playing music and writing songs about the way I feel
Tonight I'll play my guitar for you
I'll pour my heart out and tonight its blue
So gather round and watch me play
I'm putting my misery on display

I was raised with the West Coast bands
I don't change for anyone I stay the way I am
I don't do this for fame, I do this for me
It soothes my soul and keeps my sanity
I'll only be here for today
Putting my misery on display

And this road it's so cold
And at times it feels so long
But I just keep moving on and singing you my songs
'Cause I don't know any other way
Putting my misery on display

Tonight I wish someone would hold me
A woman's touch and put my mind at ease
Her lips, her breath up against my skin
Spread her wings and take my body in
I'll be gone by the break of day
Putting my misery on display

And this road get so cold
And at times it feels so long
But I just keep moving on and singing you my songs
'Cause I don't know any other way
Than putting my misery on display

I don't know any other way
Than putting my misery on display
