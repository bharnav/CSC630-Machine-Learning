"Every man has to come to a crossroad somewhere along the way
Johnny Cashy came to his crossroad in a place called Nickajack Cave."

Little white pills and whiskey
Honky tonks and smoke
One night stands with his country band
Had him strung out on the ropes
Well, he cried to Jesus
He said, "Jesus, I think I'm too lost to save."
He already had one foot inside the grave
As he stepped into the mouth of Nickajack Cave

Everything was darkness
Wasn't no light at all
Just the cold dank air and the pitch black dirt
And the spiders on the walls
Well, he laid down beneath a ledge
And curled up there to meet his judgement day
The shivering came upon him wave by wave
Well, he could feel the breath of death in Nickajack Cave

Then high above him shone a light
He never would forget
Then he heard a voice say, "Johnny Cash
I ain't through with you yet
Get up, I ain't through with you yet
I ain't through with you yet, Johnny Cash
Get up."

Then he crawled out from beneath that ledge
And felt a gentle breeze
Tears and dirt smeared on his face
As peaceful as could be
Well, he knelt down upon the ground
Raised his eyes up to the light and prayed
He said, "Lord, I'll be your servant from this day."
That's how he became "The Man in Black" in Nickajack Cave

That's how he became "The Man in Black" in Nickajack Cave

Get up Johnny Cash, I ain't through with you yet
Get up
