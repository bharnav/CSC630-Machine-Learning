So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
And nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and loney
Well send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it might take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide
And I might find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Was it what you wanted?
Could it be I'm haunted?

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

You're just the best I ever had
