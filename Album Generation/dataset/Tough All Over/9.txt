I threw our rings into a box
Filled with broken memories and fool's gold
And I woke up again last night in this lonely bed without you to hold
And I walkeda rond this house pullin' picutres off the walls
Just like I've done a hundred times before
Makin' sure I've got 'em all

Makin' sure I've got the hard to find
Little things that make me tink about you
'Cause I'm tired of this house always breakin' me down, feelin' blue
No, there's nothin' left to say
I'm puttin' memories away

Well, yesterday I found your dress
I guess there's something I missed in our room
But it didn't break me down the second that I found it like it used to
With red wine and tears I've been gatherin' all the years we spent together
I need to move on
'Cause I know that you're gone forever

Makin' sure I've got the hard to find
Little things that make me tink about you
'Cause I'm tired of this house always breakin' me down, feelin' blue
No, there's nothin' left to say
I'm puttin' memories away

No, theres nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away
