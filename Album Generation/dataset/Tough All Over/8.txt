I see you here night after night
All by yourself in the blue neon light
A drink in your hand, a tear on your face
A beautiful woman so out of place
I guess somebody told you goodbye
In a million years I couldn't unederstand why

What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool

Well, I ain't no saint and I ain't no king
I dont know it all, but I do know one thing
Whoever it was that made you so blue
Never deserevd a woman like you
He should be down on his bended knees
Beggin' you to forgive him please

What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool

One day he'll wake up
And realize the terrible truth
He'll see that he had it all
When he had you

What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool

What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool
