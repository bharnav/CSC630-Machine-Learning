[Intro]
Survival, oooh
Survival, oooh!

[Verse 1]
One more god damn day
When I know what I want
And my want will be considered tonight
Huh, huh
Considered tonight!
Huh, huh!
Just another day
When all that I want
Will mark me as a sinner tonight
I'm a sinner tonight, yeah!

[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away!
You will remember the night
You were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air!

[Verse 2]
Power unrestrained
Dead on the mark
Is what we will deliver tonight
Huh, huh
Deliver tonight!
Huh, huh!
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul
Will make you shiver tonight
We'll make you shiver tonight, yeah!

[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away!
You will remember the night
You were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air!

[Bridge]
We are the ones
That will open your mind
Leave the weak
And the haunted behind
We are the ones
That will open your mind
Leave the weak
And the haunted behind
We are the ones
That will open your mind
Leave the weak
And the haunted behind
We are the ones
That will open your mind
Leave the weak
And the haunted behind

[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away!
You will remember the night
You were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air!

Ten thousand fists in the air!
Ten thousand fists in the air!
