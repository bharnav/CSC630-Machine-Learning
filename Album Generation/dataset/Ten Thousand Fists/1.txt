[Verse 1]
Just stop enough of the limitless critical comments on my life
Just drop the judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement in my life
Step back a moment, and look at the miracle starting in our life
Don't stop the moment, and let the incredible happen knowing that

[Chorus 1]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
To be the best in the world

[Verse 2]
Just stop with all of your little deliberate problems with my life
Enough of all the crippling, terrible pain we feel inside
Step back a moment, remember how the miracle started in our life
Take back the torment; I won't be enjoying this moment knowing that

[Chorus 1]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
I know that
All that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done
We can hide
We'll be the best in the world

[Chorus 2][x2]
All I ever wanted was to be a real source of compassion
From the moment that we found ourselves drowning in

[Chorus 1]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
I know that
All that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done
We can hide
We'll be the best in the world [x2]

[Outro]
Just stop enough of the limitless critical comments on my life
Just drop the judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement in my life
