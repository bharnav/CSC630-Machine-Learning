[Verse 2x]
Say, yes they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?

[Chorus]
Then you slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the numbered
Slowly recall all your mind

[Verse 2x]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If I scare you now
Don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see
Said if I scare you now
Don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see

[Chorus]

Slowly recall all your mind

[Verse]
