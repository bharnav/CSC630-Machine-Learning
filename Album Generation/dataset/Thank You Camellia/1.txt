Wake up if you believe
Love is not a fading dream
Tell me, I'm not the only one who feels this way right now
Lonely needs a friend, ask him where he's been
You could be the light that comes and turns his world around
I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide when someone needs somebody
I don't wanna say
I don't got the time when someone needs somebody
With a little faith and a little song
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
When a heart breaks and the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
When a tear falls and the fear calls
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Sing whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Make up hides her face cause she feels out of place, and she cries
Come on, someone tell this girl she's beautiful
We don't gotta run
We don't gotta hide when someone needs somebody
We don't need say we don't got the time when someone needs somebody
With a little faith and a little song
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
When a heart breaks and the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
When a tear falls and the fear calls
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Sing whoa, c'mon (whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa) Let's stand up, let's stand
Let's stand for the vision, let's stand for the vision of love
(whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up if you believe
When a heart breaks and the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?
