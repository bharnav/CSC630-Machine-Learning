[Verse 1: Kris]
You say you do but you don't
Just like a carousel, round and round you go
My patience runs out the door
When you tell me all the ways you love me
But still ain't never been to my show
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Kris & Meiko]
Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love
Then turn around and screen my calls?
(M) Foot on the gas...
(K) ...the car keep stalling
(M) A passionate kiss...
(K) ...with eyes wide open
(K/M) Cold then hot, you go then stop
S/he loves me, s/he loves me not
S/he loves me not

[Verse 2: Meiko]
You keep me out on a wire
Somewhere between the "you" and "you and I"
My legs are getting so tired
From hanging on your every word
Making up excuses why
(K/M) You can't make up your mind

[Chorus: Meiko & Kris]
Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love
And then turn around and screen my calls
(K) Foot on the gas...
(M) ...car keeps stalling
(K) A passionate kiss...
(M) ...eyes wide open
(K/M) Cold then hot, you go then stop
S/he loves me, s/he loves me

[Bridge: Kris]
Whenever she is lonely
Or after watching a girly movie (like The Notebook)
Or she just needs a hand to hold

(M) He loves me...
[Bridge: Meiko]
Whenever it's convenient
Tell myself each time he means it
I happily play the fool

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Kris & Meiko]
Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love
Then turn around and screen my calls?

Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love
Then turn around and screen my calls?

(K) Foot on the gas...
(M) ...car keep stalling
(K) A passionate kiss...
(M) ...eyes wide open
Cold then hot, you go then stop
S/he loves me, s/he loves me not
(M) He loves me, he loves me not
(K) She loves me, she loves me not
S/he loves me not
