Here's a little song, for my one and only
She's the one I want, yeah, she's the one for me
Ever since I met her, never been lonely
Yeah, she flipped my switch, and I was gone
My friends all say, I never hang out
No, they never see me any more
But when I'm with her, there ain't no doubt
She's everything I'm looking for

Said
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops, all over the world now
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops, all over the world now

She's the kind of girl
You never get over
Give her all I got, yeah ,this is what I told her
You give me crazy love, crazy love
I can't get enough, get enough

She got my t-shirt on with a sleepy smile
And walks into the kitchen
She's so beautiful in the morning light
I had to stop to check my vision

Said
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops, all over the world now
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops, all over the world now

Here's a little song, for my one and only
She's the one I want, yeah, she's the one for me
She gives me crazy love, crazy love
I can't get enough, get enough
Yeah, my friends all say I never hang out
No, they never see me any more
But when I'm with her, there ain't no doubt
She's everything I'm looking for

I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops all over the world now
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops all over the world now
I – can't help myself
I'm in love with a girl, with a girl
I'll scream it from the rooftops all over the world now
