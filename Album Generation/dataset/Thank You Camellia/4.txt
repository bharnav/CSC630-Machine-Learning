Just when you had me down
I go changing my ways
And I wait till the moon is out
It's just part of my game

This is a cautionary cry to you
Before you figure out what I've been turned into

Just close your eyes and try to think it over
You realize I'm not the man you know, girl
I hypnotize ya
I paralyze ya
Go on and scream 'cause nobody's gonna find ya

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

I've been telling you to run away
But you say you're not scared
But when I break your heart some day
Girl you need to be prepared

So listen close I got a dirty little secret
The kind that takes away the air you try to breathe in
You won't believe it
Until you feel it
If love is blind I guess that's why you didn't see it

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

Well you don't know
What I know
And you don't know
What I know
That you're not safe
Woo hoo
Woo hoo

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
