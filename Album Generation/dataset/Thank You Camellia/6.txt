Is there somewhere that I need to go?
So is there someone to teach me how love goes?
Cause I just can't believe
That this is how it's supposed to be
I've had enough

And I don't wanna believe
That love is just a dream
And now we're waking up
So is there someone
To teach me how love goes?

Is there some way to get back to May?
Yeah, and is there someone to show me the way?
Cause I forgot how she
Is pretty even when she has just woken up
And I forgot how we
Can't make it through the evening without making love
So is there someone to teach me how love goes?

Father told me, son, we'll never really know
So maybe life is just a lesson after all
But I can't wait that long to know
God, what's the secret?
Oh, teach me how love goes

Is it in the words I say, is it in the things I do?
Is there a way to let her know she's the way I make it through?

Is it in the words I say? (the words I say)
Is it in the things I do? (the things I'll do)
Is there a way to let her know she's the way I make it through?
Is there someone to teach me how love goes?
