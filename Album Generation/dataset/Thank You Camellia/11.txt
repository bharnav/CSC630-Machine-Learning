This one goes out to you
The one with smoke in her eyes
This one goes out, cause you
You somehow put out the fire
That I was burning in
But now you're caught in it

So if you feel like
It's getting harder to breathe
Just try to hold on
I'll be the air that you need
I swear it's not your fault
But I could break your fall
We'll make it through tonight

'Cause everything is temporary
Every line of every story
Let me be the hero in the one that never ends
'Cause it ain't over till it's over
Wish that I could hold you closer
And we could turn the page, turn the page, turn the pages
Turn the pages

This wasn't meant for you
You know it's never too late
Tomorrow still will come
And this will be yesterday
But right now you're caught in it
A moment of regret
Erase it from your mind, yeah

'Cause everything is temporary
Every line of every story
Let me be the hero in the one that never ends
'Cause it ain't over till it's over
Wish that I could hold you closer
And we could turn the page, turn the page, turn the pages

This one goes out to you (this one goes out to you)
This one goes out to you (this one goes out to you)
So don't get caught in it
We won't get caught in it

'Cause everything is temporary
Every line of every story
Let me be the hero in the one that never ends
'Cause it ain't over till it's over
Wish that I could hold you closer

Everything is temporary
Every line of every story (turn the pages)
Let me be the hero in the one that never ends
'Cause it ain't over till it's over
Wish that I could hold you closer
And we could turn the page, turn the page, turn the pages
Turn the pages
And we could turn the page, turn the page, turn the pages
