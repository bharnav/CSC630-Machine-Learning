I know that I'm goin' away but I'll be back soon
There's things I gotta do
So don't you leave me there
Give me that come back stare
'Cause you know I'm not that strong
Need to say goodbye, but every time I try
Something you do pulls me back into you
So tell the driver please
That I'm not gonna need his services tonight, no

'Cause you got a way of making me stay
You got my heart in your hands
You got a way of saying my name
That I can't resist
You got a way with me

No matter how I try
I just can't say goodbye
I see that smile that makes me stay for awhile
So when I gonna leave
Into the autumn trees turn from red to winter gray
(that's what I said)

You got a way of making me stay
You got my heart in your hands oh
You got a way of saying my name
That I can't resist
You got a way with me
No I can't resist
You got a way with me
