You say that this life's wearing you out
And you need something to live for
I know what you're talkin' bout
Screaming out loud
Top of your lungs
And i bet they're not even listening
I know what you're talkin' 'bout

So raise your fist
And don't forget
We were born
To be fighters
We are strong
We're survivors

They could knock you down and make you fall
But we'll get back up cause after all
We're born to be fighters
And we're fighting for life

Been through a war
Put up a fight
And your heart has taken a beating
I can see it in your eyes
But i see the fire
I feel the flame
And it's burning inside you
I can see it in your eyes

So raise your fist
And don't forget
We were born to be fighters
We are strong
We're survivors
They could knock you down and make you fall
Well we'll get back up cause after all
We're born
To be fighters
And we're fighting for life
