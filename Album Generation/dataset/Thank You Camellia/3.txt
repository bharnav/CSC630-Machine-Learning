This city's gonna break your heart
It's gonna leave you colder
Bright light's tearing us apart
It's gonna hurt all over

Honestly I'm better off lonely
Promises are just pretend
God help this face I'm wearin'
God help this skin

We can run
We can hide
We can show off our guns and put on a fight
If it's love
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Maybe we'll make it out alive
Maybe we'll make it

I'm searching for the sound of your heartbeat
I'm looking for a sign of life
And I can hear it fading out
Lost my stregth
When you lost your fight

Honestly you're better off lonely
Promises are just pretend
God help this faith I'm wearin'
God help this place
We can run
We can hide
We can show off our guns and put on a fight
If it's love
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Maybe we'll make it out alive
Maybe we'll make it

There's gonna be thousand ways that we could break it
There'll never be an easy way so I'll just say it
Cause I know that it is not over
No matter how hard we try
Now I'm begging for the chance to make it right
Cause you've got the best of me
And you'll be the death of me

We can run
We can hide
We can show off our guns and put on a fight
If it's love
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Maybe we'll make it out alive
Maybe we'll make it out alive

(We can run, we can hide oh baby we'll make it out alive)
