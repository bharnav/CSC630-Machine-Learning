I've never been the one for saying the right thing
And I've messed up again
Broke your heart without even trying
And I blamed it on you
But there is no evidence for my claims
And I know the truth
So you can point the blame in my face
So I'll grab my coat
See you tomorrow

Tell you what I'm gonna do to make it up to you tonight
I'm gonna leave you alone
Leave you alone
Cause I don't know any other way to try to make it right
So I'll just leave you alone
Leave you alone tonight

You probably know, oh that you did nothing this time
But I've made it known
That I'm not gonna give up being right

So I'll grab my coat
And see you tomorrow
Tell you what I'm gonna do to make it up to you tonight
I'm gonna leave you alone
Leave you alone
Cause I don't know any other way to try to make it right
So I'll just leave you alone
Leave you alone

Tell you what I'm gonna do to make it up to you tonight
I'm gonna leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
Cause I don't know any other way to try to make it right
So I'll just leave you alone
Leave you alone tonight
Oh I'll leave you alone tonight, yeah
Alone Alone

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm sorry for tonight
But I just can't make it right
So I'll just be leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm sorry for tonight
But I just can't be right
So I'll just be leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
