Walking through this strange and crowded place
Imagining your face, fighting my way through
Oh i feel you getting close with every step
With all that i have left
I'm reaching out for you

If i was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you
I'd still find you

My fingers trace the outline of your shape
And recognize the way you pull me into you
Oh you're calling out to me
Not saying a thing
You're everything i need
And all that i could never, ever lose

If i was blindfolded
If my memory was erased
If every sign pointed to another place
I'd still find you

You're the gravity that's taken hold of me
Every time i lose my way
It's the chemistry
More than eyes can see
And no matter where i am
I will still find you
I will still find you
