I don't believe in anything
They tell me's set in stone
They say that we're together
But I'm sat here on my own
In the company of strangers
This trigger happy scene
Well, if a heart do like a hind
Then there is nothing in between
Oh no, no, I don't mind
Oh no, no, I don't mind
'Cause I can call someone to bring the fight on
(The doctors and the dealers)
Get someone to shed some light on
(Miracle cure, soul stealers)
Crack pot quacks with cracked up egos
(Prescribing old placebos)
Collecting junk that we don't need, no
I see them now and then
Still spitting out those lies
Strange it doesn't bother me
I've got my own disguise
And there's really not that much of me
For Jesus left to save
If savings only bartering
My soul can be his pay
Oh no, no, I don't mind
Oh no, no, I don't mind
'Cause I can call someone to bring the fight on
(The doctors and the dealers)
Yes, someone to shed some light on
(Miracle cure soul stealers)
Crack pot quacks with cracked up egos
(Prescribing old placebos)
Collecting junk that we don't need, no
You got the ball
I was lucky to get the chain
But now I have to watch the crowds
Haphazardly chasing down the drain
So what does it do?
Nothing for me
What about you?
The doctors and the dealers
The doctors and the dealers
The doctors and the dealers
They come to you
They come to me
They come in droves
Oh, one, two, three
They come to you
They come to me
They come in droves
Oh, one, two, three
They come to you
They come to me
They come in droves
Oh, one, two, three
They come to you
Oh, they come to me
They come in droves
Oh, one, two, three
They come to me
