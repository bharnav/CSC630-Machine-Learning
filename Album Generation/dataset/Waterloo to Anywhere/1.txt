I'm in to myself
On uncertain terms
I put gin in my milk
To kill all the germs
As I pray for the day
That life will return
And I pray for myself
But I never learn
No I never learn

See I really like you
But I'm nothing like you
I try oh so hard
But don't get so far
You get my respect
But we don't connect
We're in it together
So I'll love you forever
I love you forever

And so it rains on

No one gives a fuck about the values I would die for
Not the faceless civil servants
The rudimentary crack whore
No one gives two fucks about the values I would kill for
Give them something to die for
Give me something to die for

You won't really see me
I live in old movies
Cloaked tightly in sin
So they won't come in

Its like spying on cities
Through cracks in the floor
Thought I knew what the blag was
But now I'm not sure
What do I know anymore?

And no one gives a fuck
About the values I would die for
Not the baseist civil servant
The rudimentary crack whore
And no one gives two fucks
About the values I could kill for
Give them something to die for
Give me something to die for

Still I'm into myself
On uncertain terms
I put gin in my milk
It kills all the germs
As I pray for the day
That life will return
And I pray for myself
But I never learn
No I'll never learn

No one gives a fuck
About the values I would die for
Not the faceless civil servant
A rudimentary crack whore
No one gives two fucks
About the values I would kill for
Give me something to die for
Give me something to die for

No one's too perturbed
About the things that I would cry for
I've been trying all my life
Until there's nothing left to try for
No one's too perturbed
About the things that I would live for
Give me something to try for
Give me something to try for
