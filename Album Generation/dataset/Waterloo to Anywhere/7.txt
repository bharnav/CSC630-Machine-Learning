I've been chasing a dream
Round a dirty little room
I've been lacing up my coffee
And screaming at the moon

Its no good for my health
I can't rate-rape myself
And if I can shake off this feeling
Then I'll be there with you soon

I need a lover, a lover who's kind
If you love a woman you mustn't beat her
And if she's got a lover I'd like to meet her

The instinct I have is to kill the thing I love
And it seems to come so natural
I can never never get enough

And I know that she is wise
And she's the apple of my eye
She's my dirty pretty lover
And I want her at my side

I need a lover a lover who's kind
If you love a woman you mustn't beat her
And if you love another I'd like to meet her

What a silly way to go
Mess up the only thing you know
And it's rough it's rum
It makes me feel so numb

Oh no oh no oh no no no

La la la la

I've been chasing round my room for this dirty little dream
I've been eyeing up your cigarettes and screaming at the queen

It's not good for my health
I can't rate-rape myself
And if I don't shake off this feeling
Then I'll be there with you soon

I need a lover, a lover who's kind
If you love a woman you mustn't beat her
And if you love another I'd like to meet her

If you love a woman no you mustn't beat her
And if you love another oh I'd like to meet her
If she has a brother oooh la la laaa
A lover who's kind
