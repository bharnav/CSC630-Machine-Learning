So far dishonest as the day is long
Im sorry so I'll go now
But I love you so it won't be long
And the spectres in the masonry remind us of the things that might have been
Isn't it time you washed your face
It looks like a burnt out fireplace
And I am awash with memories
And worrying complexities
But in time (in time)
You'll find it very scary
It's hard to live respectfully
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
Everyones still all over the place
And not to humble to embrace
And oh my gosh the memories
But your arrogance perplexes me
Now this time (this time)
I shouldn't be so lary
Just try to live respectfully
The enemy as I know it is right inside my head
The enemy as I know it is right inside my head
So are you giving it a shot now
And it all came back and you did a little turn now
Well they didn't like that
Are you going to give it up for?
(And the spectres in the masonary remind us of the things that might have been)
All you need's a gentle heart
To see you through endless dark
All you needs a gentle heart
To see you through endless dark
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
