To think that the last of the small town playboys was a little bit like me
Hold on
Well what could that mean?

Well Im still looking around for leads
Cos when it comes to playboys
Small towns are bursting at the seams

England's getting fat
But this suit is wearing thin
So deal me another hand
Before the games begin

Well what do you do if the world owes you something?
What else is there to do
When the world owes you something new?

I want you just to forget myself
I need you just to forget myself
I want you just to forget myself

And so the last of the small town playboys
Is a little bit like me
Hold on
Now what could that mean?

No hope of hope and glory
Spilling down the Camden Road
Im in it for the story
That you spit at me in code

Well, my hearts in a headlock and my soul goes on unsung
Unsung for the lonely

Well what do you do when your world owes you something?
Oh what is there to do
When the world owes you something new?

I want you just to forget myself
I need you just to forget myself
I've got you just to forget myself

I need you
I want you
Ive got you just to forget myself
I need you
I want you
I've got you just to forget myself
