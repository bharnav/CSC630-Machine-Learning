[Verse 1]
Out where the creek turn shallow and sandy
And the moon comes skimming away the stars
When the mesquite comes rushing over the hilltops
Straight into my arms[x2]
I'm riding hard carrying a cache of roses
A fresh map that I made
Now I'm going to get birth naked and bury my old soul
And dance on it's grave[x2]

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming, my dear
It's been a long time coming, but now it's here
And now it's here

[Verse 2]
Well my daddy he was just a stranger
Lived in a hotel downtown
Well when I was a kid he was just somebody
Somebody I'd see around[x2]
Well now down below and pulling on my shirt
Yeah I got some kids of my own
Well if I had one wish for you in this god forsaken world, kid
It'd be that your mistakes will be your own
That your sins will be your own

[Chorus]

Whoaaa

[Verse 3]
Out underneath the arms of Cassiopeia
Where the sword of Orion sweeps
It's me and you, Rosie, crackling like crossed wires
And you breathing in your sleep[x2]
Well there's just a spark of a campfire left burning
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside
Reach underneath your shirt, put my hands across your belly and feel
Another one kicking inside
And I am not going to fuck it up this time

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Whoaaa
