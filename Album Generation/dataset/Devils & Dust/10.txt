[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Blind man waving by the side of the road
In a flatbed Ford carrying a heavy load
Sweet thing sipping on a blueberry wine
On a flat black highway down in Carolina
Black bird slipping in a sky of blue

[Chorus]
All I'm thinking about is you, baby
All I'm thinking about is you, honey
All I'm thinking about is you, baby
All I'm thinking about is you
There isn't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinking about is you

[Verse 2]
Little boy carrying a fishing pole
Little girl picking huckleberries from off of the vine
Brown bag filled with a little green toad
We hook him through the the lip and throw him off with a line
A sweet pair of legs got me feeling so blue

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Black car shiny on a Sunday morning
Mama go to church now, mama go to church now
Friday night and daddy's shirt is torn
Daddy's going downtown, daddy's going downtown
Isn't no one understand the sweet thing you do

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Field turned up, the seed is sowed
Rain coming in from over across the road
Big black curtain coming across the field
Blind will see and lame will be healed
Brown eyed girl, turn my back on you, now it's lonely

[Chorus]
All I'm thinking about is you, baby
And all I'm thinking about is you
All I'm thinking about is you, baby
All I'm thinking about is you
There isn't nothing in this world take away these blues
All I'm thinking about is you

[Chorus]
All I'm thinking about is you, baby
All I'm thinking about is you
Honey, all I'm thinking about is you
Yeah, all I'm thinking about is you
Isn't nothing in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinking about is you
