[Intro]
I'm gonna be straight with you
This is the end of the world
You either wake up or you don't
Apocalypse Now

[Hook]
Apocalypse Now! Apocalypse Now! Apocalypse Now!
Apocalypse Now! Apocalypse Now! Apocalypse Now!

[Verse 1]
Air Force Bomber, come with the quickness
Chemical Warfare, a bucket of Sickness
Annihilation, written thesis
Bomb and Leashes, Shrapnel pieces
Political Dynasty, vigorous lies
Multi-dead, on the rise
Realize the Demise
It's all over, No surprise

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chilling with pipe bombs, fatherless sons
Ain't no saving private Ryan but I've taken his guns
Cause there's a war outside and it's far from being done
I only speak for myself I know I'm not the only one
Fuckers got us with the planes, set us back on 9/11
Families endure the pain, got a twisted view of heaven
Need a rabbi or a Reverend I just follow the ghost
I keep an extra 4 pounds right up under my coat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cruise missiles are soaring
Helicopters are whirling
Kalashnikovs are firing
Bomb shelters are siren
Soldiers are crawling
Politicians stalling
Insurgents prowling
Casualties are rising

[Verse 4]
Life is a nightmare, I'm dreaming of death
Nothing else is promised, no, I won't hold my breath
Still talking to death, still choking the best
Still don't know when no one can be trusted only once for the left
Stepping out I'm in the dark, you wanna keep me in the cold
Ripping out ain't that your heart I'm-a causing to explode
Cause you are screwing money, law, mother fucker '95
You don't know me, keep on moving, I'm just trying to stay alive

[Hook]
