(Chorus)
30 ought, buck shot
12 gauge, is sure shot
American guns, American guns
30 ought, buck shot
12 gauge, is sure shot
American guns, American guns

(Tim)
Well, drop more, two million tons
Ho Chi Minh's trail was sprayed with bombs
Jungles of Laos, knew all along
That the American war would finally come
America, land of the free
Provayer and leaders of democracy
Debauchery, luxury
Bacchanalia's alright to be

(Chorus)
(Rob)
Nah, I won't listen because I've only been lied to
I got a few common enemies and still I despise you
It's a cold mission, they pull up beside you
In your own territory, and leave something inside you
A wise man once told me: "People are strange"
I'm a stranger in a strange land, strange as the days
Yeah I'm nice with the grouping, I stay at the range
38 to the 40 cal, A to the K

(Chorus)
