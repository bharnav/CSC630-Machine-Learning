So welcome to my nightmare
My heaven and my hell
This passionate contradiction
Of bitter sweet is where I dwell
You choose a day like today
To get me real upset
The more I love you
More I hate you
More it scares me to death

I can't keep fighting this battle with you
I can't hear words when scream like you do
If I cry will you hold me just like we rehearsed?
So do I
So do I say sorry first?

I'm flawed
I'm so imperfect
But I ain't insecure

Your jealous heart is poisoned
Tell me how could I trust you more?

I can't keep fighting this battle with you
I can't hear words when scream like you do
If I cry will you hold me just like we rehearsed?
So do I
So do I say sorry first?

Sometimes I think we feel too much
Too deep
This all-consuming love
Can't breathe
So angry
So frustrated
How we got here?

Hear me
And listen to what I say
From my heart
And I swear to you that won't change
I hope you learn to trust somebody

[I can't keep fighting this battle with you
I can't hear words when scream like you do
If I cry will you hold me just like we rehearsed?
So do I
So do I say sorry first?
