How I wake in the morning
How I won't see the space that god gave me here in my bed
How I make my cup of coffee
How i walk to the subway and I miss you hold my hand

God only knows i've fallen, I freak out to deep again
You told me you loved me i thought that means you love me
My stupid heartbreaks when will I ever learn to let go
God only knows, god only knows..

How i wonder the sidewalks
How I make it to work on time now that you're gone
When I can't make my car start
When I can't pay the rent.. how will I go on?

God only knows i've fallen, I freak out to deep again. I fall out
You told me you loved me i thought that means you love me
My stupid heartbreaks when will I ever learn to let go
God only knows

Standing in the poring rain fighting back the tears again
I thought the love will last forever please I can't seem to..
Breathe

I've fallen i freak out.. yeah I've fallen i freak out.. to deep again
You told me you loved me I thought that meant you love me
When will I ever learn to let go.. god.. god only knows

Oh, oh, oh yeah
