Rushing, way too fast, why do I always do it?
Thinking this might last, how could I be so stupid?
But this time, I'm not okay, no
I need to breathe again, 'cause I don't want to

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be alone again
No, I don't want to make another mistake like you

Stone cold and hurt inside, not what I wanted to be
I don't sleep, it's kind of hard when you cry
Yeah, that's where you left me
But this time it's not alright, no
I need to find someone, 'cause I don't want to

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be alone again
No, I don't want to make another mistake like you

Don't want to be caught in the moment that never comes
Is it too much to ask that real love will find me
I won't get stung, I'll find the one but

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be alone again
No, I don't want to make another mistake like you

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be alone again
No, I don't want to make another mistake like you
