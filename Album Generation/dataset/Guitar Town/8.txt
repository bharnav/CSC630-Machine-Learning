[Verse 1]
Hey little guy, I can't believe you answered the phone
I guess I didn't know you could do that
God help me, have I been gone that long
I'm in a truck stop somewhere on the Arkansas line
They got all the big trucks here, boy
You ought to hear the big diesels whine
No little guy, your daddy won't be home for a while
It's going to be another couple weeks and another couple thousand miles

[Chorus]
So go to sleep little rock 'n roller
Your daddy's up there knocking 'em dead tonight
One of these days when you're a little older
You can ride the big bus and everything will be all right
Until that day you got your mama to hold you
Don't be afraid when she turns out the light
Because I know there's an angel just for rock 'n rollers
Watching over you and your daddy tonight

[Verse 2]
No little guy, don't bother your mama right now
I only got a minute and I called to talk to you anyhow
I Know you miss me, God knows I'm thinking 'bout you
I got your picture in my wallet
It cheers me up sometimes when I'm blue
Well little guy, I'm going to have to let you go
You know it's way past your bedtime
And they're telling me, "We gotta roll"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I know there's an angel just for rock 'n rollers
Watching over you and your daddy tonight
Go to sleep little rock 'n roller[x4]
