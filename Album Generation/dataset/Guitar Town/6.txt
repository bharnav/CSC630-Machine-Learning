[Verse]
You're here, you're gone
I'm still hanging on
This game ain't nothing new
You've changed your mind
So many times
But I'm still in love with you
I'll think it over when you're walking out the door
Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue
And if you knew what I go through
You'd think it over too
I hope someday
I'll find a way
I'll walk right out on you
Till that day comes
I'm still the one
If you should need a fool
