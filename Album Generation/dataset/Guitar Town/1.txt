[Verse]
I could tell it when I woke up this morning
Because I can smell it when a heartache's coming
Because not that I'm in a hurry to lose you
I'd call you up but there's nothing that I can do
Talking won't do any good anyway
Because goodbye's all we've got left to say
I don't think it's going to get any better
So maybe you could just write me a letter
And I could open it up when I'm stronger
Another ten or twelve years, maybe longer
I guess I just don't feel much like bad news today
Goodbye's all we've got left to say
Oh now, don't try to call me because I'm taking my phone out
And if it rings and I'll know what it's about
And don't you worry about me 'cause I'm al-right
Maybe you'll run into me somewhere, some night
And if you do just keep going your way

[Outro]
Oh, goodbye's all we've got left to say[x2]
