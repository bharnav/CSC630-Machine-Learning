[Verse 1]
Don't you worry 'bout what you've been told
Because honey I ain't even close to cold
It's kinda soon to fall in love again
But sometimes the best that you can do is just jump back in

[Chorus]
I got me a fearless heart
Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before
A fearless heart just comes back for more

[Verse 2]
Folks'll tell you that I'm just no good
But I wouldn't hurt you honey if I could
Now, I can't promise this'll work out right
But it would kill me darling if we didn't even try

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I admit I fall in love a lot
But I nearly always give it my best shot
I know you must think I'm the reckless kind
Well, I want a lady with a fearless heart just like mine

[Chorus][x2]
