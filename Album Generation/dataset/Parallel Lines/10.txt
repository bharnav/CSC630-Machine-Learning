[Verse 1]
You're going to say you miss me
You're going to say you'll kiss me
You're going to say you love me
And I'm going to love you too
I don't care what you told me
You're going to say you'll hold me
You're going to say you love me
And I'm going to love you too

[Verse 2]
After all, another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done

[Verse 3]
You're going to tell me sweet things
You're going to make my heart sing
And I'm going to hear bells ring
Cause I'm going to love you too

[Verse 4]
You're going to say you kiss me
You're going to say you'll miss me
You're going to say you love me
Cause I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you too
