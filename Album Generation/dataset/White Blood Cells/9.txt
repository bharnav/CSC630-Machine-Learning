[Verse]
I'm patient of this plan
As humble as I can
I'll wait another day
Before I turn away
But know this much is true
No matter what I do
Offend in every way
I don't know what to say

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm coming through the door
But they're expecting more
Of an interesting man
Sometimes I think I can
But how much can I fake
I'll speak until I break
With every word I say
Offend in every way

[Break]

[Verse 3]
You tell me to relax
And listen to these facts
That everyone's my friend
And will be till the end
But know this much is true
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
Offend in every way
