[Verse 1]
I can't wait till you try to come back girl
When things they don't work out for you
Who do you think you 're messing with girl
What do you think you're trying to do?

[Chorus]
Who do you think you're messing with girl
What do you think you're trying to do?
Do you really think I want be left out girl
Who do you think you're trying to fool

[Post-Chorus]
First you said I was blind
And it's gonna be different this time
I thought you made up your mind
I thought you made up your mind, yeah
I thought you made up
I thought you made up
I thought you made up your mind

[Verse 2]
So many times I've gotten used to this
This old idea of being all alone
Tell me how I'm supposed to get through with this?
I wish this house felt like a home
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
Who do you think you're messing with girl
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
What do you think you're trying to do?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Do you really think I want be left out girl
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Who do you think you're trying to fool

[Post-Chorus]
First you said I was blind
You certainly took your time
I thought you made up your mind
I thought you made up your mind, yeah
I thought you made up
I thought you made up
I thought you made up your mind
