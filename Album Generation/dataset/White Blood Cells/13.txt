[Verse 1]
Now Mary
Can't you find a way
To bring me down?
I'm so sorry
That I had to go
And let you down

[Chorus]
Knowing you I'll think things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll probably change your mind

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry Mary but being your mate
Means trying to find something that you aren't going to hate
What a season
To be beautiful
Without a reason

[Chorus]
Knowing you I'll think things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll probably change your mind
Mary
Can't you find a way to bring me down?
