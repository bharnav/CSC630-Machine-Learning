[Chorus]
It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

[Verse 1]
Sure I'm C.F.K
But you gotta love me
The cost no man can say
But you gotta love me

[Verse 2]
Well I'm sorry but I'm not
Interested in gold mines
Oil wells, shipping or real estate
What would I liked to have been?
Everything you hate

[Chorus]
It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

[Verse 3]
There is a man
A certain man
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can
Who is this one?
Whose favorite son?
Just by his action has the traction
Magnates on the run
Who likes to smoke?
Enjoys a joke?
And wouldn't get a bit
Upset if he were really broke?
With wealth and fame
He's still the same
I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name

[Bridge]
You said, the union forever
You said, the union forever
You cried, the union forever
But that was untrue, girl

[Chorus]
'Cause it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love
