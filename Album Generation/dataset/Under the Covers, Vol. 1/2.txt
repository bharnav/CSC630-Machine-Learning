You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun (ah)
Crying like a fire in the sun (ah)
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets (ah)
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets (ah)
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home
Your empty handed army is all going home
The lover who just walked out your door (ah)
Has taken all his blankets from the floor (ah)
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door (ah)
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore (ah)
So strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Ah (Baby Blue)
Ah, Baby Blue
(Baby Blue) Baby Blue
