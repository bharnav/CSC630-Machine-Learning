You and I travel to the beat of a different drum
Oh, can't you tell by the way I run
Every time you make eyes at me, whoa

You cry and always say it will work out
But honey child, I've got my doubts
You can't see the forest for the trees

But don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I am not in the market
For a boy who wants to love only me

Yes, and I ain't saying you ain't pretty
All I'm saying is I'm not ready
For any person, place or thing
To try and pull the reins in on me

So goodbye, I'll be leaving
I see no sense in this crying and grieving
We'll both live a lot longer
If you live without me

So don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I am not in the market
For a boy who wants to love only me

Yes, and I ain't saying you ain't pretty
All I'm saying is I'm not ready (I'm not ready)
For any person, place or thing
To try and pull the reins in on me

So goodbye, I'll be leaving
I see no sense in this crying and grieving
We'll both live a lot longer
If you live without me
