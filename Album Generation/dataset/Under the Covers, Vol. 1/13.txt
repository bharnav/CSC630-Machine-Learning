I've been telling lines I never knew
All to keep that girl away from you
But she may call you up tonight
Then what could I say that would sound right

Thoughts that raised my mind just pushed aside
All the chances there that we once had
But she may call you up tonight
Then what could I say that would sound right

And when I'm crying
Yes I know my mind is flying
To a place where there's no trying
But she may call you up tonight

I've been telling lines I never knew
All to keep that girl away from you
But she may call you up tonight
Then what could I say that would sound right

She may call you up tonight
Then what could I say that would sound right
