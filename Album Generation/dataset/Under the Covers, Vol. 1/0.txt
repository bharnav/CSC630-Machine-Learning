Beautiful day I'd love to lie on the green lawn
The ducks are congregating 'round, 'round the lily pond
And the cows have all gone
Running home to put there coats on
Stay indoors, while it pours, till tomorrow

I see the rain again
I must complain again
Why does the rain let me down?
Will you try to make it sunny in the morning?

Five to ten, now it's time for the weather
The sun will shine and in it's time, get better
But it won't last for long
Clouds are spreading over London town
Stay indoors, while it pours, till tomorrow

I see the rain again
I'll take the blame again
I see the rain lets you down
But I'm gon' make it sunny in the morning?

Stay indoors, while it pours, till tomorrow

I see the rain again
I'll take the blame again
I see the rain lets you down
But I'm gon' make it sunny in the morning?
