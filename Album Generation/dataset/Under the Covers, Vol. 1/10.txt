I think I'd like to go back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know
Living there

And everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere

Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows

Every time I think about back home
It's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now
Just passing time

And everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere

Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows
(Everybody knows)

Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows

(Everybody knows)
