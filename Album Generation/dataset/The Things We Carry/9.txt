I've seen the free which you enslave
The walking which you keep chained
I've seen the growth which you keep caged and I've seen the minds that go un-raged
I've seen the body robbed of soul, just to fuel your control
I've seen the standing knocked to their knees, and I see the human beings you treat like machines
Machinist
I am not, I am not, I am not machine
Machinist
I am, I am, I am human being
A stagnant life's a victory for the lover of life that never breeds
Perpetuate, obliterate those addicted to living on their knees
The dealers deplete you, the dealers beat you like a drum without a tone
You're just skin and bones until you say no more (no more)
Unlike the silent machines who won't settle the score (the score)
Unlike the lifeless objects they want you to be
You want your object, well you fucking got it
I could be the knife in your back
The noose around your neck
I could be the bullet racing through your skull but I'd rather be the force of my spoken word
Let your voices form the weapons
No silence
No compliance
No compliance
In defiance of the rape of growth
