He was a kind hearted man in a hateful world and he caught everything that life ever hurled
Like the oldest mountain he always stood so tall
Forever showing what it means to be unbreakable

Paycheck to paycheck, three jobs a day
He's the ransom for his family's pain
In the coldest world with the warmest heart, he puts to shame what you consider hard
He's the man you don't see in the mirror
While the world was screaming death he chose a different song to hear
He's the band that's playing while the ship sinks
The song of hope he forever sings
He taught the sun to shine

Now please teach this son to shine

How can this world never break your warm heart in this frigid fucking place?
You're like the river: always flowing and growing never changing, rearranging
How can this world never take your solid stance in these turbulent times?
You're like the tree in the burning forest that never was burned down
And what he said to me was this:

"Just love the world that won't love you back"

Old man take a look at my life, I'm nothing like you are
Take a look at my life, I'm so very fucking far
From the person I aspire to be
Unbreakable
