Ambitions fall, complications hail
All my insecurities all fucking prevail
Do I turn to a drink or into what I want to be?
Is a substance gonna be the crutch thats going to set me fucking free?
The pressure rises and I feel the strain
The doubt begins and confusions reign
Directionless, where do I turn?
Don't fail me now, the one thing that I've learned

I've learned the strength to fucking push it aside

We know, we know, I got the strength inside
You know I got it and I know it so I'll show it
To live with pain
The choice is in my hands
That's just an anchor that'll drown you man
We know, we know, you got the strength inside to defeat the problems of our lives without the crutch cause we all know that life is hard enough as it is
