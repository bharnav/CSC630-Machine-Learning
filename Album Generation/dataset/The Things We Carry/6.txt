Let me tell you a story about a backfired rocketship
Some trees just can't bloom if the seed of potential never splits
Some trees just can't bloom
They never will
Born to a life of a briught future with every chance to excel
Instead he took this fucking chances with the cheapest goddamn thrills
He'd do anything, he'd take anything for a moment's satisfaction
Sweet seconds of pleasure could never measure to a lifetime of addiction
In the dark night, he tries to remember a future once so bright
"It won't happen to me, it won't happen to me, it won't happen to me"
Thats what they always fucking say
The man who thinks he's above misery, hurt and harm and pain is the man who lives his life tightly bound as a slave in chains of a neverending abyss, of an artificial bliss
And he lives just like a slave for giving his life away for nothing
