"Goddamn" he said, "I promised myself I'd never feel this fucking way again
This world has got me praying on my knees for one peaceful thought in my mind, my stride, my life
My time is consumed with a thousand thoughts
Flying free like a flock of birds with no direction or intention of finding home

It's so hard to think
It's so hard to live
When this world doesn't see you any other way

In this world, they choose to see me, they choose to see me like a setting sun
So it's up to me, I have to see me like a rising one

In my days somebody told me that the rain would always come, always come to wash away the pain
But nothing changes and this world still wants me down
Wants me on my knees praying in that rain
Born this way, die this way"

I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet so you can watch me
Watch me rise with the things we carry: the loss, the scars, the weight of hevay hearts, the things we carry

So I say to the slaves of depression: carry on and sing the sweet redeeming song about living this life free and long
Watche me rise for Miles and miles
