A breaking in spirit, a breaking in promise, a breaking in me
How can I find the peace inside me of a world I can see
Taking and taking all for ourselves, taking and taking
And it's dragging me down, deeper and deeper
Watch me sink like a stone into a sea of selfishness
Where me is more and you is less

The vanity, it's insanity
We eat the shit that's fed to us
We stomach it and we embellish it and we confuse our love with lust
Can't we find another way?
The way that goes against the grain
Abstain
The grain

The ugliness, the licentiousness, the love that's just skin deep
Please get me out before I become just a memory of what I used to be
Get me the fuck out!

We're deaf and blind to our age's cry
We refuse to fucking hear
Not learning to grow, just losing the one I used to see in the fucking mirror
Can't we find another way?
The way that goes against the grain
Abstain
The grain

The egoists, the narcissists, the waters we wade in
Please get me out before I become just a memory of what I used to be
Get me the fuck out!

"Of a world that's doing its best, nightand day, to make you (me) everybody else" - E. E. Cummings

Please take me out of a world without any heart
Take me out
When they see my hope and then they rip it apart
Take me out of a world we built to serve our selfish fucking selves
Can you tell me where does love fit in?
Remember what love is
