Fucked it up again but I'm not looking the other way
I see my errors and I know I'm wrong, but it's going to take way more than that to change my ways and start thinking straight, be the person I aspire to be
Own up to myself
Turn my life around

Make amens to my friends, I owe it to myself and them
Pledge allegiance to myself so I must fucking say: I will change
No more selfish ways, no more for number one
It's done
Arrogance is of the past, so I must fucking say: I will change
So are you going to try, or is it going to be the same old fucking song?

I must find, I'll strive for humility
Don't lose your way

It's time we really take a look at ourselves and start caring about someone else
