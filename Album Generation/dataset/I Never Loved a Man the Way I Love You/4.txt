[Intro]
If I lose this dream
I don't know what I'm going to do
If I lose this dream
I'm dreaming about for me and you

[Verse 1]
If it goes away I might as well hang it up
Cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind
To make it true or help it grow
And I only know
I only know, I only know
If I lose this dream
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes
You're the one I need
I don't want a love that's second best
There've been all of my life
I wanted to do that made me blue

[Bridge]
Help me hold onto this dream
For sometimes dreams often come true
And they all come true, they all come true
For me and you wait a minute, baby

[Chorus]
Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby, hold on
Don't let me lose my dream, no
Baby, baby, be strong

[Verse 2]
You say that a you believe that what I say is true
And that I'm the one and only girl for you
Just tell me that no matter what the people say
You're in my corner all the way

[Chorus]
