[Verse 1]
You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no (loved a man)
(The way that I, I love you)

[Verse 2]
Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby, you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't you never, never say that we we're through

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't never
Never, Never, no, no (loved a man)
(The way that I, I love you)

[Verse 3]
I can't sleep at night
And I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me
I ain't never loved a man [x2]
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad

[Outro]
No
Well this is what I'm going to do about it
