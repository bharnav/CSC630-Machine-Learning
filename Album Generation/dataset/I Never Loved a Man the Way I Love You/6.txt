[Verse 1]
I don't want nobody, always
Sitting around me and my man
I don't want nobody, always
Sitting around there
Looking at me and that man
Be it my mother, my brother, my sister
Would you believe, I get up
Put on some clothes
Go out and help me find somebody for this self
If I can

[Chorus] [x2]
Now I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me
Every once in awhile

[Bridge]
When me an that man get to loving
I tell you girl, I dig you, but I don't have time
To sit, and chit, and sit and chit - chat an smile

[Verse 2]
Don't send me no doctor
Fill me up with all a those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
That man takes care of all my pains and ills
His name is Doctor Feelgood in the morning
To take care of business is really this man's game
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You understand why I feel good, in this pain
Oh! Yeah! Oooh!
Oh, good God a - mighty
The man sure makes me feel real
Good!
