[Intro] [x2]
Save me
Somebody save me

[Verse 1]
Promised myself after the first romance
I wouldn't give you a second chance
They say if you seek, you're sure to find
A but the closer I get to you, baby
You drive me stone out-a-my-mind

[Chorus]
Save me oh, yeah [x2]

[Verse 2]
Those who love always give the most
We're crying together from coast to coast
Love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours are unjustified

[Bridge]
Begging you to, save me
Yeah, need somebody to
Save me yeah hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
Your love said you needed me
You abused my love, set me free
You didn't need, you didn't want me
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me
I'm begging you to, oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Calling the Cape Crusader, Green Hornet, Kato, too
I'm in so much trouble I don't know what to do
If you think anything about me

[Outro]
Save me oh yeah, yeah, come on
I just said, Save me baby come on
Save me, save me
Oh save me
