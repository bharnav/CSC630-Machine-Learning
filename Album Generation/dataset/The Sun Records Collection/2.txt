[Intro]
(Clear the way I'm coming through)
(I feel alright)
(Clear the way I'm coming through)

[Verse One]
And in one more year, I'll spend another five without this
I need it, I need it
But nobody knows how much I'm gonna miss this
Can't leave it, I'll leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
This would be mine
But unclear skies

[Chorus]
Directed me to where I'm gonna go
I know I'm gonna miss all this, I know
I never thought It'd have to come to this
I fell far down, fell very very quick

[Refrain]
I lost the time, I lost the time
I hold only have a life
I lost the time, lost the time, alone

[Verse Two]
A little part of me will die
The moment that I leave this time
I couldn't ever keep myself down
I've forced myself into the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
The end is neigh
For unclear skies

[Chorus]
Have directed me to where I'm gonna go
I know I'm gonna miss all this, I know
I never thought It'd have to come to this
I fell far down, fell very very quick

[Refrain]
I lost the time, I lost the time
I hold only have a life
I lost the time, lost the time, alone

[Bridge]
I lost the time, I lost the time
I hold only have a life
I lost the time, I lost the time
I hold only have a life
I lost the time, I lost the time (In time, I will leave the city)
I hold only have a life (For now, I will stay alive, I'll bomb down on em', I'm coming through)
I lost the time, I lost the time (All my tables are full)
I hold only have a life (Clear the way and cover me)
I lost the time, I lost the time (Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me)
I hold only have a life (I'll bomb down on em', I lost the time, I)
I lost the time, I lost the time (I am a vulture)
I hold only have a life (Stay alive)
Stay alive

[Chorus]
And direct me to where I'm gonna go
I know I'm gonna miss all this, I know
I never thought It'd have to come to this
I fell far down, fell very very quick

[Refrain]
I lost the time, I lost the time
I hold only have a life
I lost the time, lost the time, alone

[Outro]
I lost the time, I lost the time
And I don't know if I feel fine
I lost the time, can someone take me back?
