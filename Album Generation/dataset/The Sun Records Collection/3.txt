[Alan Watts]
"And they say after all, isn't it reasonable for it to be a circle; Look at your watch, doesn't your watch go 'round and 'round."

[Billie Holiday]
"My days have grown so lonely
For you I cry, for you dear only.
Why haven't you seen it,
I'm all for you,
Body and soul."

[Langston Hughes]
"Bring me all of your dreams, you dreamers.
Bring me all of your heart melodies that I may
wrap them in a blue cloud clothe
away from the two rough fingers of the world.
That is why it is wise, I should think
to hold fast to dreams.
For if dreams die, life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly
Hold fast to dreams, fore when dreams go
Life is a baron field frozen with snow."

RAIN

[Shel Silverstein]
"Once, there was a tree.."

[Johnny Cash]
And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder.
One of the four beasts sang, "Come and see," and I saw.
And behold; a White Horse

[Robert Frost]
I should be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
Two roads diverged in a wood
and, I, I took the one less travelled by;
And that has made all the difference.

[Rupi Kaur]

did you think i was a city
big enough for a weekend getaway
i am the town surrounding it
the one you've never heard of
but always pass through
there are no neon lights here
no skyscrapers or statues
but there is thunder
for i make bridges tremble
i am not street meat i am homemade jam
thick enough to cut the sweetest
thing your lips will touch
i am not police sirens
i am the crackle in a fireplace
i'd burn you and you still
couldn't take your eyes off me
cause i'd look so beautiful doing it
you'd blush
i am not a hotel room i am home
i am not the whiskey you want
i am the water you need
don't come here with expectations
and try to make a vacation out of me
