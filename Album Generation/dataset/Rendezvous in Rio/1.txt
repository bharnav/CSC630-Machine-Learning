Once January arrives
Soon as the mercury dies
I start to wonder how long it will take
Before my weakened will power just breaks
And I'm convincing you

To rendezvous in Rio
Dance the samba in Bahia
On the beach we'll chill
So atmospherically contented in Brazil

Rendezvous in Rio
Fly for breakfast to Bahia
In the heat we'll chill
Copacabana and banana in Brazil

Once winter does attack nice
Soon as the snow turns to ice
Don't be surprised if as I've said before
You find my passport and me at your door
'Cause all I need is you

To rendezvous in Rio
Dance the samba in Bahia
On the beach we'll chill
So atmospherically contented in Brazil

Rendezvous in Rio
Fly for breakfast to Bahia
In the heat we'll chill
Perfectly sunburnt and cooked chausseur in Brazil
