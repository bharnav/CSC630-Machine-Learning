I've searched this whole wide world
The earth's circumference crossed 2 times of 3
Still solo I and the question is why
Won't you come to me?

I've sent an sos
In hopes you'd hear
My heart's telegraphy
But no reply
And the question still why
Won't you come to me?

I've hovered over each blossom
Comparing the nectar
But now I'm a tired hummingbird

Til i can call your sweetness all my own
And fold my wings you'll see
I'll shake the sky and never say die till you come to me
I'll shake the sky and I'll never say die till you come to me

I've hovered over each blossom
Comparing the nectar
But now I'm a tired hummingbird

Til i can call your sweetness all my own
And fold my wings you'll see
I'll shake the sky and never say die till you come to me
I'll shake the sky and I'll never say die till you come to me
