When I walk around Soho
I remember Gamboa
There's a feeling, there's a beat
That hugs me like a boa

Walking by the docks
Where Donga make the samba
In the rhythm of the people
From Angola from Ruanda

Suffering along in the wonderful dilemma
Falling in the trap of the beautiful Morena
Oh, it feels so good kissing you in the cinema
With this God given love
Who would dare to condemn us?

Ai, ai, ai que coisa louca
Ai, meu deus que coisa boa
Ai, ai, ai que coisa louca
Ai, meu deus que coisa boa
