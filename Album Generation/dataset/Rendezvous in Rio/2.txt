Am I a dinosaur, yeah you bet
I grew up listening to Mose and Chet
Let others fume and fuss
Belabor the Obvious
Me, I'm a child of the Cool School
Me, I attended the Cool School

When we make love I'm too lost to speak
I sing no arias cheek-to-cheek
She is fortissimo
Me pianissimo
See, I'm a child of the Cool School
Me, I attended the Cool School

If define "cool" you must
It's kind of ambiguous
Something you sure can't pretend
One way to tell you see is
When your inner harmony
Always turns blue in the end
