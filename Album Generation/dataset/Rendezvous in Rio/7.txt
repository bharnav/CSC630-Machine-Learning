Life read the grooves and your voice
...across the years time travels
Disappeared songbird I hear
...you and my heart unravels

When I consider
...your absence then my smile erases
Sure the Creator creates
...but rarely He replaces
Songbirds as perfect as you

Songbird it's true

Neighbors in Woodstock
...you played us Perry Como's cover
Of "Just When I Needed You Most"
...trophies aride as treasures

When I consider
..Your absence then my smile erases
Sure the Creator creates
...but rarely He replaces
Songbirds as perfect as you

Songbird it's true

Meadowlark's oriole
Blackbirds and vireos
Warblers in stereo
All

It always saddens me
...yielding to gravity
When even one
...sparrow falls

(Interlude)

What Divine Musician tunes
...the heartbeat of each songbird
If depression deepens blue
...I listen to their songs

What Divine Musician tunes
...the heartbeat of each songbird
If depression deepens blue
...I listen to their songs

Though we can't explain why
...time conspires to still too soon some songbirds
Time can never tame the
...heart and gem-like beauty of each song

Though we can't explain why
...time conspires to still too soon some songbirds
Time can never tame the
...heart and gem-like beauty of each song
