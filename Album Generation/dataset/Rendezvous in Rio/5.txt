Why can't we free the love inside us?
Those inhibitions which divide us
Is it naive of me to seek such ecstasy?
I crave the chemistry of love

Let's build the Taj Mahal of pleasure
Follow the blue print to those treasures
A formula aside should help us
Crystallize into the chemistry of love

Please don't recite me poetry
I rather feel you close to me
And listen to the rhythm of your heart
Now here we are woman and man
And like those statues by Rodin
I can't tell you for me
Inside the chemistry of love
