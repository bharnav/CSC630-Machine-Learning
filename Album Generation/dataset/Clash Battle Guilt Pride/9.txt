[Intro]
I've been looking around
At abandoned cars on the side of the highway
Asking myself, "Are they a metaphor for
Lack of drive or dead battery eye?"

[Verse 1]
You've gotta scream to get your point across, that's our way
You've gotta scratch the skin with the youngest cut, it'll be okay
Too many nights in the Greyhound station
Up North Syracuse and the departure screen
Looking at me like it was talking shit just as I walked in
Too much debt, pride and seining mood through American veins
The confidence of twenty fools with equal parts shame

[Chorus]
Yeah, we were playing dead
I wanna break my jaw, maybe break the bread
Can't leave or stay, sitting on the steps
It's no surprise I hear religion on the radio
We can't find any other signal

[Verse 2]
Slow, that's how it will go when you're
Building something that's worth the build
But keep in mind why you started the climb
It gets harder with the height
Don't you think of starting over now, what a waste
The guy in your head and the one in the mirror got a different face

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Are you gonna break down that wall?
Playing with a red rubber ball
Pick the hammer up
Turn me all to dust
Break down the wall
Playing with a red rubber ball
Pick the hammer up
Turn me all to dust
