Clear the gap in the ceiling
Bed to bed, dead skin peeling
The rhyme was broken, a line from closed
Crossed out twice, unsaid and choked
Oh, now let it go, cower seatin' with the chest bones
The rhyme was broken, a line from closed
Crossed out twice, unsaid and choked
I been buildin' up your name with gold
So listen when it hits the ground
Yeah, the feeling of being alone
You'll never know
For you I kneel on nails and never give a reaction
We all (we all) sign deals
Some cash it in on the backs of the cast offs
The cool kids got you at thirty
Living owed, over earning
But worst of all, when you need a call
Who will be missing in the same song?
How's life, what's new?
Nothing wrong here, how 'bout you?
It's buried down, and glossed over, crack your neck and hold me closer
I been waiting just to hear the quote
See how the eyes play off the mouth
Yeah, the feeling of being alone
You'll never know
For you I kneel on nails and never give a reaction
We all (we all) sign deals
Some cash it in on the backs of the cast offs
On the backs of the cast offs
I'm down and waiting out the fight
But I can't wait for too long
I could just close my eyes and give it back ten times
Have we not grown up since school?
Have we not grown up since school?
Timid me and gutless you
Timid me and gutless you
Buildin' up your name in gold
Listen when it hits the ground, yeah
For you I kneel on nails and never give a reaction
We are (we are) sun tails
Cash it in on the backs of the cab stops
For you I kneel on nails (the backs of the cast offs)
For you I kneel on nails (the backs of the cast offs)
For you I kneel on nails (the backs of the cast offs)
For you I kneel on nails (the backs of the cast offs)
