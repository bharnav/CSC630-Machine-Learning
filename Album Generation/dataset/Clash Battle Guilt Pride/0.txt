The yellow line
The to and from
Forever side by side
Is that my time
Shat out on the ground and food for flies
Just some words
Just some feelings
Desperate hands on fallen ceilings
I've gotta take my grab at something great
Something great
So I'm off into the sunset
A little more glasses than cape
I've gotta take my grab at something great
Heavier than carrying my name
And how much longer written on your face
The yellow line
The to and from
Forever side by side
I've gotta take my grab at something great
Is that my time
Shat out on the ground and food for flies
Heavier than carrying my name
Yeah, a little more lasting than shame
Oh, pawner
Pawner
Pawner
Hocked it all for circumstance
Came up short, no back up plan
Pawner
Pawner
Pawner
Hocked it all for circumstance
Came up short, no back up plan
Yeah
