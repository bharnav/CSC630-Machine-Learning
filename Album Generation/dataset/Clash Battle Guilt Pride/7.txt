Yeah, you're lookin' tired and broken
Like the pillar of a dock, dead sitting
The water hitting you, but never breaking through
Is "going places" getting somewhere now?
You should be running faster or down days will shatter you
Talking on what's overdue
Let me ask you once and not again
Are we half asleep or walking dead?
Let me tell you how the times have changed
The wasteland isn't just for the teenaged
You look so together, slightly disheveled like the free spirit that you are
So impressive, doing what's done by few, living your life in blue
Might feel like the wing staff on the midnight train
You've got your heart in your pocket, heavier than river rocks
How slow till it's full stop?
Let me ask you once and not again
Are we half asleep or walking dead?
Let me tell you how the times have changed
The wasteland isn't just for the teenaged
Ginny eyes, is this my exciting life?
Or just a lie, 'cause the borderline gets thinner
(Between here) Between here and that small town
I can't outrun it on
Bottled wind
Bottled wind
I can't outrun it on
Bottled wind
It's only
It's only worth what's usin' it
Yeaaaah!
So let me ask you once and not again
Are we half asleep or walking dead?
Let me tell you how the times have changed (Let me tell you how the times have changed)
The wasteland isn't just for the teenaged
I'll tell it and be done
Swimming is how sinking isn't sunk
