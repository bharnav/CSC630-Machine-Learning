A wall of sound might as well be brick
A foreign town, you talk like you're a stewardess
We joke about how life is not just photo booths and drunk truths
But we will try, especially if it's hopeless
I am fine in a loser museum
Yeah, we laugh a lot down here
Waitin' on a chance, waitin' with each other
Fillin' stop gaps with war stories for saps and savory flavor
But are we waitin' for the slow roam?
Are we waitin' for the give or go?
You can stop it all on a dime
And send crashing what's behind
You know my heart won't break that easy
I have found the hope in this
I thought they were just days
Shots of light raking nights' early hour stay
Lately they've been a little bit more like a dog-ear folding on the passing page
What we climb towards change
Especially if it's hopeless
But are we waitin' for the slow roam?
Are we waitin' for the give or go?
You can stop it all on a dime
And send crashing what's behind
You know my heart won't break that easy
I have found the hope in this
They say that natures hates a vacuum
We haven't been kicked out just yet
Find your aim, it doesn't matter what you think you were meant for
Bury the pain, and he can't come back and tell who you are
It's just another day
So find your aim, it doesn't matter who you think is deserving
The lines of paint, wash away with the line about
How you're fine
I am fine down here
The traffic lights are changing, with no one stopped and waiting
The days are long and staying, like dog ears on the pages
One for all the laughs down here
Because my heart won't break that easy
I have found the hope in this
I have found the hope in this
