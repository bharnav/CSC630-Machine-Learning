Do you know the code?!
What do we call this thing?
Distilled, it's still disgusting
Do we just walk with it and hope it dies?
No matter how weak this drink
Twenty deep and you're still under
Bring out the word, bring out the feeling
Is implication more revealing!
Do you know the code?
Or was it never taught to you?
Was it never put on you?
Weren't you ever told you can't be born into it?
Deeper than disparity
A shred of the curtain hangs in front of me
A tattered piece, from when I was a boy
What do we call this thing?
What do we call this thing?!
Back of your throat, it's almost there
It's just the stitch of what you wear
Oh, you weren't born into it
No, you weren't born into it
Do you know the code?
Was it never taught to you?
Was it never put on you?
Weren't you ever told you can't be born into it?
Was it never taught to you?
Was it never put on you?
Hits you like a brick when you realize you're were born into it
Life between the lines can't get any sweeter
Life between the lines, aren't you feelin' freer?
Freer?
Freer?
Freer?
Aren't you feelin' freer?
Freer?
Yeah, life between the lines
Life between the lines
Do you know the code?
Was it never taught to you?
Was it never put on you?
Weren't you ever told?
Weren't you ever told?
Weren't you ever told you can't be
Born into it?
From the streets to the steps
Put generation names to rest, we sing
Out, out, to silence
We sing out
We sing, out, to silence
The let down from the streets, to the steps
Put generation names to rest we sing
Out, out to silence, the let down (To silence! The let down!)
Let us not be shameful forever (To silence! The let down!)
(To silence! The let down!)
Let us not be shameful forever (To silence! The let down!)
