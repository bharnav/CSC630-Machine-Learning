I've been scraped and I've been bruised
I never had a love like this to lose
Yeah!
Stealing your hear like an old t-shirt you'll never throw away
Living it up like old furniture, walked past every day
Will you stay up with me long enough to hear me sing?
My voice ain't much, always wished it were prettier
But I never could sit to learn
It's all the same, wind up to hit and it fades
The life the game, wind up to hit and it fades
It's me you carry, your gold-leaf obituary
Woa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh, I know what they're saying about me
The faces are changing, the sentiment is rearranging
Woa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, they'll all have nightmares about me on my best days
I've been scraped and I've been bruised but
Never had a love like this to lose
What did you think it was? Don't you get what you are?
The weight we're gonna' break free from and rise above
It's funny how those that don't do, speak tons
It's all the same, wind up to hit and it fades
The life the game, wind up to hit and it fades
It's me you carry, your gold-leaf obituary
Woa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I know what they're saying about me
The faces are changing, the sentiment is rearranging
Woa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, they'll all have nightmares about me on my best days
Cheap bets and ankle weights, full fledge disarray
But they're out best days, what did you think they were?
To you it's all the same but I'm learning to let it fade
It's me you carry, your gold-leaf obituary
Woa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I know what they're saying about me
The faces are changing, the sentiment is rearranging
Woa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, they'll all have nightmares about me
