Watch it break like knives in the pavement (Oh!)
We brand and bury
The sounds that carry all the weight (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
Keep killin', keep killin' it (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
The feelin' and this love of mine

Life tonight with sell-outs and fading fakers
Walk the line and hold hands with the sides you favor
Guard your heart with rumble strip so much
That there's no road left to follow into the sun

I'm trying and failing!

Watch it break like knives in the pavement!
We brand and bury
The sounds that carry all the weight (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
Keep killin', keep killin' it (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
The feelin' and this love of mine

Climb and climb, does the view ever become the life?
No time, the bomb won't wait to be analyzed
Is it about the sound or the system?
If you're talkin' to me how can you listen? (Hey!)
Listen? (Hey!)
Listen?

Take the whole damn story in line
And what it's worth
Take every clash, battle, the guilt, and pride
And fill the verse
Now tell me do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
The rip in the wings?
Now tell me do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
The slash of the heels?
It's buried so what's left to feel?

(Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
Watch it break like knives in the pavement!
(Woa-ah-oh) GO!
We're just getting warm!
We brand and bury
The sounds that carry all the weight (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
Keep killin', keep killin' it! (Woa-ah-oh oh-oh)
The feelin' and this love of mine!
