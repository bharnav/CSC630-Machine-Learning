Talkin' in my sleep
Back pedal to the reason you don't wanna' walk with me
Don't fight what you can't say, you know I do it
You can't hope to live off change, or hope she's gonna' chase
Or barter on good faith
Or wither white with grace
While drive eats you away
But you and I
We're breaking the windows so we can feel the cold
Computers and candles lighting what we know
We're doing fine
Now and here won't fade this time
Drove up to Beacon Hill for the first time tonight
It's us against our will
With Neil Young and Catholic guilt
So we're both a little gone, and the scenery's getting hazy
The view goes on and on, to sad bastard songs
We're breaking the windows so we can feel the cold
Computers and candles lighting what we know
We're doing fine
Now and here won't fade this time
At the starting line of last year
Grinning like a fool
Can you tell how much the road veers
Can you own it, if it owns you?
We're breaking the windows so we can feel the cold
Computers and candles lighting what we know
We're doing fine
Now and here won't fade this
Time, I promise that we won't sell the store
Yeah, there's wintery weather, but I'll never leave New York
But we're doin' fine
Now and here won't fade this time
