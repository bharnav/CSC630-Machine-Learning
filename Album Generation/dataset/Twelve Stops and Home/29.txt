[Verse 1]
I found a switch
You turned it on
I hit the ditch
You carried on
I was so near
Now you're so far
Are you quite sure
Just who you are

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh I-I-I-I-I
Oh you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
Oh and I-I-I-I-I
I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
Oh take a little time
Come on, take a little time

[Chorus]
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all

(He loves it when you call)
(He loves it when you call)

[Verse 2]
Remember me, I used to be
Your best time buddy that you couldn't wait to see
But getting old, it takes its toll
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh I-I-I-I-I-I
I'm flipping with a coin that's got a tail on either side
Oh and I-I-I-I-I-I
I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
You could have it all
We should have it all

[Chorus]
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
(He loves it when you call)
(He loves it when you call)

[Bridge]
Yeah I wonder where you been
Yeah I wonder who you seen
And I hope you find your train
When you do I really hope it's all it seems

[Chorus]
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
