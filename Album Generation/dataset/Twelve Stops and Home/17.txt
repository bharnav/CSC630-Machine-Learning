In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never knew I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face
I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up
You still have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
Cos I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turned
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, by the lakeside
When daylight broke
I saw the Earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
Cos somewhere there's a place we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please, don't give up
I moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no one needs
Don't give up
Cos you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one, no
Don't give up
There's no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up
Cos somewhere there's a place we belong
