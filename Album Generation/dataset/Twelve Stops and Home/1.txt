[Verse 1]
People in love get fast and foolish
People in love get everything wrong
People in love get scared and stupid
People in love get everything wrong

[Chorus]
At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
Never be lonely

[Post-Chorus]
B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you

[Verse 2]
People in love get special treatment
People in love get everything wrong
People in love, their hearts get eaten
People in love get everything wrong

[Chorus]
At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
Never be lonely

[Post-Chorus]
B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you

[Outro]
Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonely
