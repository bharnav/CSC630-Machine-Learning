Oh, look at you go
You've got the rest in tow
The best thing going
And you know
Look at you go
You come and the highs seem low
The quick seem slow
And you know
And every time that I laugh
Though I really wanna cry, you know
And every time that I tell you
I don't care and I lie, you know
'Cos you've got everything on me
And I've got nothing on you
Yeah, and it terrifies me
Tell me, what I can do?
If you won't play fairly, then spare me
Look at you go
How could I stop you now
Or slow you down?
This is your town
And I'll never be untruthful to you
Deceitful or cruel
'Cos you'd just see right through
And that's why I can't fool around with you
And every time I can't say
What I really wanna say, you know
Yes, every time just a trace
Of that look on my face and you know
'Cos you've got everything on me
And I've got nothing on you
Yeah, and it terrifies me
Baby, what can I do?
If you won't play fairly, then spare me
'Cos you've got everything on me
And I've got nothing on you
Yeah, and it terrifies me
Baby, what can I do?
'Cos you've got everything on me
And I've got nothing on you
Yeah, and it terrifies me
Baby, what can I do?
If you won't play fairly, then spare me
