[Verse 1]
I turn on the tap and run some water
Flick a little switch on the wall
I'm hoping you remember what I taught ya
Hoping you remember me at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm strong
But I feel like a mouse when you're gone
And I'm weak
But I'll take on the world when you're here
With me, with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see you're in the wrong place?
Will you please face it and come home?
When I think about your sweet face
I can't wait for you to come home
I can see you got a real taste for that champagne but it's all gone
Come home, the kettle's on

[Verse 2]
I've got a little something on my mind
To keep it to myself isn't really very kind
Pouring out my heart isn't usually my style
But you gave me an inch so I'm gonna take a mile
You see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm strong
But I feel like a mouse when you're gone
And I'm weak
But I'll take on the world when you're here
With me, with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see you're in the wrong place?
Will you please face it and come home?
When I think about your sweet face
I can't wait for you to come home
I can see you got a real taste for that champagne but it's all gone
So come home, the kettle's on
Yeah yeah yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Can't you see you're in the wrong place?
Will you please face it and come home?
When I think about your sweet face
I can't wait for you to come home

Can't you see you're in the wrong place?
Will you please face it and come home?
When I think about your sweet face
I can't wait for you to come home
