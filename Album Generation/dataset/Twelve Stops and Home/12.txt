I wonder what's in your head
Who's in your heart, who's in your bed
I'm trying, I'm trying to see
What I see in you, what you see in me
But it makes no sense to me but
I'm gonna do it properly this time
Gonna get it right, gonna get it right
And if my love escapes me this time
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
'Cos I did it right
I'm sorry but what can I say?
I'm paying a price for playing those games
And baby, you turned it on me
And now I can see things I never could see
I just want to make my peace
I'm gonna do it properly this time
Gonna get it right, get it right
And if my love escapes me this time
Gonna be alright, I'll be alright
I'm gonna try, oh yeah, oh, oh, aah, aah, aah
I'm gonna do it properly this time
Gonna get it right, gonna get it right
And if my love escapes me this time
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
'Cos I did it right
