I'm so sorry when I told you
Those smokestacks were making clouds for the sky
But if I told you the truth
It would just bring so many tears
So many tears to your eyes

I said it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe

Oh remember sitting on that beach
Watching all tha lightning fill up the sky
Well you got so scared
Until I told you it was just fireworks like the fourth of July

I said it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe

I Know one day you'll be old enough
To know my stories I told are not true
But when you have your own children
And they ask you questions
You'll know, you'll know just what to do

You'll say it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
Oh that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
