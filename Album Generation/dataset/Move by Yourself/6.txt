Watchin the moon rise and the sun fall
Tell me there ain't no one else at all
I said ain't no one
You can take my day into night
Still give me all that lovin light
Thats what you do
Everytime you walk out that door
I just love you more
Won't you just stay here with me
Everytime you walk out that door
I just love you more
Baby
Won't you stay here with me
With me

Make me an offer i can't refuse
Make me an offer where you won't lose
I said you won't lose
My heart is tremblin minus two
For your love ain't no deal i want to lose
I said no
I dont want to lose
Everytime you walk out that door
I just love you more
Baby
Won't you stay here with me
Everytime you walk out that door
I just love you more
Baby won't you stay here with me
Stay here with me yeah
If i let you borrow my tomorrow
Would you just stay with me today
If i let you borrow my tomorrow
Would you just stay with me
Stay with me girl
Everytime you walk out that door
Baby won't you stay here with me...today
