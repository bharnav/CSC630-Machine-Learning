Do you ever wake up and wonder how your world could change
'Cause feels so strange
Yeah you feel so strange
Do you ever feel like everything you're doing never gets done
Like you're on the run
Like you're on the run

Don't it feel so good to let it go
Forget about everything you know

Do you ever feel like all you do is try and try
But you never get by
I said you never get by
Do ever feel like what you're doing ain't what you want
It's just what you've been taught
Just what you've been taught

It's gonna feel so good to let it go
Forget about everything you know
Grab a friend let's come togheter
Times like these should last forever

Laught at me
And I'll laugh too
Cry At Me
And I'll cry with you
Laught at me
And I'll laugh too
Cry At Me
And I'll cry with you
Just to help you through

'Cause it feels so good to let it go
Forget about everything you know
Grab a friend let's come togheter
Times like these should last forever

Feels so good to let it go
Forget about everything you know
Grab a friend let's come togheter
Times like these should last forever
