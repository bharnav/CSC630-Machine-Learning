I never thought it'd happen to me
I've been looking all my life just to be
Be next to someone I could call my own
You know it feels so good not to be alone

But you know I never
Thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
I said I never
Thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine

My girl's just so sweet
I never thought I could ever meet
But now it's you
I can't live without
If you ever left
I'd be down and out

But you know I never
Thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
I said I never
Thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
I'd call all mine

Oh baby what did you say
When you woke up the other day
You said it's you I'd never leave
I don't want to live my life the way it use to be

But you know I never thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
I said I never thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
I said I never thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
You know i never thought I would find
A girl like you
I could call all mine
Call all mine
