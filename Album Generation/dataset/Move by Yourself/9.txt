It's six in the morning and not a plae to go
My mind is running
But I don't know
When to speed up, even slow down
This road here laughs at me like I'm a clown

But you got to go around the world that's around you
Go out on the streets that surround you
One day we'll all be taught
Love is all we got
I said , love is all we got

A sense of worth when the day is done
'Cause you tried your hardest out on the run
You looke back and wonder if it's all worth it
But you can never put a price on the days that we're perfect

But you got to go around the world that's around you
Go out on the streets that surround you
One day we'll all be tired
Love is all we got, got, got baby
Love is all we got
Yo know we got, got, got, baby
Love is all we got

Go Out and find some
Find some love
Go out and find some
Find some love
Go out and find some
Go out and find some love

Well I don't know if you love or hat it
But it's better than a book in a room that is faded
So cover up these scars that are on my feet
With only the beautiful pictures of all the people we meet

But you got to go around the world that's around you
Go out on the streets that surround you
One day we'll all be taught
I said, love is all we got, got, got, baby
Love is all we got
I said we got, got baby
Love is all we got

Oh find some love, find some love
You got to, you got to find some love
Why don't you, oh why don't you find some love
You just got to go out on the streets that surround you
You just got to go around the world that's around you
You just got to find some, find some, find some love

It's gonna feel so good
When you find some, when you find some
It's gonna feel so good when you get some love
I said you got to find some love
Oh it's gonna feel so good, it's gonna feel so good
When you find it, Oh when you find it
You got to, you got to find some love
It's all around you, it's all around you
I said it's all around you
You got to find some
Yeah yeah yeah
You got to find some love
