I know there's a place
You call it home
But it's not a house 'cause you're all alone
Said you went down to those broken streams
Been floating in our broken dreams

The wind that blows here
Saved my soul
The air is always clean you know
These four arms will hold us three
Our hearts together beat

I know there's a place
High a top this hill
We can go there, get away and just stand still
I know this life I'm living
Is hard to understand
I'll never stop being your loving man

The wind that blows here
Saved my soul
The air is always clean you know
These four arms will hold us three
Our hearts together beat

It hurts so bad to be away from you
My only son, come up and see us soon

The wind that blows here
Saved my soul
The air is always clean you know
These four arms will hold us three
Our hearts together beat

The wind that blows here
Saved my soul
The air is always clean you know
These four arms will hold us three
Our hearts together beat
