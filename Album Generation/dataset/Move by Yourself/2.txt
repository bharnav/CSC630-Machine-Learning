I got word today
A friend gone done me wrong
And that's alright
'Cause bad thing don't last long
They made me believe
Believe they were my friends
But I'm not blind
Blind to see it end
But you know what
I'm going to be just fine
'Cause I'm going home tonight

I'm gonna be right by your side
It's gonna feel so good
I'm gonna be right by your side

Ask how you're doin'
And don't even get a reply
I guess they think
I'm just another guy

Quick to forget
About the friends you had
But then again
I really think you're glad
But you know what

I'm going to be just fine
'Cause I'm going home tonight
I'm gonna be right by your side
It's gonna feel so good
I'm gonna be right by your side
I'm comin' home baby
I'm gonna be right by your side
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gonna be right by your side
I'm comin' home baby, comin' home

I'm gonna be right by your side
It's gonna feel so good
I'm gonna be right by your side
I can't wait baby no
I daid I'm gonna be right by your side
It's gonna feel so good
I'm gonna be right by your side
