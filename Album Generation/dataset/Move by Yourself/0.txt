I remember those times
When they said I couldn't make it
I told them I couldn't just do what they wanted and fake it

They said they'd be shocked if I could find another place to go
And you know they said if I left I'd just be all left alone
And then a friend said

Don't stop doing what you belive in
Don't let them put you on a shelf
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight

Sometimes they can't forget
Forget just what you've got
But don't ever be no, no
Somebodu that you're not
When there's a choice you've got to make
Do what you feel, don't hesitate
You know I will never, never forget what a friend said
His words keep ringing in my head
He said

Don't stop doing what you belive in
Don't let them put you on a shelf
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
I said you've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
Oh move on, move on baby

Move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight
