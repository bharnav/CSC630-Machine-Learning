Where did you go, what did you do, late last night
Baby don't you know that, I don't want to fight

Oh baby why did you get up and leave
Don't you know woman, you're the roots of my tree

That's too bad
That's too bad
Your love ain't gonna make me sad no more, no more, no more, no more

Yesterday seems like a life ago
But today seems like it's movin' real slow

When I look into your big brown eyes
I don't care if tomorrow's ever gonna lie

That's too bad
That's too bad
Your love ain't gonna make me sad no more

That's too bad
That's too bad
Your love ain't gonna make me sad no more, no more, no more, no more
