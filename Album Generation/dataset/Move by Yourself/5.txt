Oh baby, why did you treat me like a fool
Oh baby, why did you treat me like a fool

'Cause I ain't never done nothing
You know I ain't done nothing to you

Oh Baby, why do you do those things you do
Oh Baby, why do you do those things you do

'Cause I ain't never done nothing
And no I ain't done nothing to you
I keep askin' why

Oh baby, why did you treat me like a fool
Oh baby, why did you treat me like a fool

'Cause I ain't never done nothing
And no I ain't done nothing to you
And I keep askin' why

I Keep askin' why
She gonna treat me like a fool like that
Why you treat me like a fool like that
And I keep askin' why girl
