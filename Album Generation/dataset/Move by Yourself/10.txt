I don't want nothing
But I just got something I can't get off my mind
I can't get off my mind

What ever happened to those places
And all those familiar faces that i once knew
I once knew

Don't worry about tomorrow
I just want to stay
So we can make it through
Another beautiful
Another beautiful day
You and me baby
We're gonna make it through
Another beautiful day
Another beautiful day

You said, you said they'd last forever
But now they're covered up by the roads that
Join us together, join us together
I wonder how this all begun
I think to myself
When will this all be done
When will this all be done

But then you say
Don't worry about tomorrow
I just want you to stay
So we can make it through
Another beautiful
Another beautiful day

Just you and me baby
You know we're gonna make it through
I said we're gonna make it through
Another beautiful day
Another beautiful day yeah
Another beautiful day
Just you and me
