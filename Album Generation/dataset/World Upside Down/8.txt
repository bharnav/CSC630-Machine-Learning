I walk into another day
Afraid to look you in the eyes
I paid the price for hurting you
I failed to read between the lines

If everything is falling down
And burning in the way
And I can't see the light anymore
I'll be strong now you're gone
'Cause it's too late to change
I'm haunted by the ghost of time

I should have listened to your words
But it's too late to turn back now
There could have been another world
But now I'll pay for every lie

If everything is falling down
And burning in the way
And I can't see the light anymore
I'll be strong now you're gone
'Cause it's too late to change
I'm haunted by the ghost of time

For every moment that remains
For every storm to take its place
The days we had are lost in time
But you will never leave my mind

If everything is falling down
And burning in the way
And I can't see the light anymore
I'll be strong now you're gone
'Cause it's too late to change
I'm haunted by the ghost of time

You will never leave my mind
(I'll be strong now you're gone)
You will never leave my mind
(I'll be strong now you're gone)
Oh, you will never leave my mind
(I'll be strong now you're gone)
