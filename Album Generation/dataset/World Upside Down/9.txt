My generation
Will take your breath away
Let the music play
My generation
Will always lead the way
Just like yesterday

My momma warned me I was
Wasting my precious time
Yeah, I think she knew that I was
Gone, gone, really gone now
I turned my radio on high
And sang along with Jimi
He took that Voodoo Child
Down, down, all the way down

He set a fire deep in my soul
Oh, ya know it took hold
He shook desire out of control
He said I'm coming to get ya!
I'm coming to get ya!

My generation
Will take your breath away
Just let the music play
My generation
Will always lead the way
Just like yesterday

My body warned me I was
Wrecking my precious mind
Yeah, I think I knew that I was
Gone, gone, really gone now
I heard the music in my head
While I was hanging by a thread
It took a while to get me
Down, down, all the way down

I felt the fire deep in my soul
Oh, ya know it took hold
I shook desire out of control

My generation
Will take your breath away
Just let the music play
My generation
Will always lead the way
Just like yesterday

My generation
Will take your breath away
Just let the music play
My generation
Will always lead the way
Just like yesterday

My generation
Let the music play
My generation
Just like yesterday
