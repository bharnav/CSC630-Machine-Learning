He woke up in the middle of the night
He could hear the echoes of the fight
He would always check his scope
Before he'd load his magazine
He tried to fight the fire in his head
And fought to keep the focus sharp instead
He never knew he'd ever be
A hero at nineteen

It's time to go (inside he knows)
He's on his own (so all alone)
No compromise (none in his eyes)
No questions why, never say die

On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together
In this land of liberty
They wear their Purple Hearts forever

He wet his face to wash the fear away
He said a prayer behind the barricade
He looked out on the desert
As they rolled on down the road
There wasn't any warning or retreat
When twenty-seven vanished in the heat
They never knew that they were going down
Not going home

No compromise (none in his eyes)
No questions why, never say die

On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together
In this land of liberty
They wear their Purple Hearts forever

No compromise (none in his eyes)
No questions why, never say die

On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together
In this land of liberty
They wear their Purple Hearts forever

On the field of shattered dreams
They rise to pull themselves together
In this land of liberty
They wear their Purple Hearts forever
