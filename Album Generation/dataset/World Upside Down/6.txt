Ooh...
Mm-hmm

I stand beneath this neon sky
Calling out your name, afraid today's the day
The wheels are turning in my mind
This carnival of love lost in my mind

And the way I'm feeling, it just won't fade away
And the hardest part is how to face each day

I'll give you love, I'll give you everything
If there's a chance that you'll come back to me
'Cause there's a fire deep inside my soul
And for you I'd walk a million miles tonight

I know that I was never there
When you would call my name, I have myself to blame
I've had some time to think things out
I know that I was wrong, and I need you now

All my dreams are fading, but I keep holding on
And my every weakness makes you strong

I'll give you love, I'll give you everything
If there's a chance that you'll come back to me
'Cause there's a fire deep inside my soul
And for you I'd walk a million miles tonight

And the way I'm feeling, it just won't fade away
And the hardest part is how to face each day

I'll give you love, I'll give you everything
If there's a chance that you'll come back to me
'Cause there's a fire deep inside my soul
And for you I'd walk, I'd crawl a million miles tonight

A million miles tonight
I'd crawl a million miles tonight
Oh...
