You made me wanna reach out
Even though I had to let you go
It was time to turn this all around
You twisted all the rules of play
Broke all the promises you made
Now I'm gonna burn the whole thing down

I was addicted to the drugs of your affections
You knew just how to turn my key

But I'm free, free to fly away
Not like yesterday
It's hard to fight this feeling
I'm free, free to cut you loose
Free to speak the truth
And you never even noticed
I'm free!

You took me places in the dark
Even though I let you run the show
All those places were so heartless
I should've known it from the start
The winds of change were gonna blow
Until I opened up my eyes

I was afflicted by the rumors and deceptions
Your house of cards was all a dream

And I'm free, free to fly away
Not like yesterday
It's hard to fight this feeling
I'm free, free to cut you loose
Free to speak the truth
And you never even noticed

Your house of cards was all a dream

I'm free, free to fly away
Not like yesterday
And it's hard to fight this feeling
I'm free, free to cut you loose
Free to speak the truth
And you never even noticed

I'm free, free to fly away
Not like yesterday
And it's hard to fight this feeling
I'm free, free to cut you loose
Free to speak the truth
And you never even noticed
I'm free!
You never even noticed
I'm free!
