When ya found me, I was lost in a dream
With a heart made of stone
Oh, I was trying to find someone to believe
I was dying on my own

Oh, I remember falling apart at the seams
Whoa, that first night that I saw you

Your eyes, they give you away
They show the passion and reveal all the pain
Your eyes, they're calling my name
From deep inside you

All my defenses started drifting away
When you walked in the room
I couldn't speak but I had so much to say
You had me howling at the moon

Oh, I remember falling apart at the seams
Oh, that first night that I saw you

Your eyes, they give you away
They show the passion and reveal all the pain
Your eyes, they're calling my name
From deep inside you

Oh, I remember falling apart at the seams
Oh, that first night that I saw you

Your eyes, they give you away
They show the passion and reveal all the pain
Your eyes, they're calling my name
From deep inside you

Your eyes, they give you away
They show the passion and reveal all the pain
Your eyes, they're calling my name
From deep inside you

When ya found me, I was lost in a dream
