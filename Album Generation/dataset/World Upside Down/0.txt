These are the times we live in
All of the signs were given
We never dreamed they'd blow us away

Blue is the color of her eyes
They turn black in the dead of the night
She's got to always know
She's the center of attention
The way she holds her head
She's like a cat scratching at your bed
She's always been the queen of infatuation
I use to love the danger
We used to run on the edge of the knife
She was a fallen angel
Another tabloid socialite

These are the times we live in
All of the signs were given
We never dreamed they'd blow us away
So far away
(So far away)

Red was the color of her lips
She had the magic and did all the tricks
She played the games of the master magician
The way she moved her hips
Was like a hustler trying to make it rich
I finally figured out her unholy mission
I use to feed her fire
I never thought I'd feel the burn
She was my sole desire
That was the hardest lesson to learn

These are the times we live in
All of the signs were given
We never dreamed they'd blow us away

(So far away)

She was my sole desire
That was the hardest lesson to learn

These are the times we live in
All of the signs were given
We never dreamed they'd blow us away

These are the times we live in
All of the signs were given
We never dreamed they'd blow us away

(So far away)
