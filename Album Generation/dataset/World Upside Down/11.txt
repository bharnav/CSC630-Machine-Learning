It feels like I've been here before
It's so familiar
But I am not the way I used to be
Now that I am made of stone
(It's so familiar)

Come in from the wilderness
All but shattered
I figured out what matters most to me
Now you're here and I am home

I'd turn the world upside down
Just to find what I found
You were just what I needed
To turn my whole world around

Together we can make it right
Love will save us
Together we can make each other strong
At last I know you're where I belong

I'd turn the world upside down
Just to find what I found
You were just what I needed
To turn the world upside down
Just to find what I found
You were just what I needed
To turn my whole world around

You showed me all the strength I have within
I've got someone to believe in once again

Just to find what I've found

I'd turn the world upside down
Just to find what I found
You were just what I needed
To turn my whole world around

I'd turn the world upside down
Just to find what I found
