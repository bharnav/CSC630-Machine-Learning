Hey!

She was searching for a master
A magician of the heart
Someone to possess her mind
And free her body from the dark

She was chasing down a fantasy
Lost between the lines
She was living on a memory
Locked so deep inside

She knew how to light his fire, all his fire
She laid a trap for his desire

She rocked them all the way to heaven, yeah
Then rolled them all the way back to hell

He was searching for a sinner
A wild child he could tame
Someone to undress her mind
And keep the secrets of his game

He knew how to light her fire, light her fire
He laid a trap for her desire

She rocked them all the way to heaven, yeah
(All the way back to hell)
Then rolled them all the way back to hell, to hell

He knew how to light her fire, light her fire
He laid a trap for her desire

She rocked them all the way to heaven, yeah
(All the way back to hell)
Then rolled them all the way back to hell, to hell

She rocked them all the way to heaven, oh, to heaven
(All the way back to hell)
Then rolled them all the way back to hell
