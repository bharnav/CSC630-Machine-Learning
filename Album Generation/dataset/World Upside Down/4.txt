The truth hit yesterday and blew us away
Now the road's beneath my wheels
Ancient bells are tolling
City lights are growing dim
When the coal of all the fire just dies
When the light of faith keeps fading away
When I feel night falling
I pray it's gonna change

All the pieces falling, are tearing us down
All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound

Gotta find a way to face it alone
Wanna ride into the sun
But the road keeps turning
Turning back on what we've done
There's a chance that we could work it all out
If we just could raise desire from doubt
When the heart is yearning
Lord, turn it all around

All the pieces falling, are tearing us down
All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound
All the pieces falling, are tearing us down
All the pieces falling

All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound
All the pieces falling, are tearing us down

All the pieces falling, are tearing us down
(All the pieces falling)
All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound
(All the pieces falling)
All the pieces falling, are tearing us down
(All the pieces falling)
All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound
(All the pieces falling)

All the pieces fall, all the pieces fall
(All the pieces falling)
All the pieces fall, all the pieces fall

All the pieces falling
(All the pieces falling)
All the voices calling, and we don't hear a sound
(All the pieces falling)
