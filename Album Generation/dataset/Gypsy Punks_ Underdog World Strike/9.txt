I came to New York to start Gypsy punk revolt
Now that it's rockin' so why don't I just go home?
Hei Chavorale,... Think Locally!
Palo mande,.... Fuck Globally!
I can't believe back home they failed to understand
That I am simply a chavo kind of man
Hay Chavorale,.... Think Locally!
Palo mande,... Fuck globally!
