Sitting in a Russian bath-house on Avenue B
No matter how much we sweat, we just can't agree
Ai, razminku yershikom provodim my
Nobody learn no nothing from no history

Tall little Sally plays with magic pebbles
Dasha sells equipment to the Chechnya rebels
Ya vyhozhu iz anala v astral
Tam mnogo chego slyshal no ne zapisal
Nesmotrya na Se.Sheh.Ah ne poterayl azarta
Buhayu strogo kazhdoe vosmoye marta
Sitting in the bath-house on Avenue B
And never agree

Sally, all empires fall, even trends they fade away
Even complete strangers can lead you astray
But goddamnit, this round is on me
Nobody learns no nothing from no history

Oh little Sally, my darling, your panic so charming
Your shopping techniques are amazing
Celebrity erudition disarming
Oh little Sally, my darling, your panic so charming
Oh little Sally, my darling ... Yura, viruchai!
(Yura viruchil!)

Sitting in a Russian bath-house on Avenue B
No matter how much we sweat, we just can't agree
Ah-uh-uh-uh
Not me, not you!
