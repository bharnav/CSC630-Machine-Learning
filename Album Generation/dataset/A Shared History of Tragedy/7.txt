Paralyzed between these metal walls
And how I wish I had something more than this
Is this success?
'Cause when I'm home, it's just another day
A piece of the furniture with nothing to say
Your jester who lives to fail

Everything that was written by me is complicated
I swear I give you my words
They get mixed up sometimes
And everything that was written by me
What's the meaning? I swear I give you my words
They get lost sometimes

Oh, it's cute to kiss and tell
But the craziest part is that you all will never know for sure
Did I mean it all?
Any part at all?
They lyrics are just a fragile wall to keep me guarded from you

Everything that was written by me is complicated
I swear I give you my words
They get mixed up sometimes
And everything that was written by me
What's the meaning?
You think you see it, the words
They get lost sometimes

Oh, how I bleed for you
I wear my heart on my sleeve
I live and bleed for only you

With everything that was written by me
You'll never see it
You'll never get it
This world gets me down sometimes...
