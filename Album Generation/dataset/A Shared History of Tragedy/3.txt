Give away all that you have inside
Every last moment that you're alive
Until your body is cold
Sure, as he peels away your skin
You see the monster is intent
To see this to the end

It would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

Life has been keeping you awake
Asphyxiated by the hate
And it never calms
Sew the aching in your veins
That no one ever sees
With the blade in the sheets

It would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

It's over...it's over
Except the scars that last forever

It would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it
