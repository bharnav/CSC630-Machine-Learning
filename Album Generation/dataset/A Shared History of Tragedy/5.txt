I stocked up on the ropes and the chains
Can we keep things together now?
My mind is a broken shell and the last pieces
Are covering the bathroom...
Which way to the door
I'm being chased by doctors

Lucid and tranquil
I've got my sanity
Everything I ever was in mapped out on the whiteboard
For everyone and anyone
Someone please show me the door

To sanctity my sanctuary
Is hidden deep inside from most
And the secrets in the locket I wear
They've been prescribed by doctors
I need more

Lucid and Tranquil
I've got my sanity
Everything I ever was is mapped out on the whiteboard
For everyone and anyone
Someone please show me the room
Where I lost my innocence
Into a vacuum of paranoid secrecy
Is everybody after me?
Someone please show me more
Show me more...
