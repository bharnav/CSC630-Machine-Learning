Your beauty forced a change in me
Vivid and pure, it will always be haunting me
Burnt out by the temptress of old
Reborn, you're constantly challenging me...

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes
The time flies by
Soon i'll be gone
Left without a trace
I need you, to put me back together again

I ache for you constantly
Through my veins I yearn for you hopelessly
And when it's my time to go
If all else fails, I desperately want you to know

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes
The time flies by
Soon i'll be gone
Left without a trace
I need you, to put me together again...

Have I ever been so scared?
To be lost without a trace
My heart broken in two
Your memory erased
I'm so scared to be alone
You made me whole

I will always miss you
You will always have a place inside my heart

You make me whole...
