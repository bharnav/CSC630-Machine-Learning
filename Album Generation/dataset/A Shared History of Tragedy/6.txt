So take a minute and ask yourself why
Every second you're after just seems to pass
Take a minute and ask why you ran away from it
And every moment, thereafter, is a relapse
From the memory before to the one that just passed
Take a minute and ask yourself why
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees
And you're begging for me
To take it easy on you, it's easier to
Leave you when you're down...

These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Yesterday seemed so long ago
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Why do you face this alone?

So now you've watched the playback in your mind
Would you agree that you let it all slip past?
I just had to ask why it got away from you
Does every regret burn from the inside?
From the memory before to the one that just passed
Watch it again and ask yourself why?
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees and alone

These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Yesterday seemed so long ago
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Why do you face this alone?

These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Yesterday seemed so long ago
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious
Why do you face this alone?
