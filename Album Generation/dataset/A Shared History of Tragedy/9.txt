Your desperation
Your inspiration

When you finally became a mute
While a sad song plays
You lie helpless and lost
Infected by the truth
That was fabricated by you
Your image shattered in the eye of the storm
We would never reach out to you
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out
You're fooling yourself
Your inspiration is your contradictions
You've lost the concept of what's the real truth

That it's you who is the thief
Who should by humbled by the
Sheer size of your crimes
We befriended you
It was abuse
There's no better time then the present time
To finally forget you
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out
You're fooling yourself
Your inspiration is your contradictions
You've lost the concept
Of what's the real truth

Close your eyes, and pretend that it's alright
Do you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
It's all crashing down

Lately you know you've seen it
The face, in the mirror never lies
You're fading
Fading...
