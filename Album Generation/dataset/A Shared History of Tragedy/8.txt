There's a machine in my head
There's a grinding in my brain
The best part is that it turns you on
The grinding penetrates
Under the sheets, my dear
We lie in love, but with fool's gold
I want to give you the plans
Just to make you stop
I want you to get out of here for good
It's in my bed, but my bed is a plot
And the shovel is anchored down to the floor

And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity
Daylight kills us
KO'd by it and counting to ten
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again

There's something in my hand
Pushing into my veins
The tablature is for a death march
I can't miss you
Because you're already gone
This is the climax to our love song
You're in my head, but gone for good
Your sonnet's melody plays on

And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity
Daylight kills us
KO'd by it and counting to ten
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again

We lie in love but with fool's gold
