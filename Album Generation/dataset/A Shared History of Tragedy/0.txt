This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear It may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

The scent of your perfume left me consumed
And every promise that you made, were they pure and true?
Cause when I looked beyond the mattress
I saw you for what you really were
And from that moment you've been a stranger and I've been a fool

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear It may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

There's a contract in a shoe box
And a ring that comes with a veil
You've shattered all my dreams, you're a liar too

With there being so many ghosts inside
My stored past that haunts me
Will I be the one destroyed after this?

Is it a sign of weakness
Can't do it anymore
I was drowning in the ocean
Now I'm floating to the shore

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear It may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures
