Senorita, tasty mamacita
Tell me baby, what's your name
Oh Conchita, won't you have a seat-a
Tell me baby, who's to blame?

I'll fuckin' kill the man who has done you wrong
My body's shakin' out of control

His name is Larry, oh he's really scary
Drinkin' at the fuckin' bar
Tap his shoulder, muscles like a boulder
Tell him that's he's gone too far

He laughs and tells me to fuckin' fuck myself
Now my blood is boilin' over my soul
Hey!

[JB & Larry]
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that
Did you just tell me to fuckin' fuck myself?

Yeah

Well I'm telling you to step outside

Oh really?

Yeah, we got some things to talk about
A little lady named Conchita

Hey!

Yeah, you harmed her

What? Who said? Who are you?

Yeah, fuck you you piece of shit

*Fight*

When my fist connects and Larry falls down to the ground
I see he's cut me with a bottle
My pistol rises, cause it's time to double down
Larry runs, I chase him out full-throttle

Donde estas mi horse? Ayee
Digame, donde estas Larry? Ayee
En los montanes? Donde, en los canyon?
Muy bien, cold-water canyon?
Andole, hey, ha, ha

Ah, te llamo mi Conchita
Yo tengo hombre para tu gota
Mira mi cada
Soy en fuego para tu bueso
Mi amor

Watchin' Larry in his sanctuary thinkin' that he got away
With Conchita, oh my mamacita, kissing him upon the face
I fuckin' rue the day that I fought for you
Now my mind is spinnin' out of control

Ah I'm sorry mamacita
Oh my little senorita
I ? senorita
