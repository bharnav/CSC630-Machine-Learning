The world is fucking turning to shit
The earth don't stand a chance
Hurricane typhoon will destroy the city

We've got to clean up the skies and recycle
We've got to stop the overpopulation

But most important of all
We've got to build a Deth Starr

Deth Starr, it's a fuckin' ship
It's a son of a bitch, y'all, and we're building it
It's gonna take us up into the sky
We don't need the earth, we're gonna fuckin' fly sky high

Deth Starr is a son of a bitch, y'all
Gonna take us into outer space
Get your shit together motherfucker
We're gonna start a new human race in the sky
In the sky!
You know we will be rockin' on the Deth Starr
Solar eclipse of the sky

Everybody goin' insane
Futuristic video games
Everybody have a good time
Synthesizing water to wine

But how? How?
I hired a nerd
I fuckin' paid a nerd
It is absurd, but I paid him to build it
Cause I don't know how to build that ship, that's right

There's a vacuum in space
It fuckin' sucks your face
Day or night, you gots to make it airtight
You gotta build that ship, make it out of sight

The fuckin' Deth Starr!
You know we will be rockin' on the Deth Starr
We will be Democratic on the Deth Starr
There will be lots of bonin' on the Starr

Havin' lots of sex with my friends
Dipping candle into rear-ends
Bonin' on a virtual plane
Fuckin' 'til I'm fuckin' insane, oh!

Oh, yeah yeah yeah, right there (Oh)
Bend over that space module (Oh yeah)
Oh, zero gravity fucking (Oh yeah)
Hey look, there's Uranus! (Oh that shit is tight)

We got to build more Starrs
We got to spread out far
Seven strong, we gots to bang a gong
But baby, hold up for now, there's something wrong

What's that?
That's a fuckin' squid
An evil alien squid
Join up ships, we got to let it rips
We got to blow that bitch to another dimension

Deth Starr!
We got to build a hundred of them
Deth Starr!
We spread across the galaxy
Deth Starr!
You know we will be rockin' on the Starr

Deth Starr!
We gotta build a million of them
Deth Starr!
We're spread across the galaxy
Deth Starr!
We must divide and conquer on the Starr

Deth Starr!

So we search the galaxy
For other forms of life
We got to drink their nutrients
To sustain high quality of life

So we scoop up the creatures
Then we put them in a geodesic dome
But the question arises, my friend
What have we become?

Deth Starr!
