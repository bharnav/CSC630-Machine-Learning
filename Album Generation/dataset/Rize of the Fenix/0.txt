[Verse 1]
When The Pick of Destiny was released
It was a bomb
And all the critics said
That the D was done
The sun had set
And the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about
Was the D would rise again

[Hook 1]
Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again! Ya

[Verse 2]
Cause the fiery heart of a champion
Cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment
No way, no
And the critics all agreed
It was a stinky pile of cheese
But that does not mean
That our hearts are not strong

[Hook 1]
Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again, yah
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again!

[Verse 3]
Sunshine
It's a hell of a day
Riding back
And it's headed your way
D's here
Now we're puttin' on a show
We're sneakin' up
Climbing into your window

[Verse 4]
Hard rockin'
Yeah we're rockin' again
Black Mamba is my personal friend
Phil Jackson is a master of zen
We'll pick you up
Take you out on the weekend

[Chorus 2]
It's the rise of the phoenix
It's a call of attack
And you'll know when you've seen us
The fuckin' D is back!

[Verse 5]
Lovemaking
All the way to the top
Boots smokin'
But I'm not gonna stop
Bossa Nova is a beautiful dance
Hot-blooded
That's a lot of romance

[Chorus 3]
It's the rise of the phoenix
And we ride with the pack
It's the magic between us
The fuckin' D is back

[Interlude]
But what if it's true?
If Tenacious D has died, what will we do?
And what will we do
Bout all the fans who have the D tattoo?
They'll have them removed
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Tattoo-oos
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Ah

[Verse 6: Jack Black (and Kyle Gass)]
Wait a minute, Kage
(What's that you say?)
You know it's not too late
(Yes it is too late)
We only need one hit
(Just imagine it)
We could be the shit!
Too legit to quit
One hit, one hit, one hit
Yeah, we're hoping this is it
One hit
Top ten hit
Top forty hit
Top thousand hit
I don't care
As long as we get there
We'll start anew
And you can get a new Tenacious D tattoo

[Outro]
You can get a new Tenacious D tattoo
