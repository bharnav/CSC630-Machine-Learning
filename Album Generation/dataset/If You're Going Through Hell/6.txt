[Verse 1]
I had every intention of getting hammered here tonight
I gave my truck keys to the bar keep
Said "dave, don't you dare let me drive"
In the middle of this bottle
I drank my train of thought off track
So I've gotta stop drinking or start rethinking my reason for throwing them back

[Chorus]
Cause it's just wasted whiskey trying to drink you off my mind
There ain't enough bourbon behind this bar
And I ain't got that kinda time
So I'm gonna stand while I can and raise my glass
Toast every time you kiss me
Cause drinking to forget about you
Is wasted whiskey

[Verse 2]
So here's to new beginnings and to the memories
And cheers to your mamma and daddy cause they were right about you and me
And here's to milsap on the jukebox and to your new friends you've found
And here's to our joint account, master card cause I'm buying the whole house a round

[Chorus][x2]
