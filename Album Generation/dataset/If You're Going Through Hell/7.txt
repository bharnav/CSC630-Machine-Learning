[Verse 1]
My friends say they're proud of me
For taking our breakup so casually
But they don't see what lies beneath my smile
It appears that I'm okay
And I moved on when you walked away
But the truth is since you said goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm invisibly shaken and quietly breakin'
Desperately takin' one breath at a time
Beneath this composure I know it's over
Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken

[Verse 2]
If it looks like I don't care
It's not killing me seeing you here
And hearing you say you want to try us again
Believe me it ain't easy being this cool
But too many times girl I've been your fool
And I know I'd just end up here again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken
