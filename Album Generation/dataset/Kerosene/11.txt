[Chorus: Miranda Lambert]
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight

[Verse 1: Miranda Lambert]
I can't handle all this pain
All we ever do is fight anyway
Why we even tried I haven't a clue
With hearts involved there's way too much to loose

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert]
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight

[Verse 2: Miranda Lambert]
You were something else to look at
Your intentions they weren't' all bad
You tried to make me something I wasn't
Lord knows there ain't no future in all that

[Chorus: Miranda Lambert]
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
