[Verse 1]
I'm waiting on the sun to set cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walking, spinning tires ain't made for stopping
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me

[Verse 2]
I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it's too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheating really ain't a crime
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me

[Verse 3]
Forget your high society, I'm soaking it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn; ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shaking, ain't a rule that ain't worth breaking
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me

[Verse 4]
Now I don't hate the one who left
You can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holding on to someone, I'm holding up my smoking gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
Well I'm giving up on love hey love's given up on me
