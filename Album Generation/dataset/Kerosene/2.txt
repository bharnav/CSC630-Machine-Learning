[Verse 1]
Rain on the window makes me lonely
And time keeps on passin' so slowly
The old man sittin' next to me is fallin' asleep
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere
The sun's going down on my misery
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That cell phone I hear ringing, I keep wishing it was you
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere

[Chorus]
And that ring that you were wearin' don't mean everything
And the way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away
Well she loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

[Verse 2]
Bright lights of a city shinin' up ahead
My heart's analyzin' every word you said
Did you take me for a fool or did you really care
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

[Chorus]
And that ring that you were wearin' don't mean everything
And the way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away
Well she loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

[Bridge]
And I'm gonna find someplace I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride

[Verse 3]
Rain on the window and I'm still lonely
And time keeps on passin' so slowly
You're with her and I'm alone and you're wishin' I was there
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
We're all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
