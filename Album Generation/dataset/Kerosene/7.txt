[Verse 1]
You know it's so complicated, first you love then you hate it
Someone's laughing, someone's crying, someone living, someone's dying
Somebody always loses and we still play the game
And the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I ain't gonna fight
If you're the death of me darling, I wanna die

[Verse 2]
You always say that you love me and there is no one above me
Never giving, always taking, never bending, always breaking
I know you ain't a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walking on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darling I wanna die

[Pre-Chorus]
Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools

[Chorus]
Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing, you're crying, you're living, I'm dying
Somebody always loses and we still play the game
Yeah the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I ain't gonna fight
If you're the death of me darling, I wanna die

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing you're crying, I'm living, you're dying
I know you ain't a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walking on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darling' I wanna die
Oh I wanna die
Tear it up Tear it up
Um um um
