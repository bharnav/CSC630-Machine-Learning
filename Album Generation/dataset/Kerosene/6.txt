[Verse 1]
Me and Charlie boy used to go walking, sitting in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss and holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married but we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run dry like so many do these days

[Chorus]
So you treat your love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top and run like hell to show it off
Oh, promises were made when we'd go walking, that's just me and Charlie talking

[Verse 2]
Charlie always said he'd like to leave here, so he turned eighteen and he left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting for Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
Funny how time and distance change you the road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions and then you look up and it's gone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie and how we thought we knew it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
