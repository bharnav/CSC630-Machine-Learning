[Intro]
Censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, no friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Time won't keep us anymore
It's the usefulness of letting go
Your perfect plan has come and gone
Like the nuclear centuries' benefits

[Chorus]
They say
You bought the same old trip
So innocent you're out of reach
You bought the same old trip

[Verse 2]
Lawful, vengeful, awful, friendship, misfits
Bits of feelings, thieving, fits inside revealing
Time to censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, no friend of mine

[Chorus]
You bought the same old trip
So innocent you're out of reach
You bought the same old trip (we don't mind the scope)
Sigh of relief inside of a dream
You bought the same old (we all lie)

[Bridge]
Censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, paid to
Censor, censor, realize
Censor, censor, no friend of mine

[Chorus]
You bought the same old trip
So innocent you're out of reach
You bought the same old trip (we don't mind the scope)
Sigh of relief inside of a dream
You bought the same old trip (we all lie beyond)
You bought the same old trip
You bought the same old (we don't mind)
