Running out again, should've solved this right
Suddenly confused, I shifted sides
But listen little prima donna
Wrap your head 'round this simple thought

I won't be left out
You learn a thing or two
When we were young we'd shout
Let's separate the city
We won't be left out
You landed on the answer
I won't be left out

When the world owns so much of you
From your daring to fit in
At first they pass you 'round
You're only left holding the sin
But the difference quite simply
That untied these arms
Was the helpless artist
Cast the final stone

I won't be left out
You learn a thing or two
When we were young we'd shout
Let's separate the city
We won't be left out
You landed on the answer
I won't be left out

Soon
Soon these souls will be born
Safe from any
Soon
Soon these souls will be born

But I won't be left out
You learn a thing or two
When we were young we'd shout
Let's separate the city
We won't be left out
You landed on the answer
I won't be left out
