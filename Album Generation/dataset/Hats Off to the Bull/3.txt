[Verse 1]
You had that nighttime confidence, yet again
Like when you tear us all to bits, yet again
If you really want advice here
You're too much like a wall
If you're gonna light those fires
We're all up in arms again

[Chorus]
Well, I don't belong here, don't fit your style
Felt your left foot, now meet my right

[Verse 2]
See now over this, you meddler
Feed off all the rest, you meddler
Talking so close, you bring to mind
It's no fun to be behaving
But you really lit a fire, all up in arms again
Why don't you feed off all the rest?

[Chorus]
Well, I don't belong here, don't fit your style
Felt your left foot, now meet my right
It's now or never, more difficult
Those midnight answers, and stray arrows

[Bridge]
Never, never, lean on you
Clever, clever, one on two
You're mine, finite, imagine this
It's sad, to say, it's simple when still
We want to watch

[Chorus]
Well, I don't belong here, don't fit your style
Felt your left foot, now meet my right
It's now or never, more difficult
Those midnight answers, and stray arrows

I don't belong
