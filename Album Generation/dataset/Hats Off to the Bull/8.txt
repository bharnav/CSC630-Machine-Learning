Crowds and torches fill the air
Surprise you're chosen, now finish it
Yell it louder really sink that point in

That sat for so long
For so long
Behind these civilized eyes
Behind these civilized eyes

Me, I'd let the panic ride and pin it on the wall
Identifying pride is the saddest of the chores
Those burning eyes indeed define a churning of the soul
Feels better to be lost, but haven't felt the choice

For so long
Behind these civilized eyes

Revenge

That's cold
That's cold
May your sources lead
Connecting to ten-fold
Identify your own
Fate has tortured us for too long

For so long my demons (For so long)
It's countdown for me
With blindfolds you held us
Till I found the best revenge

For so long my demons (Revenge)
It's countdown for me
With blindfolds you held us
Till I found the best revenge
