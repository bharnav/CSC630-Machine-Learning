[Verse 1]
All our needs put together
Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can't I look up (out in the clearing)
Tell me what's there below (end over end)
While he's safe for the moment (guess what I'm learning)
He's never safe from the crowd

[Chorus]
So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

[Verse 2]
To be monumental
Could mean the beyond
The simpler the treasure
Means the higher the cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Well as for the ending (damn right I'm learning)
You might ask for the door (end over end)
Well I hate how the clouds hide
The gasps from above

[Chorus]
So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

[Bridge]
Find your challenge, suffer miles
Colors grey, he brings them out
Don't mind the challenge, suffer miles
A little shallow, if I don't say

Hats off to the bull, his time ain't up
Bitter hell in the lion's den, for some of us
Hats off to the bull, the sun won't set
'Til the pain and the final breath

[Chorus]
So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

[Outro]
Hats off to the bull, no giving up
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
Hats off to the bull, no giving up
Hats off to the bull
