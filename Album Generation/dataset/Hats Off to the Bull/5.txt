[Verse 1]
How will this pan out?
Search and wish so loud
Keep a candle burning
To each his own should live

[Chorus]
Before I turn in envy
I learn through sorrow
I turn in envy
And go to the wall

[Verse 2]
See how the colors run
And feel your Sunday rest
Give me a name, bring it in
Some change is for the best

[Pre-Chorus]
I may not win the race, I may not reach the top
Or I may not live your way, doesn't mean I'm stuck here
We may not fit the mold, kind of going off
Well, the medicine inside, takes a stronger hold, as we

[Chorus]
Turn in envy
I learn through sorrow
I turn in envy
And go to the wall

Before I burn with envy
I learn through sorrow I
Burn with envy
And go to the wall

[Bridge]
To the wall, to the wall
To the wall, to the wall
To the wall, to the wall

[Chorus]
Before I turn envy (to the wall)
I learn through sorrow (to the wall)
I burn with envy (to the wall)
And go (to the wall)
To the wall
