[Verse 1]
Well hell if I should decide
To give it more a little effort
Well hell if I'm tempted again
One little fight replaced by lust for you

[Chorus]
I'll ask my curious side to follow you
To a bed of angels
Can't help this wandering eye, well lucky you
The devil made ya look

[Verse 1]
Well I've never tried, pulling you in
Lucky at last, defending answers
It's almost like, you're breaking my pi√±ata
While I'm hinting at my lust for you

[Chorus]
I'll ask my curious side to follow you
To a bed of angels
Can't help this wandering eye, well lucky you
The devil made ya look too far to the abyss
No bed of angels, mystified defines it best
The devil made ya look

[Chorus]
So I'll ask my curious side to follow you
To a bed of angels
Can't help this wandering eye, well lucky you
The devil made ya look too far to the abyss
No bed of angels, mystified defines it best
The devil made ya look
