[Verse 1]
Sell me some love
Led by a ruse, set
Up like a lens
That looks into rooms, sees colors

Cast in a world
This roundabout path
Makes two rights and two wrongs
'Til it hurts finds me

[Chorus]
Let's discover your emotions
We'll visualize that fevered side we lost

[Verse 2]
It's way too hard to pin us
Hard to pin us down
If you haven't felt that fire in awhile
And its now-or-never lies

Just live for a little more, try climbing over any
Unfortunate you say, never in this setting
Young freedom had its price and
We all bend these rules so nervously

[Chorus]
Let's discover your emotions
We'll visualize that fevered side we lost
Are we blinding those emotions
Will you decide defeat or find it all

[Chorus]
Let's discover your emotions
We'll visualize that fevered side we lost
Are we blinding those emotions
Will you decide defeat or find it all

Set it free
