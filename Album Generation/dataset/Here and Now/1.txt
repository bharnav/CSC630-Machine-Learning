[Verse 1]
Hey
Who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit till it's dry
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up

[Chorus]
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinking every drop until it all runs out
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up
Ooh, bottoms up

[Verse 2]
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up

[Chorus]
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinking every drop until it all runs out
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up
Ooh, bottoms up

[Bridge]
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinking every drop until it all runs out

[Chorus]
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinking every drop until it all runs out
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up

[Outro]
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up
Hey, bottoms up
