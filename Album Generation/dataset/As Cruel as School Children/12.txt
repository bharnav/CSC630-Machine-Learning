[Verse 1]
I wish I could unzip my skin and take it off
Just to take a walk but I can’t do it
I don’t think I’ll make it on my own (on my own)
As when I take out my pen
And I wage it all, turn the page and fall
It just comes natural
I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Hook]
I just need time to walk it off
But I can’t do it
I’ll write it on my own time
Hey look I made it on my own (on my own)
I know she thinks that I don’t try, but I realize that I can do better
Write, write on [4x]
Makin’ a mess as I progress
No time to cry about it, do better
Write, write on [2x]

[Verse 2]
I wrote the greatest lines at the strangest times
Now it's payin’ off, but I still feel lost
Cuz I can’t do it
I don’t think I’ll make it on my own (on my own)
So in between now it pacifies
I change my name to free, but she feels safe to me
So I’m livin’ dangerously
I’m gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Hook]

[Outro]

Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)
Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)...
