(I think we're ready for eh, the second installment of the Sloppy Love Jingle, roll it, action)

Okay, continued
What's next upon the menu?
Hmm, maybe I should crack a joke
Attack and ask her if she smokes
'Cause I can't seem to find my matches
And that could break the ice but
I'm a bad actress with three lighters
I acquired the previous night
And there I was, do or die
She was approximately five feet away from my frame
So I decided to take a stride, swallow my pride
Tellin' her my name like
Hello miss, my name is Travis
Just a ordinary cat, I'm into art and fuzzy rabbits
Kinda smart with a big heart, you can have it
See you find that funny
I'd love to buy you a drink but I got bent and spent my money
But would you kindly accept a rain check
Perhaps some deep chit chat
She didn't think twice, nodded her head and said
"I'm with that"
By the way do you have some matches?
She's like, "No but there's a lighter right in front of you"
And now we both giggling
This girl's so crazy, got my gullet jiggling
Fiddling with my feelings like an out of tune piano
Like I'm on Ritalin
The way she's got my undivided attention dismissin' any thoughts of lettin' this one get away
