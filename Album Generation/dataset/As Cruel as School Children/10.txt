And so it goes

We mouth your words when your tongues are too paralyzed
We finish up the peanut butter jelly that you get on your router but never eat

We still pee in bottles
We play at your graduation parties
We have fallen comrades
We just rebuild the team

Our friends are rich and we love it
Cause it makes us look wealthy too
Shit, I still got a Sidekick 1 with a crack in the fucking screen man

We were your favorite "I'm the first person to know about these guys" band
We dance to "Use Me" by Bill Winters in a drunken stupor or two
Until Ma and Gary to tell us to go the fuck home and kick us out

We make mistakes, we love, we hate
We're not angry anymore though
Still miss you, still love you
Like a slug hates salt and we're still your heroes
