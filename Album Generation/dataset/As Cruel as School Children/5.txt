(Fame, fortune, platinum records
It's every boys dream...)

[Intro]
True story
Somebody asked me one time
"Travie, you high?
You look high"
"Shit, yeah I'm high"
Let's go

[Verse 1]
The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

[Pre-Hook]
We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Verse 2]
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in
Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

[Pre-Hook]
We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Bridge]
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Outro]
Breathe in...
Breathe in...
Breathe in...
Breathe in...
