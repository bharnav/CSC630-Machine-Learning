Sloppy Love Sequence 3
Cameras rollin'
Action!

The bomb's been detinated
I'm just waiting for an explosion
I was at second base and it was time for me to close in on third
With blurred vision and
Precisely placed slurred words we started kissin'
Man listen it was like a scene bad V movie with a very low budget
But fuck it I was drunk and I admit I loved it
Every last second
I couldn't kill that thought of us butt ass naked
Tely surfin with the fan on
Chattin about the session and
Slowly gettin in to closet skeleton confessions
That's when she made an offer I couldn't refuse
And chills when up and down my leg like Samoan tattoos
She said she had a pad that wasn't too far away
And she loved it if I stayed until the following day
So it was time to exit stage left
I made my rounds, gave my pounds and hugs
Gathered my thoughts and took a deep breath
And now we walkin to the door but
Right before we stepped outside she bought me one more
Now I'm feelin' it
I had my hand in my pocket but she stealin' it
With our fingers interlock
And as we walk down Exchange Street
With our hearts pitter-pat to the same beat
And then she popped the question
Like "Trav, you ever been in love"
And I'm like "Tcha, not that I recall"
But there was one situation, but I didn't have the patience
Or the balls to say it
And everytime I try I just digitally relay it
And it sound something like a "Duh duh duh duh duh"
Man my speech impediment left my heart vacant without a single resident
The first ten had got evicted the second she settled in
I seen her the other day ridin' my bike and kept peddlin'
If it wasn't for meddling kids would love even exist? (Nope)
If it wasn't for alcohol would I be saying this? (Nope)
She probably took offense, I probably started getting sober
'Cuz she started getting ugly and I think I probably told her
Then my feet got heavy, I started drippin sweat
I knew I was getting into something I would later regret
Right when I lit the cigarette I caught an occasion of the spins
I started wishin I was back at the bar with my friends
And then it happened
I fell flat on my face
When I awoke I found that I was in a very strange place
Must have goten my wish granted, 'cuz I was butt ass naked
But the only downside was that the room was pretty vacant
Except next to the bed there was this note on the dresser
While I'm trying to deal with this hangover head pressure
With a smile I grabbed the note with a smoke and sat back
"Dear whoever, lose my number
P.S. The sex was whack"
