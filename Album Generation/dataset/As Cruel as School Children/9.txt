[Verse 1]
This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This is the result of some Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
Cause hot products cool down
At which point will flot the new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when nature turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
You got em all convinced
But we ain't buying it buddy
Demand for lies is high
And you're supplying it
Truth is brutal and consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me what you ought to be
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

[Verse 2]
And this is not a fashion statement
It's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night
When what you don't bite you write half-heartedly
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give new meaning to blowing up overseas
Please
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it
And sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
Pop bottles and dropped names
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me what you ought to be
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

[Verse 3]
Wow congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement
You're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose
You're purely decorative
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
Oh they don't see
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me what you ought to be
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
