I think about you and it blows my mind
Make up forever 'cause it feel so fine
I got so furry, I think then you need
I whisper softly, don't make you believe

I really love you it's the only way
'Cause when were making and we started to claim
I gotta show you, so you understand
Just that me love you honey if I can

I think about you and it blows my mind
Make up forever 'cause it feel so fine
I got so furry, I think then you need
I whisper softly, don't make you believe
