I kept from the sages the melody fine

I'm waiting his own burn, our good times are here
Sleeping on late, you stay upon night
And go into church districted, and turning out right
It's spending an army, I wish you was here

Some will be OK, it's gonna be fine, it's gonna be OK, yeah
It's gonna be fine, fine, fine, it's gonna be OK, it's gonna be fine
