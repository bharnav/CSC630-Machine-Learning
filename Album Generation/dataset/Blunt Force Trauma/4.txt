Thrasher - Master of disaster
Thrasher - faster and faster
Thrasher - in this disaster
Thrasher - forward thrasher
Our legions growing through the world
What we started - you cannot control
We're taking over one and all
United we can never fall
Now it's on - you can't control
Now it's on - against the world
Now it's on - we are the ones
Now it's on - the chosen ones
Thrasher - I'm the aggressor
Thrasher - never say never
Thrasher - the killing weather
Thrasher - against the oppressor
We come to take over your soul
Against the world is blood for blood
No one can tell us where to go
We're everywhere and now it's on
Now it's on - you can't control
Now it's on - against the world
Now it's on - we are the ones
Now it's on - the chosen ones
The chosen ones..
Now it's on - you can't control
Now it's on - against the world
Now it's on - we are the ones
Now it's on - the chosen ones
