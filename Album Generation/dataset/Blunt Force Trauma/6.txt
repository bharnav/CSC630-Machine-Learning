Face...
With all your hate
With all your strength
Look at them down
Stare...
Into their eyes
Inside their mind
A target you'll find
I'll bring you down - you are target
I'll find you - you are my target
Now you are mine - you are my target
I'll take you down - you are my target
Strength...
Looking for you
Who against who
I'll find you too
Crush...
All the opponents
All those against us
Against the wall
I'll bring you down - you are target
I'll find you - you are my target
Now you're mine - you're my target
I'll take you down - you're my target
Who against, who against
I'm coming now for you
Who against, who against
Exterminating you
Exterminating you
Exterminating you
Exterminating you... I'll bring you down
I'll bring you down
Exterminating you.. I'll bring you down
I'll bring you down
Exterminating you...
