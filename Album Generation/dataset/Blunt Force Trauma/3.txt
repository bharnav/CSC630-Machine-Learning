Killing inside
I am corrosion
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am destruction
Killing inside
Killing inside
I'm burning fear
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am the killer, everyone dies

Look in my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Inflict them into a wall
Look in my eyes
The wars are rising now
Everyone dies
Take you from inside out

Killing inside
I am a criminal
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am fatal
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am immortal
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am forever, look in my eyes

Look in my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Inflict them into a wall
Look in my eyes
The wars are rising now
Everyone dies
Take you from inside out

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near

Everyone dies

Look in my eyes!
They come to murder
Murder now!
Everyone dies
Inflict them into a wall
Look in my eyes
The wars are rising now
Everyone dies
Take you from inside out
