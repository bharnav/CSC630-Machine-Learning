Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
[x2]

He won't go in his name
His mind is insane
Betraying his country
Abandoning his friends
Plain and the simple
Seeking the truth
Going to be hurt
To fight against who?

Fallen solider
Bloodshed
Betrayer
How dare you spit

Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
[x2]

The war caught you
Betraying your nation
What kind of kingdom
Comes from this sub-nation
Using terror to max our their fears
Propaganda is the killer

Fallen solider
Bloodshed
Betrayer
How dare you spit

Dust to dust
This soul is lost
His mind is gone
This fate is dust
Face to face
Your daily
Your world is dead
Your empty face

Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
Jihad Joe, Jihad!
[x4]
