War!

Psychosomatic
Defiance across
Psychosomatic
Lunacy unborn
Psychosomatic
Psychopathic thread
Psychosomatic
Left for dead
Psychosomatic
Mentally insane
Psychosomatic
Temporarily deranged
Psychosomatic
Live in the now
Psychosomatic
To kill 'em all

Behold the prophets would come
Beyond and from beyond...
Behold, no sanctuary, no...
We are!
Behold!
No sanctuary now
I am psychosomatic now

Psychosomatic
Cause and effect
Psychosomatic
Caustic, combust
Psychosomatic
Subsist and afflict
Psychosomatic
Insane, inflict
Psychosomatic
Tension unfolds
Psychosomatic
Ravage and repent
Psychosomatic
Cryptic, confront
Psychosomatic
Protest, infect

Behold the prophets would come
Beyond and from beyond...

Behold!
No sanctuary now
I am psychosomatic now

Psychosomatic!
No sanctuary!
Psychosomatic!
No sanctuary!
