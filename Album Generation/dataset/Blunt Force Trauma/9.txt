Rise... From Siberia he rises
Monk... Whose visions of the future will be told
Soon... His fame reaches out to the throne
Aid... To the Czar's son will come down
Revolution - it soon comes
Revolution - red comes down
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Revolution - The Czar is gone
Revolution - Monarchy's done
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Curse... He told the Czar about the curse
Plague... It will plague them if undone..
Revolution...
