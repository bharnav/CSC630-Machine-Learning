[Verse 1]
I've been drinking black myrrh again
The closer we part
I needed to touch your lips
With the nail in my heart
The night that you caught me
My coffin did walk
I fell at your mercy
I fell in your grave
Meccamputechture
That stands in my way
The younger I stay
An elderly child
The longer the mirror gives birth
To the death I file

[Chorus]
If you consume me I will not let you go
If you walk right through me
My voice will taint your throat
Blessed be, blessed be the wrong I've done

[Verse 2]
Someone is watching us
Someone has found
Fluorescent ligaments
On a black and white tile
Why do you call them
If your kingdom won't come
The younger I stay
Forever I rot

[Chorus]
If you consume me I will not let you go
If you walk right through me
My voice will taint your throat
Blessed be, blessed be the wrong I've done

[Outro]
Because the flies my mouth spill
Bare the children at play
