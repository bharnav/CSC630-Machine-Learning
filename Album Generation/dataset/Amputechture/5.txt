[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Por quando te vi enfermo con mentiras
Este ladron cuenta se dio
Trapa mal hecho de trampas te lo juro
Que yo s√≠ te mato
Y con cada dia que se pase recuerdate
Quien era el mas poderoso

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of magnets
They fold the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

[Chorus]
In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

[Verse 2]
Hay mi hija no me llores
Porque yo te quito de esta cruz
A noche te vi caminando sin la alma de tu cuerpo
En los brazos sin luz

[Verse 3]
Stains fall into the brick wall severed
Four of them were watching
While the other three did hide
The culprit spat the seed from a podium of glass
Shattering the sigil that you thought was deitized

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of maggots
They rot the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

[Chorus]
In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

[Instrumental Section]

[Chorus]
In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

[Verse 4]
Wait
I've seen the arc shake from your mnemonic tongue
But the braille that you weave of itself, it shall read aloud
Yes it will
I said, she's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
She's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial ground
She's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
I said, she's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial ground
