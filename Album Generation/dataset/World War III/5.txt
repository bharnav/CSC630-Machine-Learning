Long drive, bitter day
Grey skies cover Michigan
In no time, I'll her away
And after that, I'll never see her again
You know that we had everything
So why are you happening to me?
Oh star crossed lovers torn apart
We crossed five oceans but I'm back where I started

Now, that it's over, I'm moving on
I'm not getting under your landslide
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on
Now that it's over, I'm moving on
I gotta life of mine to live
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on

Driving home this time alone
No idea where my life will go
And now her head's on another chest
As she forgets everything we had
You know that we had everything
Oh, star-crossed lovers torn apart
We crossed five oceans but I'm back where I started

Now, that it's over, I'm moving on
I'm not getting under your landslide
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on
Now that it's over, I'm moving on
I gotta life of mine to live
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on

How'd you go turn it off
When the night before is the best that it ever got
Where'd you go zombie girl?
Who put all the poison in to your world?
It's not the sex and it's not the laughs
How it felt just to hold your hand
It's not the lonely, not the sadness
It's star crossed lovers broken hearted

Now, that it's over, I'm moving on
I'm not getting under your landslide
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on
Now that it's over, I'm moving on
I gotta life of mine to live
Now that it's over, I'll walk away
I'm moving on
