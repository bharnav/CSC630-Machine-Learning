On a dark and winding road
I'm going nowhere fast
I thank god, I'm all alone
'Cause I don't trust myself
I'm just a passenger to an animal instinct
Standing up to a world, that loves to hate me

Some say I'm weak, some say I'm cursed, that I'm worthless
Because I'm not like them and more like me instead
Some say I'm stupid, I think I'm a genius
Because I found myself and finally

I couldn't love live more
(I've become the animal)
I couldn't love less more
(Taking everything I want)
I couldn't love live more
(I've become the animal)
And I've become untouchable

On a straight and glowing road
The clouds evaporate
'Cause I met my all-time low
And I spit into its face
I realized the hands, wrapped around my neck
Was my imagination, at war with my head

Some say I'm weak, some say I'm cursed, that I'm worthless
Because I'm not like them and more like me instead
Some say I'm stupid, I think I'm a genius
Because I found myself and finally

I couldn't love live more
(I've become the animal)
I couldn't love less more
(Taking everything I want)
I couldn't love live more
(I've become the animal)
And I've become untouchable

And I've become untouchable
And I've become untouchable

Some say I'm stupid I think I'm a genius
Because I found myself and finally
