Hey there good neighbor
What more could you ask for?
A beautiful wife and two kids
But it's never enough neighbor is it?
Because you hate yourself
And that drives you mad
She starts to wonder 'cause she knows
You're not a real man

To fight your weakness
You beat her to death

The bitterness is rising up
But I've found something to live for
If our greatest gift is free will
Come and watch these killers get killed
Come and watch these killers get killed
Come and watch these killers get killed

Hey there good neighbor
You fucked everyone out there
You poor thing, you end up beat
Now that's what I call a family
To fight your weakness
You beg for help from an innocent victim
Use him leave him out on the street
Well, you'll never fuck up again

The bitterness is rising up
But I've found something to live for
If our greatest gift is free will
Come and watch these killers get killed
Come and watch these killers get killed
Come and watch these killers get killed

Hey kids your dad is gone
Please know it's not your fault
You'll be okay, I promise
But dad was sick so I killed him
