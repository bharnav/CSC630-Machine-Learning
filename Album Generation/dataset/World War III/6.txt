Phone cutting in and out, this goddamn reception again
I missed two calls and when we talk
You asked me why you're in an ambulance
I dropped my phone as I went numb
Until I saw your face
You smiled at me and said
"I've never felt this kind of pain"

I promise, we've got this don't let 'em win
'Cause forever, forever is not supposed to end

Late on the street you heard the screams and you saw her getting beat
No shock to me you jumped between now we're racing to surgery
They wouldn't let me come with
The last thing I heard 'em say
"I think we're losing him"

I promise, we've got this don't let 'em win
'Cause forever, forever is not supposed to end
Like you said to me once
"There's no me without us"

Where did you go when you didn't remember me
It was hard but I knew you'd never leave
I tried to be as strong as you've always been
But for the very first time
I was prepared to take my own life

I promise, we've got this don't let 'em win
'Cause forever, forever is not supposed to end
Like you said to me once
"There's no me without us"
