My life had always been a game
I never learned how to play
Hid from me every day
Because I've see some horrible things
And thanks to memory I doubt they ever leave
And all my friends are like chameleons
They're into shape shifting and I don't trust anything
I blame the jealousy, the insecurity
But that is such a waste as up today all that shit changes

I don't care any more
If it's okay with you
I'll be the judge of me and you can just peace
And I don't care any more
I watched some porno girl
I'll take a pill or two if I wanna chill

I'm gonna pour another vodka drink
And I don't care what you think
Everyone's on something
And can you find Mister Popular
But crack him open girl and you'll find something wrong

If I could cure insecurity
How fucking rich would be?
I'd sell it all to you and then you'd leave

But I don't care any more
If it's okay with you
I'll be the judge of me and you can just peace
And I don't care any more
I watched some porno girl
I'll take a pill or two if I wanna chill

Sometimes I feel as if
My walls are closing in
Maybe I'm just paranoid
Or am I focused in

I don't care any more
If it's okay with you
I'll be the judge of me and you can just peace
I don't care any more

Until you're oblivious
Congratulations they lost me
