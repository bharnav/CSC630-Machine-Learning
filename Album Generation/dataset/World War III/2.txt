Kick open the bedroom door
The walking has turned to a crawl
And I just lied, to everyone
I stumble into the bed
And that's where I start to beg for a peace of mind
Where I deny
Just like the night before
Just like the night before that one
And I don't know
If I'll see tomorrow's sun

I feel the angels coming for me
But I'm not ready to leave
I got a promise to keep
Woah
I feel forever slipping away
You know I'll fight this disease
I'll fight it everyday for you

Don't wanna be sick no more
But I'm just to insecure to ask for help from any friends
I can't turn to family
Cause their so proud of me
And there is no worse feeling
But I can do this by myself

I feel the angels coming for me
But I'm not ready to leave
I got a promise to keep
Woah
I feel forever slipping away
You know I'll fight this disease
I'll fight it everyday for you

I always thought I could do anything
That I don't need anyone
But I'm all alone
And I need help
My life is slipping in
I just don't wanna die

I feel the angels coming for me
But I'm not ready to leave
I got a promise to keep
Woah
I feel forever slipping away
You know I'll fight this disease
I'll fight it everyday for you

I'll fight it everyday for you
I'll fight it everyday for you
