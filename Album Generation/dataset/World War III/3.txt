You're such a beautiful gift from above
When I fell so hard in love
I knew I was dead
Because your taste of fame filled you up
Then I became just optional
'Cause I'm the idiot

Hey superstar, so popular
(When will you ever know?)
Nobody cares who you are
Hey superstar, don't try so hard
(Maybe someday)
You'll see who you really are

I'm such a hideous, ridiculous
But honest and loyal misfit
And I'm okay with it
But you got swept up inside
A new media whore
Well then, I'm so over it

Hey superstar, so popular
(When will you ever know?)
Nobody cares who you are
Hey superstar, don't try so hard
(Maybe someday)
You'll see who you really are

I'll never be rich
And I'll never look perfect
I don't care
It's who I am

You'll never be happy
Chasing all the wrong things
And you'll never understand
(What it means to be)

Hey superstar, so popular
(When will you ever know?)
Nobody cares who you are
Hey superstar, don't try so hard
(Maybe someday)
You'll see who you really are

Maybe someday
