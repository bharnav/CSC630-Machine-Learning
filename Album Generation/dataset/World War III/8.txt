You sacrificed it all
For a little taste of fame
The spotlight fills you up
Like a black tar heroine

Under the burning lights
Crystal lenses to fades away
Back in your real life again
When it's cold, you're alone

When they take it all, take it all away
(they better take me too)
Because I can't fall, I won't fall again
(I'd fight forever just to be remembered by you)
And I fight forever to be remembered by you

Once you've had it all, you can forget who you are
When your reality surpasses all your wildest dreams
You've got nothing else but to be just yourself
And you got nothing left what to be, just yourself on your own

When they take it all, take it all away
Because I won't fall, I won't fall again
And I fight forever to be remembered by you

Like a black tar heroine
The pain
When you forget what goes down will always raise again
When you find your heroine
She will take you in
And then you know it's never over if you never surrender

When they take it all, take it all away
Because I won't fall, I won't fall again
And I fight forever to be remembered by you
By you
