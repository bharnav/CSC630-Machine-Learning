Shut your fucking mouth, it's 5 a.m
I already know about you and him
I guess I should have known
The day we met you had your red flags on
So much for trust

Honestly, honesty's for liars
(Words don't feel)
Truthfully, truth needs no explaining
(It's just real)

I'm alone and insecure it's 6 a.m
And I'm running back to her once again
The real sickness is, I need the pain
And in fact I'm craving it

So I can escape decades of the real pain
Stuck inside me

Honestly, honesty's for liars
(Words don't feel)
Truthfully, truth needs no explaining
(It's just real)
Trust me, the trust never last forever
(Just like us)
Believe me, belief is never worth believing
(It never was)

I started when I first betrayed myself
I have to find a different kind of hurt
(Wanted this, I needed this)
'Cause pain's become my brand new normal

Honestly, honestly
Truthfully, truth left me
Trust me that trust never lasts forever
Honestly, honesty's for liars
(Words don't feel)
Truthfully, truth needs no explaining
(It's just real)
