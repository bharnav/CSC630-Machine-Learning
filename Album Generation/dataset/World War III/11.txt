I wish I had something to say
I wish I had someone to say something
To who understands what I've been through
I wish I wasn't paranoid
I wish that I could trust everyone I want to
But I guess I love a bunch of fools
I wish I had somewhere to go
I wish there was a place without spies in disguises
And invisible reminders of you

It feels like all the galaxies colliding into us
I wish that I had a friend in me
For once, I miss you bad
I need you back
I can't live and I can't breathe when all I've got is me for once
