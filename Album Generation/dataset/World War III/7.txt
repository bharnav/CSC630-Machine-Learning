I've never seen a ghost
But I've seen miracles
I guess it's all possible
Some things you wanna know
Some things you're meant to know
Some things you'll just never know

What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder?
Where truth and fiction collide
What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder
I need peace and quiet in my head

I'd never been luckier
Then I got massacred
The truth just set me on fire
Now I don't believe anyone or anything
Nothing makes sense any more

What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder?
Where truth and fiction collide
What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder
I need peace and quiet in my head

Had enough I give up shut 'em up
Let me go begging you let me go
So I guess I'm sick in my head

Had enough I give up shut 'em up
Let me go begging you let me go
So I guess I'm sick in my head

What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder
So I guess I'm sick in my head

What it is, what it is to wonder
What it is, what it is to wonder?
Where truth and fiction collide

Had enough I give up shut 'em up
Let me go begging you let me go
So I guess I'm sick in my head

Had enough I give up shut 'em up
Let me go begging you let me go
So I guess I'm sick in my head
