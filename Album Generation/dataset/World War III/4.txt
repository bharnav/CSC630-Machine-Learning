Just take your clothes off
Lay back, clear up your mind
And I'll turn down the lights
Just take the pain and the pressure
And leave it behind
It's all for you tonight
(I touch ya)

We're like an island
(I kiss you)
We're all alone here
I'm going down babe
(I kiss ya)
Go ahead get loud

Gonna give you fireworks tonight my girl, tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna set your sky on fire while I'm inside tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud

I'm not the first
But I promise
I'll be the last to get you off like this
(I touch ya)

We're like an island
We're all alone here
I'm going down babe
Go ahead get loud
Don't be afraid and you'll feel everything
The waterfalls elate the shakes

Gonna give you fireworks tonight my girl, tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna set your sky on fire while I'm inside tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna give you fireworks tonight my girl, tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna set your sky on fire when I'm inside tonight

In this moment, the past just melts away
In this moment, high on life we stay
Feel the lips, our hips we're sweating an ocean
The sex connects forever to us

Gonna give your fireworks tonight my girl, tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna set your sky on fire while I'm inside tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna give you fireworks tonight my girl, tonight
I'm going down babe, go ahead get loud
Gonna set your sky on fire when I'm inside tonight
