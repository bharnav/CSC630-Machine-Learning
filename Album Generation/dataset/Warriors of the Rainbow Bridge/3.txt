Rockin' round this country and rollin' round the world
We've seen a lot of faces and we spanked a million girls
You're waitin' on me, you're walkin' backwards my friend
This road goes on forever and it's never gonna end

When we take the stage
There's no reason through the night
Give everything every time

Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin' till the dawn
Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin', say shakin' all night long

Shakin'

I've been from city to city, every town in between
I'm ridin' steel horses, chasin' my life's dream
I'm on tour forever and that's all that I know
I'm always on the run, yes I'm always on the go

When we take the stage
And we'll turn it up real loud
Do our best to do you proud

Been down many a dusty road
And I felt that cold wind blow
And that cold wind blow

Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin' till the dawn
Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin', shakin' all night long

Livin' out of a suitcase, standin' on the line
I worked without a net, I guess I'm doing alright
New York City to Birmingham, Alabama
Chicago, Daytona, Lafayette, Louisiana

When we take the stage
And we turn the amps to ten
Then you'll understand my friend

I'm the luckiest guy I know
Cause I'm livin' the life I love
Yeah, it's all I know

Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin' till the dawn
Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin' till the dawn
Till the dawn
Said, roadhouse boogie
