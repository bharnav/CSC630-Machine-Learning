In the beginning, it was love and devotion
All the emotions you missed all your life
I want to show you into my heart
Cause that's where feelings have to start

And I feel so alive to hold you in my arms
Did not realize the cost
Midnight promises that are broken don't mean a thing
That's how easy love gets lost

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

And then in a moment baby, you were gone and I had just turned my head
My whole world went upside down cause I believed every word you said
Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

Live another day

Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

Fight another day
