It started out baby, just like a dream
Like teenage romance, we were head over heels
I can't read the future to tell what was in store
While I was sleepin', she was on out the door

I can't believe that she said I was her man
As she was my baby, that's when the trouble began
As trouble follows you around all night and day
Now that I know we'll go our separate way

Don't let the screen door hit you where the good lord split you
Cause time keeps tickin' away
Don't let the screen door hit you where the good lord split you
Cause time keeps tickin' away

What happened to the promise we made
For better, for worse, I think that we both said
We try to work it out and stay together
Then I found out, it was all spoken mirrors

If you can't stand the heat, don't look in my direction
Just leave the keys and take your obsession
What a show you put on, yeah it's quite a disgrace
Your number's on the bedroom wall, say who wants a date

Don't let the screen door hit you where the good lord split you
Cause time keeps tickin' away
Don't let the screen door hit you where the good lord split you
Cause time keeps tickin' away
Cause time keeps tickin', time keeps tickin', time keeps tickin' away
