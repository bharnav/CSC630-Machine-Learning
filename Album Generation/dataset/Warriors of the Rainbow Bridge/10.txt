Times of trouble I can understand
I may be crazy, don't mean that I'm a bad man
Broken sails from a wind of change got me broken down
Lose a man from breakin' baby, till you're six feet in the ground

One step forward and two steps back
Living hand to mouth in a shotgun shack
Two time loser in love, yes it's sink or swim
Ain't nothing gonna owe, but the rent now baby
While you are drinking your ice cold gin

I was walkin' with the devil in the bad days of my life
I could not find the sun cause it's raining all day and night
Hear the soundtrack to your soul coming from deep inside
Places you don't wanna go cause you can't hide

No stranger to the darkness, trouble finds its way to me
I'm facing the danger, but not till eternity

The world is getting bigger, all alone out in the blues
All fingers on the trigger, just tell me who made who
Raised out on the streets since I was born
Have mercy for good fortune cause I'm really torn

No stranger to the darkness, trouble finds its way to me
I'll be livin' the danger from now until eternity
No stranger to the darkness from now until eternity
No stranger to the darkness from now until eternity
