You got my attention, now I'm in the mood
Love to see you shakin', love to watch you move
Lookin' so fine, swinging to and fro
All dolled up and ready to go
Oh, no, no, no

And all goes around on her tippy toes
Which way you're turnin', no one knows
Down and dirty, don't you know?
It's all in the name of rock 'n' roll

Men are layin' at your feet
Heads are turnin' on the street
See you comin' for a country mile
End the destination, you arrive in style

Damn, you knocked me off my feet
Tight little package looks so sweet
Baby, you make my day complete

I want more than just a little
Yeah, smack dab in the middle
Pick my tongue up off the floor
What's behind the bedroom door?
Oh, gimme just a little more
What's behind the bedroom door?

Some folks say you're quite a mover
Slippin' and slidin', you know how to maneuver

It's a pure and simple plan
Grabbing everything you can

Every weeks pay for just one smile
Sassy, saucy, just my style
You got them great big bedroom eyes
Must be the devil in disguise

Men are layin' at your feet
Heads are turnin' on the street
See you comin' for a country mile
End the destination, you arrive in style

Damn, you knocked me off my feet
Tight little package looks so sweet
Baby, you make my day complete

I want more than just a little
Yeah, smack dab in the middle
Pick my tongue up off the floor
What's behind the bedroom door?
Tell me what do I have me some more
Ow, what's behind the bedroom door?

Men are layin' at your feet
Heads are turnin' on the street
See you comin' for a country mile
End the destination, you arrive in style

Damn, you knocked me off my feet
Tight little package looks so sweet
Baby, you make my day complete

I want more than just a little
Yeah, smack dab in the middle
Pick my tongue up off the floor
What's behind the bedroom door?
Said baby, won't ya gimme some more?
See you comin' for a country mile
What's behind the bedroom door?
Damn, you knocked me off my feet

I got to have me some more
Baby, you make my day complete
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
What's behind your bedroom door?
