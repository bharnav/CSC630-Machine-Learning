Welcome to the last chance motel, yeah it's the end of the line
All dressed up and nowhere to go in a one horse town
Part of me is back in the city, I had to change direction
I got no backstage passes baby, to the resurrection

I had to reach inside, take a look when I don't know who I am
With broken hearts and street-smarts baby has made me a jaded man

Nothin' to it, but to do it
Get in the game
Been on the sidelines far too long
Get in the game

Stick to your pistols baby, cause it's a brand new day
The world is for the takin' now, nothin' to stand in my way
Lookin' back over your shoulder, dwelling on the past
Better think twice if you roll the dice, don't write a check your ass can't cash

I had to reach inside, take a look when I don't know who I am
With broken hearts and street-smarts baby, has made me a jaded man

Nothin' to it, but to do it
Get in the game
Been on the sidelines far too long
Get in the game

Nothin' to it, but to do it
Get in the game
Been on the sidelines far too long
Get in the game

I'm always left inside a song, that's where I feel safe
Sometimes when you open your eyes, you play 'em as they lay
Now the sun is shining down, black clouds have gone away
Life's worth livin', but it ain't forgiven, yes it's your play you pay

I had to reach inside, take a look
Behold a stronger man

Nothin' to it, but to do it
Get in the game
Been on the sidelines far too long
Get in the game

Nothin' to it, but to do it
Get in the game
Been on the sidelines far too long
Get in the game

Get in the game
Get in the game
