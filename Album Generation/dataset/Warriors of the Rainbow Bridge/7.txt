Creeping through the backyard late in the morning
Don't wanna wake up my wife
You hear a shotgun blast that will be the warning
Yeah, you better run for your life

This ain't no way of living, always fighting, no forgiving
Half my life's on my bended knee
Could you meet me in the middle? Show you love me just a little
And won't see the backside of me

Hell has no fury like a woman's scorn
Make a strong man wish that he'd never been born
Go messin' with the lady, she's gonna drive you crazy
Leave you standin' on the street

Out there alone
Got everything that you own

If there's a moral to this story
I'd be the last one to know
Take your pleasure where you find it, hold it close while you can
And baby, don't let it go

Hell has no fury like a woman's scorn
Make a strong man wish that he'd never been born
Go messin' with the lady, good god, she's gonna drive you crazy
Leave you standin' on the street

Without no home
She gonna take everything that you own

Hell has no fury like a woman's scorn
Make a strong man wish that he'd never been born
Go messin' with the lady, she's gonna drive you crazy
Leave you standin' on the street

Hell has no fury like a woman's scorn
Make a strong man wish that he'd never been born
Go messin' with the lady, she's gonna drive you crazy
Leave you standin' on the street

Out there alone
Got everything that you own
