Everybody's got a different life story, there ain't no two alike
We all have family hardships, do our best just to survive
Early springtime morning, the life I knew came to an end
I lost my lover and my wife and my very closest friend

Your mama and your daddy always raised an eye to see
They tried to give you all the love they had and ever need
I gave you unconditional love, so you would never feel alone
We picked out an ice cold house that you turned into our home

So let's celebrate the lady we were lucky to know at all
I'm so sorry that she's gone, but her spirit lives on and on
As you cross the rainbow bridge, you're in my heart

And it wasn't just so I love you, I never put no one above you
I think about you every minute of every day
You and mama are above me 24/7, 365
I know you're walkin' with the angels and yourself is out tonight

So let's celebrate the lady we were lucky to know at all
I'm so sorry that she's gone, but her spirit lives on and on
As you cross the rainbow bridge, you're in my heart
