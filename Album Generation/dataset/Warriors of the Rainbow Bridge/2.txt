I got a hot rod engine in a Cadillac
A sweet little mama to ride in back
Coming into town to give me some
Tell the policeman, get ready to run

I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready (to do what you do)
I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready for you to do what you do

Gimme your best

Full tank of gas and a fresh pack of smokes
Little girl's in the backseat telling dirty jokes
The policeman gives me the evil eye
So does mama as we drive by

I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready (to do what you do)
I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready for you to do what you do (do the best)

The doctor's in the back, he's all messed up
Little girl's half naked, she's shakin' that stuff
My lawyer's playing cards with the boys in the band
Good golly Miss Molly, who's holding the hand

I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready (to do what you do)
I'm ready (ready for you)
Baby, I'm ready for you to do what you do, I'm ready

I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready (to do what you do)
I'm ready (ready for you)
Yes, I'm ready
