Gone in sixty seconds, still runnin' way down low
You feel the eyes upon you, said baby, it's time to go
Get your things and grab your heart, just head on out the door
The world is out there waitin' for you, only you know what you're lookin' for

Live fast, ride hard and go for what you know
Life's tough and go for what you know
Go for what you know

I went to darker passions baby, the end of the road
A comedy, a tragedy as the devil laid a dirty joke
All I see is bloody roses, my mind is getting clearer
All my troubles left with you, they're in the rearview mirror

Live fast, ride hard and go for what you know
Life's tough and go for what you know

Be careful what you wish for cause it might just come true
Well if it comes too easy baby, then you have to pay your dues
If you can't wait until tomorrow, got to have it today
Be careful what you wish for, you just might live to pay

Live fast, ride hard and go for what you know
Life's tough, so go for what you know
(Go for what you know)
Live fast, ride hard, go for what you know
Live fast, ride hard, go for what you know
Live fast, ride hard, go for what you know
Live fast, ride hard, go for what you know
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
