[Verse 1]
Hold up, let me see your bottles up
We the band with the brand and we blowin' up
This goin' out to the people who don't give a fuck
Time to throw a little party, who's showin up?
Draggin' swifties from the house to the front lawn
Start it up at dusk, wrap it up about dawn

All you ladies feelin' crazy, time to get it on
Ain't invitin' any fellas, they can stay at home
Lethal rockin' on the tables, droppin' all the funk
Sammy got the quarter, pourin' drinks from his trunk
Otto got the fire goin' warmin' up the buns
Wes is dressed up like an alien, we havin' fun

[Hook]
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10
90 percent filled up with women again
The block is full so let the party get hot
It's how we do it, if you like it or not

Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10
90 percent filled up with women again
The block is full so let the party get hot
It's how we do it, if you like it or not

[ Verse 2]
We got this party goin' harder than a motherfucker
All these naked ladies makin' out with one another
Playboy Bunnies on the roof in the mini-skirts
I'm lookin' up and what I'm seein' then, it really hurts
My brother Corey D. is paintin' up a couple bodies
You ain't never seen a party with this many hotties

I just heard that Paul Wall is comin' now
Reakwon is on the mic and he's buggin' out
Corey Taylor got a harem chasin' him around
We ain't slippin' with his knot, then we goin' down
But it doesn't got this lovin' comin 'at me
Ain't nothin' new cause I'm rollin' with the LB

[Hook]
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10

Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10

[Pre-Chorus]
The girls look so good (It's how we do it)
(If you like it not)
The girls look so good (It's how we do it)
The girls look so good (It's how we do it)
The girls look so good (It's how we do it)
(If you like it not)
The girls look so good! (It's how we do it)
The girls look so good! (It's how we do it)
(If you like it not)

[Outro]
That's how we do it if you like it or not
That's how we do it if you like it or not
That's how we do it if you like it or not
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10
