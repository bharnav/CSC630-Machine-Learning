I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I'm losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I've ever had

Back in the days there was ways
I was movin' on guns all ablaze
Dwellin' on the past like I do
Still can't forgive all the abuse
That ain't no way to rise from the crib
Still runnin' hard from the shit
Why you wanna push my buttons?
Makin' sure that I feel nothin?
Do you really think you need to remind me
Everytime every single second that I'm alive
Just to make yourself feel better? I don't think so
I just wanna do it all right
Find me better place in this life
We bring out the worst in each other
That ain't no way to love one another

I just wanna be okay
There ain't nothin' wrong with that
I'm losin' my life away
Losin' myself and I want it back

Do you remember when we both used to be so in love for eternity?
All the promises that we made
All our friends said we had it made
Yeah, there were times we were rough
Times we were down, world spinnin' round
Everybody goes through a brawl
But me and you could crash through it all
We were both lions in a cage
We were both livin' through the rage
We were still afraid and we both had everything but didn't have it made
I'm really feelin' bad that we both gonna have to say goodbye now (Goodbye)
But it is what it is baby I'm gonna have to take a time out
(Goodbye)

I just wanna be okay
There ain't nothin' wrong with that (Goodbye)
I'm losin' my life away
Losin' myself and I want it back
(Goodbye) [x2]


[Hook]

Goodbye!

I just wanna be okay
There ain't nothin wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losin myself and I want it back

I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I'm losing since I met you
