I wanna rock right now
Looking for a spot that's hot to get down
Ain't no stoppin' this quietness
Do some time and break it down

[Hook]
Hey, it's a party on the back porch
I'ma take you through the back door whoa
Gonna drink till there ain't no more
It's a party on the back porch

It's a party on the back porch
I'ma take you through the back door whoa
Gonna drink till there ain't no more
It's a party on the back porch

I wanna rock right now
Looking for a spot that's hot to get down
Ain't no stoppin' this quietness
Do some time and break it down

I wanna rock right now
Looking for a spot that's hot to get down
Looking for a night that's gonna be worth
Busting on the shell tows and doin the smurf
Ain't stopping this grindin'
I ain't even mindin'
If you put your lips on my diamond
Hands fly to the sky
Swinging so high
Up to the silver lining
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Dickie's, ball cap
You know what's up
Inside it's too claustrophobic
If I'ma flow it
I need room to through it
Follow me to the place to be
On the back porch with the symphony
One, two, three, aight y'all let's go
Follow me, follow me

[Hook]

Hey, baby, break it on down
Break it to the Bizkit sound
Let's move to the next big town
Nobody gonna stop you now

Hey, baby, break it on down
Break it to the Bizkit sound
Let's move to the next big town
Nobody gonna stop you now

[Hook]

I wanna rock right now
Looking for a spot that's hot to get down
Ain't no stoppin' this quietness
Do some time and break it down
