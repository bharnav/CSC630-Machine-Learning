[Hook]
The pain is so beautiful
The city of angels
You know who you are
It's not that you're waitin'
For some sweet tomorrow
In a room full of darkness
Hopin' you'll find lights
It's not that you're waitin'
For some sweet tomorrow
In a room full of darkness
Hopin' you'll find

[Verse 1]
What the fuck did days become, what a phase to run
We don't judge no priest, we don't reach – we come
There's smoke all in my lungs, just fuck you, I'm havin' fun
We ain't blind, we see – we don't beat, we drum
Organize the ways, damn, this life is a stage
Grab the moment and own it, I'm lookin' forward today
Before I hop on this plane, it's important to say
Goodbye to my kids, you know, you better behave
I'm livin' outta my soul, fuck it, there's no regrets
I'm hittin' Texas, we're [?] at this cash money, no bet
I've seen this ship before and I ain't have no fear
I'm near, I'm near, I'm near, bitch, I'm right here
Fuck it, I'ma drink, if I don't get a DUI
See these tickets, sneak up on you like a sniper eye
Yeah, I'm right above the clouds, boy
Ain't no way, it's time to get it now, boy

[Hook]
The pain is so beautiful
The city of angels
You know who you are
It's not that you're waitin'
For some sweet tomorrow
In a room full of darkness
Hopin' you'll find lights

[Verse 2]
I had been through this storm, been through the rain
People tellin' me lies, nobody takin' the blame
Jumpin' through all my thoughts, like it's a picket fence
All the shit that I've done doesn't really make sense
Show 'em how to behave, show 'em how to go far
Show 'em how you believe, show 'em just who you are
Fell in love with a stripper, she happy outta my head
Every fucked up lady, you can say what she said
With every single right I'm always born white
I'm punchin' these walls and it ain't no right
No, I'm chief, no bite – come and live in the night
And I sleep in the day, that's some vampire life
Cash money, metal – I should get a medal
Goin' for the gold, life don't settle
It's a race to the pain, beauty is the name
Tag it on my arm 'cause my life won't change

[Hook]
The pain is so beautiful
The city of angels
You know who you are
It's not that you're waitin'
For some sweet tomorrow
In a room full of darkness
Hopin' you'll find lights
It's not that you're waitin'
For some sweet tomorrow
In a room full of darkness
Hopin' you'll find lights
