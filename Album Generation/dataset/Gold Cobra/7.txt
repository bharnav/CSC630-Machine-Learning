One, two three, four

Down in a hole there are so many ways
To find yourself some light
It' always the miracles keep waiting all you like
Ain't got no time to waste I know the end is near
And if I run away I'll always end up here

[Hook]
Walking away from the things I adore
Telling the truth for once I'm sure
It's always a sign when you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away from all I need

I can't escape the tragedy that always brings me down
If I could eliminate those things that make me frown
Take all the baggage that follows me around
And just disintegrate burn it to the ground
[Hook]

I'm walking away!

Walking away!

[Hook]

I'm walking away!
