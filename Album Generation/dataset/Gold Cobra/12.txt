There's a motherfucking killer on the loose
And he'll destroy every single one of you
You'd better watch it cos he's lookin' for your ass now
Better lock all your doors shut the house down
He's making a list and he's checkin' it twice
He was born pissed and he's ready to slice
His reality ain't like yours and mine
He can shed blood I hope it ain't mine
He don't give a fuck if you're cryin' for help
He was born blind in the chambers of hell
Satan gave this homeboy a licence to kill
And if he comes knockin' I'mma show him the deal

[Hook]
What the fuck you gonna do about that (x2)
When the killer showing up with a gat
You goin' have to grab your ass a baseball bat
Remind this motherfucker where the home run's at
What the fuck you gonna do about that (x2)
You gonna have to face the moment of truth
You know what to do
You gonna to have to go and find the killer in you

He's got a trunk full of hatchets and shit
Bombs, gasoline, matches and shit
Anything that make a human die quick
Creepin' in the night like some super-sly shit
So scandalous! Everything about him wrong!
Chainsaw stalk none at the crack of dawn
Leatherface is a pussy, It don't compare
He'll have you shitting in your motherfucking underwear
All you homies acting hard better get a grip
He'll kill your wife and your baby sleeping in the crib
We gotta stop him
Shut this motherfucker down
Show his ass who runs this motherfucking town (x2)

[Hook]

Plant that motherfucker on the curb

Saw the killer in you

Show that motherfucker what the deal
What's real

Now it's real

Yeaaahhh (Kill that motherfucker)

[Hook]
