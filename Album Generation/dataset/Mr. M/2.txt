This was their last night on the continent
The production was shutting down
Drinks and goodbyes were had all around
The wine tasted like sunshine in the basement

The fire it almost starts itself
Looks like water comes from somewhere else
And I can use a thing or two today

Sometimes I find things on the street
Exchange the shiny ones for something we can eat
You can find me behind the stadium
Along the course of the purling river

The fire it almost starts itself
Looks like water comes from somewhere else
And I can use a thing or two today

And a bowl outside fills itself with rain
And I will get along with something less
