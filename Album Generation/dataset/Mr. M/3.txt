God made us rational
Thought made you stereo
I think of you today
Boy, what an A-hole

You made me spare
Like used software
I will not join you

Friends made you sensitive
Loss made us idiots
Fear makes us critical
Knowledge is difficult

You made me spare
Like used software
It will not bring you

Fear makes us visual
Life made you beautiful
Hate makes us powerless
Turn on your radio

You made me spare
Like used software
I will not follow you

Sleep makes you possible
Doom made this laughable
Night made a day like this
Love made a festival
