I'm not the kind of man
To live comfortably
Just give it some time
And you’ll see

And I’d like to show you
How wrong you can be
'Cause the good life is
Is wasted on me

Together there’s nothing
That cannot be fetched
Or haven’t you noticed this yet

Some friends gone forever
And sometimes our pets
And then there’s that thing with the rest of the world

Just like the hound dog
That begged for his bone
And I won’t be going there soon

I’m just as guilty
As guilty can be
'Cause the good life is
Is wasted on me
