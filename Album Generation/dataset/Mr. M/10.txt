I’ve never been in love before
And I’ve needed nothing, nothing more
Than to be with you
Make a sweet scene with you
The chances I’m aware
Are increasing now that there is love

Love I’ve never thought about it
Just some silly word that people use
Love, my stupid love
Has proved, that to be without it
Would be a loser’s bit
Now that I get, the hang of it
My love
My love
