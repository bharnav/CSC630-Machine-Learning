Took the Christmas lights
Off the front porch
February 31st
A band mate was in New Orleans
My soul mate was on the coast
After all it takes for us

There are missionaries on a beachhead
On our television screen
And I swear it looks like England
Yeah, I think it's England
And the dogs they bark at no one
And we do the best we can
2B2

I don't want to go to sleep
When I'm hungry
I don't want to wake up
When I'm stoned
Too
2B2

It was good to talk to you while we're cooking
Sounds like we're making the same thing
One man cooks with powder
The other cooks with stones
2B2
