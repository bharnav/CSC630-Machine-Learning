[Verse 1]
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me
Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

[Chorus]
You still believe in me

[Verse 2]
I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully

[Chorus]
You still believe in me

[Outro]
I want to cry
