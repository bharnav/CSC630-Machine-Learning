[Verse 1]
I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say

[Chorus]
But don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Come close
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand
And let me hear your heart beat

[Verse 2]
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow

[Chorus]
And don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Come close
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand
And listen to my heart beat

[Bridge]
Listen, listen, listen

[Instrumental with strings lead]

[Chorus]
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still

Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
