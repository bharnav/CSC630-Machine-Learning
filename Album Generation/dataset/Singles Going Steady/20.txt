You're an awful lot of fun
Forever on the run
You're my number one
But if you're not late
Then I guess you never come

You're always on my side boy
When it comes to playing games of who are we
We never find out why though
That our own raison d'etre we can't see

You're an awful lot of fun
Forever on the run
You're my number one
But if you're not late
Then I guess you never come

I said blue eyes would suit you
Yes they do oh I knew I would be right
But watch your friends don't get you
'Cause if they do I won't be seeing you tonight
