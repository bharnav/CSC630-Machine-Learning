[Verse 1]
Tried to find my sock
I know that it's lost
Something's gone wrong again
Need a shave, cut myself, need a new blade

[Hook]
Something's gone wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something's gone wrong again
Something's gone wrong again

[Verse 2]
Tried to fry an egg, broke the yolk, no joke
Something's gone wrong again
Look at my watch just to tell the time but the hands come off mine
Something's gone wrong again

[Hook]
Something's gone wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something's gone wrong again
Something's gone wrong again

[Verse 3]
Nothing ever happens to people like us
Except we miss the bus
Something goes wrong again
Need a smoke, use my last 50p, but the machine is broke
Something's gone wrong again

[Hook]
Something goes wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]
Something goes wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again

[Verse 4]
Nothing ever happens to people like us
Except we miss the bus
Something goes wrong again
Need a smoke, use my last 50p, but the machine is broke
Something goes wrong again

[Hook]
Something goes wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again

[Verse 5]
Turned up early in time for our date
But then, we turn up late
Something goes wrong again
Need a drink, go to the pub, but the bugger shuts
Something goes wrong again

[Hook]
Something goes wrong again
And again
And again
And again, again
Something goes wrong again
Ah, something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
