Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore
She told me my attitude was wrong
I had to find out where she came from

Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Her name was written on her coat
Her life was a miserable anecdote

She loved her mother and her father
They never missed her birthday
Listen to everything they said
Like never miss your birthday

Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore
A product of environment
Another flesh wound in a tenement

Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore

Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Facing Bernstein's barrier
Waiting for someone to marry her

Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Why she's a girl from the chainstore
Down there at the discotheque
Waiting for someone to bite her neck
