[Verse 1]
Reality's a dream
A game in which I seem to never find out just what I am
I don't know if I'm an actor or ham, a shamen or sham

[Hook]
But if you don't mind
I don't mind

[Verse 2]
I'm lost without a clue
So how can I undo the tangle of these webs I keep weaving?
I don't know if I should be believing
Deceptive perceiving

[Hook]
But if you don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time, I used to feel so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more

[Verse 3]
How can you convince me
When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down?
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around

[Hook]
That's if you don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time, I used to be so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more

[Bridge]
I even think you hate me when you call me on the phone
And sometimes when we go out, then, I wish I'd stayed at home
And when I'm dreaming or just lying in my bed
I think you've got it in for me
Is it all in my head?
Is it in my head?

[Verse 4]
How can you convince me
When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down?
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around

[Hook]
That's if you don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
