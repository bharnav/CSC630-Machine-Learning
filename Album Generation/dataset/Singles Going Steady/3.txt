[Verse 1]
I'm in love again
Been like this before
I'm in love again
This time's true, I'm sure

[Chorus]
Don't wanna end up like no nine day wonder
I've been hurt so many times before
So my darling, I will never leave you
It's in my blood to always love you more
Love you more

[Verse 2]
It's my heart again
That drives me so wild
I just can't explain
Although, I'm not a child

[Chorus]
So why would I cry if you ever left me?
Maybe 'cause you're all I'm living for
With every heartbeat, I want you madly
It's in my blood to always love you more
Love you more

[Verse 3]
Oh my love again
What I say is true
Though it may sound plain
I love you

[Chorus]
And it means more to me than life can offer
And if this isn't true love, then, I am sure
That after this love, there'll be no other
Until the razor cuts
