[Verse 1]
There's bed in your eyes
But there's nothing there to trust
Just lust, just lust
You're telling me lies
When you say that it's a must
Just lust, just lust

[Chorus]
You shattered all my dreams
And my head's about to bust
Is it all real?
That's how it seems
But it all comes down to dust

[Verse 2]
Your hands feel a need
I don't know if it's too much
Just lust, just lust
It seems it's only greed
To taste all that you touch
Just lust, just lust

[Chorus]
You shattered all my dreams
And my head's about to bust
Is it all real?
That's how it seems
But it all comes down to dust

[Verse 3]
You're driven to possess
It hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing matters less
Then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust

[Chorus]
I was slow to catch on
And that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion
Then emotion is a curse

I was slow to catch on
And that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion
Then emotion is a curse

[Verse 4]
You're driven to possess
It hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing mattered less
Then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust

[Chorus]
It's my imagination
To see things as I choose
Love has a reputation
That it can only lose
