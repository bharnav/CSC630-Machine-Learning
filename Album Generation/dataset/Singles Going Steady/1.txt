[Verse 1]
I just want a lover like any other
What do I get?
I only want a friend who will stay to the end
What do I get?

[Hook]
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?

[Verse 2]
I'm in distress, I need a caress
What do I get?
I'm not on the make, I just need a break
What do I get?

[Hook]
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?

[Chorus]
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead

[Hook]
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead

[Hook]
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?

[Verse 3]
I just want a lover like any other
What do I get?
I only want a friend who will love to the end
What do I get?

[Hook]
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh, oh, oh, what do I get?

Well, let me tell you now

[Outro]
(What do I get?)
(What do I get?)
(What do I get?) I get no love
(What do I get?) I get no sleep at nights
(What do I get?) I get nothing that's nice
(What do I get?) I get nothing at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
'Cause I don't get you
