[Verse 1]
Oh shit, I thought you and I were friends
Oh shit, I guess this is where our love ends
Oh shit, I thought things were goin' well
But it hasn't turned out so swell

[Hook]
Has it?
Oh shit!

[Verse 2]
Oh shit, pride comes before a fall
Oh shit, and once you lose one, you've lost them all
Oh shit, I guess that this time's the time
And it seems you're no longer mine

[Hook]
Don't it?
Oh shit!
Oh shit!
Oh!

[Verse 3]
Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which wasn't mine

[Hook]
Face it!
You're shit!
You're shit!

[Verse 4]
Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a fuckin' cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which could never be mine

[Hook]
Admit!
You're shit!
You're shit!
You're shit!

[Outro]
Admit!
Admit!
You're shit!
You're shit!
You're shit!
You're shit!
You're shit!
