(oh no) Oh lately it's so quiet in this place
You're not 'round every corner
(oh no) Oh lately it's so quiet in this place
So darling, if you're not here haunting me
I'm wondering...

Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Whose sheets you twist
Whose face you kiss?
Whose house are you haunting tonight?

I don't think much about you anymore
You're not on every whisper
I don't think much about you
But if you're not lurking behind every curtain
I'm wondering...

Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Whose name you hiss
Who's clenching fists?
Whose house, are you haunting tonight?

Now whose house are you haunting tonight?
Who can't resist
Who's cryin?
Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Whose name you hiss
Whose sheets you twist?
Whose house are you haunting tonight? (oh no)
