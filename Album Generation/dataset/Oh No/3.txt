True about my taste; true about my wealth
The thing about St. Petersburg: I was never there myself
So come on, yeah, come on
Anastasia might've cried all night, but I couldn't save myself
So come on, yeah, come on

I appreciate your courtesy
Your well-learned politesse
But you got yourself into your own mess
You know the demon's in the design:
A good idea at the time
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at time
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at time

Now how it all went down, only Pilate knows
All I ever asked of him was when the bars were closed
So come on, Yeah come on

I appreciate your courtesy
Your well-learned politesse
But you got yourself into your own mess
You know the demon's in the design:
A good idea at the time
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at time
Oh, seemed like a good idea at time
Hey, yeah, oh, at the time

Now what you gonna do about it?

Now it's true about my wealth; true about my taste
But you don't need no help from me
You'll lay yourself to waste
So come on

Seemed like a good idea at the time
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at the time
Oh, seemed like a good idea at the
Oh, alright, seemed like a good idea
Seemed like a, seemed like a
Oh, seemed like a good idea
Oh, seemed like a good idea
Seemed, seemed, seemed
Oh, seemed like a good idea
Seemed like a good idea at the time
