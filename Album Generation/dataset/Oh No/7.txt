Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

J's locked out on the fire escape
Sarah's still down on the bench at the Circle K
Crying and crying all day
Everbody's best attempts didn't do no good

No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign
But I got a hunch
Oh, it's not over yet
Oh, it's not over yet

Kate broke down on Division Street
Oh, air so wet you can hear your heart beat
And beat, and beat, and beat, and beat
Oh, I swear I gave it my best shot
What else could I do?

No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign
But I got a hunch
Oh, it's not over yet
Oh, it's not over yet

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, J's locked out on the fire escape (J's locked out on the fire escape)
Oh, Sarah's still down on the bench at the Circle K (Sarah's still down on the bench)
Crying and crying all day
And everbody's best attempts couldn't do no good

No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign of life
No sign
But I got a hunch
Oh, it's not over yet
Oh, it's not over yet

Oh, it's not over yet!

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, it's not over yet!
Ooh, ooh, ooh (J's locked out on the fire escape)
Oh, it's not over yet! (J's locked out on the fire escape)
Oh, it's not over yet! (J's locked out on the fire escape)
Oh, it's not over yet!
