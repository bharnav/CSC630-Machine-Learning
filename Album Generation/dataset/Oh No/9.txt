[Verse 1]
You're not the prettiest girl in town
I'm not the only boy with sullied clothes and a sullen frown, so
To hell with Valentine's, to hell with perfume
To hell with chocolate and picnics and Sinatra tunes

[Verse 2]
Cause while the rest of the girls are drowning
In roses and songs, he composes
And while the rest of the guys are all trying
All trying so hard

[Chorus]
Oh girl, let's crash the party
El Dorado on the lawn
Let's burn holes in the carpets
Kicking, shouting, dancing on the tables all night long

[Verse 3]
I'm not so good with subtlety
You wouldn't say that I'm the picture of urbanity
Never put much stock in suavity, courtesy, chivalry
Gallantry, all that useless jewelry

[Verse 4]
But while the rest of the girls still sigh
For the night, he was smiling politely
And while the rest of the guys are all trying
All trying so hard

[Chorus]
Oh girl, let's crash the party
El Dorado on the lawn
Let's burn holes in the carpets
Kicking, shouting, dancing on the tables all night long
All night long, all night, all night long
