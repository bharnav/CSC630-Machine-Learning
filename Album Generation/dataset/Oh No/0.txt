[Verse 1]
When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to go through you first
I bet they won't be expecting that
When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to deal with you first
And now, my money says they won't know about

[Pre-Chorus]
The thousand Fahrenheit hot metal
Lights behind your eyes
Invincible

[Chorus]
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
You're invincible
Oh, oh, oh
Invincible
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
You're invincible
Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom smashing, white hot thing
Invincible
Invincible

[Verse 2]
When they finally come, what will you do to them?
Gonna decimate them like you did to me?
Will you leave them stunned and stuttering?
When they finally come, how will you handle them?
Will you devastate them deliberately?
'Cause I'm gonna guess they won't be prepared for

[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand Fahrenheit hot metal
Lights behind your eyes
Invincible

[Chorus]
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
You're invincible
Oh, oh, oh
Invincible
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
You're invincible
Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom smashing, white hot thing
Invincible
Invincible

[Bridge]
So please
Use your powers for good
Please use your powers for good

[Chorus]
You're invincible
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
Invincible
Oh
You're invincible
Invincible
Oh, oh, oh
You're invincible
Invincible
Invincible
You're invincible

[Outro]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
You're invincible
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom smashing, white hot thing
Invincible
Invincible
