Having spent your entire life
Exactly where you are tonight
In the valley between intent and deed
You must have mastered this
The fragile art of a good excuse
The little things that get you to believe
That get you to believe

So listen, I'm not trying to prove anything at all here
But don't you think that maybe, this time, you were wrong?

You've spent your entire life
Quick-tongued and always right
Hasn't being right just let you down?
Right just lets you down

So listen, I'm not trying to say anything at all here
There isn't much left anyway, that hasn't been said
But don't you think that possibly, this time, it's different?
Don't you think that maybe, this time, you were wrong?
