Super automatic pilot motor
Running down circles in the parking lot
Self-sustaining system
Bit her in the neck and quick
And kissed her and took all she got
Did you come here to dance?
What's in your glass?
Do you feel better?

Let it rain, let it pour
Let it rain, let it pour
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let it rain, let it pour

Cruise-control distressed her
Kind of cursed and kind of blessed her
Engine running on the fumes
Vision blue and blurry
Falling angels in a flurry
Spinning through the empty room
Did you come here to dance?
What's in your glass?
Do you feel better now?

Let it rain, let it pour
Let it rain, let it pour
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let it rain, let it pour

Super automatic pilot motor
Running down circles in the parking lot
Self-sustaining system
Bit her in the neck and quick
And kissed her and took all she got

Let it rain (hallelujah), let it pour
Let it rain (hallelujah), let it pour
Let it rain (hallelujah), let it pour
Let it pour (hallelujah)
Let it pour (hallelujah)
Let it pour
