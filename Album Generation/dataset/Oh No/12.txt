Fingers blistered from the nightly scratching at the window
Which won't open far enough to let air in
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

Feral cats are screaming at the clouds beneath the window
With the crack so small that nothing gets within
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Telephones are howling at the cats out in the alley
And the window offers nothing in the din
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

Clouds uncage the car alarms to chase the cats and telephones
Fingers rake and rasp away their skin
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
Yeah, you don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in

Ice age upon catastrophic ice age of selection
And only one result has trickled in
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

If evil were a lesser breed than justice after all these years
The righteous would have freed the world of sin
The house wins
Oh, the house always wins

You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
You don't have to be sick to be dying
You might as well give in
You don't have to have lost to be lost
Oh, give in
You don't have to be alone to be lonely
You might as well give in
