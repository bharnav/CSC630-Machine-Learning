[Verse]
The last time i saw elvis
He was shooting at a colour tv
The phones were ringing in the pink motel
And the rest is history
He was the king
The last time i saw elvis
He was singing a gospel song
You could tell he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king
The last time i saw elvis
He was up on the silver screen
Pushing a plough in a black and white movie
And everybody started to scream
Yes, he was the king
The last time i saw elvis
It was some kind of vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed
He was the king
The last time i saw elvis
He was fronting a three-piece band
Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the king
The last time i saw elvis
The last time i saw elvis
He was riding in a pink cadillac
Wind was blowing through his hair
And he never did look back
He was the king
He was the king
Thank you very much
The last time i saw elvis
He was singing that gospel song
You could tell that he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king

[Outro]
He was the king [x6]
