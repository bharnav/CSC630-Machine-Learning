[Verse 1]
Was he thinking about my country
Or the color of my skin?
Was he thinking about my religion
And the way i worshiped him?
Did he create just me in his image
Or every living thing?

[Chorus]
When god made me [x2]

[Verse 2]
Was he planning only for believers
Or for those who just have faith?
Did he envision all the wars
That were fought in his name?
Did he say there was only one way
To be close to him?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Did he give me the gift of love
To say who we could choose?

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Did he give me the gift of voice
So some could silence me?
Did he give me the gift of vision
Not knowing what i might see?
Did he give me the gift of compassion
To help my fellow man?

[Chorus][x2]
