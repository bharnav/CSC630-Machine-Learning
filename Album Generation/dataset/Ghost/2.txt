Hey little one, think about our time
When all the pain we’ve overcome
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the boys are older
All I’ll ever think about is you
And you’ll be there when we are through

And all are drinking from our hearts
Of all the love that comes apart
Is all for you or all for ‘I’?
I want to wait until we die
You’re here afraid yet still you try
As life for me is life through ‘I’
If all for three is all for five
Then we’ll have peace until we die

Close your eyes and go to sleep
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Peace to you…
Peace to you…
Peace to you

Hey little one, think about a time
When all the waves and oceans rise
Hey little one, think about a time
And all the way, you loaded all your dolls and toys into the car
…and we are here while you are far
And all I ever think about is you
It’s only father feathers
It’s only feathers

They say heaven was in tune, your point of view
I try to see your point of view

The door opens into your eyes
And I have wondered when we die
He won’t have due this falling ride
As I’ll have to already child
So all for you and all for I
Lets just forgive and let this child…
So all for you and all for I
So lets forgive and let this lie…

Close your eyes and go to sleep
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Peace to you…
Peace to you…
Peace to you

Peace to you
Peace to you
Peace to all
Peace to you
Peace to all
Peace to all

Generally we are a lonely people
Generally we are alone
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
Generally we are a lonely people
Generally we are alone, alone…
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
Generally we are a lonely people
… Generally we are alone
Generally we are alone

Peace to you
