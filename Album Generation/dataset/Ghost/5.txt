The leaves are falling down
The trees are calming down
So do we love it now?

The thrills are calming down
And she is leaving town…
So do we love it now?

Find a way, we’re falling all the time
Soon we will be home within our time
Soon we will be harmonized
How in the world are we going to find the time?

I will always love you
… if you wouldn’t mind I think I’ll fall in line
I will always love you
… if you wouldn’t mind I think I’ll fall in too

I’m over, I’m over, I’m overtired…
I’m over, I’m over, I’m overtired…
(You’re so tired)

I’m over, I’m over, I’m overtired…
I’m over, I’m over, I’m overtired…

I will always love you
… if you wouldn’t mind I think I’ll fall in line
I will always love you
… if you wouldn’t mind I think I’ll fall in too

It’s you, it’s you, it’s always been you…
It’s you, it’s you!

Young love, it’s on the blackberry vine!
Young love, it’s on the blackberry vine!
Young love, it’s on the blackberry vine!
Young love, it’s on the blackberry vine
