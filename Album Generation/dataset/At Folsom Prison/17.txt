[ Johnny Cash & June Carter)
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out

[ Johnny Cash ]
I'm going to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

[  June Carter ]
Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!

[Johnny Cash ]
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson

[  June Carter ]
See if I care

[ Johnny Cash ]
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow

[  June Carter ]
Hah!!

[ Johnny Cash ]
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cos I'm goin' to Jackson

[  June Carter ]
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote

[  June Carter ]
But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan

[ Johnny Cash &  June Carter ]
Well now, We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back

[ June Carter]

[ Johnny Cash ]
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'
And we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went...
