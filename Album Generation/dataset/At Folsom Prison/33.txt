[Verse]
Well he's not very handsome to look at
Oh he's shaggy and eats like a hog
And he's always killing my chickens
That dirty old egg-sucking dog
Egg-sucking dog
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound
Now if he don't stop eating my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm going to get my rifle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky
Egg-sucking dog
You're always hanging around
But you'd better stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound
