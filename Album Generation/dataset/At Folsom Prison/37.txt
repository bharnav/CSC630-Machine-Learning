[Verse 1]
Well I'm going start out walking
Just you wait and see
Uh-huh guitar picker
You ain't leaving without me

[Chorus]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out uh huh
Yes ma'm I think we can

[Verse 2]
Well I stole the Hope diamond
Hoping I could shut your mouth
But how am I going wear it
If I got to hide it out

[Chorus]
Well you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out uh huh
Yes ma'm I think we can

[Verse 3]
Well I bought you a first class ticket
For a luxury liner cruise
I got out in that ocean
Looked around and there was you

[Chorus]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out uh huh
Yes ma'm I think we can

[Verse 4]
I bought you a big long limousine
But I don't want no car
I gave my love and everything
But you're still what you are
You're just a big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out uh huh
Yes ma'm I think we can
Oh honey I love that big sweet mouth
You a long legged guitar picking man
Ha ha I'm going to pick it for you
Now you a nice guitar picking man
