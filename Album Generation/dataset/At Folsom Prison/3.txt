[Verse]
My bills are all due and the babies need shoes
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's going to haul my belongings away
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
Because I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
But I'm Busted
My brother said, "there's not a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you
Because I'm Busted
Lord, I am not no thief, but a man can go wrong
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's got to pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
Because I'm Busted
