Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"

"Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more."

When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack into that district court"

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, in the first degree
I hollered, "Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pin
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whisky, and let that cocaine be
