I'm not in this town to stay
Said a lady old and grey
I'm Just here to get my baby ou of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just to ge my baby out of jail

I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your clothes
If that will get my baby out of jail

I will pawn you my watch
I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
Yes, warden, I'm just to ge my baby out of jail

When those gates swung wide apart
She hel her darling to her heart
She kissed kissed her baby boy and then she died
Yes, warden, in ther arms of her dear boy there she died
Yes, warden, in ther arms of her dear boy there she died
