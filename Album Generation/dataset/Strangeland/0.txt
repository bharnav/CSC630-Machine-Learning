[Verse 1]
Fearful child have faith in brighter days
Stay home 'til this darkness fades away
Lie still beside me
I'll hold you now, I'll hold you forever

[Verse 2]
Winter's hand will freeze your heart again
Doors will close, no time to start again
Nothing is given
Except the ties that hold us together

[Chorus 1]
Lay down your load
Cause every day it's gonna grow
And bask in the sunshine
Try to pay no mind, try to pay no mind at all
To all the things that you don't know
You've got time to realize
You're shielded by the hands of love
Cause you are young

[Verse 3]
Fading light may make a fool of me
Courage fails, strengths slip away from me
Lie still beside me
And hold me now, and hold me forever

[Chorus 2]
Lay down your load
Cause every day it's gonna grow
These days are sacred
Hey now, don't be scared, baby, don't be scared at all
Of all the things that you don't know
You've got time to realize
You're shielded by the hands of love
Cause you are young

[Bridge]
You've got time, you've got to try
To bring some good into this world
Cause you are young
Cause you are young

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Cause you are young
