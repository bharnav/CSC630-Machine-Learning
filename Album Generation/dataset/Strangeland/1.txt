[Instrumental break]
[Verse 1]
In a city like mine there's no point in fighting
I close my eyes, see you and me driving
If I am a river, you are the ocean
Got the radio on, got the wheels in motion

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

[Verse 2]
I lie in the dark; I feel I'm falling
Feel your hand on my back; hear your voice calling
I'm out of my depth, girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town
They look straight through me

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

[Bridge]
'Cause, baby, I'm not scared of this world when you're here
No, baby I'm not scared of this world when you're here

Ooohh oohoo, you and I, we're gonna rise again
Ooohh oohoo, you and I, we're gonna rise again

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then
