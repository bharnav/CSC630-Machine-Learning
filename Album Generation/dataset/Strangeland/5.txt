[Verse 1]
Have you been feeling that pull?
And are you hearing that call?
Cause you've got everything that you need to make a start
I had a dream of my own
Just walking out of my home
And going I don't know where to sing beneath the stars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your whole life lies ahead
It's just around the bend

[Chorus 1]
So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road
And when the world is laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load
When things get bad you know you'll have a friend
All along the road

[Verse 2]
And I would love it sometime
If you would walk at my side
Going I don't know where to sleep beneath the stars

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If in your life you need a hand
Reaching the promised land

[Chorus 1]
So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road
And when the world is laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load
When things get bad you know you'll have a friend
All along the road
All along the road

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Golden light lies ahead
It's just around the bend

[Chorus 1]
So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road
And when the world is laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load
When things get bad you know you'll have a friend
All along the road

[Chorus 2]
So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will meet you on the road
And when the world's laying you low
Don't you let it rattle your bones
Sometimes the dream itself can keep you safe
All along the road
All along the road
All along the road
All along the road
