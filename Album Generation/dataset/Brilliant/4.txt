I give to you the best of everything
I'm here to grow your little monuments
Oh, don't dare to doubt me all the joy I bring
It's Heaven sent

Hold on, I've come to help you rise
With a handshake, big smile, good guy profile
Take it now or leave it 'neath the flash of a neon sky
I'll cheat and lie
To give you all the things you need
To help you get the things I need for me

I bring you revelations openly
I set the word of God to make you pray
Oh, don't think to thank my world for anything, anyway

Hold on, I've come to help you rise
With a handshake, big smile, good guy profile
Take it now or leave it 'neath the flash of a neon sky
I'll cheat and lie
To give you all the things you need
To help you get the things I need for me
Hold on, I've come to help you rise
To give you all the things you need

No how or why
No live or die
Fail to comply
Red neon sky

Hold on, I've come to help you rise
With a handshake, big smile, good guy profile
Take it now or leave it 'neath the flash of a neon sky
I'll cheat and lie
To give you all the things you need
To help you get the things I need for me

Take it now or leave it 'neath the flash of a neon sky
To give you all the things you need
To help you get the things I need for me
