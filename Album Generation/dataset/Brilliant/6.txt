Hello, hello, hello
Welcome to this world you made
Hello, hello, hello
It's raining through your sad parade

If you always do
What you've always done
Then nothing good will ever come
If you always get
What you've always got
You'll find that love's what you forgot

Hello, hello, hello
Welcome to this world you made
Hello, hello, hello
It's raining through your sad parade
Free to bite your bitter pill
Sorry now, at least until
Someone is but never will
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

There's no one to blame
'Cause this was your goal
You gave your life, your heart, your soul
Wrapped in deceit
Loving the lie
To find that life has left you dry

Hello, hello, hello
Welcome to this world you made
Hello, hello, hello
It's raining through your sad parade
Free to bite your bitter pill
Sorry now, at least until
Someone is but never will
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

Hello, hello, hello
Welcome to this world you made
Hello, hello, hello
It's raining through your sad parade
Free to bite your bitter pill
Sorry now, at least until
Someone is but no one will
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

Hello, hello
