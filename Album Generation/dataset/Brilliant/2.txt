Somewhere sure, somewhere safe inside
A world where you reside
Where chance and trust have died
A world where you can
Hide away, hide away
No tomorrow, no today

You, the brilliant thing you are
Outshine your brightest star
Too distant and too far away
You, you legend deep inside
Religiously denied, denied

Step out from the mask you stand behind
Fearful lost and blind
Time to take the time
The pressures on you
Hide away, hide away
No tomorrow, just today

You, the brilliant thing you are
Outshine your brightest star
Too distant and too far away
You, you legend deep inside
Religiously denied, denied

You, the brilliant thing you are
Outshine your brightest star
Too distant and too far away
You, you legend deep inside
Religiously denied, denied

You, the brilliant thing you are
Outshine your brightest star
Too distant and too far away
You, you legend deep inside
Religiously denied, denied
