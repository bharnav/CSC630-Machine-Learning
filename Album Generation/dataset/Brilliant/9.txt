Couldn't you let it lie?

With a smile and subterfuge
You dance your savage dance
Some hidden cause you cannot justify
A lie's a lie

Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?

Conscience clear and sanctified
You wash your sins away
In God's name you start your holy war
Who's it for?

Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?

Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?
Couldn't you let it lie?
