I am the road I walk alone
Exposed and turned to stone
A heart without a home
Walk for miles to walk away
A new life every day
To welcome come what may

Turn around and make the change
Turn it round and love will happen
You took a lifetime to find
The change

I am the wall I built alone
The line that I have drawn
So cold and dark and strong
Resistant to all love and hate
So tragic and so great
No heart to penetrate

Turn around and make the change
Turn it round and love will happen
You took a lifetime to find
The change

Leave you standing on my shore
To watch this ocean roar
A sea you can't cross over
A raging tide to wash away
The gift of better days
With words that you might say

Turn around and make the change
Turn around and make the change
Turn it round and love will happen
You took a lifetime to find
The warmth
The love
The change
