It was a birthday gift of a Mexican Telecaster
From this day on, I will play along to all my Young Pioneers records
And there will be a poetry spoken silently between me and the stereo
I'll work mornings and you can work through the night

Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it across the state line, we might as well lay down and die
Because if Florida takes us, we're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from will be the death of us

And I cannot help but hold on to a handful of times
When what was spoken was a revolution in itself
And what we were doing was the only thing that mattered

And how good it felt to kill the memory
Of nights spent holding your shirt for the smell
I heard you used to cry when you made love to him
But this band will play on

'Cause all we can do is what we've always done
And on and on on and on on and on on and on on and on

Mary, there is no hope for us
If this GM van don't make it across the state line, we might as well lay down and die
Because if Florida takes us, we're taking everyone down with us
Where we're coming from will be the death of us
