[Verse]
In the closest alley, in the first doorway, he pushed up against her and closed his eyes
He said, "This is probably the worst decision that I've ever made."
She laughed and smiled. She said, "I'm sure you do this all the time right right right right right?"

And as the morning came and the city woke and in the building people all went to work
As their rides out of town came they parted ways she said, "Do you know when you're coming back again?"
Dig it deeper, deeper, and farther still, bury it up and over and into the ground
All these lies will grow in ways that we never thought possible

[Chorus]
If you quiet down down down, so soft of a sound, you can hear it all coming back after you
Quiet down down down, so soft of a sound, you can hear it all coming back after you
And Now you want to take it back, you think you might have fucked up
Waking dreams of concrete, deafening panic, cracked skull
There is yelling all around, get up, get up please start breathing
And the moment will come when you finally realize the results of decisions and choices in your life
Can you hear it all coming back after you?

[Outro]
Down down down, so soft of a sound, can you hear it all coming back after you?
Down down down, so soft of a sound, can you hear it all coming back after you?
