[Verse 1]
Evelyn sits by the elevator doors
It's been 37 years since James died
On St. Patrick's Day in 1964
She could not hold it against him
There were times when there was nothing she could do
But lie in bed all day
Beside a picture of them together
A picture of better days

[Hook]
And just like James, I'll be drinking Irish tonight
And the memory of his last work week
Will be gone forever
Evelyn, I'm not coming home tonight
If we're never together
If I'm never back again
Well, I swear to God that I'll love you forever
Evelyn, I'm not coming home tonight

[Verse 2]
In all the years that went by
She said she'd always love him
And from the day that he died
She never loved again
And in his wallet she kept on her nightstand
An AA card and a lock of red hair
Kept secrets of pride locked so tight in her heart
It killed a part of her before the rest was gone

[Bridge]
She said "If I would have known
Just how things would have ended up
I just would have let myself die"

[Hook]
And just like James, I'm drinking Irish tonight
And the memory of his last work week
Will be gone forever
Evelyn, I'm not coming home tonight
If we're never together
If I'm never back again
Well, I swear to God that I'll love you forever
Evelyn, I'm not coming home tonight
