[Intro]
The party's over
A CD skipping
It's the same hook repeating
Grows more grating with each passing second

[Verse 1]
And the walls contain a resonation, laughter and conversation
It was fun while it lasted, but now we should be going
And I hope everybody had a real, real good time
The hospitality's partaken
My head is flying, my heart's racing to keep up
And I hope I haven't overdone it, no

[Verse 2]
I hope my body can take it
I hope I make the occasion
It's only this fucked up, I start realizing all this living is just dying
And if these are my friends, if this is my home
If this is how I spend my nights
How I communicate and demonstrate a love of life

[Outro]
My eyes roll into the back of my head
If these are the last words that I've ever said
No, I'm not ready to die just yet
