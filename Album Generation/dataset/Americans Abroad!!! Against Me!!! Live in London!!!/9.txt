[Verse 1]
Not one more word tonight
Between here and there
We'll put a distance the size of the ocean so now this heart can beat a skipping rhythm

As the cadence carries me
I almost drift away
Far enough to forget
But when it comes you cannot hesitate

And when found I will write
An account and seal it in an envelope
Addressed to your last known residence

[Chorus]
Whoaaaa
Whoa - oh - oh - ah – oh
Whoa - oh - oh - ah – oh
Whoa - oh - oh – oh

[Verse 2]
And we sink, and we drown
And what is lost can never be found
Well these arms did swim
Until the lungs pulled in
Panic was lost in a deep understanding

That you will see what is wrong with everything
What is wrong with you and me
They make all the right reasons to fuck it up
You're gonna fuck it up

[Chorus]
Whoaaaa
Whoa - oh - oh - ah – oh
Whoa - oh - oh - ah – oh
Whoa - oh - oh - oh

[Outro]
That sounded pretty good to me
I thought it was pretty good
