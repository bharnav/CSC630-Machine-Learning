[Verse 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I make a picture

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?

[Verse 2]
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you

[Verse 3]
Are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair
Are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine
You were dodging all the time
Are you still dizzy?

[Chorus]
Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?

[Verse 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I make a picture

[Chorus]
Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?
