Far away I'm hunting
In my heart I'm wanting
Forged my breach through prison
From the sludge I've risen

Today's a brand new day
I'm a new chill in the air
Pity my friend has shown to me
His softer underbelly

So easy to take life away
When your soul is wounded
I've tracked so many animals
They all die the same way

I taste her I want her
The chain reaction starts
I'll own her I'll rule her
It's over and I promise you that

I'll take away the things that you trust
The things that you love
I'll find a way to share all my pain with you

It's so easy for me
She's so vulnerable
I'll use my tricks and take her home
And you'll watch as I do

Feel my new transition
Darkened exhibition

I'll take away the things that you trust
The things that you love
I'll find a way to share all my pain with you
I'm gonna share it with you

I'm gonna polish my lies
Gonna tell them just right
You better mark what I say
I'm gonna take it away
I'm gonna take it away
I'm gonna take it away
