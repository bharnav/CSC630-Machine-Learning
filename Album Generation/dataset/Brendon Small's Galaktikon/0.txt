Forty thousand light years
The galaxy is burned through my sight
Pushing through the system like mercury
I'm liquid in flight

I'm devoid of navigation
Detect my path through the starlight
Speeding through the universe
Constellations focus my flight

Serpentis Centauris Circinus Delphinus
Orion Arcturus Andromeda Poseidon

I never wanted that life my focus was lost
Complicated matters weakened my heart

But its over it's over now
I'm moving I'm moving on
I'm needed protector
The universe the universe

What has become of this deity
What of the beautiful
Gone and slipped into eternity
You can't look back your

Future is no more

Why does he run
Has his power failed he's indestructible
He is a man with god like strength
The faster her flies the stronger he becomes

You know you can't go back
You know you can't go back
Further further further away

Forty thousand light years

It's so far
This black love hit so hard

Yes I must fly on gonna fly away
Cause you're gonna fly on too anyway

Oh I need a change of scenery
Could I get some advice oh no
Could I get some advice oh no
Could I get some advice oh no
Just a little advice oh no
