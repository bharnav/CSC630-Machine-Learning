And now Poseidon is dead
And I spread black love like fire
And I have killed all desires
I am a machine

Don't want to see me again
Apparently now I'm needed
And none of the warnings heeded
Now I'm in this too because of you

On my way called to say
On my way on my way

But now you've done it this time
Gone and taken half my being
And the whole wide world is seeing
It must be rectified

Who will I battle this time
Is it the beast or she
I can't believe I'm still learning
That I'm my worst enemy every time

On my way called to say
On my way on my way

Hold on someone's got your back
Who cares what this means to you
Don't think this will change a thing
But hold on someone's coming through

We have guests here tonight
Make them feel welcome

Not so easily
Not so easily

Recognize them
Paralyze them
Not so easily
Whose death will it be

One small move it can change your life
Whose last move will it be tonight

On my way called to say
On my way on my way

Hold on someone's got your back
Who cares what this means to you
Don't think this will change a thing
But hold on someone's coming through

We are so tired
Don't want no more
Black love good bye
I'm moving on
