You dug your hole
You will pay the price
Bow down for us
You won't last past night

Those that tried with cunning and pride
Have felt the strength and soul collide

Make your peace tonight
Those were your last rights
We'll fight until our final breath
Your world will quake until your death
We don't stand alone
We don't stand alone

Take your place now
You can't let them down
We want your blood
Spilled onto the ground

Those that tried with cunning pride
Have felt the strength and soul collide

Make your peace tonight
Those were your last rights

We'll fight until our final breath
Your world will quake until your death
We don't stand alone
We don't stand we don't stand
We don't stand alone
We don't stand we don't stand
We don't stand alone
NO

We will challenge the impossible
We will defy the laws of gravity
They will behold our majesty oh oh

We're gonna break on through the gates
We're gonna break em all down
We're gonna kick em when they fall
We're gonna take em all down

Hold the line hold the line hold the line
Hold the line hold the line hold the line
GO
