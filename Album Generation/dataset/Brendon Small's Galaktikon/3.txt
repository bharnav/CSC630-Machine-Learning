This one comes from me
My god I'm so into you
He never took the time
To say you're looking good too

It don't matter now
Who I could be to you
Beast or royalty
I wanna move with you

I think you're so wonderful
Stay with me I'll stay with you
If you only knew the things I'd do to you
I'll bend you till you break and won't be through with you
Push until you shake and you will beg me too
But it's getting late we better move it

Come on my way come on my come on let's go oh
It's not too soon
Come on my way come on my way come on let's go oh
It's up to you

And there is nowhere to run
And there is nowhere to run
And there is nowhere to run
And there is nowhere to run

The clock is running down
It's time to make your call
I can read your thoughts
You're mind's made up you know
You've got no will
You're mine to break
It's your chance
You better take it now

Stay with me
I'll stay with you

Come on my way come on my come on let's go oh
It's not to soon
Come on my way come on my way come on let's go yeah
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
