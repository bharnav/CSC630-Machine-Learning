Rumors circulating now
Found the beast and settled down
It's moving forward
So happy for her

Message fired through the stars
Cryptic threat her life for yours
It's moving forward
So frightened for her

I don't accept future foreseen
Although I know it's hard for me
I can't ignore catastrophe

Your identity is known
Kill the deity right now
It's moving forward
Will no one help her
She's begging screaming
They just stand there

You know it's gonna get darker
You know that a storm will brew
You know you're gonna lose everything
How can you do it when you know she wouldn't
Do it for you

I won't be told who I can't be
I over ride the future
All else will cease

You know it's gonna get darker
You know that a storm will brew
You know you're gonna lose everything
How can you do it when you know she wouldn't
Do it for you

Looks like I'm flying through the eye of the storm
Unmask Poseidon leave the cloak and armor

Tonight danger got a feeling this won't go well
I'm being followed i got a feeling this won't go well

Looks like I'm flying looks like I'm done
