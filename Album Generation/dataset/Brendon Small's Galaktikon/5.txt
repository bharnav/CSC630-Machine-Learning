I am inside your mind
Ghosts of your past have died
I have hidden your soul
You're under my control

You can't run away from me

I want you to know
If you try to go
I can detect your lies
You're risking both your lives

You have begun counting days
You have found your place to stay
You will never get away
You can't run away from
You can't run away from
You can't run away from me

I realize that I'm feeling so much colder
I realize that I am running out of time

You have begun counting days
You have found your place to stay
You have begun counting days
You have found your place to stay
You have begun counting days

You can't run away from
You must run away from
No you can't run away from
No you can't run away from
