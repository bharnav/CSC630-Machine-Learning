There's a darkness I see
A premonition in me
The black love that you seek
Will be abducted in dreams

Oh but oh oh tread slow
Don't go keep your head about

Don't close your affairs
Don't count your shares
Just let this thing play out
Don't intervene
It's plain to see
The end will simply be

All the sound all the sound
Carries round carries round
All the sound all the sound
Carries round carries round

Leave it be
Leave it be

It's got nothing to do with you wasting your time
Oh oh oh oh
You should forget what you know and just take my advice
Oh oh oh

I see a beast on a mountain
So hard to tell he's concealing his horns
A wicked beast on a mountain
He will entice with the spells of his scorn
Decrepit world lacking beauty
He wants what you used to have
Collect the debt in his prison
And immortality will greet him

It's so hard for you see
That these things will come to be
It's so hard for me to speak
Of these things

Don't go
Don't go

It's got nothing to do with you wasting your time
You should forget what you know and just take my advice
It's got nothing to do with you wasting your time
Oh oh oh
You should forget what you know and just take my advice
Oh oh oh

Don't go I can see it all so clearly
I can see it all so well
Please believe the words I tell you and don't go
