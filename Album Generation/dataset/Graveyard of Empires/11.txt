Reach me with halos
Clean me with all your good intent
Burn me with fear so I won't question or end this relationship

Well I'm filled with more than regret
I have chose to ignore it or face the feeling again
My time is wasted

I followed your story, I can't do your math
You won't stand before me or behind my back
My eyes have been blurry, my family attacked
I can't stand before you and won't take this back
Won't take it back!

Show me you're a hero
Show me your life makes perfect sense
Judge me for years so I'm infected by questions of innocence

Well I'm filled with more than regret
I have chose to ignore it or face the feeling again
My time is wasted

I followed your story, I can't do your math
You won't stand before me or behind my back
My eyes have been blurry, my family attacked
I can't stand before you and won't take this back
Won't take it back!

Won't take it back!

I followed your story, I can't do your math
You won't stand before me or behind my back
My eyes have been blurry, my family attacked
I can't stand before you and won't take this back
Won't take it back!
I followed your story, I can't do your math
You won't stand before me or behind my back
My eyes have been blurry, my family attacked
I can't stand before you and won't take this back
Won't take it back!
