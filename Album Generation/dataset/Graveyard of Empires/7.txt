The fire has gone away
The truth is left to blame for all the damage I have made

I feel, I feel the past escape
The want to know the way to you left me here to faint

I lost the fight
There's nothing left to bleed and no one left to free
Pick me up and give me back my belief
Feed me lies
There's nothing left to see and no room left to breath
Sp pick me up and give me back my belief
Live to die

Please is just another word
Is just another victim to the faults of you and me

Well, I try to understand you
I try, believe me, I do
And you choose to turn and walk away
(You walk away)

I lost the fight
There's nothing left to bleed and no one left to free
Pick me up and give me back my belief
Feed me lies
There's nothing left to see and no room left to breath
Sp pick me up and give me back my belief
Live to die

You live your life
No one hears your screams
We stay alive
We never fall asleep

I lost the fight
There's nothing left to bleed and no one left to free
Pick me up and give me back my belief
Feed me lies
There's nothing left to see and no room left to breath
Sp pick me up and give me back my belief
Live to die

We live to die
