We fight for the hell of it
We flee to feel alive
We love to get the hate from it
We feed troubled minds

We will divide (we will divide)
We will remind you
We will survive (we will survive)
We live inside you

We crawl inside, we fade away
We blame, we hate
We live inside you
We paralyze, we take away
We hate, we break
We criticize you
We crawl inside, we take away

We captivate the furious
Deception our demise
We decorate the fear in us
With power to fuel the fires

We will divide (we will divide)
We will remind you
We will survive (we will survive)
We live inside you

We crawl inside, we fade away
We blame, we hate
We live inside you
We paralyze, we take away
We hate, we break
We criticize you
We crawl inside, we take away

We crawl inside, we fade away
We blame, we hate
We live inside you
We paralyze, we take away
We hate, we break
We criticize you
We crawl inside, we take away
