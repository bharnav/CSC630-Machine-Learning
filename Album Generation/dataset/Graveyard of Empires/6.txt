When all you have are memories
No thoughts are left behind
When all is lost but the little things
You fake to keep you high
When all along all you want is someone to make up your mind
It's all you want
It's all I want

Fake, hating, taking this feeling!

Life isn't what it seems to be
The echo in my mind
Life, is it hard for you to breathe?
Live in the shadow
Life, is it hard for you to feed
The demon trapped inside
Do you find it far too easy
Living in the shadow

Confusing what is meant to be
Believe in what you are
Searching for the enemy
Caged inside your heart
It's all you want
It's all I want

Life isn't what it seems to be
The echo in my mind
Life, is it hard for you to breathe?
Live in the shadow
Life, is it hard for you to feed
The demon trapped inside
Do you find it far too easy
Living in the shadow

Living in the shadow

Fake, hating, taking this feeling!

Life isn't what it seems to be
The echo in my mind
Life, is it hard for you to breathe?
Live in the shadow
Life, is it hard for you to feed
The demon trapped inside
Do you find it far too easy
Living in the shadow
