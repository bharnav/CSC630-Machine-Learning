I would like a word with you (Kind and justified)
I haven't seen the life in you (Forgive me while I try)
Time hasn't done the best for you
(Open wide are my) Eyes, deprived of finding you
I am justified

And I am a warrior, not the victim of your pain
I speak for the curious, infected by your ways
And we stand
I'll stand before you at the foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you!

I try, to believe in blind but true
(Paralyzing my) Mind, and consequently you
(Suffocated by) Lies and acts of pain to prove
(That I'm justified)
By what I expect from you while I'm still alive

And I am a warrior, not the victim of your pain
I speak for the curious, infected by your ways
And we stand
I stand before you at the foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you!

Am I supposed to change?
Am I the only one who feels this way?
Will I find peace again
Or face the end in love with emptiness?

And I am a warrior, not the victim of your pain
I speak for the curious, infected by your ways
And we stand
And I stand before you at the foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you!

And I am a warrior
I'd like a word with you...
