You're a book, you're a photograph
You're a plaque on the wall or a knickknack haiku
You're the voice of a guilty man who doesn't call your name
Until he needs to be lied to
Call me vicious, cast your stones on me
You're the death of a million men
You're the face we defend with a patient virtue
You're the judge of when a life should end
Or when a war begins, you're such a perfect statue

You wear your necklace like you wear your noose
You fear your comfort anyway you choose
But I'm not like you!

I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I can't let you in
I feel like choking then holding
You're breaking the skin
This isn't hope that I'm holding
No love you can give
Not lonely, I've chosen
To bleed here again and again

Now I wake up to the sound of the mourning
I feel infection
Eyes shut to the absent heartbeat
Too late to question
Will you surrender or will you lose
I love the way you blur your vision, I feel your passion
Never give up until the path you're living finds your intention

Call me evil cause I'm not like you
You fear your comfort anyway you choose
But I'm not like you!

I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I can't let you in
I feel like choking then holding
You're breaking the skin
This isn't hope that I'm holding
No love you can give
Not lonely, I've chosen
To bleed here again and again

One man buys the life
That someone controls the night
He died...

I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I can't let you in
I feel like choking then holding
You're breaking the skin
This isn't hope that I'm holding
No love you can give
Not lonely, I've chosen
To bleed here again and again
