Building, shaping shallow fallacy
Render hate to cure the wrath
As we find new ways, we define duality
Desperate to relate, rewrite me

Fire finds me
Doubt burns without defense
Wired blindly, well, here I go again

I can't go back in time tonight
I see the ashes of my life

Thank you, hate you
Been caged inside my only life and I blame you
Escape you (Hear the truth inside to find it)
Hate you, I just wanted to thank you

Chasing shattered passing memories
Right or wrong, I need the company
Comfort me, come between, confront with me
Fate is not afraid, it's the enemy

Liars find me
Words come without regret
Wired blindly, well, here I go again

I can't go back in time tonight
I see the ashes of my life

Thank you, hate you
Been caged inside my only life and I blame you
Escape you (Hear the truth inside to find it)
Hate you, I just wanted to thank you

Shielding then using the words of an enemy
Truth is the lie in disguise
Pleasing then choosing the words for a remedy
Keeping your ghost in my eyes!

I can't go back in time tonight
I see the ashes of my life

Thank you, hate you
Been caged inside my only life and I blame you
Escape you (Hear the truth inside to find it)
Hate you, I just wanted to thank you
