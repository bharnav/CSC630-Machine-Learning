Once a Kingdom of Fire
Now a Graveyard of Empires
Headstones line the rows
To mark dreams gone astray

The ones who believe
The ones who were trusted
One by one, they fall victim
In the wake of decay

They captured the creators
And harnessed the fire
Built up their armies
And took over the field

But for all good intentions
Their greed became rampant
And it poisoned the leaders
Their true nature revealed

Locked on a path
Of waste and self-destruction
They silenced the voices
Of the creators they enslaved

They dampened the fire
And they buried the bodies
But they were powerless to
Hold the souls down in the graves

A new breed will stand up
And rise from the ashes
Take back the fire and
Fan the flames to new heights

Change, evolution
A progressive solution
A band of fringe outlaws
Will take over the fight

A revolution is building
As the empires crumbles
The warriors and the fighters
Will be last to survive

We wake up to a new day
Where complacency falters
And in this field of dead empires
It feels good to be alive
