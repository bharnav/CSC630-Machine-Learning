We start to run before we crawl
Run until we fall...

Well, take a piece of me, take my eyes
Throw me down and watch me go blind

But if you see through eyes like mine
Look past the pain, the memories
The hollow world you keep inside
So we can rise again

We know how it feels to be numb inside and underwater (Breath out, breath out, breath out!)
Know now the enemy is alive and undercover (Breath out, breath out!)

Well, make peace with me, free my mind
And wrap my head around this life and realize

But if you see through eyes like mine
Look past the pain, the memories
The hollow world you keep inside
So we can rise again

We know how it feels to be numb inside and underwater (Breath out, breath out, breath out!)
Know now the enemy is alive and undercover (Breath out, breath out!)

Run before we crawl
Run until we fall...

But if you see through eyes like mine
Look past the pain, the memories
The hollow world you keep inside
So we can rise again

We know how it feels to be numb inside and underwater (Breath out, breath out, breath out!)
Know now the enemy is alive and undercover (Breath out, breath out!)
Know how it feels to be numb inside and underwater (Breath out, breath out, breath out!)
Know now the enemy is alive and undercover (Breath out, breath out!)

To run before we crawl...
Run until we fall...
