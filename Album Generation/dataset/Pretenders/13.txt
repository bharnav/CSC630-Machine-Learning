This is a mercy mission
From a faceless messenger who don't want to see you hit
Here's the word
Listen to it
Somebody you used to know is back in town
You better go
This is a mercy mission
A voice you'll never hear again
From a southside callbox
Winged demons are the hardest to outfox
The same one you lost on the run
Is gonna show you how to have some fun
You better get out of town cause you're gonna get hit
This is mercy mission
You'll find your schedule underneath the door
All the arrangements have been made
Major expenses have been paid as you know
Dont forget the last details
Accept no parcels in the mail
