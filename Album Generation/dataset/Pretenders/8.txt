Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me;
Getting tired of your theatrics, your acting is a drag
It's okay on T.V. 'cause you can turn it off
But don't try me
Yes your marriage is a tragedy but it's not my concern
I'm very superficial I hate anything official
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death
You've made a desperate appeal now save your breath
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret shit that's so
Wet
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
You ask me for my advice I say, 'Use the door.'
You're still clinging to somebody you deplore
And you want to use me for emotional blackmail
I just feel pity when you lie and contempt when you cry
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
Private life, private life, leave me out
Private life, drama baby leave me out
