Mystery achievement
Don't breathe down my neck no
I got no trophies on display
I sign them away
I mean what the heck
All of your promises
Dont fill me with pride no
I just want to get out on the floor
And do the Cuban Slide Slide Slide Slide

Chorus:
Everyday every night time I find
Mystery achievement
You're on my mind on my mind on my mind
Everyday every night time I feel
Mystery achievement
You're so unreal

Mystery achievement
Where's my sandy beach yeah
I have my dreams like everybody else
But they're out of reach
I said right out of reach
I try to ignore you
Your demands are unending yeah
I got no tears on my ice cream
But you know me: I love pretending

Repeat chorus
