Cuban Slide

Remember the nights i cried
You were doing that old cuban slide
All night I tried and tried
I could not master the cuban side

R'member the night I started to weep?
Under lights you did the 'creep'
That night I could not sleep
Oh lord how goes the creep?

Chorus:
AIy YI AIy Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me
AIy YI YI AIy- I wanna dance would someone help me
AIy YI YI Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me
AIy AIy Ya-

Last night I could not talk

On the street you did the Charing Cross walk
Up and down I swoop and stalk
Only I can run, but I can't walk

Chorus

(Breakdown)

Remember the nights i cried
You were doing that old cuban slide
All night I tried and tried
I could not master the cuban side

AIy YI AIy Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me
AIy YI YI AIy- I wanna dance would someone help me
AIy YI YI Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me
AIy AIy Ya-

Now Dance!
