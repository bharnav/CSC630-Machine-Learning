Hold tight
One day morning
Wake up yawning
Break an egg
Bust my head
Maybe it's a warning

Ring on the bell
Says it's half past eight
Keys in my tea
Hey, I'm gonna be late

I'm walking on the pavement
Skipping on the lines
So the bears won't eat me
Send me to the salt mines
Get on the bus
But the bus don't start

My feet are sitting down
My head on the tire
I can't open the window
Cause there ain't no sun
I think somebody's telling me to get out of London

My feet's keep moving
And I don't wear any socks
Can't stop singing
Head ting a linging

I like my housetop
I think I hit a phone box
Making coffins out of bits of no woods

Selling tea to the council
Though I know it's no good to be a trader
Collaborator
Sill I rather be a snitch
Than a cocktail waiter

Commit my crime now
While I'm on my probation later
Okay
All right

I know I'm doing wrong
But save it till tomorrow
Cause I get out of London

Last night, I left my car keys
I settled in to revers in a night
Of wed and bliss
I had a bee in my body tiger in my tan
I was on my maiden voyage
Spent my night with a saint

They call me jack of hearts
Did some one say a name
My mother was the queen of tarts
My baby was a head slave
Parts selling records to the red manufacturer

I do myself in public
Just to get on the action
Turn to my face
See my race is run
My car's on fire
Got to get out of London

Oh
You don't wear a suit
Don't wear a smile
Don't wear my spikes
Said I only go the mile

Keep my hand on my nine
My eye on my mind
Keep my heat at feet
When I'm racing

To the front line change
Bangs racing on the bits of afar
So I rock my body to the sound of the box
The louder you scream
The faster we go

It's an act of battery
A boom, boom, boom hands
Still fluttering
Coming down soon
Head banger

Judge
Thug
Night of fun
Slide on my knees
I got to get out of London park

Straight as a crow
Waiting for my treasure at the lottery
Blues in my pockets
Rain on the fair
The weighs are building blacks
On a bit of an air

Facin' a photo a beauty
Is there tears on her cheek?
She's living a nightmare
Turn the page
To a brand new leaf resolute

Psycho dude
Time to be A Z
Okay
We do this tons of times
Keep out of sync
Singing get out of London

Everybody in the lines
Stuck waiting for the tube
Beg like a puppy dog
Raise like a hedgehog
When you come here

Let me tell you the truth
Tell you a wonder why
They make us look

Good party for my friends
So they wouldn't be lonely
They wouldn't let me in
Said it's membership only

Don't worry 'bout me
Cause I'm doing fine standing on my head
And sitting on a door mine
We get crazy three times a day
I got to get out of London
