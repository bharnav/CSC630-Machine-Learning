I like the way you cross the street
Cause you're precious
Moving through the Cleveland heat
How precious
You're taking nights and all the kicks
You're so precious
But you know I was shittin' bricks
Cause I'm precious

[Chorus]
Make me wanna
Make me wanna
Maybe make it
Ooh, you're so mean

East 55th and Euclid Avenue
Was real precious
Hotel Sterling comin' into view
How precious
It's a pity that you bruised my hip
Cause I'm precious
You shouldn't have let your manners slip
You're too precious

[Chorus]
Make me wanna
Make me wanna
Maybe make it
Ooh, you're so mean

We were bound, bound, bound, bound to show it
We was a duet, duet, duet, duet on the pavement
Maybe, maybe I'm going to have a baby
We was a duet—do it all night

I was feeling kind of ethereal
Cause I'm precious
I got my eye on your Imperial
You're so precious
Now, Howard the Duck and Mister Stress both stayed
Precious
Trapped in a world that they never made
But not me, baby—I'm too precious
I had to fuck off!
