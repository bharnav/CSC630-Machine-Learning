I've always been the one who waits for something good
I leave it all to fate
Never seem to take a chance, even when I know I should
I always hesitate
And I tell myself
I'll get it right in time

Oh oh oh oh oh
Throw your hands up and let it go
Anything to make it better
You give a little heart, give a little soul
All you have is now or never
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go

I've always been the one who wants a little bit more
The last with the least
I never know what I got till it's out the door
And out of reach
And I tell myself
I'll get it right in time

Oh oh oh oh oh
Throw your hands up and let it go
Anything to make it better
You give a little heart, give a little soul
All you have is now or never
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go

I keep an open mind
Whatever's there for me to find
Hoping that something's gonna give
I'm hoping that something's gonna give

I tell myself
I'll get it right, I'll get it right

Oh oh oh oh oh
Throw your hands up and let it go
Anything to make it better
You give a little heart, give a little soul
All you have is now or never
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go
Throw your hands up and let it go
Let it go

I tell myself
I tell myself
I tell myself
I'll get it right, I'll get it right, I'll get it right, I'll get it right
I tell myself
I'll get it right this time
