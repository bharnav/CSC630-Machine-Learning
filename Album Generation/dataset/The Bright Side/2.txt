All I do is think of you
And how you make me feel brand new
Like a pair of shoes that fit my feet just right
I wanna wear you out tonight

And they say that you're not for me
But they don't know you like I do
They say that we'll never make it
But they don't know how it goes
When the doors close

All I do is dream of how
We can leave it all behind
Paris, France or to the moon
We'll leave it all behind

But they say that you're not for me
But they don't know you like I do
They say that we'll never make it
But they don't know how it goes
When the doors close

When the doors close

They say that you're not for me
They don't know you like I do
They say that we'll never make it
But they don't know how it goes
When the doors close

They say that you're not for me
They don't know you like I do
They say that we'll never make it
But they don't know how it goes
