He was a boy that wasn't very nice
He was a boy who wasn't very very nice

He told me that I wasn't very nice
He told me that I wasn't very very nice

And I wonder to myself
I wonder to myself
I wonder to my, wonder to myself

I was a girl with big big dreams
I was a girl with very very big dreams

He was a boy who didn't need many things
He was a boy who didn't need too many things

La da da di da

I am afraid of being alone
I am afraid that I can't call him my own

He is afraid that I'll be gone
He is afraid that I will be gone

And I wonder too, I wonder too
I wonder too, I wonder too
I wonder too, I wonder too
I wonder too

He wonder too, he wonder too
He wonder too, he wonder too
He wonder too, he wonder too

I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I"m on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I"m on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I'm gonna call it a day

(I wonder to myself)
La da da di da

I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I said I'm on my way
I'm gonna call it a day
I'm gonna call it a day
