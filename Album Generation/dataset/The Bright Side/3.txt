I think I'm thinking too much
Is this what happens when you're falling in love?
I know I should let it be
This isn't how I am usually

But I'm losing sleep
Going over possibilities
I'm scared that I'm not what you need
I think I'm thinking too much

So long I've been waiting
For something to turn out right
Is it so wrong to be this easy?
I never thought that I could be without a fight

Ooh, I'm in love with you
What am I to do?

I think I'm thinking too much
Is this what happens when you're falling in love?
I know I should let it be
This isn't how I am usually

But I'm losing sleep
Going over possibilities
I'm scared that I'm not what you need
I think I'm thinking too much

It's so good to be this happy
I should be dreaming every night
But instead, I toss and turn in my bed
I'm restless every night

Ooh, I'm in love with you
What am I to do?

I think I'm thinking too much
Is this what happens when you're falling in love?
I know I should let it be
This isn't how I am usually

But I'm losing sleep
Going over possibilities
I'm scared that I'm not what you need
I think I'm thinking too much
