I must confess, when I wear this dress
I feel like dancing the whole night with you
And when I do, doo doo doo doo doo
I feel so happy, I'm stuck on you

'Cause you are the one I could see having fun with
Not just for the night, but for the rest of my life
You are the one I could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life

Doo doo doo

You are so dreamy, feel like I'm in the movies
I feel so happy, I'm stuck on you

'Cause you are the one I could see having fun with
Not just for the night, but for the rest of my life
You are the one I could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life

Doo doo doo
I'm stuck on you

'Cause you are the one I could see having fun with
Not just for the night, but for the rest of my life

You are the one I could see having fun with
Not just for the night, but for the rest of my life
You are the one I could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life

Doo doo doo
