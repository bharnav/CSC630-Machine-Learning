Look what you've done
Look what you have become
You're a puppet, a fool, and a thief
With my eyes closed
'Cause that's how it goes
Everyone knew it but me

You're a good looking loser
And I'm the one who got away

With my eyes full of tears
And my hands with two beers
I'm as sorry as I am ashamed
Should have been smarter
Should have tried harder
Should have been quick to your game

You're a good looking loser
And I'm the one who got away
Nobody said it'd be different this time
Maybe you're all the same

And I had my doubts
But I threw them all out
I had faith
That there would be no price to pay

You're a good looking loser
And I'm the one who got away

Yeah I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who got away
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who got away
Yeah I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who got away

You're a good looking loser
And I will do what I have to do
