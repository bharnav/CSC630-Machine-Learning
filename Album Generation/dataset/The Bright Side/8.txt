You don't know who
You're dealing with, do you
With your perfect hair, little jezebel
Without a thing to do

I heard your voice
When you thought I left the room
I heard you say
I couldn't never compare to you
Well I got a secret
That I can't keep

I had a long talk with your baby
In my back seat
And he was real, real sweet
Yeah, he was real, real sweet

Play your cards right
And get out of my life
'Cause we both know
I'm not the quiet type

Yeah, I got a secret that
That I can't keep
Every time he left you
I was waiting down the street
And he was real, real sweet
Yeah, he was real, real sweet

But you'll never know, you'll never know
The truth
No no no you will never know the truth
Will you

I got a secret that I can't keep
I know that he loves you
But he's in love with me
And it goes real, real deep
Yeah, it goes real, real deep

But you'll never know, you'll never know
The truth
No no no you will never know the truth
Will you
