When I'm laying down in bed
I write you letters in my head
Of all the things I haven't said to you
I'll be your lover, I'll be your wife
I'm in the kitchen baking pies
I wanna have that kind of life with you

When you get home at night
I'll have the house just right

I'm not sorry for saying that I want you
For waiting naked in my bed all day
And I'm not sorry for saying that I need you
To come and make a woman out of me
I'm not sorry

I hope it won't scare you away
I wanna have your kids someday
They'd all have dimples on their face like you
And when you're old or bald or grey
I'm gonna love your wrinkly face
Nobody else could love you like I do

When you get home at night
I'll have your crown and sprite

I'm not sorry for saying that I want you
For waiting naked in my bed all day
And I'm not sorry for saying that I need you
To come and make a woman out of me
I'm not sorry

I never thought I could feel like this
Everything changed from just one kiss
The single life I wouldn't miss if I'm with you

I'm not sorry for saying that I want you
For waiting naked in my bed all day
And I'm not sorry for saying that I need you
To come and make a woman out of me

I'm not sorry for saying that I want you
For waiting naked in my bed all day
And I'm not sorry for saying that I need you
So come and make a woman out of me
I'm not sorry
