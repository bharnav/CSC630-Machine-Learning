Lie to me
I don't want to know your history
I don't want to know a single thing
Please lie to me

Say you'll stay
Even if you plan to go away
I know you'll come back another day
Please lie to me

Check all of the above
I'm deaf, dumb, and blindly in love
I just can't get enough
Please lie to me

Make me believe
I'm the only one you've ever loved
I'm the only one you'll ever touch
Please lie to me

And say you'll stay
Even if you plan to go away
I know you'll come back another day
Please lie to me

Check all of the above
I'm deaf, dumb, and blindly in love
I just can't get enough
Please lie to me

Check all of the above
Everything's not black and white
I'm in between the dark and light
So lie to me

Check all of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
Please lie to me

Check all of the above
If everything's not Xs and Os
I'd rather never know
Please lie to me

Check all of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
All of the above
Please lie to me
