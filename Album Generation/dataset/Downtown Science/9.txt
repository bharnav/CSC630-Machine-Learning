Soft and warm a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn, break of dawn
A power source of tender force generatin', radiatin'
Turn me on, turn them onYou short-circuit all my nerves
Promising electric things
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow ringsQuiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, blow babyWindy sigh, weaken my
Butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm better free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your somber rainShower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stopQuiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my lifeShower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stopQuiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Blow baby, blow baby
