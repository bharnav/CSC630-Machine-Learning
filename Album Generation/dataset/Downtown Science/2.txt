Did you see the lights
As they fell all around you
Did you hear the music
Serenade from the starsWake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our ownWhoa, whoa
IiiiiiiiiiDid you feel the wind
As it blew all around you
Did you feel the love
That was in the airWake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our ownWhoa, whoa
IiiiiiiiiiThe sun comes up
And it shines all around you
You're lost in space
And the earth is your ownWhoa, whoa
Whoa
