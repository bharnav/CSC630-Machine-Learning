[Verse 1]
Those boon times went bust
My feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted
It's just rust
And that signature thing
That used to bring a following
I have trouble now
Even remembering

[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard
Late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it

[Verse 2]
I knew that to keep in touch
Would do me deep in dutch
Cause it isn't the rush of remembering
It's just mush
And that signature thing
Is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now
To keep from following

[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard
Late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it

[Verse 1]
Those boon times went bust
My feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted
It's just rust
And that signature thing
That used to bring a following
I have trouble now
Even remembering

[Modified Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard
Late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry, to quit
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it
