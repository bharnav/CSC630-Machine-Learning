It's a kick in the teeth
Can make it hard to smile
I'm turning to a dirty dastard style
What... there ain't no use in crying

So I just keep on trying
And the heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head around what you want
Oh yeah

Killing time waiting for tomorrow
Well I can't sleep take my pills of sorrow
Well I don't ...
...

Well I just keep on trying
And the heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head round what you
What you want

Well kicking teeth
Broken glass went flying
It's a fucking cheek, a bloody mouth, don't mind it
You cut me down but there ain't no use in crying

So I just keep on trying
The heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head round what you
Oh, what you want

What you want
Don't know what you want
What you want
Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
