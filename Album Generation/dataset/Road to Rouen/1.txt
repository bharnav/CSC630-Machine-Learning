[Verse 1]
Before the time of the morning sandman
I can find my way around
Soon be here at the borderline, I guess
Armageddon coming down

[Pre-Chorus]
And here lies a pretty state again
It's time to make a move on

[Chorus]
'Cause in three days, I'll be out of here
And it's not a day too soon

[Verse 2]
Firelight, the light of love, burns
Turns to ashes in your hand
So to bed by the morning light, I guess
And I'm awake and understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Set sail for St. Petersburg
Making use of my time

[Chorus]
'Cause in three days, I'll be out of here
And it's not a day too soon

[Verse 3]
Head out to a better life
I can get a job, settle down
I'm full of love, of a full of feeling
I can't stand the here and now

[Pre-Chorus]
We leave town for pity's sake, you know
It's time to make a move on

[Chorus/Outro]
'Cause in three days, I'll be out of here
And it's not a day too soon
Yeah, three days, I'll be out of here
And it's not a day too soon
