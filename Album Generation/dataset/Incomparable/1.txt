You are pushing my patience, so there's no know
I'm sick and tired of being denied all by you
Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me

'Cause what you see is real and true
You can't take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can't take that away from me
Won't let it slip away
Witnessed too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

I will do nothing to break down what I've built up
I will do whatever it takes to make this stop
Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me

I won't let it go

'Cause what you see is real and true
You can't take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can't take that away from me
Won't let it slip away
Witnessed too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

You see things from a different point of view
Why should I listen?
Why should I let you in?
Why should I even trust you?
We are like two different worlds apart
Won't let you in, always wait for remain
Why should I even trust you

Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me (burning me)

I won't let it go

'Cause what you see is real and true
You can't take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can't take that away from me
Won't let it slip away
Witnessed too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

Real and true
