There are things that I need to say
So hear me
Please don't take this the wrong way
Hey, I don't wanna make this harder, no I don't wanna complicate
This is keeping me awake

(Yeah)
Standing at the crossroads now
And we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there
(Yeah)
Need to close that door
We've been here before
Now there's nothing left worth saving there

I hear you
Maybe we are not indestructible
I know that we can be more if we let it go
I know that we can be so much better, girl
If we make the right choice now
We don't need to look back

(Yeah)
Standing at the crossroads now
And we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there
(Yeah)
Need to close that door
We've been here before
Now there's nothing left worth saving there

'Cause you're breaking me, shaking me
You're taking me over
We were love drunk and we sunk
We need to get sober
Before we fall over

Standing at the crossroads now
And we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there
Standing at the crossroads now
And we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there
Need to close that door
We've been here before
Now there's nothing left worth saving there
