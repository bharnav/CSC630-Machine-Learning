YEAH, yeah

You feel the grass is always greener
And the tears I left behind
To know I can take my freedom
And my heart isn't next to line
With you the sun is always rising
When im with you it's never dark
With you the grounds are free from raining
With you my life doesn't fall apart

Yeah

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind
I am missing you, more than yesterday, I am missing you

YEAH

We'll live a life filled with melodies
Now the stories is my defriend
When we fly free from promises
I try to smile but I can't pretend, no

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words

Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind
I am missing you, more than yesterday
I am missing you, more than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday

The sun is not getting lighter than yesterday
As I ever get further from yesterday
Can see the echo is closer, than yesterday
As I ever get further from yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind
I am missing you, more than yesterday
I am missing you, more than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday
More than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday), yesterday
