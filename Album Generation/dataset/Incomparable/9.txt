You should know
You should know

Don't tell me to
Let go the past...
Cause it's all I got
Throwing away too fast
Memories will last

Full of love and apologies
Trying to go on with a broken heart
I thought it through like a thousand times
What went wrong
What went wrong

I am trying so hard...
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here
Want you to know!
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But Without you here
Cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here...

Don't tell me to...
To let go of you
It hurts in me
Say that it's not too late
That it's just a dream
For in my mind I'm soaring
Trying to go on with a broken heart
Can we closure inside of this story
What went wrong
What went wrong

I am trying so hard...
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here
Want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But Without you here
Cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here...

All the memories still remain
I've taken them again and again
My abilities of restraint
Taking without you in the pain

Want you to know...
Thought you should know...

(I am trying so hard)
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you near
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you near
Want you to know
Try to breathe (try to breathe), try to sleep (try to sleep), try to feel But Without you here
Cannot breathe (cannot breathe), cannot sleep (cannot sleep), cannot feel
Not without you here...
