I would carry the world
I would stand here and burn

You are
Incomparable
You are
Irresistable
You are
Incomparable
You are
Unmistakable

I would catch if you fall
I'd take a spit through my heart

You are
Incomparable
You are
Irresistable
You are
Incomparable
You are
Unmistakable

No hurricane can move me
Earthquakes can't shake me
I will always stand my ground
Always be around
No snowstorm can freeze me
Black holes can't take me
I will always stand my ground
Always be around

You are
Incomparable
You are
Irresistable
You are
Incomparable
Incomparable
Unmistakable

No hurricane can move me
Earthquakes can't shake me
I will always stand my ground
Always be around
No snowstorm can freeze me
Black holes can't take me
I will always stand my ground
Always be around
