As an agent of life, I have practiced myself
So much regrets, so much failure
But to you it only feels like Im a distance, its about to hurt!

Lost in time, feels like I am fading
All of us, is nothing, Im lost within, Im trapped inside me
My past is staring at me; I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away!

I feel so hard, so much left to see, I lose my life, in vain

As soon as I burn it down, we threw a black coat
That goes to show to mean theres no tomorrow
Well all be done, with these questions, according to my end!

Lost in time, feels like Im fading
All of us, is nothing, Im lost within, Im trapped inside me
My past is staring at me; I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away!

I feel so hard, so much left to see, I lose my life, in vain

Lost in time, feels like Im fading
All of us, is nothing, Im lost within, Im trapped inside me
My past is staring at me; I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away, awake myself
I am lost, so far away!!

I feel so hard, so much left to see, I lose my life, in vain!
