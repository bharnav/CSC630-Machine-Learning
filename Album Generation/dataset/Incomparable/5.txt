Jimmie
Don't try to run, we're alone in this war
Our thoughts will be futile, progressing bit by bit
As I'm fighting to kill it
Replace all my frustration, with you, inspiration was reclaimed
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Zandro: Evil's on my left, good is on my right
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Zandro:Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

For what, listen to me, now I am crying it out
Trying to fight again inside, now I am screaming it out
Replace all my frustration, with you, inspiration was reclaimed
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Zandro: Evil's on my left, good is on my right
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Zandro:Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

I am trying to figure it out why I'm bleeding
No one will ever understand me, it's like I'm two faced
Understand me, it's like I'm two faced
Understand me

Zandro: Evil's on my left, good is on my right
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Zandro:Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
Jimmie: It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
