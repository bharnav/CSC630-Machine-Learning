[instrument break]
[Verse 1]
I've been running all night long
And the pulse is pounding in my chest
Now I am here
There are feelings that I just must express
[Chorus]
Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
Open for me
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
[Verse 2]
Gotta get this out my system
I've gathered my strength
Ripped my blindfold off I'm ready now
I have stayed in the dark with my mind switched off
[Chorus]
Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
Open for me (Open for me)
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna be
Out here on my own
I don't wanna be
Outside in the cold
I don't wanna be
Completely alone
I just wanna be
Right where I belong
[Bridge]
Open for me
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
[Chorus]
Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Don't say it's too late
Open for me!
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say!
Don't say it's too late
