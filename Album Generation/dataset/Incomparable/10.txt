When you wake up (wake up, wake up)
When you wake up (wake up, wake up)

I can see your hurt, See your sorry
I know the face, I know the story
When hope is fading out, You can trust me I'll be there
When pain is screaming loud, I'll

I'm awake, To be watching over you
Don't you worry, I'm never taking my eyes off of you
Fall asleep now, I will be there when you wake up
Don't you worry, I will be there
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you wake up

Try to forget, Try to forgive
(Hey)
Try to move on, Try to live
When hope is fading out, You can turn to me and say
This is more than I can possibly take
I'm awake, To be watching over you
I'm awake, I'm never taking my eyes off of you
Fall asleep now, I will be there when you wake up
When you wake up

Keep fighting every day
It takes a lot of time
It's only in your mind
Keep fighting every day
Look inside yourself, be strong
Because from here it won't take long
Until you wake up
Until you wake up
Until you wake up, hey

I'm awake, to be watching over you
I'm awake, I'm never taking my eyes off of you
Fall asleep now, I will be there when you wake up
Don't you worry, I will be there
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you wake up
When you wake up
