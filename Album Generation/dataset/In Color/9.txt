[Chorus]
Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
Ooh, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

[Verse 1]
Home in one month
Couldn't feel better if I tried
Won't even write
It's better that'll be a surprise

I can't expect to be a household word
I don't mind, just let me inside
I don't expect to be seen or heard
I won't mind, I've nothin' to hide

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Ooh, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

[Verse 2]
Home in one week
Gettin' so much closer all the time
Seems like overnight
It's better that'll be a surprise

We shouldn't get to be too close friends
I don't mind, I've nothin' to hide
We couldn't get to be too close friends
You won't mind if you've nothin' to hide

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Ooh, I hope everyone missed you
You know they want you to stay

[Bridge]
Don't stop to think what you're doin'
I'll surprise you everytime
Don't stop to do what you're thinkin'
You're just wastin' your time

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's so good to see you
I couldn't wait another day
So good to see you
Oo, I hope everyone missed you
I really want you to stay
