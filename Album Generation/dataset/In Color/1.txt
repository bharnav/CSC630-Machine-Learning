[Verse 1]
It's not the way you look, no
It's not the way you walk
Your eyes are somethin' good
You know they're clear and bright
It's not the color of your hair

[Chorus]
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those big eyes
They keep calling my name
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

[Verse 2]
You're such a losing cause
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause
Go on, get out of here

[Chorus]
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

[Verse 3]
You're such a losing cause
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause
Go on, get out of here

[Verse 1]
It's not the way you look
It's not the way you walk
Your eyes are somethin' good
You know they're clear and bright
It's not the color of your hair

[Chorus]
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

Big Eyes
