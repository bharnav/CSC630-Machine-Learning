[Verse 1]
We are the expatriated
Our fate cards have played us
Neighbors displaced us
We’ve seen that these demographics are targets
Shot down by the market

[Chorus]
I’ve felt the wrath of the greedy
Now complete with more yellow monsters
I’ve seen the needs of a city completely ignored
Surrounded by vultures

[Verse 2]
We are the sons and the daughters
Expecting betrayal
Neglecting our pleasures
We know your plans don’t include us
That’s why we’ve made our own

[Chorus]
I’ve felt the wrath of the greedy
Now complete with more yellow monsters
I’ve seen the needs of a city completely ignored
Surrounded by vultures
Destroying their culture

[Break]
Insatiable their appetite
The gluttons who consumed their way to the top

[Verse 3]
We are the expatriated
Our fate cards have played us
Neighbors displaced us
We’ve seen that these demographics are targets
Shot down by the market

[Chorus]
I’ve felt the wrath of the greedy
Now complete with more yellow monsters
I’ve seen the needs of a city completely ignored
Surrounded by vultures
Destroying their culture
