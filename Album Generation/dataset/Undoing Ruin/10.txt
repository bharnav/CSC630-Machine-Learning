This decaying flesh is coming back to life
Reanimate me
Give me a chance and I'll be right here where the sun hits the sea
Watching these waves wash the pain away
And it will radiate so brilliantly that we can keep pushing on and get on with life
Cause we deserve it
Now I know that the worst is behind us now onward and upward
We take flight on bruised and battered wings
We soar above our clouded thoughts
Never looking back
We can regain a sense of balance that's been gone so long
Give me a chance to reason with the odds
To pick myself back up
Regain a balance gone so long
