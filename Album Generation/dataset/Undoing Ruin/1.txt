[Intro]
It’s been a long night
Waiting to sleep the day away
And it's been a long time coming
Along with me every step of the way

[Chorus]
The confinement binds you
And nothing scares me, nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me, nothing kills me
The confinement binds you
And nothing scares me, nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me, nothing can kill me

[Post-Chorus]
The stagnant time
Is a breeding ground for regrets and wrongdoings
And resolutions take their time
That's if they even come at all-

[Bridge]
-ways seeking redemption
Through the echoes I’ve listened
And still came up missing
And always seeking redemption
And through the echoes I’ve listened
And seeped through the cracks

[Pre-Chorus]
The stagnant time
Is a breeding ground for regrets and wrongdoings
And resolutions take their time
That's if they even come at all

[Chorus]
The confinement binds you
And nothing scares me, nothing thrills me
I’ve fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me, nothing kills me
The confinement binds you
And nothing scares me, nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me, nothing can kill me

[Outro]
These wounds will heal
Nothing can stop me now
Said, these wounds will heal
Nothing can stop me now
These wounds will heal
These wounds will heal
These wounds will heal
Oh...
