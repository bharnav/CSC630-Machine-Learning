My heart's been racing with my mind to the finish line of these fevered times
Stuck down again
This turbulence has overcome
Tranquility pounding the walls inside these thoughts
I can't control and shooting through my veins
These heightened senses overwhelming
Confusion replaces clarity
A neurotic rearrangement
You know the feeling when down feels up to
It's old tricks again
So misleading when it hits like a ton of bricks to the chest
Out of breath on the bathroom floor
And I'll make light of this night and night of this day
It's what I tell myself to sleep when I dream myself awake
