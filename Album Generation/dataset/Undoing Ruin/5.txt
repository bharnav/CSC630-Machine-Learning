Injected venom sucking the life from us away for eighty days
It's white noise just white noise
Staying awake for the music's sake
They say they listen but never hear a thing
Mass deception illusion deception
We say they listen to white noise
Can this really be our time
Are we found to find the line
Disillusion me again
Can we really be the only ones who see this charade
The meaning is fleeting
All these egos competing
Searching for an identity through the series of misleading
Disillusion me again
