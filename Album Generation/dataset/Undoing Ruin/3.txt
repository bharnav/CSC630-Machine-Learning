This moment marks the severing of senses comatose distinctions
The gathering of flies on a irrational mind filled with broken conviction
I've seen how lies take form in your eyes
Your suspicious ways followed a hollow gaze
You fucking left me to rot
But one day you'll see first hand how I've paid for your biggest mistake
Sound the surrender
Embraced in vain
What will you gain from this
What will you lose
Secrets hidden behind your back
Your silence it serenades deceit
Secrets hidden behind your back
Your forever ideal fantasy
Sound the surrender
You have gained all
You could from this
Sound the surrender
But you've lost only one
