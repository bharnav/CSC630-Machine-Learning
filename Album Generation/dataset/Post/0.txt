I miss my chick
Yeah, I miss my chick
I miss her lips
And the way she kiss

I can see her face stand over me
But she ain't there man, don't you see
But I just got off the phone
And she miss me

I miss my chick, don't you see

I miss my chick
And I miss her hips
And her big beautifull eyes, and her ass
And I miss her tits

This may come as no surprise
But I... I miss her smooth silky thighs
So give me no shit
I miss my chick

Like I said man: I miss my chick

I miss my chick
And I miss the way she kiss
And I see her face staring at me
But you know she ain't there
Man, don't you see

I miss my chick
I miss my chick
I miss her eyes, and her ass
And I miss her tits

I miss my chick
Yeah
And I miss my chick
Yeah
Yeah, baby, I miss you
Yeah, I miss my chick
Oohhh
I miss my chick

I'm coming home home, baby
I'm coming home to you
That's right
