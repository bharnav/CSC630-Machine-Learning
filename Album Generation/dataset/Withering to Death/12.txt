- To you, in the navy blue sea -
I close my eyelids as I know I am alive
Slowly I throw up Life is white
No one can come into my frozen heart

- I pray to you in the navy blue sea -
You are weak But stay as you are
Can you hear? My rusty voice cries out to you
Can't make it into words But I just want to feel you

Now

Tomorrow
Deeper then the deep sea that I can't see deeper deeper deeper I sleep tomorrow

Deep blue
The things I can't forget are too painful
Deep blue
What voice, what words will you use to talk to me

- In the navy blue sea, the tears mix in -
No one notices the reason for crying
So the life can't be saved, feel life
Even just for a moment, please live

Deeper than the deep sea that I can't see deeper deeper deeper you sleep

Deep blue
Just realizing that I am getting used to getting hurt
Deep blue
When the seasons comes and winter sleeps, I will

Come visit with flowers
