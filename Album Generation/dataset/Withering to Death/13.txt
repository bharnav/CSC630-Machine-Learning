The sadness on the face will probably be gone tomorrow
When did my eyes become dead?

What is waiting for me tomorrow as I sing and live without meaning?
Alone in my room as my heartbeat screams
Don't kid yourself and don't fool yourself

I am addicted to the perceived fate
I am alone I linger on to this fate
Don't kid yourself don't wound yourself

The unstoppable rain The unstoppable sound The unstoppable scar
The unstoppable love The unstoppable song...
I can't stop it anymore
I can't handle it anymore

Kill the voice Close your eyes Drown in the darkness Roam around
I won't depend on anyone anymore
Kill the voice Close your eyes Drown in the darkness Roam around
I keep inside me your keen voice...
All in darkness

It's such an irony this sunny bright weather
- Good Morning -
