I have lived in restrict I want to disappear more then to forget
I laugh back at people like you, who act like you understand

You people just live on laughing, saying something good will happen tomorrow
There was always something different about you
And me and
The way you talk from the beginning

It's not unusual anymore to get hurt by you

Just wishing it wasn't real is my only negative way to escape...

Ash to ash
I am just garbage with an umbrella So give me my dream
I am used to hiding underneath the umbrella So I want you for me
Can you hear me?
