A classic phrase, he's trying to find out
A gnarly face, whatever there's to doubt

I'm not immune, words come out but not in tune for you
I'm not immune, you are barking all too soon at me

A rolling line for me to turn away
And what is fine with being what you say

I'm not immune, words come out but not in tune for you
I'm not immune, you are barking all too soon at me

A classic face again, a gnarly frase pretend
Wants me to turn away, but I'm not what you say....

I'm not immune, words come out but not in tune for you
I'm not immune, you are barking all too soon at me
