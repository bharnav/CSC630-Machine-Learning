When in your condition you don't get much done
When in your position it can't be all that fun
The more you give, the more they take
The question can get down You cannot leave
You cannot pretend They preach and feel in one

You're going underground
You hide away from all attacks
You're nowhere to be found
But soon I'll bet you will stray back
You're going underground
Everybody wants you just to lose track
You're nowhere to be found
Until the day that I know you'll struggle back

Dead ‘cuz yours days can’t keep you in shape
To the world that go to skate but you’re just another ape
The lies that you are making up seem sweet atleast at first
But soon they'll know you faked it all and then your bubble'll burst

You're going underground
You're running away from heartattack
You're nowhere to be found
But soon I'll bet you will stray back
You're going underground
Everybody wants you just to lose but
You're nowhere to be found
Until the day that I know you'll struggle back

Well, if you can't solve your problems, got to make things happen
You gotta take the bull by the horns
Every can't kill the bet they need to have fun

You're going underground
You're running away from heartattack
You're nowhere to be found
But soon I'll bet you will stray back
You're going underground
Everybody wants you just to lose but
You're nowhere to be found
Until the day that I know you'll struggle back
