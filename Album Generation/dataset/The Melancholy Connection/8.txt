Somebody told me I should get a normal job
If I don't quit the band I have I'll end up as a slob
But I'm not listening to no-one
Especially not the people who aren't happy with their lives
And yet they preach
Well this is who I am and what I really wanna do
Yeah I do respect you hope you will respect me too
Ready to go on with my life, know it's all me
I realise it now, I'm sure my life was free, I realise it now

Somebody told me that I dream my life away
If I don't start to live like him I'll end up being ashamed
But I won't fall, I'll never leaving
More important than this, I should be following just in me, go my own way
Well this is who I am and what I'm truly standing for
Figure out the answers by myself and I'm quite sure
Working to whatever that I want it's all me
I realise it now, I'm sure my life was free, I realise it now

This is a beginning
Yeah I know it never ends
Life's too short for you to doubt
There is always someway out
Try your own way you will see
How much sweeter life can be
Life's too short for you to doubt
There is always someway out
Try your own way you will see
How much sweeter life can be
