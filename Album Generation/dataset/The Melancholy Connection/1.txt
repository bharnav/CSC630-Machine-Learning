You came out from nowhere
And left me behind in time
You change my mind
The days pass don't by
It was empty and dark in there
Are you free nowhere
Well I've got too change to pass this by
Come in the hours, ask him why
It's easy for you to promise
I'm gonna change my life
I wanna leave you today
When angels are coming my way
I'll be free when you're through
This time I'm gonna stand tall
There's a new where I hear time to get up and fight to go
When you're down and low
No time to feel changes embarrass this forget the past
It was never us
We all gotta change to pass this by
I'm gone change my life
I wanna leave you today
When angels are coming my way
I'll be free when you're through
This time I'm gonna stand tall
I'm gonna leave you today
Now I go my own way
So here we go again
With a feeling I'm gonna die today
Yeah the chances are growing if I stay
T-t-take me to another state of mind
When all angels will feel us left behind
I'm gonna leave you today
When angels are coming my way
I'll be free when you fall
I'm gonna change my life
