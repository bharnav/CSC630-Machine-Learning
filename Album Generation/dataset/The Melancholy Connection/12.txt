Yeah I'm a hopeless sinner
But now I smile
I found a way to spend all my money
Taking it day by day
At least I found a winner
It took a while
But now I'm set
For I'm a person honey
And everything's okay

Yeah when Bowmore's
Running through my veins
They can never hurt me in that state
I just bottle up and go
So no more troubles
No more pain
More then trouble bowmore is my faith
At least for now I think it's so

Even if I worry
I know a way to calm things down
Be my patient honey
Cause that's the only way
I guess I've got my filling
Oh how things work at 12 years old
And it makes me blurry
Yeah what more can I say?

Yeah when Bowmore's
Running through my veins
They can never hurt me in that state
I just bottle up and go
So no more troubles
No more pain
More then trouble bowmore is my faith
At least for now I think it's so

'Cuz I like it
Yes I do
Yes I like it
And you should too
But in the morning I'm not myself
No I can't look myself in the mirror
And in the morning I'm afraid
To look inside the mirror once again

Yellow bowmores
Running through my veins
They can never hurt me in that state
I just bottle up and go
So no more troubles
No more pain
More then trouble bowmore is my fade
At least for now I think it's so
