You only see the side I show
I'm lost here in between two different lives I know
I've locked myself inside I sleep
I can't get out, I'm in too deep
I need something to ease the pain
But still won't make me sane

I believe it now, words will come out easy
It's crystal clear so come and let me down
Into the maze, keep it nice and slow
It's my own space,... glow
Into the maze, where side ... green
I'll find myself (into someone hands?)

A hole inside I need to fill
The feelings block my mind
Why can't I get things real
I'm going down, I'm feeling weak
The lights are out, I'm feeling cheap
I can't believe myself, I'm fooling my own strength

So don't believe it now, 'till everything stops changing
It's crystal clear so come and let me down
Into the maze, keep it nice and slow
It's my own space, ... glow
Into the maze, where side... green
I'll find myself (into someone hands?)

All sad and ready you can see into my eyes
I know you believe it I can see right through your lies
I'm really trying to get out from this maze
I really need my space to get out of this maze
