Ratboy's masterplan
Ratboy's masterplan

What can I define for when the end worked out to be
Your hate goes bad with shame and sorrow
He says you have to stop and get yourself down on your knees
And if you know these things there will be no tomorrow

Now ratboy and his rivals looked irrational and I ran
What ever happened to the bad guy and his band
Now ratboy and his rivals
Gotta give me your masterplan

It's all about preparation how much no one knows
So what you got to do is cling to something real good
And if it doesn't work, well, than you're real good I suppose
You better watch your back when you're down in Kingwood

Now ratboy and his rivals looked irrational and I ran
What ever happened to the bad guy and his band
Now ratboy and his rivals
Gotta give me your masterplan

But everybody knows they, they looked irrational I ran
Yeah, ratboy and his rivals
Now that's what I call scam, they looked irrational and I ran
Now that's what I call scam

Now ratboy and his rivals looked irrational and I ran
What ever happened to the bad guy and his band
Now ratboy and his rivals
Gotta give me your masterplan

Now ratboy and his rivals
Gotta give me your masterplan
Ratboy's give me your masterplan
Ratboy's masterplan, ratboy's master
