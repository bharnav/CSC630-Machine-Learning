Design me a drug that will help you to act right
Just tell me how and you're stuck in the spotlight
You've gotta learn how to think before you act
I really need some more distance to react

Design me a lie that is harmless but still smart
I'll bet you'll buy it, it will soften your stone heart
Another stab in the back, but it's allright
I'm planning my revenge now and it's airtight

We're falling apart and I'm still dependent
Pretending we'll remain the same
Pretending we're still the same
Pretending we share the blame
But I know we should swallow our pride
And just try to avoid to collide

There's nothing to say, I'm here until it's gone
I'm where I belong now, I'm just hanging on
I never felt this really, maybe you will
Understand this life and it's big thrill
There's nothing to lose so come on just admit it
Surrender yourself or I know you will quit it
We're one in a hundred,It's over my head now
Won't bend under pressure and I can't understand how

We're falling apart and I'm still dependent
Pretending we'll remain the same
Pretending we're still the same
Pretending we share the blame
But I know we should swallow our pride
And just try to avoid to collide
