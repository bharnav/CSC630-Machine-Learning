When I was a hyper junior
I hated everything too slow
I did, I did it sooner
And on the to move to go
Now chillin' like a senior
Taking walks,and playing chess
I seemed at my ensign
With a bill to impress

I'm over 27
Not in long I'll be an antique
Wish I could erase 11
But I have matched my peak
My future is like a big scam
And down the road again
Guess its all downhill from where I am

Now I used to discourage
I used to frown
About thoughts about kids and marriage
And to settle down
Of course now I am closer
To the bingo hall
Already a proposal
But they're here to watch me fall

I'm over 27
Not in long I'll be an antique
Wish I was still like 7
But I have matched my peak
My future is like a big scam
And down the road again
Guess its all downhill from where I am
Guess its all downhill from where I am
Maybe ageing doesn't have to be bad
Choose my passion now it could be rad
Oh no the closer getting through me then
Maybe it'll be cool to be like mom and dad

I'm over 27
Not in long I'll be an antique
Soon I might be in heaven
Thanks to God I'm not a freak
My future is like a big scam
And down the road again
I guess its all downhill from where I am
I guess its all downhill from where I am
All downhill from where I am
