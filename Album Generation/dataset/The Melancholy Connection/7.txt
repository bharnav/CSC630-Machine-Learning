[Verse 1]
Hey you, where you gonna hit the wall
Finding your religion in the exhibition hall
Like an odd fish on a bike you are
Never gonna reach that far
I must confess

[Chorus]
You are a junkie for success
You remind me of a fragile child
Who are you trying to impress
Your desperate nature's growing wild

[Verse 2]
There is always one thing on your mind
Always aim for progress, never fall behind
Like an odd fish on a bike you're lost
And a lie like that is gonna cost
More than your stress

[Chorus]
You are a junkie for success
You remind me of a fragile child
Who are you trying to impress
Your desperate nature's growing wild
Your desperate nature's growing wild

[Bridge]
Come on now, rewind the track
Don't need no wind in your sail
Slow down now before you crack
Once in a while we all fail

Come on now, rewind the track
Don't need no wind on your sail
Slow down now before you crack
Once in a while, once in a while we all fail

Who are you trying to impress, yeah

[Chorus]
You are a junkie for success
You remind me of a fragile child
Who are you trying to impress
Your desperate nature's growing wild

[Outro]
You're desperate and you're growing wild
Desperate and you're growing wild
You remind me of a fragile child
Your desperate nature's growing wild
