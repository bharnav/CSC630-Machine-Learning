[Verse 1]
Mind the mice, where you stand
Make sure you have your act all planned
Think it twice, then again
There will be hell if you can't explain
You've been out, you've been cruel
You've been a self indulgent fool
There's no doubt, you've done wrong
And now you just try to play along

[Chorus]
So pick yourself up now and set things straight
Though I know you're full of doubt, you just gotta let it out
And pick yourself up now before it's too late
If you wanna keep that ring, if she ever meant a thing...
Don't lie

[Verse 2]
Mind the mice, where you walk
'Cause you'll regret it all around the clock
It's the price that you pay
Remorse like that will surely stay
She don't know where you've been
But the ice you're on is getting thin
She don't know what you've done
But she will get it in the longer run

[Chorus]
So pick yourself up now and set things straight
Though I know you're full of doubt, you just gotta let it out
And pick yourself up now before it's too late
If you wanna keep that ring, if she ever meant a thing...
Don't lie
No, don't lie

[Bridge]
Oh, you've still got it all boy
In the palm of your hand
If you get the chance you will lose it all
With your head stuck in the sand
Stuck in the sand
Oh, you've still got it all boy
Don't throw it all away
It's about time to get your head out now if you
Want her to stay

[Chorus]
So pick yourself up now and set things straight
Though I know you're full of doubt, you just gotta let it out
And pick yourself up now before it's too late
If you wanna keep that ring, if she ever meant a thing...
Don't lie
No, don't lie
