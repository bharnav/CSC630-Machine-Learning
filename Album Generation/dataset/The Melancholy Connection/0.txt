I'm going to follow you down into the sea
Climbing the mountains, you took the best of me
I'm going to carry you high, don't ask me why
Saving our friendship 'cause I don't want to see it die
And I'm telling you I believe the way
(I'm telling you)
I hope you want to stay
(I'm telling you)
You better show the tune, this is the last time I'll wait for you
Easy, come and go
(I'm telling you)
The eyes are going to show
(I'm telling you)
Open up your eyes, this is the last time I'll wait for you
Come on and leave this mess, we don't need distress
It took a lifetime to understand this crime
You got to think and leave, we don't need to grieve
You heard my word before, now I open up the door
And I'm telling you I believe the way
(I'm telling you)
I hope you want to stay
(I'm telling you)
You better show the tune, this is the last time I'll wait for you
Easy, come and go
(I'm telling you)
The eyes are going to show
(I'm telling you)
Open up your eyes, this is the last time I'll wait for you
In the light of day, I hope that you will try your best, forget the rest
In the dark of night, do tell me you will stand up tall, but then you'll fall
This is all I ever asked for, I know the game
Yeah, I'd give my best to prove that it's not in vain
The sun goes up and down and the moon is there
It's all the nightmare that we do share
I believe the way
(I'm telling you)
I believe the way
(I'm telling you)
I hope you want to stay
(I'm telling you)
You better show the tune, this is the last time I'll wait for you
Easy, come and go
(I'm telling you)
The eyes are going to show
(I'm telling you)
Open up your eyes, this is the last time I'll wait for you
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about, I've just stayed up for you
(Wait for you)
The way that all the pyjamas I found got open again
(Wait for you)
But still, you've got to talk the way I talk, get to feel the way I feel
(Wait for you)
You've got to walk the way I walk, way to feel the way I feel
(Wait for you)
