His name is Tony
As young he was uncool
But he always laughed at all the tough guys who ruled the school
But he's a phony
And I will tell you why
Because his biggest wish to be the hard-knocks a lie

Phony Tony's in disguise
What he wants to be he will despise
And he currently takes the prize
But Phony Tony's no surprise

Yeah little Tony grew up and finished school
And what he meant to his that he is no longer a fool

Phony Tony's in disguise
What he used to be he now despise
And he currently takes the prize
But Phony Tony's no surprise

Now he's a big man
And he's far away from school
Now he's the one who's bullying others calling them fools

He's no longer a fool
He's far away from school
Tony went cool

Phony Tony's in disguise
Phony Tony's no surprise
Phony Tony takes the prize
But phony Tony will capsize
