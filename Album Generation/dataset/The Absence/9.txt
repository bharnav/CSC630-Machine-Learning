You might be a lover always gone astray
But my heart won't have it any other way
Maybe I deserve this longing everyday
'Cause my heart won't have it any other way

If happiness is evidence that fate is everywhere
Then why should I deny my chances of saying I don't care
Now reason don't remind me love ain't bound to stay
'Cause my heart won't have it any other way
No my heart won't have it any other way
