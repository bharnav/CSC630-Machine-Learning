So we meet again, my heartache
So we meet again, my friend
I should've known that you'd return
The moment I was on the mend

So we meet again, my heartache
Like two lovers torn apart
Bound together by the breaking
Of a tired and torrid heart

So we meet again, my heartache
Just as leaves begin to change
How you've made my life a story
Filled with words you've rearranged

So we meet again, my heartache
Come and join me in my pain
You're the reason I remember
Every sweet and sad refrain

So we meet again, my heartache
Come and sit with me a while
Rest your head upon my shoulder
Hide your face beneath my smile

So we meet again, my heartache
Hold the glasses stained with wine
I hope you join me in my toast, my ghoulish host
And maybe stay a while this time
