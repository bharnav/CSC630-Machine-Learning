There are so many things I could say, my love
Make you trip, so your lips would be mine
There are so many things I could do, my love
To convince you my love is divine
There are so many words I could tell you
There are so many moments in time
But I say 'fore we go to the land down below
If I tell you I love you, I'm lying

There are so many places to go, my love
There are so many places to find
There are so many worlds to explore, my love
There are so many stars yet to shine
There are so many secrets to tell you
There are so many men on the line
But I say 'fore we go to the land down below
If I tell you I love you, I'm lying
