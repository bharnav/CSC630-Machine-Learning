Don't wait home for me darling
I'm not coming home!
Draw the blinds and set the alarm
Cause I'm not coming home
In the morning you will rise
With sadness in your eyes
Cause I'll be gone
I'm moving on
Goodbye, so long!

Every flower has faded to dust
I am not, coming home
Tears may fall your lashes may rust
But I'm not coming home
Forever is on my mind
And I have just got to find
A place I belong
One I belong
Goodbye, so long

So long!
So long!
So long!
So long!

Every power is drawn to the close of another
I'm not coming home
Wave goodbye so everyone knows
I'm not coming home
Goodbye, so long!
So long
