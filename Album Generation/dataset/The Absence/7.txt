Goodnight was just a little word you learned
Somewhere somebody that you burned
Was all too happy with a lie

But love, you know you never got it right
I don't know why you say goodnight
You only mean to say goodbye

And i know you quick to show your lover to the door
And you ain't never been in love before
You're only bound to get it wrong

And I know you're just a victim of your circumstance
I never know in any real romance
And so we ought to say so long, goodbye, so long
Goodbye

I know you're only trying to ease my mind
But I'm-a lay it on the line, this time
You only need to say goodbye

Oh, love, you know you never got it right
I don't know why you say goodnight
You only mean to say goodbye
You only mean to say goodbye
You only mean to say goodbye
You only mean to say goodbye
