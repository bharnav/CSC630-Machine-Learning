Well, when you wake in the morning, little eyes open wide
When there's no tender warning, no surprises, no surprise
Maybe your wing may be broken, maybe you're learning to fly
Well, so am I

Amalia, finding a way out on the open road
Amalia, going whichever way the wind gon' go
Amalia, taking your chances on the open sea
Amalia, open the breeze, they're gonna carry me

Maybe fate, maybe reason, made you fall from the sky
Like the tide, like the seasons ever changing, you and I
So where do you go when worry takes you?
Where do you go when somebody makes you cry?

Amalia, finding a way out on the open road
Amalia, going whichever way the wind gon' go
Amalia, taking your chances on the open sea
Amalia, such a funny little bird and you're now with me
Ohh, such a funny little bird and you're now with me
