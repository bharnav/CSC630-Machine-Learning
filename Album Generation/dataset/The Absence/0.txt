The felicidad that I hold in my heart
Is a pretty good start for us two
And if in the world there were only tristesse
I would find happiness in the blues
Mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to be

In all that I've seen, all the love that I need
Is the love that reminds me of you
In every smile is a trace of the joy
That I feel like a sweet morning too
Mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to be

Oh Mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to be
