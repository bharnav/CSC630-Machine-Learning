Hear me out for I was joyful once, like everyone
Hear me out I must have changed sometime
And all at once 'cause it seems
That nothing stays the same as certainly as me
Yeah nothing stays the same but me

Well I have toiled and I have tamed
Constricted and constrained
Just to learn about how everyone is the same
I am old and I am lame, and ruthlessly estranged
Ask me then what I have gained from almost everyone
Uh ho

Hear me out for I had everything indeed
Hear me out I must have changed

Well I have toiled and I have tamed
Constricted and constrained
Just to learn about how everyone is totally insane now
I am old and I am lame, and ruthlessly estranged
Ask me then what I have gained from almost everyone

Uh ho

Hear me out for I was joyful once, like everyone
Hear me out I must have changed
