Do do do do
And I don't think about I could ever represent I've been to
I guess it's easy for me and that's the kind of easy that I'm into
Yeah the Xmas sexy ahh said next and said all the little babies
Now go
Baby gonna let you
I thought that you could set you free
Luxury cars and a sweet guitar
Sleeping at nearling 'cause I'm rocking easy says I catch you

I thought that you could set you free
Oh the Xmas sexy no said next and sex floors and ecstasy
Hot and said next decks on a whole'a baby on a holograph I'm maybe gonna let you
I thought that you could set you free
I thought that you could set you free
Whooooaoao
Aayayayayayayayayay
Ooohohohohohohoh
Aaaaaaahahayayayaya
