I want you, I think so, I wanna get round like Tokyo
I won't tell, will freak you, I wanna go down like this girl
I want you, California, I don't want to get shown like I'm on ya
I won't tell, won't miss though, I wanna get down like disco

I'm coming on all of the time

I'll whip one, out of this joint, see a red neck burn like I must go
Temperamental, never miss though, I wanna go down like disco
I wanna get in, I wanna get out, I wanna go up and then I wanna come down
I wanna get in, I wanna get out, I wanna go out and then I wanna high

Coming on all of the time

I want you, I don't think so, I don't wanna come down like disco
I wanna get in, I wanna get out, I wanna get up and then I wanna come down
I wanna get in, I wanna get out, I wanna get out and then I wanna get high

Coming on all of the time
I'm coming on all of the time, coming off all of the time
