All right, here it comes

Well, I can tell you for the money
The simple life, honey, is good, uh huh
Well, if you ask me how you made it?
Secure life, baby, you should
Oh yes, you should

‘Cause if you’re doing all the best that you can
But you’re still runnin’ just as fast as the man says
Well, I can tell you for the money
The simple life honey is good
Uh huh, now yes, it’s good

Now when you’re movin’ to the city
You worry on your mental health
Yes, you do, now
Oh, you gentlemen and ladies
You’ve got to be good to yourself, mm hmm

So get yourself into a ranch style home
When the neighbor’s never more than a stone’s throw
Well, I can tell you for the money
The simple life, honey, is good
Yes, it is, yes, it’s good
That’s right, yeah

But, oh on, all the money
Still you just can’t please everybody
How bad do, do you want it?
‘Cause the money it looks so good, good, good, ohh
Yeah, whoo, yeah

So now you’re chasin’ the American dream
Just like the dollar’s gonna make everybody scream
But I can tell you for the money
The simple life sure looks good
That’s right, now, yes, it’s good, oh yeah

Oh no, all the money
Looks so good, good, good to everybody
How bad do, do you want it?
‘Cause the money, it looks so good, good, good

Now there’s a whole lot of faking and takin’
And shakin’ my hand
And when they tell you, they love ya’
They love ya’ like a one night stand, mm hmm

So if you’re playin’ in a rock’n’roll band
But still you’re doing whatever the man says
Well, I can tell you for the money
The simple life, honey, is good, that’s right
Yes, it’s good

Uh huh, take care
