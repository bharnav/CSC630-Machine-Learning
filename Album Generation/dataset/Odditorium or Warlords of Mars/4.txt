Woohoo

I've been thinkin' about moving house
I've been wonderin' what I'm about
I've been lookin' for a home
I've been wonderin' about Rome
But all this dirty talkin' and all these whores a-drinkin'
All this worried walkin' and all this worried talk and I'm movin' out. Movin' out

I've been wonderin' when I belong
I've been thinkin' of a song
I've been wonderin' where to go
I've been thinkin' about the road
But all this dirty talkin' and all these whores a-drinkin'
All this worried walkin' and all this worried talk well I'm moving out. Moving out

(Yup, Zia's movin' out, here she goes)

Movin' Out, yeehaw. Movin' out

Well, those who came before, I caught them like a war

Those who came before, let me hear, so I'm movin' out (movin' out)
