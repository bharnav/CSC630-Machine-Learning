I've Been Around And Done Some Things
But I Am Proud Of What I've Been
Some Call Me Many Different Names
You'll Burn In Hell When You Touch My Pain
And When The Lights Begin To Blind
I Raise My Fist For My Own Kind
If You Could See What I Have Seen
I'm Just A Waking – Breaking – Taking – Living Machine
I'll Come To You – In The Night
So Hear My Scream – I'll Take My Rights
We're Godforsaken – We Are Stone Hard
Wrecking The Rules For Our Family
We're On A Mission For The Stone Hard
We Are Free And We'll Always Be
I've Been Allowed To Do My Thing
And All The Things Should Not Have Been
So Many See Me Different Ways
And Passion Kills The End Of My Days
And When The Insides Come Alive
I See Reflections Of My Life
If You Could See What I Have Seen
I'm Just An Earthquake Terror Making Rocking Machine
