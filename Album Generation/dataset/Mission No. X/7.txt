We’re Revving Up – We’re Coming Through
We’re Breaking Out – Just For You
Ripping Up – And All That Crap
We’re Gonna Make – The Better Map
So Here We Are
We’re Here For Good
So Listen Up
Take Our Word Forever
We’re On The Move – We’re On The Ball
We’re Gonna Feed – Your Hungry Soul
No Matter Who – No Matter Where
Be It Here – Or Be It There
Breaking Down The Borders
Breaking All The Chains
No More Law And Order
Breaking Down The Pain
We’re Gonna Fight – And Gonna Win
No Matter What – We Won’t Give In
It Was Them – Who Made The Rules
They’re The Ones – Who Are The Fools
