I’m Mad – Mad For Crazy – I’m Made To Rock
Still Mad For Crazy – Rolling To The Top
Mad For Crazy – I’m Made To Rock
Still Mad For Crazy – Rolling To The Top
I Had Some Bad Times
But I Had Good
I Had Some Sad Times
But We All Should
I Need The Action
I Need The Ride
That’s Satisfaction
On Overdrive
Just Take Look In My Eyes
Take It – You Won’t Be Surprised
And All The Nonsense Inside
Nothing Will Stop ‘Cause I’m Still
Mad For Crazy – I’m Made To Rock
Still Mad For Crazy – Rolling To The Top
Mad For Crazy – I’m Made To Rock
Still Mad For Crazy – Rolling To The Top
I Feel The Power
So Look Inside
I Need The Madness
So Step Aside
I Am A Racer
Adrenaline
Cut Like A Razor
So Sharp And Mean
