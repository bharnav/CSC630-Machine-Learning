I've always been wholehearted
But it would take a saint to understand
And so they had me martyred so I'd find out
The sky explodes above us
And I know there's no other above you
I only touched the surface but I found out

And I won't leave before an army makes me run
Big fish eat the littles ones
You and me we're sainted
Don't let them break your soul

The chemicals have started
They stop me finding anybody new
Why was I your target, do I stand out
The stars were shining for us
And I know there's no other above you
I'm rolling with the punches, I won't lie down

And I won't leave before an army makes me run
Big fish eat the littles ones
You and me we're sainted
Don't let them break your soul

Roll the dice, cause nothing's ever sure in life
Even though the stakes are high, we're already sainted
You're the first, I know it cause I'm fit to burst
I know it cause my halo hurts, I feel like I've been sainted

And I won't leave before an army makes me run
Big fish eat the littles ones
You and me we're sainted
Don't let them break your soul

And I won't leave before an army makes me run
Big fish eat the littles ones
You and me we're sainted
Don't let them break your soul
