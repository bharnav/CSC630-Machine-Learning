I know you hope the little people don't exist
I know you hope we'll fight and miss
I know you hope it's never gonna come to it
Now you know that you're at risk
When you set me up
Put me where I'd do most harm
And you tried your luck
And now it's time for you to learn

Cause I will break your rubble
Into even smaller stones
Yes, I will burst your bubble
And then laugh at what I've done

I know you'll fight for what I'm gladly offering
I backed them cause I knew you'd win
I know that we're all cousins under our skin
But now that doesn't mean a thing

[x2]
Cause I will break your rubble
Into even smaller stones
Yes, I will burst your bubble
And then laugh at what I've done
