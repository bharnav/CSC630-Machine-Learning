I can't believe it's all the same
I can't believe we fill our lives with all these trials and errors on our way
But I'll be there I'll be there
I shoulda never shown my hand
But look outside and dream it's only when you look inside you'll understand
And I'll be there I'll be there
Say the end is near whenever you draw near
The end is near ohh ohhh
Say the end is near whenever you draw near
The end is near

The moon will flicker in the sky
Like a film projector I have seen this scene a hundred million times
But I'll be there I'll be there
Say the end is near whenever you draw near
The end is near ooh ohhhh
Say the end is near whenver you draw near
The end is near
Say the end is near whenever you draw near
The end is near ohh ohhh
Say the end is near whenever you draw near
The end is near
Say the end is near
Say the end is near
