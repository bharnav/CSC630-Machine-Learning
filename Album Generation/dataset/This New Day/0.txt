[Verse]
I won't let you break
You'll live to fight another day
All so you feel safe
I'd take a bullet, jump a speeding train

I kick to stay afloat
And end this sad song on a happy note
No one else came close
To making my heart stop

[Chorus 1]
So you've gotta wipe your eyes
'Cause there's no use crying
I know you're sick of trying
But you know your day is gonna come
Wipe your eyes
'Cause there's no use crying
I know you're sick of trying
But you know one day

[Bridge]
We're gonna run away
And they will hunt and chase
I will turn this place
Into a playground once again
Say you'll come with me
And I will try to make it all feel safe

[Chorus 2]
You know you've gotta wipe your eyes
'Cause there's no use crying
I know you're sick of trying
But you know your day is gonna come
Know your day is gonna come
Know your day is gonna come

[Chorus 3]
You've gotta wipe your eyes
'Cause there's no use crying
I know you're sick of trying
But you know your day is gonna come
Wipe your eyes
'Cause there's no use crying
I know you're sick of trying
But you know your day is gonna come
Know your day is gonna come
Know your day is gonna come
