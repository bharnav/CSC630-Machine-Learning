[Verse 1]
You're the first in my life, to make me think
That we might just go all the way
And I want you to know we're all hanging on

[Verse 2]
They'll come, and yes they'll try yo break us down
But we know that we'll never lose
If we keep moving forward and don't look back

[Chorus]
With the world at your feet, there's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet, there's no height you can't reach
This could be the one

It's calling, it's calling you now
You know it's gonna be your time
Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at your feet

[Verse 3]
Like stars in the sky, burning bright
Seen by a billion eyes
Now I want you to know we're all turned your way

[Chorus]
With the world at your feet, there's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet, there's no height you can't reach
This could be the one

It's calling, it's calling you now
You know it's gonna be your time
Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at your feet

With the world at your feet, there's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet, there's no height you can't reach
This could be the one

[Bridge]
You'll lift it up with one proud kiss
There's nothing else that feels like this
So lift your arms and everyone sing

[Chorus]
With the world at your feet, there's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet, there's no height you can't reach
This could be the one

It's calling, it's calling you now
You know it's gonna be your time
Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at your feet
