Birds end their song
Only you compare
Only you know where they're gone
Clutch the final straw
Break it in your hand
No one understands it's yours

Now don't let go, never let go again
Now cause if you must go, won't you go down in flames

Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
That's why everybody looks your way
Celebrate and let those demons race
You were never fake, nobody could take your place

Can't make time stand still
But you can make it run
You can make it bend at will
Sparks will light your trail
You were never lost
You were only off the scale

Now don't let go, never let go again
Now cause if you must go, won't you go down in flames

Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
That's why everybody looks your way
Celebrate and let those demons race
You were never fake, nobody could take your place
You were never fake, nobody could take your place
You were never fake, and nobody can take that away
