Bright explosion in the sky
A light that burned my eyes
Made me come alive
I thought I'd seen a sign
And prayed that I was right
As tears filled my eyes
Blurred the scene

Now a sun inside me burns
Bleaching all my bones
And the rising smoke
Will carry me away
To another place
I never lost my faith
Just my way

'Cause I exploded into life that day
I'll never look back, I'll never look back
And no-one can take these feelings away
I'll never go back, I'll never go back

Dark is flowing through the cracks
There is no turning back
Or giving into doubt
I held my candle out
For forty days and nights
Like a firefly
In the big black sky

'Cause I exploded into life that day
I'll never look back, I'll never look back
And no-one can take these feelings away
I'll never go back, I'll never go back

I'll make the river run with pictures that I'd take
As a dying sunspits colours in it's wake
Say you've seen enough
You'll only fan the flames

'Cause I exploded into life that day
I'll never look back, I'll never look back
And no-one can take these feelings away
I'll never go back, I'll never go back
