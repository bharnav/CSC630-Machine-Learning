[Verse 1]
I tried to fight the feeling, the feeling took me down
I struggled and I lost the day you knocked me out
Now everything's got meaning, the meanings bring me down
I'm watching as a screening of my life plays out

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake, I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life, all mine I will chase

[Chorus 1]
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
You have to follow nature's law

[Verse 2]
I'll live with never knowing if knowing's gonna change
I'll stop the feeling growing, I will stay away
Like a broken record stuck before a song
A million beginnings, none of them the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake, I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life, all mine I will chase

[Chorus 1]
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
You have to follow nature's law

[Bridge]
I wrote her letters and tried to send them
In a bottle I place my hope
An S.O.S. full of good intentions
Sinking, will you give it to me? Don't make me wait
You built me up, knocked me down
But I will stand my ground
And guard this light that I've found

[Chorus 2]
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
If you let them show, you'll keep them
I know you're hurt but soon you'll rise again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

[Chorus 1]
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
You have to follow nature's law
