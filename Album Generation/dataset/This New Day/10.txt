Look before you leap
Cause then you'll see what everybody sees
You see the other side is out of reach
It's nothing you can change

And everything won't work out in the end
You realise the world is not your friend
There's nothing that you've broken you can mend

On this new day, I found my fate
You know you'd better look before you leap again
On this new day, I found my place
You know you'd better look before you leap again

Stop before you rush
Before you try to make that final push
You know your best will never be enough
It's nothing you can change

And I will sit here watching as you chase
Knowing that it's fools gold all the way
Saying you should leave it all to fate

Its up to you, on this new day
All the seeds you've sown you should have thrown away
Nothing will grow, you're in the shade
And you will stay there alone
On this new day, I found my fate
You know you'd better look before you leap again
On this new day, I found my place
You know you'd better look before you leap again

You've gotta make them see it
You've gotta make them feel it
You've gotta make them see it
See you mean it
Break the ceiling, break these demons
Just keep dreaming
Just keep on breathing
You've gotta break the ceiling, break these demons
Just keep dreaming
Keep on breathing
You've gotta fight these feelings
Gotta see you mean it
