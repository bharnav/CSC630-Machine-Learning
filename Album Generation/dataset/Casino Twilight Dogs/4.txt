I'll meet you by the drain
We'll run through leaves and shopping trolleys, gathering in the rain
Cocooned in our nest of joyful folly
We have no home. This is our home

Our parents are asleep
They think that we're still kids and they know what the first one did
But they'll never know the things we did

We will drive around until a security guard
Tells us we're not allowed

And I'll find you out beyond the streetlights
Under the underpass, under the underpass
Where the tall grass keeps us out of sight
Under the underpass

Let's stay awake all night
And in the morning just when we thought we froze, the early light
Will flicker in the creek and shine like barcode
And we'll go back to stacking shelves
At Woolworths

And I'll find you out beyond the streetlights
Under the underpass, under the underpass
I won't tell them even if they ask
Under the underpass

Who'd have thought we'd live?
Who'd have thought we'd last?
Oh I have no home. This is my home
