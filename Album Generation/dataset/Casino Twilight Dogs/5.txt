Babe, let's move to Sicily
Just you and me
And the mediterranean sea

I work on a scallop boat
That would keep us afloat
The sun would burn my throat

You lie beneath the shade
Writing songs all day
Into the summer haze
And in the evening
We go stealing
Out beneath different stars
Night would hold us
And gently fold us
We'd lose our minds
In tiny bars

We never argue
'cause with just us two
There'd be no point to
They need a surgeon
'cause in this version
We become one person

And in the evening
We go stealing
Out beneath different stars
The night would hold us
And gently fold us
We'd lose our minds
In tiny bars
