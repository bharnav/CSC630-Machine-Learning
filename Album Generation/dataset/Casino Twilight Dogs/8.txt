Summer rain is falling like it's never gonna stop
Yeah, it's been ages
Puddles form on city corners
Businessmen, they leap between the edges

Umbrellas take up battle spots
But nature's fury always proves much stronger
And I've been sitting in my room
Wondering if I'm gonna last much longer

And I've been so damn sure
That I've been here before
I'll give back what I borrowed
And start today tomorrow

I've been watching over you
Watching while you're sleeping
Visions slowly comes to me
Of you when you were sixteen

Standing in your neighbour's house
Like the ones I've shown you
Sometimes I get the feeling that
I've always known you

And I've been so damn sure
That I've been here before
I'll rise above my sorrow
And start today tomorrow

The rain's gone
Here come the swallows
Let's start today tomorrow
