Listen now my sweet and
I didn't mean to cause you pain
We could have spent our summer
Sitting here making daisychains

I lie awake at night
Staring at my roof
Now you're gone

For weeks I've had your pretty face
Hanging in my brain
It's suspended like the reflection
In a window pane

You hang just like a ghost
Over city streets
Now you're gone

How could i begin to finish
What i couldn't start
I'm more general hey ???
Than napolean bonaparte

Oh go now just leave
No more words please
Now you're gone

Listen now my sweet and
I didn't mean to cause you pain
I could have spent all summer
Sitting here making daisy chains

I lie awake at night
Staring at my roof
Now you're gone
