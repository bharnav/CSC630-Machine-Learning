Down in the valley, the industrial estate
He slaloms round beer cans in his escape
He never got nothing, in death even less
What'd you say? I bless

Do what we like
Go where we like
Happy to see it says nothing about us
Drive by the scene
Holding our breath
Relieved to see it says nothing about us

Down in the chambers of law there's a blueprint
To make sadness invisible, suffering a figment
Rehabilitate some and just hide the rest
Now who's guilty? Confess

Do what we like
Go about our lives
Happy to see it says nothing about us
Read in the news
Just shake our heads
Happy to see it says nothing about us

He was alone
Fell with a silence
His mother did separate the whites from the violence
Love on your own
Reap what you've sown
I can't believe that our trains didn't even slow down
