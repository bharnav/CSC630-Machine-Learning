[Verse 1]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

[Verse 2]
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
Music's for the sad men

[Verse 3]
Can you imagine when this race is run?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

[Chorus]
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

[Verse 4]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are the melody, some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

[Verse 5]
It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

[Chorus]
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever?
