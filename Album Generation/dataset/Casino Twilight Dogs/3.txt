I know something's wrong but something's going to change
A frozen line of suits and ties displayed in their own cage

I just walk on through...
I just walk on through...
I just walk on through...
Through the dead zoo

I know something's wrong, is it ever going to change?
An aviary, a mortuary from the Panasonic age

I know something's wrong, we've got to make a change
Another term, will we ever learn? C'mon let's turn the page
