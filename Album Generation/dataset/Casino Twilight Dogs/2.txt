Compression, sustain
Impression remains
I am not a guilty sentence
I just get up and switch it off
Secret temptations, standard frustrations
I look inside, there's nothing in there
Other parasites ripped on schedule you solitary man
You sit at your territorial machine
I need you to tell me this is wrong
Catching and killing
Catching and killing
Oh I feel like I'm winning
Catching and killing
Tapestry in the lounge room
Talk show reject, tell me your name
Tell me your name, a man sits at his computer
And moves infinitesimally
