I just changed my mind
I traded it in
For a new sheet of skin
And tea within

The doctors couldn't presribe
Anything else from the medicine shelf
Oh cure thyself

My life's on a string
I'll do anything
To get myself back
I hang by a thread
Oh let's go to bed
And get ourselves back

I just lost my head
I'm falling away
The things that you say
Will haunt you one day

Love's such a creepy thing
It gets under your skin
Starts sticking in pins and festering

My life's on a string
I'll do anything
To get myself back
I hang by a thread
Oh let's go to bed
And get ourselves back

Oh

My life's on a string
My life's on a string
My life's on a string
I'd do anything
I wanna know you ..
