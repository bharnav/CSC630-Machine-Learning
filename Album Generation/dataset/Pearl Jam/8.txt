[Verse 1]
No more upset mornings
No more trying evenings
This American dream
I am disbelieving
When the gas in my tank
Feels like money in the bank
Going to blow it all this time
Take me one last ride

[Chorus]
For the lights of this city
They only look good when I'm speeding
Going to leave them all behind me
Because this time
I'm gone, long gone
This time I'm letting go of it all
So long, because this time I'm gone

[Verse 2]
In the far off distance
As my tail-lights fade
No one thinks to witness
But they will someday
Feel like a question is forming
And the answer is far
I'll be what I could be
Once I get of of this town

[Chorus]

[Outro][x2]
If nothing is everything
If nothing is everything, I'll have it all
I am gone
