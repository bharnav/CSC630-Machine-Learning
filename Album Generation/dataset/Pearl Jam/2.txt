[Verse 1]
Consider me an object, put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions, free of air and friction
Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down and there I will swing, for all eternity

[Chorus]
Feel it rising
Yeah next stop falling
Feel it rising
Comatose, with no fear of falling

[Verse 2]
Consider me an abscess
Leave me in a vacuum
Blood on all the pistons
Running my transmission

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
High above, I'll break the law, if it's illegal to be in love
Leave the hatred on the cross
Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down and there I will swing
For all eternity

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Something never thought you'd be a part of
