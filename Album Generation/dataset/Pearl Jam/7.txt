[Verse 1]
I used to be crustacean (Woah)
In an underwater nation (Yeah)
And I surf in celebration (Woah)
Of a billion adaptations (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
I feel the need planted in me
Millions of years ago, can't you see the oceans size?
Defining time and time arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind to let me ride

[Verse 2]
I scream in affirmation (Woah)
Of connecting dislocations (Yeah)
And exceeding limitations (Woah)
By achieving levitation (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
I feel the need planted in me
Millions of years ago, can't you see the oceans size?
Defining time and time arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind to let me ride

[Outro]
Got me a ride
I got me a ride
