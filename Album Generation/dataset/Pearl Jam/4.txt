[Verse 1]
There is a marker, no one sees it because the sand
Has covered over, all the messages it kept
Misunderstanding, what original truth was
And out expanding, in a faith but not in love
What went wrong?

[Chorus]
Walking tightrope high, over moral ground
Seeing visions of, falling up somehow
Do come down
With the living, let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say?

[Verse 2]
Those undecided, needn't have faith to be free
And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be
Now you got both sides claiming killing in Gods name
But God is nowhere, to be found conveniently
What goes on?

[Chorus]
Walking tightrope high, over moral ground
Seeing visions of, falling up somehow
Do come down
With the living, let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say?
God, what do you say?

[Verse 3]
There is a sickness, a sickness coming over me
Like watching freedom, being sucked straight out to sea
An the solution? Well, from me far would it be
But the delusion, is feeling dangerous to me
What goes wrong?

[Chorus]
Walking tightrope high, over moral ground
Seeing visions of, falling up somehow
Do come down
With the living, let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first

Oh, what do you say?
God, what do you say?

What do you say?

[Outro]
Calling out, calling out
Calling out, I'm calling you out
