[Verse 1]
I felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper, laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture, I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the face I'd never see again
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday in a hell man made
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

[Verse 2]
Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face
That the president took for granted
Writing checks that others pay
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and naive
So much to talk about, nothing for to say
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder
Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save
Does not equate, and the truth's already out there

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You got to know there's another, another, another, another
Another way
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder

[Chorus][x2]
