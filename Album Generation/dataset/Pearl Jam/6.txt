[Verse 1]
He's got a big gold ring what says "Jesus Saves"
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day
When he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss said, "You best be on your way"

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
So this life is sacrifice
Oh, yeah
Jumping trains just to survive

[Verse 2]
Well, his wife and kid are sleeping but he's still awake
On his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinking if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream?

[Chorus]
Yeah, so this life is sacrificed
Oh, yeah
To a strangers bottom line
Oh yeah, I've seen the light
Uh-oh oh oh
Uh-oh oh oh
I'm scared alive
Near to death
Uh-oh oh oh
Uh-oh oh oh
I've seen the light, scared alive

[Chorus]
Yeah, so this life is sacrificed
Oh, yeah
Was a dream that had to die
Oh yeah, I've seen the light
Uh-oh oh oh
Uh-oh oh oh
I'm scared alive
Near to death
Uh-oh oh oh
Uh-oh oh oh
I've seen the light, scared alive
Uh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

[Outro]
I'm near to death
Here to die
Scared alive
Near to death
Here to die
Scared of life
