[Verse 1]
Big man stands behind an open door
Said, "leave your lady on the cement floor"

[Chorus]
"Got some kicks, want to take a ride?"
I said, "yeah"
"Take your pick, leave yourself behind"
I said "yeah"

[Verse 2]
I've no fear but for falling down
So look out below, I am falling now
Oh please understand, I just need, my friend a way
A way home
Tried to walk, found a severed hand
Recognized it by the wedding band

[Chorus]
"It's okay, do you want some more?"
I said, "yeah"
"You'll see dragons after 3 or 4"
I said, "yeah"

[Verse 3]
"Understand, I'm not falling down"
I said, "Look around, the room's taller now"
I can't close my eyes, cause I see the sound in waves
In waves, lets me stay calm
If I don't lose control
Explore and not explode
A preternatural other plane with the power to maintain

[Outro]
Like a tear in all we know
Once dissolved, we are free to grow
"What is human? What is more?"
I'll answer this, when I get home
