[Verse 1]
Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lillian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels
Weren't found in schools
Where I came from

[Bridge]
Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got

[Verse 2]
Oh, Lillian
I should have run
I should have known
Each dress you own
Is a loaded gun

[Chorus]
Oh, Lillian

[Verse 3]
Oh, Lillian
I need protection
I hear your voice
And any choice I had is gone

Oh, Lillian
Once I begun
I couldn't stop
'til every drop of blood was sung

[Bridge]

[Verse 4]
Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

[Chorus]
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
