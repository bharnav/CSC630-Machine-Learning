[Verse 1]
Overflowing senses
Heightened awareness
I hear my blood flow
I feel its caress
Whispering cosmos
Talking right to me
Unlimited, endless
God breathing through me

[Chorus]
See the microcosm
In macro-vision
Our bodies moving
With pure precision
One universal
Celebration
One evolution
One creation

[Verse 2]
Thundering rhythm
Pounding within me
Driving me onwards
Forcing me to see
Clear and enlightening
Right there before me
Brilliantly shining
Intricate beauty

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
