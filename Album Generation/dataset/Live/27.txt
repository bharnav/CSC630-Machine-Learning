[Verse]
Passed some time on the stoop on the block were we used to sit
I thought about it all too much I thought so hard i couldn't see
Pete rode by on his Hutch
Passed some time on the stoop on the block were we used to sit i looked down and tied my shoes
I thought about it all too much i looked up and then i knew

[Chorus]
I guess these things were meant to be
And there's no use fighting what's in me
Night on earth
Night on earth

[Verse]
Passed some time walking around
Looking for something to be when i stopped to look around
All the music was different to me
All these places we used to go
When i loved you i didn't see I'll miss you
But now I'll know better next time because i found me

[Chorus]
I guess these things were meant to be
And there's no use fighting what's in me
Night on earth
Night on earth
