I don't know what other people say
Or what they think is love
But I know what it means to me
I fall in love so easily
And it's hard to let your guard down
Something you never wanted to do
I give you my love and you turned away
I guess I'd be screwed
But

I'm a hopeless romantic
You're just hopeless
I'm a hopeless romantic
You're just hopeless

Beer and wine does me fine
But it doesn't always do
When i get back up and dust off
I always come back to you
I'm my own man
With my own plan
I can't do the things you want me to
I'm kinda lazy
And i kinda stink
But I'll clean myself up for you

I'm a hopeless romantic
You're just hopeless
I'm a hopeless romantic
You're just hopeless

You're just hopeless
You're just hopeless
