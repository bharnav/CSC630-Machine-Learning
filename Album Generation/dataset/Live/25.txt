Ole[All x's 12]

The Bouncing Souls
No one can beat us
We drink beer and wear Adidas
Anywhere we get the itch
We're off to find the proper pitch
Lace your sambas
Get on out
Off we go and a kickin about
Win or lose we're havin fun
We won't quite until we're done

We got heart
When we play
Take you on
ANYDAY!
