I used to have a home with a room
And a bed a porch and a driveway
With a big garage but i traded it in
I kept some faith laid my head down
Every night and it seems so far away..it seems so far away
Remember me now cuz things always change
5 long years are gone
I've done some time
And even when i fall i know i'll never be the same
I learned some things
About the place's i saw
I learned some things about myself
I guess it came the hard way
Now i know what counts
I've got one prayer
It's in your confidence
I know all the places i don't want to be
Everyone's gone theres no one but me
Remember me next time i go away
For the first time in my life i wanna stay
I could count one hand here today
The only things that matter to me anyway
And it seems so far away
