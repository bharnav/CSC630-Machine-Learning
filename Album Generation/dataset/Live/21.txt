He was only 16 and he knew he wasn't like anyone else
Listening to his records in his room he knew
Something had to change somewhere or he would go insane
But when some years slipped by and he still felt the same
People and money came and went but the only thing that stayed the same
Were the feelings he felt when those records played

He drinks ‘til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
He's looking for something and
He's gonna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy!

Me and Lamar in NYC on the avenue
Talking about nothing much
With a bag of brew the New York wind
Will blow and he will wear his engineer boots
Motorcycle jacket black jeans nowhere to go
Nothing to do
So much has gone
Wrong and so much is bad but sharing
This music with Lamar there is so
Much we have
He drink's and think's
About a girl who lies
Oi oi oi oi and his name is Lamar Vannoy
He'll wake up and
Go to work with a swollen brain
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy

He drinks ‘til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
He's looking for something and
He's gonna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy!
