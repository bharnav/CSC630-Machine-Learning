[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
Well, I like to rock and I love to roll
When the music's runnin' through my soul
I got no, no place to go
But my own private radio
I met a lot of people that made me feel alright
And the music's got me through the night
Go!

[Verse 2]
Well, I had a drink and I had a smoke
I listened to every word you spoke
Another story, another memory
Another day the way things should be

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had it my way, everyone would know
How we're livin' in our, our own private radio

[Chorus]
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had it my way, everyone would know
How we're livin' in our, our own private radio

[Chorus]
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
(Private radio)
Private radio, private radio
