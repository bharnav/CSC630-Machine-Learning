[Verse 1: Dirty J]
I was a fool for playin' it cool
I tell ya
You made it clear it wasn't working for you
I couldn't get just a passing glance
And you didn't know
So I'm telling you now and I'm takin' this chance
To let you know

[Chorus: Dirty J]
I wish you'd notice, notice when I'm not around
I wish you'd notice, notice when I'm not around
So I could show this, show this new love that I've found
I wish you'd notice, notice when I'm not around

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
If I could read your mind and find out what to do
I'd do it
I'd change up my style all the way to my shoes
You're lookin' now
Situation rising, am I breakin' the rules
Will you tell me
If I try to get a little attention from you
What do I do to make you

[Chorus 2: Dirty J]
Notice, notice when I'm not around
This is hopeless, hopeless and bringin' me down
I wanna show this,show this new love that I found
To make you notice, notice when I'm not around

[Bridge: Dirty J]
I said that the trans that you had me
No longer pulls at my heart like a tidal wind
And now that I've gone, now I've moved on
You'll no longer hear me singin' this song
Like

[Chorus 3: Dirty J]
Notice, notice when I'm not around
You're so hopeless, hopeless, it's bringing you down
I tried to show this, show this new love that I found
And now you notice, notice, well, I'm not around
