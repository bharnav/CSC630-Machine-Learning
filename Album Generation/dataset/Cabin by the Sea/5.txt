[Verse 1: Dirty J]
I took my sixteen bars to outer space, so check my universe
I'm a spell, what the hell, man, taste a little curse
I'm a wordsmith, you need a firm grip to rap your head around my shit
Kill the joint and get a burnt lip
See-through, tie-dye, LSD eyes got me in some trouble seeing double
Take a breather while the clav bubbles
Okay, I've caught my breath, my lungs just need a rest
Excuse me, I digress, I need to get something off my chest
I'm an MC, just a little differently dressed
So if you really want us, better check your orthodontist
Keep-a chattering your teeth, kid, just trying to be honest
Better take it from me, I said I spit so much heat, it put a chip in my teeth
I got some different beliefs, you sick of sounding antique
Well write a rhyme to this beat
It's like you're stuck up in the 60s flower child when I peace

[Chorus: Dirty J]
I said you look at me the wrong way, and I say okay
It doesn't bother me, I wrap my head around the kush
You're taking it the wrong way, and I say okay
You're off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push
You started off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push

[Verse 2: Rome]
The Dirty Heads have got you jumping out your seats
Dirty J and Duddy B don't hit the field without the cleats, uh
And with a little touch of Rome, you're back at home
You mix the three, it's ecstasy, you see I swear I'm never wrong (heard)
And everybody wants a hook and wants a beat
But I just got off the bus, I'm overdosing on the summer heat
I like the finer things like smoking on the finer weed
I'm sipping on the stuff that makes me feel better than complete (heard)
One hundred and ten percent is what I give the game
Give me a year or two and your boy will be a household name
Bust in the scene, I'm swinging up home runs
And now I'm breaking hearts and writing records
All good, all fun

[Chorus: Dirty J]
I said you look at me the wrong way, and I say okay
It doesn't bother me, I wrap my head around the kush
You're taking it the wrong way, and I say okay
You're off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push
You started off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push

[Verse 3: Duddy B]
Exactly where I want to be
Floating high on energy
Drifting through the galaxy
Death to those who challenge me
I am not the enemy
I am my own entity
I grow exponentially
Deepest roots, redwood tree
Count my rings, infinity
I was here before B.C
Earth's my home for now it seems
But Mars is in my destiny
I'm just floating high on steam
I'll come down eventually
Just to get some Listerine
Cause verbally I'm disgusting
Future bright, diamond ring
Shoes and hat always clean
So far from reality, I live
My life like it's a dream
Watch me fly endlessly
Faster than a laser beam
If you do not clap for me
Probably cause you amputee

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Look at me the wrong way, and I say okay
It doesn't bother me, I wrap my head around the kush
You're taking it the wrong way, and I say okay
You're off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push (eh)
You started off on the wrong foot, we call it mongo push
