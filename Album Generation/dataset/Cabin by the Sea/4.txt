One (oh yeah) two
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kymani]
Remember the first time that hit set in
We were in the backyard listening
We let the songs on the record play
You told me you wanted to stay the night
He sang to us "everything will be alright"
Our favorite songs on the record play

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Your love gets me l so high
Like when were listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody
Your love gets me so high
Like when were listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody
He's got us singing like oooohhhh whooooaaaa
You know we got the feeling right oooohhhh whooooaaaa

[Verse 2: Duddy]
Remember the first time I pulled you in
We didn't have to pass we were shotgunning
You blocked the breeze from the summer wind
I can hear it now and I heard it then
We got this song on a repeat spin
Don't wanna know when my high will end

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Your love gets me l so high
Like when were listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody
Your love gets me so high
Like when were listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody
He's got us singing like oooohhhh whooooaaaa
You know we got the feeling right oooohhhh whooooaaaa

[Bridge: Kymani]
You said its close to perfection
I heard it in your inflection
He's your favorite selection
Out my record collection
So let it spin so, don't stop it, let it go
Just wanna know if you'll stay with me
Now that I've been stoned
Don't wanna let you go
If I was a friend of time, I'd make him stop!

[Outro: Dirty J + (Kymani)]
Your love gets me so
Your love gets me so
Your love gets me so stoned
Like Bob Marley and you can feel it in the melody
You got me singing like ooooohhhh whhoooaaa
(You know you got us feeling right) ooooohhhh whhoooaaa
Ooooohhhh whhoooaaa
You know its got us feeling right ooooohhhh whhoooaaa
(That's it, like Bob Marley
Music for the masses)
