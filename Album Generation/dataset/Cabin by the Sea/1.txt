[Verse 1: Duddy B]
Well come with me to a place by the sea
If your ship breaks down, you can always find me
And Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree
Our fans are always welcome with our friends and family
And if you wish you can stay, as long as you please
Just lend a helping hand up at our cabin by the sea
Where everyday is beautiful, the sun, the sand, the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony

[Bridge: Duddy B]
And we'll sing but just as loud as we please
But then we will be, forever so free
So come follow me, cabin by the sea

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo
Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo
What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand
We'll fill it up with wood and build a fire with our hands
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey and the wine
And we can pass it all around, until it's all gone
Put a message in the bottle, put the cork back on
We'll throw it in the sea, the message it will read
If you find this don't send help, send another bottle please

[Bridge: Duddy B]
And we'll sing but just as loud as we please
But then we will be, forever so free
So come follow me, cabin by the sea

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo
Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo
What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo
Said we look better in the black and white photo

[Outro: Dirty J]
And when the sun goes down
We can start a fire to sit around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire to drink around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire to sing around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire
