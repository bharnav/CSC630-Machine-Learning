[Chorus]
Oh, we will rise, we will rise
Until we die, until we die, until we die, until we die
Oh, we will rise, we will rise until we die

[Verse 1: Dirty J]
Well, I'm rude boy for life
And yes, I carry a knife inside my mouth
And when I speak it likes to come out just to slice
I try to keep it under wraps I push and pull and fight
But it loves to come and cut when sucker MCs try to bite
So now there's too many MCs running around, get cutted up
And if you want me to stop you can tell me to shut up
'Cause I was born with this mouth, and yes, my horns poking out
And yes, I'm devilish
No, I'm not Bob Marley but I'm soul rebellious

[Chorus]
Oh, we will rise, we will rise
Until we die, until we die, until we die, until we die
Oh, we will rise, we will rise until we die

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
If you give up, tell me how you wake up every single morning
Remember you were younger and did everything you wanted
Didn't have a worry only had a dream and you chased it
Now you realize your time was wasted
Dwelling on the whack shit, look at those who make it
It takes hard work and practice
Nothing comes easy they say but to me
Life's easily thrown away by those who can't see that
'Cause once you're gone you can never get these times back

[Chorus]
Oh, we will rise, we will rise
Until we die, until we die, until we die, until we die
Oh, we will rise, we will rise until we die
