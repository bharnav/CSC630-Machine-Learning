[Verse 1]
The one life to live so I'ma live it
The one chance to give so I'ma give it
All that I have with no limit
We made it this far, but it’s only the beginning
Got my eyes set strictly on the prizes
Standing in my own two shoes, my whole life is
Easier said than done, but I survive it
Aim for the stars, dream big and don’t hide it

[Pre-Chorus: Duddy B]
I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
And as the mist rises I can see horizons
A new day has dawned, I’m just happy to be alive
I'ma make it to the top and if not I die trying
If I’m lying watch my nose grow, Barbara Streisand

[Pre-Chorus: Duddy B]
I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

[Chorus: Dirty J]
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you’re soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky

[Verse 3: Duddy B]
I’ve seen things I just can’t explain
I’ve seen the fire and I’ve seen the rain
I’ve been places and ask questions
But was told that my answers were blowing in the wind
So now I follow the purple haze
All the way through the everglades
I’ve broken through to the other side
Just to find myself building castles in the sky
Never rise up I can see reality below me
Flowing on a dream to the house of the holy
Hands clinched tight, praying death come slowly
'Cause life is too short to give up what you're holding

[Pre-Chorus: Duddy B]
I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

[Chorus: Dirty J]
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you’re soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky

[Outro: Dirty J]
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you’re soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
