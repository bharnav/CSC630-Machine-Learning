[Verse 1]
What we found was a place we could
Go to get away from ourselves
When we found it, it was broken
Wanna stay here and fix it with me
Wanna stay here and fix it with me

[Bridge]
Out here we are
Out here we are
Out here we are
Out here we are
Out here we are
Out here we

[Chorus]
We arrive and
I know nothing
I owe nothing
We owe nothing now

[Verse 2]
And now it's ours and we rebuilt it
It's a place for me and you
Won't you come back when you feel it
I'll be waiting right here for you
