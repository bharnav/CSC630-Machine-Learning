[Verse 1: Duddy B]
All hyped up, ready to begin
Styrofoam MC's keep crumbling
Dirty Heads stay tight, couldn't loosen with a wrench
These rivers run deep, Mariana Trench
Pickin' up speed, easy round the bend
Eye on the scope, target focused in
My guitar is my gun, I strum it like the wind
Zoomed in on the pulse of the nation once again

[Pre-Chorus: Duddy B]
So don't wait for me my friend
I'm just wasting time again

[Chorus: Duddy B]
So day by day, I will move on (day by day)
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by day, I will grow stronger (day by day)
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by day, step by step (day by day)
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
Bright lights on
Coming off the hinge
Rambling on like a Led Zeppelin
I got my sword and my pen like mad mordagin
Outta the abyss starting to ascend
Top of the class, peak of the summit
Throw your worries of a cliff, watch them as they plummet
Bandana and a harp playin' while you're strumming
Bobby McGee and Duddy B while your humming like

[Pre-Chorus: Duddy B]
So don't wait for me my friend
I'm just wasting time again

[Chorus: Duddy B]
So day by day, I will move on (day by day)
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by day, I will grow stronger (day by day)
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by day, step by step (day by day)
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day

[Bridge: Duddy B (with Dirty J)]
Moving forward, beyond the borders
(Take warning), my day has come
Stop for nothing, wait for no one
(Take warning), my day has come
(Take warning), my day has come

[Chorus: Duddy B]
So day by day, I will move on (day by day)
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by day, I will grow stronger (day by day)
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by day, step by step (day by day)
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day
