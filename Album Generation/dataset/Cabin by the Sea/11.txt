[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
Well, the fire's been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself

[Chorus: Dirty J]
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself

[Verse 1: Dirty J]
Well it's still burning bright from what I can see
And I really could use some help
Will you give it some water to quench this beast
Don't think I can do it myself

[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
Cause that fire's been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself

[Chorus: Dirty J]
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself, by myself
Just to share it with somebody else

[Verse 2]
Won't you please, please pass it to me
You know it's been moving so well
Keep it going strong 'til all of it's gone
One more to all of our health

[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
Still, that fire's been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself

[Chorus: Dirty J]
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself, by myself
Wanna share it with somebody else

[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
Well, the fire's been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself

[Chorus: Dirty J]
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself

By myself, by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself, by myself
Wanna share it with somebody else
