[Chorus: Dirty J]
'Cause if we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you

[Verse 1: Dirty J]
Well these words that I write, they go up in the sky
Sit up in space, come down in your eyes
It's true, it's true
I don't need no birds that fly
I can send my love through the satellite
It's true, it's true

[Chorus: Dirty J]
'Cause if we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you

If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
Well, I don't need no plane or train or automobile
To send you all my love and ask you, how do you feel
It's true, it's true
I used to keep your letters underneath my bed
Now at a push of a button, they go straight to my head
It's true, they go straight to my head

[Chorus: Dirty J]
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you

[Bridge: Dirty J]
And if there was a blackout, I would have to let you know
I'd light a thousand lanterns in the sky and let them go
I'd watch them float away and burn out right next to the stars
But at least you'd know that I sent my love and the brightest ones were ours

[Chorus: Dirty J]
'Cause if we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
If we lived a long time ago
These would be my love letters to you, to you
