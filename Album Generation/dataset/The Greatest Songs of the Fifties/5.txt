Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill in the morning mist two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing; yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Oh once on a high and windy hill in the morning mist two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing
