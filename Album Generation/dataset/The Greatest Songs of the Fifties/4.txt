It's Not For Me To Say

It's not for me to say~ you love me
It's not for me to say~ you'll always care
Oh but here for the moment I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine and dream that love
Will last

As far as I can see~ this is heaven
And speaking just for me~ it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing dayâ€¦..
Or we may never meet againâ€¦but thenâ€¦
It's not for me to say

And speaking just for me~ it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing dayâ€¦
Or we may never meet againâ€¦â€¦but thenâ€¦..
It's not for me to say
