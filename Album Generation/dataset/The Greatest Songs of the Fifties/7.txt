Sincerely, oh yes, sincerely
'Cause I love you so dearly
Please say you'll be mine
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
Please say you'll be mine
Did you say
(That)
I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight
Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight
The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear my love
Should the teachers stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
If you teach me tonight, tonight, tonight
