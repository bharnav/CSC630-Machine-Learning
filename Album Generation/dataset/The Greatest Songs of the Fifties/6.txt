Rags To Riches

I'd know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To all the treasures that I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore

Must I forever stay a beggar?
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To all the treasures that I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell you're mine evermore

Must I forever stay a beggar?
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you
