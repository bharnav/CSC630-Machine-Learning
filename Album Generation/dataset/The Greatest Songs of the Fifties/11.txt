What A Difference A Day Made

What a difference a day made, twenty four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue dear, today I'm part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear, since you said you were mine

What a difference a day makes, there's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy, since that moment of bliss
That thrilling kissâ€¦â€¦
It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made and the difference is you

It's heaven when you find romance on your menuâ€¦
What a difference a day made and the difference is you
