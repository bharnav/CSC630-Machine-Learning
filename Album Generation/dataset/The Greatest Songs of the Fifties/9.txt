Young At Heart

Fairy tales can come true ~ it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard you will find~ to be narrow of mind
When you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart?

For as rich as you are~ it's much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105 ~ look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive~ and here is the best part~
You have a head start~ if you are among the very young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart?
For as rich as you are~ it's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105 ~ look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive~ and here is the best part~
You have a head start~ if you are among the very young at heart
