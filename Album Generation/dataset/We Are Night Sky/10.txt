Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend
Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend

It never ends
At the death of things
Love will swing
Burn everything and sing
Ah ha, evil friend

Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend
There is starlight in your blood
It seems that our shadows are wearing us
Ah ha, evil friend

Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend
Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend

You knew rebirth but died again
Evil friend
Black tooth that speaks no truth
Ah ha, Evil friend
Burn everything and sing
Ah ha, Evil friend

Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend
Evil friend
Ah ha, evil friend

We are, Night sky
We are, God's eye
At the end of a lullaby
On the shore of tears yet to be cried

We are, We are
Night sky, night sky
We are, We are
God's eye, God's eye
At the end of a lullaby
On the shore of tears yet to be cried

We are, We are
Night sky, night sky
We are, We are
God's eye, God's eye
At the end of a lullaby
On the shore of tears yet to be cried
On the shore of tears yet to be cried
On the shore of tears yet to be cried
