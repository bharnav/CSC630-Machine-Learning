All we've lost the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again
Tears you've shed the earth has gained
Buried 'neath a sky so strange it cannot be explained
In this light I see your spirit
Listen maybe we can hear it
All we've lost the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
All we've lost the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again
Tears you've shed the earth has gained
Buried 'neath a sky so strange it cannot be explained
In this light I see your spirit
Listen maybe we can hear it
All we've lost the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
Innocent magic is stronger than evil
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
Innocent magic
