Baby, I'm pale and still
My blood's all run down the drain
My blood's all run down the drain
Baby, It's raining
You hear it falling
But I think it's blood
No Rainbow, It's raining skulls
When the raining stops there will be no rainbow
Baby, I'm pale and still
You were an iron maiden
You were an iron maiden
Baby, It's raining
You hear it falling
But I think it's blood
No rainbow, It's raining skulls
When the raining stops, there will be no rainbow
No Rainbow, It's raining skulls
When the raining stops, there will be no rainbow
(la da da ...)
