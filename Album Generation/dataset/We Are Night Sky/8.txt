There was a rhythm to the beating wings that was brilliant
Can't you hear it?
There was terror in the heart of your silence, don't fear it
We will speak it clearly
Counting backwards into darkness from infinity
Can't you hear me?

Laughing at a joke that no one spoke
The misadventures of dope, yeah
13 knots on the hangman's rope
Friend, have you counted them?
It was bloodless and hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope

Rabbit skull and dead bird, baby's got a fistful of love, yes she does
Dancing in song my body aches to forget the Earth

Given enough time all things are possible
The astronomical
Can't you hear me?

Laughing at a joke that no one spoke
The misadventures of dope, yeah
13 knots on the hangman's rope
Friend, have you counted them?
It was bloodless and hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope
Misadventures of dope
Misadventures of dope
Misadventures of dope
