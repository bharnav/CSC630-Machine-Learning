Pale child that was left behind haunts me endlessly
I can smell the churches burning, I can hear the fire's melody
And you're moving for me baby so gracelessly

Feeling like an ancient man
I got Heaven, I got Hell in my hand
I got Hell in my hand
This radiation spills from my heart
Darkness come, darkness come and darkness fall apart
Darkness fall apart

How sweet it was her teeth against my throat
I'm a ghost gone mad, an angel in the dopesmoke

Feeling like an ancient man
I got Heaven, I got Hell in my hand
I got Hell in my hand
This radiation spills from my heart
Darkness come, darkness come and darkness fall apart
Darkness fall apart

I've seen my reflection in the river and heard
Sister sky whisper to our mother the Earth
Mother Earth

I envy the night (envy the night)
For it's absense of light (absense of light)
