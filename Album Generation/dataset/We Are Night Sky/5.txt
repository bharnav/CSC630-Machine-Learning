There are spiders on the flowers
In the corner of the garden
Oh the night will live forever
Oh but die before the morning
It's the song that I'm thinking of
It was a song called Blood, yes it was

There are spiders on the flowers
In the corner of the garden
Oh the night will live forever
Oh but die before the morning
Yeah the night will live forever
Oh but die before the morning
Yeah the night will live forever
Oh but die before the morning

It's the song that I'm thing of
It was the song called Blood, yes it was
