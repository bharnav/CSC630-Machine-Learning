Little white rabbit with the eyes of a serpent
A dog with three heads in a ghetto apartment
I was a man made of sand, oh melting in the rain again
Dropping like a squid upon my brain
Colder than soldiers in their graves
Grinning like sinners

Here she comes, here she comes
Death in blue jeans

This inverted heart has been kissed by lightning
