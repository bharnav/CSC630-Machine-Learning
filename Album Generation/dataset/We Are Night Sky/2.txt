I hear the buzz don't last that long
Hear the buzz don't last that long
I could not forget the sun
Cannot forget how long it was
If you were dreaming you know how long the night was
How long it was, the night
How long the night, yeah, it was

When it's over somehow
I can't believe it now
When it's over somehow
I can't believe it now, how long it was
If you were dreaming you know, you know, how long the night was
How long it was, the night
How long the night, yeah, it was
How long the night was
How long it was, the night
How long the night, yeah, it was
How long the night was

If you were dreaming you know
If you were dreaming you know, don't ya
If you were dreaming you know how long the night was
If you were dreaming you know
If you were dreaming you know, how long
If you were dreaming you know how long the night was
