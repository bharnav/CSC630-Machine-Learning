[Verse 1]
The spirit climbs my spine to the brain
Followin' the railroad tracks down again
I needed space, with soul, maybe we can die there
Maybe we can

[Chorus 1]
Stop, I'm already dead, yeah
Stop, I'm already dead

[Verse 2]
My, my, my mother, she said
"Heaven's on one shoulder, but baby hell is on the other," yeah
Tied neatly in a box beneath the bed, it was the bones of my father
Oh baby we can

[Chorus 2]
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah

[Bridge]
I am already dead
Uh-huh, uh-huh, ohoh, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, ohoh

[Chorus 3]
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop, na-na-na-hoo
I'm already dead, yeah

[Outro]
I am already dead
