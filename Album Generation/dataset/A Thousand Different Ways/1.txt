Graham Russell:
Another dream, another day
I've seen too many fade away
So if you wonder how to make it right
Give me everything, everything tonight

Clay Aiken:
'Cause I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to feel empty no more
Only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more

Graham Russell:
Take me in, take me home
I can't stand to be alone
Help me paint the picture of my life
Don't you disappear and leave me here tonight

Clay Aiken:
'Cause [sung with background vocals] I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to feel empty no more
Only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more [end background vocals]

Can't make no sense of life ([background vocals:] Make no sense of life)
No matter how I try
'Cause something's missing in my heart, tonight

[sung with background vocals] I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to feel ([overlap:] I don't wanna be lonely) empty no more
Only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't want to be empty no more
And only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more, no more
