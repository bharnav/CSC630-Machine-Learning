Graham Russell:
Oh, I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Oh, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Clay Aiken:
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Graham Russell:
Oh, I can't forget this evening
And your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Clay Aiken:
I can't live, oh, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore, oh, oh, oh, oh!

I can't, I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live... (fade)
