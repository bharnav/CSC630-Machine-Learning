[Intro]
I won't maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough
I don't wanna maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough

[Verse 1]
Fresher
Like it's the 1st semester
Rock it like Queen when I'm under pressure
While the rest of these cats, all siesta
I get loose like change when it's on your dresser
Boom, here comes the real volume
Loud enough to wake up and shake this tomb
I connect like skate decks in concrete rooms
You're about to face what makes this move

[Pre-Chorus]
People used to tell me that I'm on my own
They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
'Cause there's a million other people who could sing this song
I said "Well, thanks for the push 'cause you all were wrong"

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

[Verse 2]
Explosion
Dig it like rust corrosion
When it goes in gush like a busted nose and
Competitors
I was born to set it off
They wrapped me in cloth
I grabbed a mic and went on tour
Smash it
Back in school I was a hazard
Cause I never saw the grass
Never just looked past it
Had a passion that burned like battery acid
Peter Parker, bit by some radioactive
(Shake this place in)

[Pre-Chorus]
People used to tell me that I'm on my own
They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
Cause there's a million other people who could sing this song
I said "Well, thanks for the push 'cause you all were wrong"

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

[Bridge]
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down
