[Intro]
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh

[Verse 1]
You could read a million pages
Know the words in all the phrases
You could try to turn a lie into the truth
And you can live to be a hundred
Memorizing every number
You could even put a man on the moon
And the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me
But I'm following this feeling

[Chorus]
I don't know why it's so hard to swallow our pride
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right
I don't know the reason, sometimes it just feels so good to cry
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But you're here with me, and that's all I need to know
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh

[Verse 2]
There's a moment in the morning
When I feel the most alone
But then I hear your voice whispering my name
It's like a wave of understanding
And I never could have planned it
Where the questions and doubts all fade away

[Chorus]
And I don't know why it's so hard to swallow our pride
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right
I don't know the reason, sometimes it just feels so good to cry
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But you're here with me, and that's all I need to know
Oh-oh, oh (that's all I need to know)
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
I figured it out, just turn me around
At the speed of light
All that I ever needed to know
Was in your eyes

[Chorus]
I don't know why it's so hard to swallow our pride
And I'll never count all the stars in the sky
I don't know the reason, sometimes it just feels so good to cry
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But you're here with me, and that's all I need to know
Oh-oh oh (that's all I need to know)
Oh-oh oh (that's all I need to know)
Oh-oh oh (all I need to know)
Oh-oh oh
