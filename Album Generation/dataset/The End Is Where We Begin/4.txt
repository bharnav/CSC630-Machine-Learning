[Intro]
Hahaha
Let the sparks fly
Hahaha

[Hook]
There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

[Verse I]
Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake
It only takes ONE spark
For TWO to fall apart
And THREE more to blow it away

[Chorus]
Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

[Hook]
There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

[Verse II]
Give me one good reason
Two more to believe in
And three shots at why I should wait
Cause I got one more match
Two strikes left
You got 'till three to get out of my way
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake
It only takes ONE spark
But TWO to fall apart
And THREE more to blow it away

[Chorus]
Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

[Hook]
There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

[Interlude]
Hahaha
Let the sparks fly...
Hahaha

[Chorus]
Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
Cause Heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

[Outro/Hook]
There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby
