[Verse 1]
I know they say that the space between
Can make it stronger then we've ever seen
They might be right, but I disagree
Cause I've never felt stronger than when you're with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder why you even care
Cause even when I leave you're always there with me
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased

[Chorus]
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

[Verse 2]
I've stood alone and I've fallen down
Your hands were there to pick me off the ground
Sometimes I cry cause I can't believe
Your love is big enough to cover me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder if you're even there
But when I feel far away you need me there
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased
Yeah...

[Chorus]
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you... I wanna be lost

[Bridge]
I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
I wanna get lost in you
Underneath your sky

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
So far gone tonight

[Chorus]
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

[Outro]
So far gone in you
In you...
In you...
So far gone in you
