[Verse 1]
I think I'm ready
I think I've got it
Cause too much thinking is bad for my health
It's like a fire
Cause when I start it, I can't control it and I burn myself
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will

[Hook]
We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one

[Verse 2]
My heart is racing
Just like a rocket
Victory looks like a distant dream
Cause what we're fighting
Not gonna stop it
But we can beat it if we just believe
I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will

[Hook]
We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one

[Extro]
We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will


[Hook]
We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one
