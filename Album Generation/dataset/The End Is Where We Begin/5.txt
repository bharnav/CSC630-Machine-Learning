[Intro]
Oh, I could be nice
But don't test me
I can get wicked

[Chorus]
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

[Verse 1]
I'm a beast, came to rip this spot up
Stick to Cons 'cause the devil wears Prada
We want peace, but we can make this rowdy
Stop, we don't wanna hurt nobody
You can't hang me 'cause my nature's nice
And my heart's for the people of the world tonight
If you got a problem with it, take it up with life
'Cause if you try to push me it, ain't gonna be nice

[Chorus]
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

[Post-Chorus]
I am not afraid
Of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees, I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and unashamed
When it washes over me, I feel free

[Verse 2]
P.S., don't play me like a 3DS, these cats can't see us
They're checking the wrong mirrors, cavaliers
Don't mistake kindness for weakness
They never wanted to hear us blowing speakers
Spinning the trinity, hook, line and sequence
In your brain like a G6, no secrets
My faith's my life, it's rolling the dice
If you try to push me, it ain't gonna be nice

[Chorus]
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

[Post-Chorus]
I am not afraid
Of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees, I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and unashamed
When it washes over me, I feel free
Go!

[Bridge]
Oh, I can be nice
Don't test me

[Chorus]
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get

[Outro]
I get wicked when you come against me
So quit it, stop trying to push me around
Let's kick it if you really wanna touch fire
Come get it, step up, I'll bring you down
(Ha-ha-ha, think I'm not going to defense? You're crazy)
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked
