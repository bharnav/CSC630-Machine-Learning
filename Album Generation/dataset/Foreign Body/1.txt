One of those days I was taking a walk
Thinking about the older places in town
That part of us is sure that we haunt

One of those times I was looking for your
Eyes in every morning
I could see you going
Further every day, life is full of changes of heart

In the end I was fighting a war
I'd say it out loud but my words were fighting me
Fighting me

I know I know I must go it alone
In so little time the world has grown so cold
It's fighting me

What is riding on these other people's lives
I'm living in a mind
I do not know what changes it

Some are gone and something's going away
Some long to stay that world turning round
All things are bound to change

One of those days time was wandering free
Light passes from the morning, dark goes evening
Night is full of days
Going by

One of us will stand at the edge of the sunlight
Grey at every morning
But eyes can see the whole thing
Silent from above it all

It was one of those days
I was taking a walk
Thinking about the older places in town
That part of us is sure
That we haunt

One of those times I was looking for your
Eyes in every morning
I could see you going
Further every day
And night
