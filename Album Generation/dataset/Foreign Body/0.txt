[Verse 1]
Would you ever even try
Below I [?]
Turn in fable in the glow
Dam the light into the corners above oblivion
Call her name out in the clothe

[Verse 2]
Haunted by the horns of skin
Mirrored echoing thru the pouring roof
Your effortless so
Call the light into the corners above oblivion
Watching shadows play up ahead now

[Verse 3]
Rising light amongst the trees
Metal shows amongst the clove
Turn the sail towards the emptiness
Orphan hollows and never close

[Verse 4]
Making patterns in the sky
Pull a name out in the echo of the sound of falling

[Outro]
I don't know
I don't know
