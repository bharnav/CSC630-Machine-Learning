[Verse 1]
I met a girl at the beach
It was underneath a blazing sun
Just like usual I was looking for a little fun
I was sitting and chilling out
And listening to the breaking waves
That's when the day really started to change

[Hook 1]
Rising out of the sea like Excalibur's sword
All the men they're staring and the women they scorn
A glorious vision, the seventh deadly sin
Tall, tanned and lovely like songs from Jobim

[Verse 3]
I started to gather my one thousand things
The sand's in my shoes and my skins' been burning
It's very different where I'm from
So it's hard to be like a true beach bum
I just get dizzy in the midday sun

[Hook 2]
She seems to dance around, she's born for this place
Always next to her she keeps the same old battered books
Sometimes right over her face
A beautiful full moon party
She lives in the light of day
And is she reading 'A Picture of Dorian Gray'?
Okay

[Verse 4]
She's a towering inferno of restless energy
But she's as patient as students of ornithology
She seems to wait for nothing but the close of the day
Then all of a sudden, just like I had prayed
I see her start to look my way
I'm as self-conscious and nervous as a first-time virgin drug smuggler
I'm doing my best to keep my eyes from constantly being obvious and staring at her
I play with my phone, start texting a mate
I hope they call back, that sucks
'Cause I'm here, she's hot, and it's great

[Verse 5]
I take a little walk, over to the bar on the beach
The other English guys are as burnt as me
I order a beer 'cause I'm feeling real thirsty
I know it should be water 'cause this'll dehydrate me

[Hook 3]
To my surprise as I am sitting here
She sits right down right next to me and orders a beer
She speaks just like a native girl, she's humming a song
I'm resisting every tempting moment where I'm thinking I can just sing right along
Singing along

[Verse 6]
And now I can't believe it
But she asked me where I'm from
Her accent is thick
I definitely wasn't wrong
I tell her I'm from London
And she seems impressed
We start joking about the cold
The wind, the rain and the fog
Well all I try and do is stop staring at her chest

[Hook 4]
She'd love to move away and pursue her career
She studied at the University over here
She said she had some trouble getting hold of a visa
I said I would marry her, seemed to please her


[Verse 7]
It was all going well so I ordered some shots (shots)
It went straight to my head 'cause I was tired and hot (hot)
This girl she had no problem with all of the tequila
I was just so shamelessly trying to feed her

[Hook 5]
I knew I was mangled when I tried to stand
I had double vision and the room span
She grabbed my arm to keep me steady
And she asked me in that cute voice "Are you feeling horny?"

[Verse 8]
We were staggering up the four flights of stairs together
I began to imagine me ensuing pleasure
As we entered the room she began to undress
She seductively asked me to turn around quickly to increase the suspense

[Hook 6]
Closing my eyes was like entering a vortex
Was I even going to manage to get through the sex
And so before it even all began
She battered me over the head with the bedside lamp

[Verse 9]
I awoke the next morning
And I was feeling like crap
All that was left was the shirt on my back
She must have spiked my drink
I could feel it in my throat
On the side of the table she'd left me a note
Thanks for last night, I don't need a visa
Why would I move, life is just easier

[Outro]
There's no moral in this tale
Which I guess is a shame
Cause the truth be told
I'd probably do it again
I'd probably do it again
