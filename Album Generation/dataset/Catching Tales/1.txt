[Verse 1]
Paint a picture
Clear cut and pale on a cold winter's day
Shapes and cool light wander the streets like an army of strays
On a cold winter's day

[Chorus]
Will you let me romanticize
The beauty in our London skies?
You know the sunlight always shines
Behind the clouds of London skies

[Verse 2]
Patient moments you chill to the bone under infinite greys
Vision hindered mist settling low like a ghostly ballet
On a cold winter's day

[Chorus]
Will you let me romanticize
The beauty in our London skies?
You know the sunlight always shines
Behind the clouds of London skies

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing is certain except everything you know can change
You worship the sun but now, can you fall for the rain?

[Chorus]
Will you let me romanticize
The beauty in our London skies?
You know the sunlight always shines
Behind the clouds of London skies
