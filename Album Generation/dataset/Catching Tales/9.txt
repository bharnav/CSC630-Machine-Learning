[Verse 1]
Every day it comes to this
Catch the things you might have missed
You say, get back to yesterday
I ain't ever going back
Back to the place that I can't stand
But I miss the way you lie
I'm always misunderstood
Pulled apart and ripped in two
But I miss the way you lie

[Chorus]
Catch the sun, before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire

[Verse 2]
I never really understood
Why I didn't feel so good
But I miss the way you lie
I've always been up and down
Never wanted to hit the ground
But I miss the way you lie

[Chorus]
Catch the sun, before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire

[Piano-Solo]

[Chorus] x2
Catch the sun, before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire
