[Verse 1]
Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring

[Hook]
No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know
Cause I love you so
And you love me, love me

[Verse 2]
Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile

[Hook]
And our dreams are meant to be
Because we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come

(Piano Solo)

[Verse 2 repeated]
Our day will come
If we just wait a while
And no tears for us
Think love and wear a smile

[Hook/Outro]
And our dreams are meant to be
Because we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day, our day, oh daaaaay, will come
