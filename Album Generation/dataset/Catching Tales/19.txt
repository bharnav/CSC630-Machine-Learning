[Verse 1]
I'm a glum one
It's explainable
I met someone unattainable
Life's a bore
The world is my oyster no more

[Verse 2]
All the papers
Where I lead the news
With my capers
Now will spread the news
Superman turned out to be
A flash-in-the-pan

[Chorus]
I've flown around the world
In a plane
I've settle revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But I can't get started with you
Around the golf course I am under par
And all the movies want me to star
I've built a house and show place
But I can't get no place with you

[Verse 3]
You're so supreme
Lyrics that I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
And I dream
Both day and night of you
And what good does it do

[Chorus]
In 1929, I sold short
In London, I'm presented at court
But you've got me down hearted
'Cause I can't get started with you

[Musical Solo]

[Hook]
You're so supreme
Lyrics that I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
And I dream
Both day and night of you
And what good does it do

[Chorus/Outro]
In 1929, I sold short
In London, I'm presented at court
But you've got me down hearted
'Cause I can't get started with you, with you
