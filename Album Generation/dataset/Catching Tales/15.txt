[Verse 1]
I see my life running in cycles
Except the other day I felt like a change
Watch as I break this vicious circle
You gone and made me see some things in different ways

[Hook]
Now need not explain it
See with you girl
No need to hide
Time, time waits for no man
Or am I just using these all cliqued ideas

[Chorus]
Here it comes again
It's that something I can't explain
Like a drug in my brain
It won't be long before I hit the ceiling
And lose my mind
But you'll stop me
From tripping up this time

[Verse 2]
It doesn't feel like other times
I met with disaster like it was my good old friend
I had some trouble with the signs
Like another language
I couldn't even comprehend

[Hook]
Now, need not explain it
See with you girl
No need to hide
You're your just so different
You see with you my dear I really can confide

[Chorus]
Here it comes again
It's that something I can't explain
Like a drug in my brain
It won't be long for I hit the ceiling
And lose my mind
But you'll stop me
From tripping up this time

[Instrumental/Jamie Scatting]

[Chorus/Outro]
Here it comes again it's that something I can't explain
Like a drug in my brain
It won't be long before I hit the ceiling and lose my mind
Maybe it is a sign
Here it comes again it's that something I can't explain
Like a drug in my brain
It won't be long before I hit the ceiling
And lose my mind
But you'll stop me
From tripping up this time
