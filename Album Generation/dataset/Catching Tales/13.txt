[Verse 1]
Got a little rhythm, a rhythm a rhythm
That pitter pats through my brain
So darn persistent, the day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane

[Verse 2]
Comes in the morning
Without any warning
And hangs around all day
I have to sneak up to it
Some day I'll speak up to it
And hope it listens when I say...

(Jamie-instrumental/Scatting)

[Chorus]
Fascinating rhythm
You got me on the go
Fascinating Rhythm, I'm all a quiver
What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like my grandmother

[Verse 3]
Each morning I get up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done...
I know that once it didn't matter
But now you doing wrong
When you start to patter, I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

[Outro]
Oh how I long to be
The man I used to be
Fascinating Rhythm
Why don't you stop picking on me

(Jamie-instrumental/Scatting)
