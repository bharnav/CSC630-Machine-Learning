[Verse 1]
I missed the opportunity
To get you babe to stay with me
Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made
Like a song, it will fade

[Chorus]
If there's music in the night
And it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you (Woaah)

[Verse 2]
So I put my feelings out to dry
Love, one day again
I'll have to try
Falling out, making up
It seems such a silly game
Why do I never gain?

[Chorus]
If there's music in the night
And it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you

(Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na, oh oh)

[Chorus]
If there's music in the night
And it's really, really right
It's the only thing I need!
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead!
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you

[Outro]
(It intoxicates your mind)
(Na na na na na na na na
Na na na (repeats until end)
Watch me forget, about missing you
(It intoxicates your mind)
(It intoxicates your mind)
