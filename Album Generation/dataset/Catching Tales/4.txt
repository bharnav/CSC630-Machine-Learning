Verse 1:
We were so drunk last night
We had that stupid fight
You called me a useless selfish prick
So I'm in a fix right now
And we'll measure the truth somehow
Love is a funny thing to me

Pre-Chorus 1:
Then you stormed out and grabbed your coat
While slamming shut the door
A ruthless move so cold you left your keys inside the door (Oh...oh)

Chorus:
Can Nothing I do make you happy anymore
Nothin' I say put a smile onto your face
Can nothing I say bring us back together
Nothing I do put a smile onto your face

(Spoken) Well Okay..

Verse 2:
Next day I called you back
And you called me a stupid twat
And then you were crying on the phone
You sounded so upset, you said
I wasn't the man you'd met
3 years and 7 months ago

Pre-Chorus 2:
I pleaded with her take me back
I'll change my sorry ways
So tell me why mysteriously I'm annoyed instead of shamed
(Yeah ooh mm mm mm)

Chorus:
Can Nothing I do make you happy anymore
Can nothin' I say put a smile onto your face (Oh)
Nothing I say bring us back together (Woah)
Nothing I say put a smile onto your face
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Bridge:
MMmmmm, Yeahhh

I'm pondering it all after that call
I think it is clear
I am here, you're from another stratosphere
Oh, now all the things she said they went around my head
And come out my ear
And not before long
This stubborn soul thinks he's done no wrong

Instrumental

Pre Chorus 3:
As when the questions flit around my head like butterflies
My head spins at reflecting on another love's demise, Ohhhh

Chorus:
Can Nothing I do make you happy anymore
Can nothin' I say put a smile onto your face
Can nothing I do bring us back together
Nothing I say put a smile onto your face, Ohhh

(Spoken) All together now... ah 1,2,3...

*Whistles in tune to the chorus* -- until fade out
