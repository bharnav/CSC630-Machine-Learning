[Verse 1]
Are the stars out tonight?
I don’t know if it's cloudy or bright

[Hook]
'cause I only have eyes for you, dear

[Verse 2]
My love must be some kind of blind love
I don't see anybody but you

[Verse 3]
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

[Hook]
'cause I only have eyes for you
I don’'t know if we’re in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

[Hook]
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
I only have eyes for you

[Verse 2/Outro]
My love must be some kind of blind love
I don'’t see anybody but you
