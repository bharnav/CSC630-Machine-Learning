[Verse I:]
So hail a taxi-cab and come around here
And I will meet you right outside
I got some DVDs and a couple of beers
If you want to we can stay up all night
It's nothing fancy, just a little couch and me
And conversation for your mind
So let's explore all the possibilities
Of the things that we both talked about last time

[Chorus I:]
Take a trip to my yard
Don't you know the grass is greener on the other side?
Take a trip to my yard
Don't you know the love that you've been dreaming of is mine?
My yard, oh

[Verse II:]
I'll be your neighbour at the other end of town
And the benefits you soon will find
So let's enjoy the fact that we're on our own
We will answer to nobody else this time
Tonight might be nothin' but the moon and me
Any time that we take the script and flip it
Baby take a trip to my yard

[Chorus II:]
Take a trip to my yard
Don't you know the grass is greener on the other side?
Take a trip to my yard, oh
Don't you know the love that you've been dreaming of is mine?
Take a trip to my yard
Don't you know the grass is greener on the other side?
Take a trip to my yard, oh
Don't you know the love that you've been dreaming of is mine?
My yard
