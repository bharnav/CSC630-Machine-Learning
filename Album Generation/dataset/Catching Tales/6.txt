[Verse 1]
There's maybe a way I can tell you
'Cos with everyday things continue
To get more compromised
So who will fantasize
A new generation politicized

[Verse 2]
When things are done in our own name
Are we as much to blame?
Now it's become clear to me
But only lately
And the ground is removed underneath

[Hook/Pre-Chorus]
Shout it from the brink
You're louder than you think

Chorus:
21st-century kid, you're surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Your weapon

[Verse 3]
Nothing is certain 'cept a memory
And that's soon washed away by the low sea
Now sit yourself down my one
And see what you've become
Ignoring a smoldering gun

[Hook/Pre-Chorus]
The white dove's flown
D'ya think we're on our own?

Chorus/Outro:
21st-century kid, you're surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?!
21st-century kid, you're surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Your weapon
