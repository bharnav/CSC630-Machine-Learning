[Verse 1]
Said I many times, love is illusion
A feeling result of confusion
With knowing smile, and blas√© sigh
A cynical so and so, am I

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so sure, so positive
So utterly unchangeably-certain
Though I never was aware of loving you
'Til I suddenly realized there was love in you

And, oh

[Chorus]
In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures
And underrated treasures
I'm glad there is you

[Post-Chorus]
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role, so new
I'll muddle through with you
If you'll guide me through

[Chorus]
In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

[Outro]
More than ever, I'm glad there is you
Said I many times, love is illusion...
