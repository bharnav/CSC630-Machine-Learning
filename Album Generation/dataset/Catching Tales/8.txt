[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while since I have talked to you
But maybe you're the one who makes the winds blow
We're looking at the stars without explanation
We contemplate as kings and simple men on trial
Our little world's fragile

[Chorus]
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop?
Maybe it's not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost?
So who's the last resort... Oh God

[Verse 2]
Tumbling towards unclear destinations
Do they wash away the pain
The wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange

[Chorus]
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop?
Maybe it's not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost?
So who's the last resort... oh God

[Instrumental]

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh God can you tell us when it's going to stop?
Maybe itâ€™s not just down to you oh oooh!
Oh God can we win back what we have lost?
So who's the last resort?
