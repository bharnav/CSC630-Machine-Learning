You thought you had this thing licked
Hide under the covers when you answer the phone
Pretend you're sick
You built that wall around your heart so no one
Could get to it
You must have missed a spot somewhere baby
'Cause I walked right through it
Love had something to say about it
Wasn't gonna let you lay there and cry
Because baby I live just to dry your eyes
Thought you could live just fine without it
Tough out every heartache you hide
But love had something to say about it
Love had something to say about it
Nothing lives without water
You live without love so long
You think its how you oughta
Now that is the dumbest lie we ever tell ourselves
