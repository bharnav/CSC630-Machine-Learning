Well, I can't believe how much I think about you
I don't know why
How'd I ever even get along without you
Through the long night
Days are so long when you're not around
But I only know one thing

I'm tired of sleeping with the lights on
Writing all these sad songs
I know where I belong
It's tangled up in your arms
So tell me that you're all right
You're missing me tonight
You can't wait till I come home

And I wonder if you're staring out the window
Watching cars go by
And I wonder if it ever really gets to you
With no one by your side
Walking through this lonely space
I need you so much every day
This is the life I know

I'm tired of sleeping with the lights on
Writing all these sad songs
I know where I belong
It's tangled up in your arms
So tell me that you're all right
Missing me tonight
You can't wait till I come home

It's getting closer every day
Just thinking about it makes me shake
But I know I need you now

I'm tired of sleeping with the lights on
Writing all these sad songs
I know where I belong
It's tangled up in your arms
So tell me that you're all right
Missing me tonight
You can't wait till I come home

Tell me that you're all right
Missing me tonight
You can't wait till I come home
