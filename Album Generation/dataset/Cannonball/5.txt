I wish I could hold you back
I know I can't help you pack
Cuz it's all that I can do
To pretend I'm not watching you

Go find yourself somewhere else
Chase some dreams on the streets of LA
Don't let this town tie you down
When a bigger life's calling your name
You'll find who you are
If you follow your heart
With it wherever it leads
But get on back fast
When find yourself missing me

I wish I could tag along
This town is where I belong
Take this old ring of mine
Maybe I'll get it back some time

Go find yourself somewhere else
Chase some dreams on the streets of LA
Don't let this town tie you down
When a bigger life's calling your name
You'll find who you are
If you follow your heart
With it wherever it leads
Get on back fast
If you find yourself missing me

Oh, missing me

Go find yourself somewhere else
Hope you keep me in some of your dreams
I won't let you down. I'll be here
If it turns out that I'm what you need
You'll find who you are
If you follow your heart
With it wherever it leads
Get on back fast
When you find yourself missing me

Oh, missing me
