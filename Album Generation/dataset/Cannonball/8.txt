It's just you and me and a voice on the radio
It keeps telling you and me
Should have turned around hours ago
Just two innocent bystanders
Victimized by the night
That'll be our alibi in the morning light

*CHORUS*

So come on in
And hold on
Don't you tell me that it's wrong
Its ok, it's all right
It's just you and me tonight
That's all right, that's ok
We won't let love get in our way

The boulevard is on fire tonight
Engulfed by the flames of burning street lights
Look at those two fools on the corner
They got that look in their eyes
I wonder if it's real or just a brilliant disguise

REPEAT CHORUS

Just two innocent bystanders
Victimized by the night

That'll be our alibi in the morning light

*CHORUS*
