Pretty little thing
Where ya going with that
"I'm about to give up"
Look in your eyes
I just said what I felt
But I sure didn't mean
To make you cry
That's the thing about honesty
Sometimes it stinks
Sometimes it sets you free
Go on, be mad at me
Just don't leave
Cuz I'd still be lost, without you
I'd still be lost without you
Who would I be
Baby, I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do
Cuz I'd still be lost
I'd still be lost
Without you without you, without you
Days come and go
Time passes
Hard to remember
It's easy to forget
The velvet sky
That kiss
That first taste of
Your perfect lips
That's the thing about you and me
Sometimes we just disagree
But baby I just need
You to see
That I'd still be lost, without you
I'd still be lost without you
Who would I be
Baby, I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do
Cuz I'd still be lost
I'd still be lost
Without you, without you, without you
Without you, without you, without you
Cuz I'd still be lost, without you
I'd still be lost, without you
Who would I be
Baby, I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do
Cuz I'd still be lost
I'd still be lost
Without you without you, without you
Without you, without you, without you
