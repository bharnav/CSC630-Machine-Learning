Check out those kids over there in the parking lot
They're probably drinking a lil beer and smoking pot
But I doubt they mean anyone any harm
Yeah thats old man Fredrick's daughter
Breakin every rule her daddy ever taught her
With that wild-eyed kid on the hood of that pick-up truck
But who are we to talk?
Didn't we walk that very same walk?
Not so many years ago
CHORUS
With a love like that
We were young and true
With a love like that
The fall of '92
You were my homecoming jacket to the homecoming football game
With a love like that
We crawled in the back
With a love like that
We moved way to fast
I hope nobody tells them that it ain't gonna last
'Cause there's a beauty in a love like that
Sure (both) are families yeah they had their doubts
There was money on whether we would work out
And to come to think of it we ain't ever been payed
I guess we are just like those kids
We could have listend but we never did
Sneaking out of the house just prayin
We wouldn't get caught
Remember those long walks
When you swore all we were gonna do was talk
Not so many years ago
CHORUS
With a love like that
You ain't ever alone
With a love like that
We built a home
With a front porch swing and a couple of kids in the yard
With a love like that
You never look back
With a love like that
I got the courage to ask
I hope nobody tells them it ain't gonna last
'Cause theres a beauty in a love like that
A love like that
A love like that
A love like that
A love like that
'Cause a love like that
It's built to last
With a love like that
