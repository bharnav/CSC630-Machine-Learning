Virginia Belle
Comes walking down the street
I wonder if she'd stop and talk to me
Would I stumble
Would I fall
Would I say anything at all

Just to know her (yeah yeah)
How great it would be
Just to show her (yeah yeah)
I can already tell
Virginia Belle
My Virginia Belle

Virginia Belle
Don't you know who I think I am
I've got a very intricate but simple plan
Lets take a walk
Lets grab a drink
We'll hold hands
Cause that's alright

Just to know her (yeah yeah)
How great it could be
Just to show her (yeah yeah)
I can already tell
Virginia Belle
My Virginia Belle

My opprotunity has passed
When she took that taxi cab
Will I ever see her again
Did I stand a chance

Just to know her (yeah yeah)
How great it could be
Just to show her (yeah yeah)
I can already tell
Virginia Belle
Virginia Belle
