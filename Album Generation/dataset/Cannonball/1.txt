Sometimes it's a car
A certain shade of mystic blue
I think of you and I wonder how on Earth you are
Sometimes just a song
That's playing on my radio
And there I go just a wishin' you were singin' along

That's all it takes
And I just opt to dreamin' I'm in

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
You were layin' in my arms
That class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah raise a family
Down in way back Texas
Uhuh population you and me

Me I'm doing well
No one in particular
Girl i heard that you went and rang them weddin' bells
The say his name is John
His daddy owns a dealership
But the slipper don't quite fit
Yet life goes on and on
So I guess that I'll hang up
And just wonder if you ever dream of

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
Were you layin' in my arms
Had a class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah livin' happily
Down in way back texas
Way back
Population you and me

And every now and then
If you need me I'll be back in

*Chorus*
Way Back Texas
Where your layin' in my arms
Had a class ring necklace
We're gonna buy that little farm
Way down by the river
Yeah raise a family
Down in way back Texas
Uhuh population you and me
