Stay, won't you stay
Please don't throw this all away
You're out of daydreams girl, we will be out tonight
You've been done so wrong that I can do you right
And it's something for you
And it's something for me
So take all you want and take all you need
And he let you go, now here we are
And it's finder's keepers
When it comes to the heart
Day after day
I've waited for the chance to say
Love can be a shelter but it can be a storm
My love's the kind that keeps you safe and warm
And it's waiting for you
So baby take it from me
Everything you want, everything you need
He let you go, now here we are
And it's finder's keepers
When it comes to the heart
He let you go, now here we are
Well, it's finder's keepers
When it comes to the heart
And it's finder's keepers
When it comes to the heart
