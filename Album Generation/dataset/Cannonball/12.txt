Everybody's talking 'bout how everybody's feeling
There's a change coming down
All the people in the street are moving to the beat of a brand new sound
But it's the same old theme
Love is all you need

*CHORUS*
We got to learn how to live
We got to learn how to live together
We got to learn how to give
That's the only way to stay together
Stay together
Sha la la.............

Well I hear what your sayin' when your sayin' to me baby that maybe its time that I change my ways
But I'll always be the fool standin' out in the rain sayin' take me back please open your door
But it's the same old song
Baby, I know I was wrong

*REPEAT CHORUS*

Getting closer every day
Just thinking about it makes me shake
I know I need you now
