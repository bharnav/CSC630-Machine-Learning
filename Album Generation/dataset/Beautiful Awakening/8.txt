[Verse 1]
Tryin' to analyze every angle, situation
Tryin' to find an explanation
Cause it's gettin' aggravatin'
Why my relationships never seem to work out
Beginnin' to worry and doubt
If I'm even able to detect he's the one
When this day you're wonderin
Why I haven't seen the sun
Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
Cause I'm gettin tired of the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' on my heartbreak and I...
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin'
Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

[Chorus]
Is It me? am I so complicated?
Is It me? or is love over-rated?
Is It me? cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
Is It me? am I too independent?
Is It me? not ready for commitment?
Is It me? cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm longin' for it more than I should be expecting
All the standards that I'm settin'
Unrealistically I'm gettin'
Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
Because I'm so confused and insecure
Cause when I know for certain everything is goin wrong
I permitted to prolong
Tried my best to hold on
My Mister Right's probably hangin' 'round my window pane
While I look through only watchin the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' on my heartbreak and I...
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the...
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin
Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

[Chorus]
Is It me? am I so complicated?
Is It me? or is love over-rated?
Is It me? cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
Is It me? am I too independent?
Is It me? not ready for commitment?
Is It me? cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

[Bridge]
Never thought it could be that it's me
Till I realized I'm the only
Common factor and played a big part
In lettin' people break my heart
Never noticin' I was wasting time
Askin' the same thing every time
Who were you with? and where were you at?
Until I took the time to turn and look back
Ooooh la la la
La la la la
La la la

[Chorus]
Is It me? am I so complicated?
Is It me? or is love over-rated?
Is It me? cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
Is It me? am I too independent?
Is It me? not ready for commitment?
Is It me? cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked
Is It me? am I so complicated?
Is It me? or is love over-rated?
Is It me? cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
Is It me? am I too independent?
Is It me? not ready for commitment?
Is It me? cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

[Outro]
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
