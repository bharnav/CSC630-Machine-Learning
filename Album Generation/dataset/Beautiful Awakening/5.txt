[Verse 1]
From your walk to your style
From your lips to your smile
Got me feeling like a child
And baby, I just want it all for me
Baby, tell me that it's all for me
From your kiss to your touch
Got me needing it so much
Boy, I got a crush
And with you is where I wanna be
So please tell me that it's all for me

[Chorus]
I love it, I don't want it to stop
Every minute I'm without you always seems like a lot
Feels like I'm in a dream when I'm not every time I get close to you
Please don't wake me baby, cause...
I really hate seeing you go
But you gotta handle business
Yeah baby, I know
Feels like half of me left when you walked out the door
Please take me away with you

[Verse 2]
From the look in your eye
You want me as bad as I want you in my life
Baby, loving you feels like a dream
And your loving has become a need
Every time that you go
I get a pain in my heart, and that lets me know
I just gotta have you all for me
Baby, tell me that it's all for me

[Chorus]
I love it, I don't want it to stop
Every minute I'm without you always seems like a lot
Feels like I'm in a dream when I'm not every time I get close to you
Please don't wake me baby, cause...
I really hate seeing you go
But you gotta handle business
Yeah baby, I know
Feels like half of me left when you walked out the door
Please take me away with you
I love it, I don't want it to stop
Every minute I'm without you always seems like a lot
Feels like I'm in a dream when I'm not every time I get close to you
Please don't wake me baby, cause...
I really hate seeing you go
But you gotta handle business
Yeah baby, I know
Feels like half of me left when you walked out the door
Please take me away with you

[Bridge]
A love like yours is hard to find
Can I be yours? Will you be mine?
I think it's time
Please take me away with you
Cause you bring out the best in me
The greatest love I've ever seen
Is what I need
Lease take me away with you

[Chorus]
I love it, I don't want it to stop
Every minute I'm without you always seems like a lot
Feels like I'm in a dream when I'm not every time I get close to you
Please don't wake me baby, cause...
I really hate seeing you go
But you gotta handle business
Yeah baby, I know
Feels like half of me left when you walked out the door
Please take me away with you
