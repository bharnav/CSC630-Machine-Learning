[Intro]
Oh
Oh
Ooh, I'm not missing you
Hmmm

[Verse 1]
Been through just about everything that I could go through
When it comes to relationships
Don't know what I was missin'
Or why I ain't listen
When I told myself that was it
But here I go hurt again
'Cause of my curiosity
Now that it's over, what else could it be?
He decides to cheat

[Pre-Chorus]
I made a promise never to settle
Why didn't I keep it?
'Cause I hated the heart break, cryin' and cheatin'
The foolin' around
But I'm not missing you

[Chorus]
I'm not goin' through the motions
Waitin' and hopin' you call me
I'm not missing you
You might've had me open
But I must be goin' because...
I got life to do
I know I'm usually hangin' on
I used to hate to see you go
But this time it's different
I don't even feel the distance
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you

[Verse 2]
It's a shame in a way
'Cause I feel that I may not
Ever find the right one for me
Did I leave him?
Is he right in front of my face? Oh
Will my true love ever be?
Why would I go on a search again
When I know what the end will be?
What good is love when it keeps on hurting me?

[Pre-Chorus]
I made a promise never to settle
Why didn't I keep it?
'Cause I hated the heart break, cryin' and cheatin'
The foolin' around
But I'm not missing you

[Chorus]
I'm not goin' through the motions
Waitin' and hopin' you call me
I'm not missing you
You might've had me open
But I must be goin' because...
I got life to do
I know I'm usually hangin' on
I used to hate to see you go
But this time it's different
I don't even feel the distance
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you
I'm not goin' through the motions
Waitin' and hopin' you call me
I'm not missing you
You might've had me open
But I must be goin' because...
I got life to do
I know I'm usually hangin' on
I used to hate to see you go
But this time it's different
I don't even feel the distance
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you

[Bridge]
No, I can't be with you 'cause I'm scared
Felt like I was fallin' when you left me
I can't keep goin' through life
Unaware of what I'm missin'
Or the person that I could be
Love's good when it's right
Bad, when it's left in you memory
All the times and; anytime
I guess love would be nice for someone, as this life
I'm not missin' you

[Chorus]
I'm not goin' through the motions
Waitin' and hopin' you call me (no)
I'm not missing you
You might've had me open
But I must be goin' because...
I got life to do
I know I'm usually hangin' on
I used to hate to see you go (I used to hate it)
But this time it's different
I don't even feel the distance
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you
I'm not goin' through the motions (ooh, yeah, yeah)
Waitin' and hopin' you call me (knockin' at my door)
You might've had me open
But I must be goin' because... (It's the best day of my life)
I know I'm usually hangin' on
I used to hate to see you go
Different, feel the difference (no)
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I'm not missin' you
Oh baby, I'm not missing you
I'm not missin', I'm not missin' you (oh, cause I'm so over you)
It ain't even a problem
