[Verse 1]
You and I made mistakes
We've been in and out of arguments
And said some things we didn't mean to say (wait)
This time you're not the one to blame
Sometimes I get a little too afraid
I didn't mean to cause you any pain

[Chorus]
So wait (wait)
Ahh, wait darlin'
Before you go and throw our love away
Can I get a minute to explain?
Now wait (wait)
Ah, think about it
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait

[Verse 2]
Now I've been caught with my heart on
Time and time again
Holdin on, why?
Boy, you know I'm so alone I...
I just need a friend
And you've been so good to me
I don't wanna miss a real good thing

[Chorus]
So wait (wait)
Ahh, wait darlin'
Before you go and throw our love away
Can I get a minute to explain?
Now wait (wait)
Ah, think about it
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait

[Bridge]
You don't know what you do to me
Baby, won't you sit and talk to me?
No, it doesn't have to be this way
Darlin', I'm just wantin' you to stay
You don't know what you do to me
Baby, won't you sit and talk to me?
No, it doesn't have to be this way
Darlin', I'm just wantin' you to stay (stay)

[Chorus]
So wait
Think about it everyday
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait
Now wait
Mmmmmm, ohh (wait)
Gotta wait
Gotta wait
Yeeeaahh, oooh
I'm just askin you to wait on me
Please wait
Oooh, please wait baby
