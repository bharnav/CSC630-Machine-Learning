[Verse 1]
Baby...
It's not the arguments
It ain't the time we spent
I never worry bout who you're with or where you been
You take good care of me
I really should, but please
I know you probably won't believe it's not you, babe its me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why
I dont love you anymore
And though i try
Its just not like it was before
I wish that I
Had reason to be mad at you
Then maybe I would not feel bad for leavin' you

[Chorus]
You may not like what I have got to say
Baby, I can't do this no other way
My feelings for you boy just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay
Please don't say you love me
I know you do
Don't know why I'm not still in love with you
My feelings for you boy, just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay

[Verse 2]
Baby, it's life itself
You know how these things go
Maybe I've just grown out of you
Maybe we'll never know
I know sometimes i'll miss you
This may just be my loss
Though it may not seem that way
Maybe we are better off

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why
I dont love you anymore
And though i try
Its just not like it was before
I wish that I
Had reason to be mad at you
Then maybe I would not feel bad for leavin' you

[Chorus]
You may not like what I have got to say
Baby, I can't do this no other way
My feelings for you boy just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay
Please don't say you love me
I know you do
Don't know why I'm not still in love with you
My feelings for you boy, just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live a lie no more
How can I stay and not be sure?
I wanna be with you
And I think you need to know the truth

[Chorus]
You may not like what I have got to say
Baby, I can't do this no other way
My feelings for you boy just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay
Please don't say you love me
I know you do
Don't know why I'm not still in love with you
My feelings for you boy, just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay
You may not like what I have got to say
Baby, I can't do this no other way
My feelings for you boy just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay
Please don't say you love me
I know you do
Don't know why I'm not still in love with you
My feelings for you boy, just ain't the same
Make this easy please
Don't ask me to stay

[Outro]
Ohh stay, baby I can't stay
I dont know why
