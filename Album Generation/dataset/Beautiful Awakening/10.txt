[Verse 1]
Hey, what am I doin'?
Over here late at night on the sofa
Kissin' and touchin'
Whisperin in my ear, got me breathin'
Marvin Gaye in the background singin', it ain't helpin'
Now in this moment, candles burnin', oh, it's so easy
Got me compromisin' with my sexuality
And I know that you and I have got a real good thing
But when I pause, think it over
It ain't right, gotta tell ya

[Chorus]
I can't give it up
Shoulda never started now we gotta stop (ooooh)
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
I can't give it up
We started a fire gotta blow it out (ooooh)
But one day, I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

[Verse 2]
Boy, what was I thinkin'?
When I move like that on your body
Bump and grindin'
Can't stop now got you breathin'
And you ain't in the mood for teasin'
Heaven help me
And when the moment candles burnin, oh, it's so easy
Got me compromisin' with my sexuality
And I know that you and I have got a real good thing
But when I pause, think it's over
It ain't right, gotta tell ya

[Chorus]
I can't give it up
Shoulda never started now we gotta stop (ooooh)
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
I can't give it up
We started a fire gotta blow it out (ooooh)
But one day, I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

[Bridge]
And you should know
This is really hard for me
Cause when I'm with you, boy
I wanna give you everything
But there's much more than a night of ecstasy
I need commitment with a diamond
Then I'm yours to be your fantasy
I can't give it up
I will be your fantasy
Ooooh

[Chorus]
I can't give it up
Shoulda never started now we gotta stop (ooooh)
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
I can't give it up
We started a fire gotta blow it out (ooooh)
But one day, I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
I can't give it up
Shoulda never started now we gotta stop (ooooh)
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
I can't give it up
We started a fire gotta blow it out (ooooh)
But one day, I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me
