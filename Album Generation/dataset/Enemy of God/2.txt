Suicide Terrorist
Bringing worldwide death
Random killing
Cruelty obsessed

Tool for those who know no compromise
Dictating demanding lives
Leaders breathing hell
Cities burn the day you die now

Suicide Terrorist living sacrifice
Nameless icon within blood baptized
For the victory of brand new lies
Your life shall be the price

Suicide Terrorist
Religious devide
Fearless killing
Aggression redefined

Socialists and capitalists fall
No front line and no rules to this war
Let battle comence
The world will learn the day you die now

Suicide Terrorist living sacrifice
Nameless icon within blood baptized
For the victory of brand new lies
Your life shall be the price

Eradication cleansing of the west
This fragment of hypocrisy won't last
A man made pandamonium absurd
Hysteria breeding hell on earth

Suicide Terrorist bringing worldwide death
Random killing cruelty obsessed
Tool for those who know no compromise
Dictating and demanding
One hundred thousand innocent lives

Suicide Terrorist living sacrifice
Nameless icon within blood baptized
Socialists and capitalists fall
Self imposed martyr in a holy war
