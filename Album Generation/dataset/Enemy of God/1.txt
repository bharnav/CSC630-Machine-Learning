All I see is terror
All I see is pain
All I see is mothers dragging children to their graves
A curse as old as time, an Armageddon misery
Spectators of a world in ruins
Hypnotised, I'm staring at

Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Is all there was is all there'll ever be

All I see is violence
All I see is hate
All I see, tyrants dragging servants on a chain
A curse as old as time, an Armageddon misery
Spectators of a world in ruins
Hypnotised, I'm staring at

Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Is all there was is all there'll ever be

How much more can you take
Propaganda mind control
From the cradle to the grave
Poisoned fruits to kill the soul
The weak following the blind
Fearful hearted, empty-eyed
In this mortal plane of slaves
Life's oppressors cannot be destroyed

All I see is terror
All I see is pain
All I see is mothers dragging children to their graves
A curse as old as time, an Armageddon misery
Spectators of a world in ruins
Hypnotised, I'm staring at

Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Impossible brutality
Is all there was is all there'll ever be

And as your world collapses
I'll watch it die in silence
I wish this day would come now
Await its dawning without fear
