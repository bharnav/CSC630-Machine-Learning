Silent places after rain
Monuments fall the last strike of fate
End time ravens over blood oceans flames

Spread the ancient plague
Among the wolves of wrath

As the last sad existence enters the grave
Battle torn the angels cry with not a soul to save
Let us close our eyes and dream of the plague

Spread the ancient plague
Among the wolves of wrath

Purify the earth from all of it's worms
Dissolving into the void through the thunder and the storms
Let us close our eyes and dream of the plague

Spread the ancient plague
Among the wolves of wrath

Patriots and warfare
Demonstrating arrogance
Superior armies waiting for their final call to arms
Winds of mayhem choirs for the final pestillence
A gospel rapture battlecry of barbarians

Death to all the empires
Death to lifelong wars
Death to bitter sons of the antichrist
Death to the world

Silent places after rain
Monuments fall the last strike of fate
End time ravens over blood oceans flames

And I saw millions of souls
Preparing for the last incarnation
No more earthly pleasures no more life's temptation
And the ghosts of long forgotten sociaties
Cast out wicked dreams from the heart of the lost
The future is drowning in the ashes of the past
And through the toxic stench of human tragedy
A saviour appears in a red mask in front of me
AND SATAN IS HIS NAME!!!
