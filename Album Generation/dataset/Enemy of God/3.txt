Isolated world in pain the tyrants bitter triumph
Devoted celebrate the empires ice cold victory
Feed their soulless bodies to the vultures and the lions
They're scared to raise their voices in disasters long foreseen

I hate your lives
Falsehood and lies
I hate your world
Your paradise drowns in chaos to breed

World Anarchy
World Anarchy

Kings ruling emptiness and terror over ruins
Fast destruction slow death to all masters of the earth
Kings rulers autocrats in corpse mountain seance
The harvest of all all cultures raped by axe and sword

I hate your lives
Falsehood and lies
I hate your world
Your paradise drowns in chaos to breed

World Anarchy
World Anarchy
