I used to wake up every night
Bad dreams and my chest tight
You tell your friends on the telephone
Its not them that make you feel alone
And nothing ever stays the same
Why should we worry about acting our age?
I wanna live under my own rules
Do what I want without answering to you

Oh no I wanna kill but im young
We were born the same day
Just been out having fun
Now it don't mean a thing to me or no one
I will live my life when my day comes

You sat me down on the kitchen floor
So drunk you wrote on the wall
You took your dress off and looked at me
You can't love what you can't see
And nothing ever stays the same
Why should we worry 'bout acting our age
I'll never tell you what to do
Its just bad luck baby following you

Oh no I wanna kill but im young
We were born the same day
Just been out having fun
Now it don't mean a thing to me or no one
I will live life my life when my day comes

Oh no I just won't leave you like this
You know I just can't leave you like this
You know I just won't leave you like this
You know I just can't leave it

Oh no I wanna kill but im young
We were born the same day
Just been out having fun
Now it don't mean a thing to me or no one
I will live my life when my day comes
