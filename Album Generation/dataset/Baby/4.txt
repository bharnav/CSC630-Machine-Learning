Met this girl last night
She's a real life dancer
The kind that will change your life
She just stepped right up and sat down
Took a brand new tiara and laying it on the ground

She said
Are you healthy?
Do my pheromones make you happy?
How do you tell a child that there's no God up in the sky
And it's all a lie
For Nothing
How do you tell a son that his daddy left his mum when she fell in love with a girl like you?

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

Took a ride in her car
She had back seat speakers
She took me to her favourite bar
She kicked off her heels again
Took a swing at the lampshade
And whispered softly in my ear

Are you healthy?
Do my pheromones make you happy?
How do you tell a child that there's no God up in the sky
And it's all a lie
For nothing
How do you tell a son that his daddy left his mum when she fell in love with a girl like you?

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

Are you healthy?
Do my pheromones make you happy?
How do you tell a child that there's no God up in the sky
And it's all a lie
For nothing
How do you tell a son that his daddy left his mum when she fell in love with a girl like you?

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

Ohhh
With a girl like Sappho
With a girl like you

How do you tell a child that there's no God up in the sky
And it's all a lie
For nothing
How do you tell a son that his daddy left his mum when she fell in love with a girl like you?
