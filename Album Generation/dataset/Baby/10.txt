A bathtub with a stranger
Made love to a Cajun dancer
Then several hours later
Life's a little shorter
The drink that overwhelmed me
Such confusion owns the beauty
A poison for the lonely
For all the world to see
When you're out of time
This bad apple's no friend of mine

So what you want
So what you need
Cause who you love
Aren't what they seem
When all you have you got for free
The things you do you don't believe
The mistakes you've made just never leave
When all you have you got for free

A picture of Jesus on your windshield
A Sunday afternoon
Drive for miles and miles together
Just me and you
Wasted out and I feel younger
A million miles away
The day I die gets a little closer
Still here to stay
When you're out of time
This bad apple's no friend of mine

So what you want
So what you need
Cause who you love
Aren't what they seem
When all you have you got for free
The things you do you don't believe
The mistakes you've made just never leave
When all you have you got for free

So what you want
So what you need
Cause who you love
Aren't what they seem
When all you have you got for free
The things you do you don't believe
The mistakes you've made just never leave
When all you have you got for free
