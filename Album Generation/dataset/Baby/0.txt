Icecream from California
Making a mess on the shiny leather
I can't say goodbye when I'm handcuffed to you
A dude in a dress for the first time ever

If you came back
It'd just be me and you
If you came back
It'd just be me and you

I don’t know how you dream up all things that you say
Never died in an aeroplane, spiralling away
To a desert island where they all know your name
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay

I'm too exhausted to open my mind
When we sell it in the back of your car
I wasn't born in front of your eyes
A pink carousel to remind me how

If you came back
It'd just be me and you
If you came back
It'd just be me and you

I don’t know how you dream of all things that you say
Never died in an aeroplane, spiralling away
To a desert island where they all know your name
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay

Come on paradise you're loosing me
Get on my knees and lick the streets clean
Come on paradise you're loosing me
Get on my knees and lick the streets clean
Come on paradise
Come on paradise you're loosing me
Come on paradise
Come on paradise you're loosing me

I don’t know how you dream of all things that you say
Never died in an aerolplane, spiralling away
To a desert island where they all know your name
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay
Whenever
Whenever
Whenever you come to stay
