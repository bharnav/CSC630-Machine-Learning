So this is how it is
Scare yourself to death
On promisses
Keeping you away from dangerous ?kids
When all I wanna do is you

She said
Come on, meet me in the morning

Last night I went walking in
The middle of the street
Missed times
You came running back to me
I might have stood there acting naturally
But this time, this time
I could really see
What you want me to be

I saw you yesterday
In the supermarket
Carrying away
Just dreaming on, just dreaming it away
When all I wanna do is you

She said
Come on, meet me in the morning

Last night I went walking in
The middle of the street
Missed times
You came running back to me
I might have stood there acting naturally
But this time, this time
I could really see
What you want me to be

She said
Come on, meet me in the morning

Last night I went walking in
The middle of the street
Missed times
You came running back to me
I might have stood there acting naturally
But this time, this time I could really see
What you want me to be
