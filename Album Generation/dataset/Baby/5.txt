Could you do something
For me
I feel a little different
Lately

I just can go anywhere when I'm
Howling my heart and I
I just can't tell
No

Does it move you, (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
The state I'm in? (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
Does it move you, Oh!
The state I'm in?

Whisper discretely
To me
The years don't see me
Come clean

I just can go anywhere when I'm
Howling my heart and I
I just can't tell
No

Does it move you, (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
The state I'm in? (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
Does it move you, Oh!
The state I'm in?

I just can go anywhere when I'm
Howling my heart and I
I just can't tell
No

Does it move you, (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
The state I'm in? (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
Does it move you, (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
The state I'm in? (Woah oh oh, Woah oh oh)
Does it move you, Oh!
The state I'm in?
