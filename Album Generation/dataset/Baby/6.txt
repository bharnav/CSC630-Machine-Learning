Last look
Keeps me out of trouble
That last drink
Got me seeing double
Road kill
Makes my guts wanna spill
On the backseat now
With my head hanging down

What use is god if you can't see him?
What use are friends if they don't want in?
Running around with my head in a spin
What use is god if you never win?

Six a.m
Watch the sun come up by myself
Watch the headlights fly by
Road kill
Makes my guts wanna spill
On the backseat now
With my head hanging down

What use is god if you can't see him?
What use are friends if they don't want in?
Running around with my head in a spin
What use is god if you never win?

What use is god if you can't see him?
What use are friends if they don't want in?
Running around with my head in a spin
What use is god if you never win?
