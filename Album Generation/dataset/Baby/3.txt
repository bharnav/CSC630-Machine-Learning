An awakening of self, wrapped up and ready to go
Just wanna dance with you but I won't let it show
Do you remember how we were? Late nights on the trampoline
Just wanna dance with you, this time it's plain to see

Stay awake to watch you sleep. I'm young but I don't feel well
I'm not in love with you but i won't let you tell
If you could list your favorite things. Fast food and magazines
I'm not in love with you, this time it's plain to see

Well i'm saving up my time, for use on someone else
Not much left here anyway...I blame that on myself
But I wouldn't change a thing, i'm better off alone
When you wake up here tomorrow, I'll be half way home
