Took a walk yesterday
To the places we would play
Then Charlie passed away
And it hasn't been the same
On this island in the sea
That was made for you and me
Could you make yourself believe
You're not happy

Girls in the pub make the boys feel lonely
Man in the street screams the country's unholy
Have you noticed a change in the weather lately
It's getting me down, always saying I'm sorry

In the corner of an English field
With the devil trying to cut a deal
I've decided I don't want to go home
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me alone

The day you dyed your hair
How we watched the people stare
You said you didn't care
And it was nothing
A hundred years from now
When we're six feet underground
Do you think there'll be a crowd
Still laughing

Girls in the pub make the boys feel lonely
Man in the street screams the country's unholy
Have you noticed a change in the weather lately
It's getting me down, always saying I'm sorry

In the corner of an English field
With the devil trying to cut a deal
I've decided I don't want to go home
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me alone

Do you really want to be a part of it?
That's when your eyes won't close and your dress don't fit
Do you really want to be a part of it?
From the back of the bus where we first kissed

And don't you know
It's where we call home
It's where we call home

In the corner of an English field
With the devil trying to cut a deal
I've decided I don't want to go home
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me alone
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me alone
