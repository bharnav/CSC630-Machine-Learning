I see colors
Well I can't quite work out why
Am I at the bottom of the ocean?
Or way up in the sky?
Am I alone or with friends?

I hear thunder
And a thousand words in song
A symphony so beautiful
I had to sing along
Am I alone or with friends?

Either way, to find old lovers hands
Writing messages in the sand

I feel cold and the the air's too thin to breath

Now you couldn't possibly imagine how much of you I need
Am I alone or with friends?

Either way to find old lovers hand
Writing messages in the sand

Just let go and let your body do the work
Like an angel made of stone to dust
If the universe is kind to leave our soul behind
Then bury me waaay out at sea
Just you and me

Just let go and let your body do the work
Like an angel made of stone to dust
If the universe is kind to leave our soul behind
Then bury me waaay out at sea
Just you and me
