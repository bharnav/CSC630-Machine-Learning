Friday or Saturday, what does that mean?
Short space of time an' needs a heavy scene
Monday is comin' like a jail on wheels

Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a'forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills

So tell me, and I'll take the tube
You know a girl, yeah well she's bound to be rude
Can't a'get a'nothin' at the places I've been

(Chorus)

I've combed this town from top to bottom
Try to get around but my legs are broken
Every time, I miss it, 'cause I ain't got a ticket

(Chorus)
Cheap thrills
And he got thrills

Kickin' for kicks

(Chorus)
