White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick

Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!

(Chorus)

All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

Are ya' takin' over
Or are ya' takin' orders?
Are ya' goin' backwards
Or are ya' goin' forwards?

(Chorus)
