[Verse 1]
They tried their best to drag him out
Of a courthouse down in Montgomery
Now they want to kick him out of school
And take him off our money
They can take those words off of paper and stone
But he ain't gone, no

[Chorus]
He ain't the leavin' kind
He'd never walk away
Even from those who dont believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain't the leavin' kind

[Verse 2]
She stayed mad at him for a lot of years
For taking her husband
Started losing her faith and thinking that
Her life meant nothin
But when she looks at those kids
She raised all by herself
She knows she had some help
Yeah she knows

[Chorus]
He ain't the leavin' kind
He'd never walk away
Even from those who don't believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain't the leavin' kind

[Bridge]
No matter what you do
No matter where you go he's
Always right there
With you

[Outro]
Even from those who don't believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain't the leavin' kind
