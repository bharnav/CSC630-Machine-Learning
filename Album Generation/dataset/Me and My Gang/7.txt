[Verse 1]
You waved your hand and it was done
Said "Let it be", and there it was
A mountain, so high, it broke through, the sky
A canyon, so deep, it'll bring a man to his knees

[Chorus]
I've seen what you can do
I've seen you make miracles and hopeless dreams come true
You've made the heavens and the stars
Everything, come on how hard
Could it be, to make her love me?

[Verse 2]
I've said some things I shouldn't have
Tried everything to win her back
I'm human, I messed up, Is she gone?, Are we done?
Forgiveness, another chance, that's all I want, it's in your hands

[Chorus]
I've seen what you can do
I've seen you make miracles and hopeless dreams come true
You've made the heavens and the stars
Everything, come on how hard
Could it be, To make her love me?

I've seen what you can do
I've seen you make miracles and hopeless dreams come true
You've made the heavens and the stars
(heavens and the stars)
Everything, come on how hard
Could it be, to make her love me?

[Outro]
To make her love me, yeah
To make her love me
(oooo)
