[Verse 1]
From the moment that we met
My world was turned around
Upside down
To some degree I still regret
My memory for keeping you around
Girl I thought that you were mine
But my broken hearts been shattered
One too many times

[Chorus]
And I don't want to see you anymore
I'm just not that strong
I love it when you're here
But I'm better when you're gone
I'm certain that I've given and oh how you can take
There's no use in you looking
There's nothing left for you to break
Baby please release me
Let my heart rest in pieces

[Verse 2]
Someone let you down again
So you turn to me
Your convenient friend
Oh but I know what you're doing
And what you hope to find
I've seen it a thousand times
Oh the fire we had before
Are now just bitter ashes
Left scattered on the floor

[Chorus][x2]
