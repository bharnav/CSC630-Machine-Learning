[Verse 1]
Do I cry, in the night?
Do I long to hold you tight?
And do I wake, wanting you?
Yes I do
Do I recall, everyday
How you took my breath away?
Do I remember loving you?
Yes I do

[Chorus]
Yes I do dream of all we had together
Yes it's true we lost it all forever
And do I pray anyway?
Yes I do

[Verse 2]
I don't live in the past
Wanting love that wouldn't last
I don't ache, like I used to
Yes I do

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yes I do
Do I pray?
Yes I do dream of all we had together
Yes I do
And Yes I do
