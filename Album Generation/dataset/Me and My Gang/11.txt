[Verse]
Grandma burned the biscuits
Nearly took the house down with it
Now she's in assisted livin'
We all knew that day would come
We knew she was to gone to drive
The day she parked on I-65
Found her on the shoulder cryin'
She didn't know where she was
Its like her mind just quit
Oh but bring up grandpa- its like someone flipped a switch

[Chorus]
A front porch light and a blue Desota
Couple a straws and a coca cola:
You can see it all going down
A handsome boy in army green
A tear on his face- down on a knee
Shaky voice- a diamond ring ...she'll put you in that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948

[Verse 2]
She takes out his medals
A cigar box of letters
Sits and scatters pictures
Black and whites of days gone by
We started losing her when she lost him
But to hear her carry on you'd swear she's seventeen again

[Chorus]
Football games and leaves a'crackling
Walking her home in his letter jacket
You can see it all going down
A perfect night on a front porch glider
Saying goodnight for the next 3 hours
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright
When she talks about that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas 1948

[Outro]
While the world is fading all around her
Sharing a sundae at the counter
He's going on and on about her
But she's right there right now
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas 1948
