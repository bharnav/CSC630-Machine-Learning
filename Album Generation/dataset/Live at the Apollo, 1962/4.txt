[Verse 1]
Lost someone, my love
Someone who's greater than the stars above
Someone who I need
Someone who don't let my heart bleed
Someone that's the one
That's the someone, that's the someone
That I lost

[Chorus]
Don't go to strangers
Come on home to me
I'll love you tomorrow
I'll love you today
Help me, help me
I'm so weak
Gee whiz, I love you
I'm so weak
I'll love you tomorrow

[Verse 2]
I, I lost someone
A million to one
Ten thousand people
I'm my father's son
We need someone
Someone, the only one
That someone who needs someone
A loving some
To care for them, to care for them
Just that someone

[Chorus]
I'll love you tomorrow
Like I love you today
I'm so weak
Don't take my heart away
Come on, come on
Gee whiz, I love you
And don't go to strangers
Come on home to me, come on home to me
I'm so weak, I'm so weak
