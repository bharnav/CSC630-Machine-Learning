Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation
Kansas city born and growing, you won't believe what the boys are blowing
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band

You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo
You'll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo
Suddenly the music hits you, it's a bird in flight that just can't quit you
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band

We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance
Me and you will listen to a little bit of what made the preacher dance

Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section
Either way you're bound to function, 52nd Street's the junction
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band
