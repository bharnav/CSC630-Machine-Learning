[Verse 1]
I could be wrong but I have seen your face before
You were the man that I saw running from his door
You owed him money but you gave him something more

[Chorus]
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?

[Verse 2]
You were the founders of the clinic in the hill
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill

[Chorus]
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?

[Bridge]
When you're born to play the fool
And you've seen all the western movies
Woe to the one who does you wrong
You'll hide in the bushes
Murder the man
With Luger in hand

[Verse 3]
I understood that you will soon be leavin' town
Don't try to call me when they finally run you down
Just give fair warning any time you come around

[Chorus]
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
