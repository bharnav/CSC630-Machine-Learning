[Verse 1]
Placing a smile at the perfect event
Gracing your skin with the side of my hand
If I ever leave I could learn to miss you
But "Sentimental Boy" is my nom de plume

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me save you, hold this rope

[Chorus]
I may never sleep tonight
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
I'll stay awake 'til I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away

[Verse 2]
I feel marooned in this body
Deserted, my organs can go on without me
You can't fly these wings
You can't sleep in this box with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me save you, hold this rope

[Chorus]
I may never sleep tonight
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
I'll stay awake 'til I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away

[Bridge]
So let me save you
Hold this rope and I'll pull you in
'Cause I am an anchor
Save her or feel it sinking in
Let me save you, hold this rope
(This is only the greatest story ever told)
I am an anchor, sinking her
(With lightning in my head to be brought to the world)

[Chorus]
I may never sleep tonight
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
I'll stay awake 'til I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away
