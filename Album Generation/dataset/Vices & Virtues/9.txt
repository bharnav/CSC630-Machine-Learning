[Intro]
Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me
Dès le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants
J'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour
Je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret

[Verse 1]
My wing tips waltz across naive
Wood floors, they creak
Innocently down the stairs
Drag melody
My percussive feet serve cobweb headaches as a
Matching set of marching clocks
The slumbering apparitions
That they've come to wake up
Here I am composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks
Sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads
They asked for it
As a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart
On haunting me forever
From the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met
I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing
That makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met
I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

[Verse 2]
How does a heart love if no one has noticed its presence
And where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart
On haunting me forever
From the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met
I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing
That makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met
I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go
Ever since we met
I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing
That makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met
I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

[Outro]
Mona Lisa, pleased to please you
(And that one regret is you)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please you
(And that one regret is you)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please you
