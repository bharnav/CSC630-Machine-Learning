[Intro]
(Only for you
Only for you)

[Verse 1]
They said, "If you don't let it out
You're gonna let it eat you away"
I'd rather be a cannibal, baby
Animals like me don't talk anyway
Feel like an ambulance
Chaser of faith
Pray I could replace her
Forget the way her tears taste
Oh, the way her tears taste

[Chorus]
Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

[Verse 2]
The world may call it a second chance
But when I came back it was more of a relapse
Anticipation's on the other line
And obsession called while you were out
Yeah, it called while you were out

[Chorus]
Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

[Verse 3]
Asleep in the hive
I guess all the buzzing got to me
Well, I am still alive
At night your body is a symphony
And I am conducting

[Bridge]
They said if you don't let it out
You're going to let it eat you away

[Chorus]
Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

[Instrumental Outro]
