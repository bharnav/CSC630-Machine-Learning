[Intro]
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
You've got these little things
That you've been running from
You either love them or I guess you don't
You're such a pretty thing
To be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me right now
You think you're ready for it
I wanna know
Why you got me going
So let's go
We'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leap
I'm ready to live

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I am ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 2]
You've got these little things
You wanted something for them
You either get it or I guess you won't
What does it really mean
To get nothing from anyone?
There's a million ways it could go

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me right now
You think you're ready for it
I wanna know
Why you got me going
So let's go
We'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leap
I'm ready to live

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

[Bridge]
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
