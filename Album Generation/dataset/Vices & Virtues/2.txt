[Verse 1]
Are you worth your weight in gold?
'Cause you're behind my eyelids when I am all alone
Hey, stranger, I want you to catch me like a cold
You and God both got the guns
When you shoot, I think I'd duck

[Pre-Chorus]
I led the revolution in my bedroom
And I set all the zippers free
We said, "No more war, no more clothes!"
Give me peace
Oh, kiss me

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane
Drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same
A fire in a flask to keep us warm
'Cause they know, I know
That they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know
That they don't sound like me

[Post-Chorus]
You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'd confess, I'd confess
In a room where Iâ€™m blessed
But he didn't come and speak to me
Or put my heart at ease
And I believe that half the time
I am a wolf among the sheep
Gnawing at the wool over my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I led the revolution in my bedroom
And I set all the zippers free
We said, "No more war, no more clothes!"
Give me peace
Oh, kiss me

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane
Drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same
A fire in a flask to keep us warm
'Cause they know, I know
That they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know
That they don't sound like me

[Post-Chorus]
You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!

[Bridge]
Fix me or conflict me
I'll take anything
Fix me or just conflict me
'Cause I'll take anything

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane
Drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same
A fire in a flask to keep us warm
'Cause they know, I know
That they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know
That they don't sound like me

[Post-Chorus]
You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!
