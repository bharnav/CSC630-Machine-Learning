Yume no katachita ai no nai asu to
Onahara he dappi shiyou ka
Sui mo ama sa ni otoru mono
Mada hoshii hazu no
Hangyaku ron katate ni tomato wo kajiru
Kaumi ni tsukisasaru naifu
Konya dake wa hanasa nai ? Kieusero
Lost in mind
Naeru nichijou nara kagi wo akete ?
Kurae nai butsuri gaku no yuuutsu ka ?
Kaze wa itsu kataru ? Hizashi to ochi ta mabuta
Aishiae nai souseiji
Greed
Asu mo wagami inoreyo saa
No More No
Nare wa hateha
No More No
Asu mo waga ka mi chikae yo saa
No More No
Imawashiki asu no tame
Focus
Amami ni tsukisasaru naifu
Dacchiwaifu ni haha maiban tsukitate sousouai
Kaze wa itsu kataru ? Hizashi to ochi ta mabuta
Aishiae nai souseiji
Asu mo wagami inoreyo saa
No More No
Nare wa hate ta
No More No
Asu mo wagami chikae yo saa
No More No
Saraba hana saku shi yori

Do you want to molt into boundless ocean
With a loveless future in the shape of a dream?
The bitter is worse than the sweet
You must want the [?]
I bite into the tomato with a treacherous theory in one hand
So tonight, I'm not going to let you go...get out of my sight
Lost in mind
If your daily life withers, then open the lock...
Has the unbearable physics turn melancholic?
When will the wind speak?
The sunlight and the closed eyes
Twins, unable to become lovers
Greed
Let us pray for ourselves tomorrow, go on
No more no
A mere shadow of one's former self has appeared
No more no
Let us swear for ourselves tomorrow, go on
No more no
For the loathsome tomorrow
Focus
The knife stabs into sweetness
Stick it up the love-doll every night, perpetually in love with each other
Let us pray for ourselves tomorrow, go on
No more no
A mere shadow of one's former self has appeared
No more no
So, let us swear for ourselves tomorrow
No more no
Goodbye, from the death of the blossoming flower
