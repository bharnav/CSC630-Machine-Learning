It bursts from imagination
And from imagination, delusion is erased leading to suicide
You are delusional right?
A thousand corpses
Need

A great spring for all
The narrowing wall of flesh
Is it broken?
Since when?
I love you... that's why

Behind the wall where you hear the sound of the organ playing
Press your ears against it to hear
Behind the wall where you hear the sound of the organ playing
Madmen
Dead Line
Nightmare

Imagine
The parched-earth color of summer
The amount of sweat and blood is too great
It's impossible to wipe clean... End Of Era

Behind the wall where you hear the sound of the organ playing
Press your ears against it to hear
Behind the wall where you hear the sound of the organ playing
Madmen
Dead Line
Nightmare

Imagine
The parched-earth color of summer
The amount of sweat and blood is too great

A split second of pleasure
Breaking into paradise
Now, let's lock the door and turn on the lights
Say What You Like

The bitter sin melted by the morning sickness
Let's make love to the gorgeous past, which is all a pile of make belief

Burn It Down
That self-centered personality
I am in a distorted relationship with your sad beautiful self
Do You Love Me?

Today again, I listen to the melody of the screams
