The echo to your yell
The ripple to your dive
The currents under your wave

Electricity
Flows through me
I send it out to you
We were charged
With the founding poles
Of a million years
A million years
Before us
Have trembled in their fears

Never saw you never heard you
But i knew that you where there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

I know that i am just a grain of sand
Meeting water at the land
We could make our castles here
And sweep them all away

I know that i am just a drop of water
Frozen into ice on the stormy earth
Who gave us birth
Over and over in cycles
Lovely cycles

Never saw you never heard you
But i knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me

Never saw you never heard you
But i knew that you were there
Everywhere
I could feel you all around me
