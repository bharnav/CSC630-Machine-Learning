I have seen you in various stages of undress
I have seen you through various states of madness
I have seen your refractions and I did not recognize you
I have seen you in various states of madness

How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?
How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?

I am sorry I had nothing left for you
My mind was willing and my spirit was strong
My lips were tired and tightened from singing along
My eyelids are heavy as anchors thrown over

How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?
How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?

I have seen you in the eyes of a hundred thousand other stranger faces
I have seen you in unlikely and unfamiliar places
I have seen you be reckless in matters of love
I have seen by degrees the boiling point come and go

How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?
How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?
What lies at the end of this long and dark and twisted road?
How high your highest of heights? How low are your lows?

I have seen you in various stages of undress
I have seen you through various states of madness
