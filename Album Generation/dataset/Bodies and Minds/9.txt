It goes on forever along the shoreline
It never will end on the shores of my mind
I travel alongâ€˜til the sleep takes me in
Where have I ended, where do I begin?

Sand blankets are littered with stones whipped across
Dead things in the water, forgotten or lost
The branches have surfaced and now they are lean
The trees have washed up here
Stripped bare, and washed clean

The waves kiss and gently caress on the shore
Kissing and winking, and calling for more
The waves like wagging tongues do adore
And whisper there softly to the sand on the shore

You would be nothing without me
I could be nothing
Said the waves to the sand
I could be nothing without you

Each ones shifts and weakens a little
Neither aware just how much they are brittle
Each one shifts and weakens a bit
Allowing the other to live and exist

O water and patience, pressure and time
Cuts through the faces of rocks we have climbed
The army of kisses, the lake never tires
The kisses that can put out all of my fires

You could be nothing without me
I could be nothing
Said the waves to the sand
I could be nothing without you
Without you, I would be nothing
Without me, you could be nothing
Said the waves to the sand
I could be nothing without you
