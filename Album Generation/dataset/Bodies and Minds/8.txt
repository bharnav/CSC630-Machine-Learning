I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I knew you in the wild

You were nervous, you were furious
You were very sure-footed
Dreams and intentions
Full of wonder and amazement(?)
The fire in your eyes
You were in your disguise
You were haunted you were hollow
You could not see tomorrow

In the wild
I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I knew you in the wild

In the books, in the trees
You were spreading your own needs(?)
And their hats all went off to you
They were trying to show respect for you
I was riddled with worry
You were all in a hurry
Crystallized mess of things
There was a fear in it and all a great(?)

In the wild
I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I knew you in the wild

Holding onto high ideals
Living incongruously
You were there among the leaves
Your needs were directing you
And the wilderness, it spoke to you
They were threatened to choke you
You were always aware
You could sense that i was there

In the wild
I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I knew you in the wild

I could tell by your look
You came from a book
And i read many times
All your funniest(?) lines
And the branches with the sages
I turned all the pages
We were two sets of eyes
Two fires burning behind

In the wild
I saw you in the wild
I saw you in the wild
I knew you in the wild
