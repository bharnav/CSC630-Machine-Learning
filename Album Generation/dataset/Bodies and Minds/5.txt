When we were greened and young as shoots
The world took off beneath our boots
Oh we were picked when we were young
Gentle words and modesty
When we turned towards the tide
Choirs screamed in their delight
Oh i am ripe and ready now
My heart is heavy, it's going to fall
Out of my body

Unto love, unto love
Oh my heart is heavy, it's going to fall
Out of my body

Would have died without
Your gardens of eternal life
That you kept so well, kept so well
Could have lived without
The fall into the tragedy
But i'm not adam
And you're not eve
They were brave enough to leave
When they were told leave it behind

Leave it behind
It behind
They were brave enough to leave
When they were told
Leave it behind
