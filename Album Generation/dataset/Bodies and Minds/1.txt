My heart is with you, its many dark corners
Its rings of smoke, its lighted hallways
And I wish you could know all the ghosts in my bones
They are weeping, they are screaming
They are inside my body

O, let's trade skins
I'm rippling in this skin that I'm in
You could wear my shoes, I could have your hair
And think that it was fair
I'm rippling in the skin that I'm in

"I'm gonna build you," she said, "I'm gonna heal you
I can feel every part of you
That holds it together"
And you always looked so happy when you were sleeping
Sleep is the only way sometimes
To live in a perfect world

It's party time, quiet and sublime
Tonight there's a party, a party of one
Like a wisp of smoke, solitary and thin
The heat's coming off the fires we built

Stars were meant to shoot
And waves were meant to crash
I'm hypnotized by the flicker, and saddened by the ash
And it's complicated with desires and dreams
With stiches and battle scars pulling apart at the seams

O, let's trade skins
I'm rippling in this skin that I'm in
You could wear my shoes, I could have your hair
And think that it was fair
I'm rippling in the skin that I'm in
