I was born in a house of glass and silver floors
There were so many people wearing masks
One question with two answers I asked

[Chorus]
Anywhere is better than here, away from you
Breed me, breed me, give me away
Lie to me, you lie to me, give me away, oh

What do you say?
Just you and I
South on the five
For a couple of days?
You take your car
I'll take my bag
You take the wheel
I'll gather money for gas

[Chorus]

Danny, oh, Danny, oh, Danny, Danny
Danny, yeah, Danny, oh, Danny, Danny

I was born to be given away
Breed me, breed me, give me away
Lie to me, you lie to me, give me away, oh

They told me
A little boy who had been wearing my face
Had told me I was born to be given away
