There's an ocean out my window
There's beauty in its tears
There's an ocean out my window
It's crashing in my ears

Oh, sea, your shelter
You dance between my toes
When I feel like I can't move forward
You carry me like a father

Breathing is the hardest thing I do
I'm not the only person in the room
It's hard for me, to feel like I'm perfect
