[Verse 1]
If ignorance is bliss
Then eradicate my knowledge of my history
Now meaningless left on my own
I looked for a long time
Crossed paths with your kind
But some things are better left alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wake up lonely, hating my life
Alone
Wake up lonely, hating* my life

[Chorus]
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again

[Verse 2]
Just bodies, they bite, they scratch
They crawl at golden souls
Hue pictures you won't see or never know
Just bodies, these golden souls
With pictures were deleted
Heaved into the ocean to drown with their brothers

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Brothers
Wake up lonely, hating my life
Their brothers
Wake up lonely, hating my life

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Come again
Come again
Oh shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Oh shame on me
Come again
