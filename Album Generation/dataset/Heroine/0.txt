[Intro]
Mothersound
What have they done to you?
You're withering away in the cold
Mothersound
Once again the world's molested you
And took your soul

[Chorus ]
I have done this for the sound
Have done this for the sake of you
The sake of me;
And you can mark my fucking words:
"We aren't a mock-supposed to be."
We're here to rouse the rabble

[Verse 1]
Thanks to you
We get our ace fix
From exposing what you are
And what you've done
You've poisoned the litter
No better time, than now
To change what has been written;
And what has been taught
To those who would not have known
Better

[Chorus]

Oooh oh!

[Chorus](x2)
