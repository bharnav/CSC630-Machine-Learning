[Verse 1]
How does it feel to be ashamed
Of who you love, oh, I know
You wore me out so proudly
Hidden in the glitter is the real thing, real

[Chorus]
Always knew
What you were
Always knew

[Bridge]
You walk on water, you sing that lovely tune (x3)
You walk on water
You sing, sing

[Chorus]

[Hook 1]
The crows are coming for us
Let them live, let them live

[Hook 2](x5)
The crows are hungry for us
Let them live, let them live

[Outro]
Always knew
What you were
Always knew
What you were
(The crows are coming for us)
Always knew
(The crows are hungry for us)
What you were
(The crows are coming for us)
