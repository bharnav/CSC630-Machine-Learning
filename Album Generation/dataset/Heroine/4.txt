[Verse 1]
Let's starve down to the bone, we're looking better boney
Who needs figure anyway?
Stay with me, stay with me
So I can dig my nails deep in your cave

[Verse 2]
It feels better now without control, oh girl
You look better blurry angel
Why do we need to be sanitary
When the world's so filthy anyway?

[Chorus]
Oh poor me, oh poor you, ohhh (x2)
Poor unfortunate child
I can't stop running away

[Verse 3]
I'm a one life, hopeless dirty animal baby
And I bow down to my feeble brain
Aberrated, primitive
Stay with me, stay with me

[Verse 4]
No food for weeks I've never felt better
We look, better-famished girl
Hightail to the lush escape
And leave our filthy world away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm on the verge of self-destruction
Suffering because of my selfish vices
I'm on the verge of self-destruction
Suffering because I gave up on myself and everyone

[Outro]
Oh poor me, oh poor you, ohhh (x2)
Poor unfortunate child
I can't stop running away
Poor unfortunate child
(I can't stop, I can't stop)
I can't stop running away
