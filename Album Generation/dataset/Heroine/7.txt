[Chorus]
Now!
Rise, rise, rise to fall
I never cared, never cared to try until now
To find home
The distance grows as the ground approaches

[Verse 1]
Faith, at least in the form of gravity
Keeps me low at the ladder
Time to crawl to the salty heel that pins my life

[Chorus]

Now!

[Chorus]

[Coda](x2)
Climb, climb, climb to fall
