[Verse 1]
Every day gets worse
Locked in a vice my thoughts perverse
You must wonder why I look at you that way (that way)
Tonight I'll make my way into your house
I must; I'm lusting for your body
Skin looks tight, think I just might have
To take a bite, but I know one will turn
To three or four or more my little whore

[Chorus 1]
Tonight, tonight she's not alone
(can you taste the wicked in the room?)
Bobbysoxer, so pure, so young
By morning, her soul will be gone, gone

[Verse 2]
I did a beautiful thing
Relax baby, that's a good girl
You're like my work of art
I can control, I can contort any
Position that I wish
I make my fantasy reality
Hold still, it will be over soon

[Chorus 2]
Tonight, tonight she's not alone
(can you taste the wicked in the room?)
Bobbysoxer, so pure, so young
By morning, her soul will be gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
I blend with the walls so I won't be seen
My love, you smell so
I took one good look
I followed you home

[Chorus 3]
Tonight, tonight she's not alone
(can you taste the wicked in the room?)
Bobbysoxer, so pure, so young
By morning, her soul will be gone!
