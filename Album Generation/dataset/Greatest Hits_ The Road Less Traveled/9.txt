Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

If I wanted to
I could do anything right
I could dance with the devil
On a Saturday night
If I wanted to
I could turn matches to gold
Smoke, drink, swear
And I would never grow old
I wouldn't have to be
In love with you

If I only wanted to
Yeah, if I only wanted to

If I wanted to
I could run fast as a train
Be as sharp as a needle
That's twisting your brain
If I wanted to
I could turn mountains to sand
Have political leaders
In the palm of my hand
I wouldn't have to be
In love with you

If I only wanted to
Yeah, if I only wanted to

I could leave tonight
And I would be alright
Stop holding on
If I wanted to
If I only wanted to

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... oh, oh
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

If I wanted to
I could be as patient as death
Fix this hole in my heart
Leaking into my flesh
If I wanted to
I could turn sparks into ice
There'd never be another woman
Who could make you think twice
I wouldn't have to be
In love with you

If I only wanted to
Yeah, if I only wanted to
Yeah, if I only wanted to
Yeah, if I only wanted to

Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... oh, oh
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... oh, ah, hey
If I wanted to
Eh, hey, hey
If I wanted to
Eh, hey, hey
If I wanted to
If I wanted to

Oh...
Oh... oh, oh
Ah
