Come on, baby
Let's get out of this town
I got a full tank of gas
With the top rolled down
There's a chill in my bones
I don't want to be left alone
So baby, you can sleep while I drive

I'll pack my bag
And load up my guitar
In my pocket
I'll Carry my harp
I got some money I saved
Enough to get underway
And baby, you can sleep while I drive

We'll go thorough Tucson
Up to Santa Fe
And Barbra in Nashville
Says we're welcome to stay
I'll buy you glasses in Texas
A hat from New Orleans
And in the morning
You can tell me your dreams

You know I've seen it before
This mist that covers your eyes
You've been looking for something
That's not in your life
My intentions are true
Won't you take me with you?
And baby, you can sleep while I drive

Oh... is it other arms you want to
Hold you, the stranger
The lover, you're free
Can't you get that with me?

Come on, baby
Let's get out of this town
I got a full tank of gas
With the top rolled down
If you won't take me with you
I'll go before night is through
And baby, you can sleep while I drive
