Hello, hello
This is Romeo
Calling from a jackpot telephone
Shame, shame
But I love your name
And the way you make the buffalo roam
Oh... fly, fly
I guess this is goodbye
Oh, you packed up your heart
And you left no souvenirs

But if you want me
You can call me
In the night you know
Where I'll be
Broken lover
You can touch me
In the dark
The innocent can't see

You lock it up now
Hide the key
It would mean surrender
To let me see
Oh, brave, brave soldier
Keep it under cover
You fell alone
Like no other lover

Burn the pictures
Break the records
Run far away
To a Northern town
Sell your fear
And leave me standing here
With no souvenirs

Once, twice
I thought it might be nice
To come into your kitchen and play
Cool, cool
Just a crazy fool
I never saw it any other way
Oh... wait, wait
I guess I'm just too late
Oh, you made up your mind
Love shouldn't be so hard

But if you want me
You can call me
In the nights you know
Where I'll be
Broken lover
You can touch me
In the dark
The innocent can't see

You lock it up now
Hide the key
It would mean surrender
To let me see
Oh, brave, brave soldier
Keep it under cover
You fell alone
Like no other lover

Burn the pictures
Break the records
Run far away
To a northern town
Sell your fear
And leave me standing here
With no souvenirs

No shirts, no shoes
No jackets, no blues
Your car's for sale
You forward your mail
You're growing your hair
You don't want to know
Where I'm calling you from
Or how come

But if you want me
You can call me
In the nights you know
Where I'll be
Broken lover
You can touch me
In the dark
The innocent can't see

You lock it up now
Hide the key
It would mean surrender
To let me see
Brave, brave soldier
Keep it under cover
You fell alone
Like no other lover

Burn the pictures
Break the records
Run far away
To a northern town
Sell your fear
And leave me standing here
With no souvenirs
Yeah...

Hello, hello
This is Romeo
