[Verse 1]
Sometimes I know
That it's never enough
Survival is fine
But satisfaction is rough
I try with an angel tonight

Spread these wings
And I'm on for the ride
Cruise these streets
Where my innocence hides
There's some things you can't deny

What is it about
This human condition?
I need some kind of promise
Some kind of submission tonight

[Chorus]
Heavy
Ain't it heavy?
Ain't the night heavy?
Heavy
Ain't it heavy?
Ain't the night heavy?

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' kinda loose
I'm feelin' kinda mean
I've been feeling kinda wild
Since I've turned seventeen
Or is it madness?

Tell me where can a woman
Find any kind of peace?
When does the fury
And the agony cease?
How long have I got to say "Please"?

There's a hole in my jeans
I only wanted to fade
I've been ripping out seams
Somebody else made tonight

[Chorus]
Heavy
Ain't it heavy?
Ain't the night heavy?
Heavy
Ain't it heavy?
Ain't the night heavy?

Mmh...
Mmh...
So heavy
Cause a woman needs
Yes, a woman needs
Some peace, please
Please, please
It's never enough

(Heavy)
Mmh... you feel so
Feel so
(Heavy)
Feels so, so
(Ain't the night heavy?)
Tonight
(Heavy)
Tonight
(Ain't the night heavy)
Hey...
(Heavy)
(Heavy)
It feels so heavy
(Ain't the night heavy)
Oh, heavy
(Heavy)
(Ain't the night heavy)
Oh, so heavy
(Heavy)
This night is so heavy
(Heavy)
It's so heavy
(Heavy)
Ain't the night heavy
(Heavy)
Come on, come on
(Heavy)
(Heavy)
(Ain't the night heavy)
Oh...
(Heavy)
(Heavy)
(Ain't the night heavy)
(Heavy)
(Heavy)
