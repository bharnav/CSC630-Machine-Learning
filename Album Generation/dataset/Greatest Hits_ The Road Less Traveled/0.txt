We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret, all the same
Somehow we get around it
Listen, it don't really matter to me baby
You believe what you want to believe, you see

You don't have to live like a refugee

Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you want to lay there and revel in your abandon
Honey, it don't make no difference to me baby
Everybody has to fight to be free, you see

You don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Oh baby you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Oh baby we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other loves been cursed
Right now it seems real to you, but it's
One of those things you gotta feel to be true

Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some
Who knows maybe you were kidnapped, tied up
Taken away and held for ransom
Honey, it don't really matter to me
Baby, everybody has to fight to be free, you see

You don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby you don't have to live like a refugee
