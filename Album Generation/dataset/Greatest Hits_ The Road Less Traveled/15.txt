Bravely you let go of my hand
I can't speak yet you understand
Where I go now I go alone
This path I walk these days of stone

And the angels are calling

[Chorus:]
I must go away
Wait for me here
Silently stay
And don't ask me why
Only believe
This is not good bye

All of my strength all my desire
Still cannot melt this breath of fire
I go to meet some kind of test
Bury the truth that scars my chest

And the angels are calling and calling

[Chorus]
I gathered all my courage
I shaved off all my fear
With this banner on my shoulder
I hold your essence near

And the angels are calling and calling and calling
