[Chorus]
When I’m riding home at night now
I get in so tired
To the saws and bows that spell out
E-M-P-T-Y

[Verse 1]
But driving west now, half past five
My skin is cut, my hands are knives
I could be anyone alive
But I just can't fit and it's too late to quit

[Verse 2]
When the night air comes to me
I wonder if the days I've lived through count
With the world strung like a rosary
Through faces moving in the crowd

[Verse 3]
What is the colour and the number
When the happiness begins?
When the knight waits in the laurels
Hesitating

[Verse 4]
I found a clarity I'd never known
In fag-end weeks before I left for school
The darkness in the pylons and the smoke and creosote
Canceling the faces that we knew

[Verse 5]
Did they forget the light inside your eyes?
Those simple words, those lover's sighs?
The hand is dealt, the cards are played
But I just can't fit and it's too late to quit

[Bridge]
I saw them and I knew them all
Inside a sheet of flame
I saw them and I knew them all
Inside a sheet of flame

[Chorus]
When I’m riding home at night now
I get in so tired
To the saws and bows that spell out
E-M-P-T-Y
E-M-P-T-Y
E-M-P-T-Y
