[Verse 1]
In the silence of the garden
Moths are rising on the wind
And the beast is pondering love, love, love
'Till the rusty nails grow dim

[Chorus]
I can't seem to make you mine
Through the long and lonely night
And I try so hard, darling
But the crowd pulled you away
Through the ribbons and the rain
And the ivy coiled around my hands

[Verse 2]
So I lingered with the people
In the silent August glade
But the rain has brought the night
And the night has brought the rain

[Chorus]
I can't seem to make you mine
Through the long and lonely night
And I try so hard, darling
But the crowd pulled you away
Through the ribbons and the rain
And the ivy coiled around my hands
