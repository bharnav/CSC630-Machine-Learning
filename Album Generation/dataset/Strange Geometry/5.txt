[Verse 1]
When I came home from the party
Everything had changed
The city was beside itself
Just one inch away

[Verse 2]
Alright, my tongue gets split, my hands are gloves
I just can't quite shake it off
I just can't quite shake it off
I just can't quite shake it off

[Verse 3]
When I came home from the movies
Through each tenement line
The city was in rapture for
The twenty-second time

[Verse 4]
Alright, they haunted you in middle school
All the sunlit faces
Marching through the crowd
All the sunlit faces marching through the crowd

[Outro]
All that day and all that night our dead friends walked into the streets
Their faces in the doorways like a mirror to your photographs
They mingled with the crowds until the living and the dead became each other
