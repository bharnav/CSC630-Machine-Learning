[Verse 1]
Help me
Define the light that's shinning on me
To get back what they've taken from me
And build a little fire where it's cold
Show me
The path that leads to all the glory
The words that tell a sacred story
And build a little fire where it's cold

[Chorus]
I wanna live in a dream
In my record machine
I want a piece of the world
And everyone inside my mouth
And all the money I waste
Is it a matter of taste?
I want a piece of the world
And you can't make me spit it out

[Verse 2]
Take me
Back from the darkness where they sent me
I give hope to places where it can't be
And build a little fire where it's cold

[Chorus]
I wanna live in a dream
In my record machine
I want a piece of the world
And everyone inside my mouth
And all the money I waste
Is it a matter of taste?
I want a piece of the world
And you can't make me spit it out

[Outro]
You can't give me a reason
I don't need one to shine
You can't give me a feeling
If it's already mine
'Cause I'm one in a million
And if the sun don't rise on my soul
Then I'll blow
