[Verse 1]
Someday you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
I'm keeping my head down now for the summer
I'm out of my mind but pour me another
I'm going to take that tiger outside for a ride

[Chorus]
What a life
What a life

[Verse 2]
Keep on chasing down that rainbow
You'll never know what you might find
Over the sunset on the horizon
It may be a dream but it tastes like poison
I'm going to take that tiger outside for a ride

[Chorus]
What a life
What a life

[Chorus]
What a life
What a life

[Chorus]
What a life
What a life

[Chorus]
What a life
What a life

[Outro]
Someday you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
