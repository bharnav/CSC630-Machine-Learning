[Verse 1]
All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about to speak
For soldier boys and Jesus freaks
They go to heaven on their holidays
The congregation hopes and prays
They leave their letters in the mail box
For lonely souls they could not save

[Verse 2]
Off and on I used to hear the call
When she was just a baby doll
And all around the world the holy men
Will twist the words of way back when
She will kiss the sky and shelter the world from the rain
Put on a record on the jukebox
She might dance the night away

[Chorus 1]
On and on we go
But the restless world outside
May soon explode
And there's no place we might hide

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus 2]
On and on we go
But the rest of the world outside
May soon explode
And there's no place we might hide
And on we go
'Til we kiss this world goodbye
And on and on and on and on

[Verse 3]
All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about to speak
For soldier boys and Jesus freaks
