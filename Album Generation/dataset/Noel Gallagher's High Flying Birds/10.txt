[Verse 1]
When I feel like a drop in the ocean
But there's no one else at sea
And my body is bent and broken
Let the Lord shine a light on me

[Verse 2]
Now the voices in the distance
Try to sing my soul to sleep
But I'm drifting in the silence
Let the Lord shine a light on me
Let the Lord shine a light on me

[Verse 3]
If I raise you up to the top of the mountain
Would you tell me what you see?
Am I stranded on this island?
Did the Lord shine a light on me?
Did the Lord shine a light on me?
Did the Lord shine a light on me?
Did the Lord shine a light on me?
