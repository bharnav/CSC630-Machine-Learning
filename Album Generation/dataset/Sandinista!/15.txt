Summon up the mas! Play on the pan!

Starin' dreads are jerking their locks
The White Star liner sank in the docks
On the drummers face, there is a look of dread
He drums away 400 years of dread
The dancer man, with the the power of mas
Smoking to the mighty sparrow's blast
But you better be careful
You still got to watch, watch yourself

You want to be crazy
So you want to go crazy
Let's go crazy
(x2)

The lawful force are here of course
For special offenders for the special court
But the young men know when the sun has set
Darkness comes to settle the debt
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest
They're waiting for the sun to set
They're waiting for the sun to set

(Chorus)

The mighty observer keeps his cabinets hot
A great meeting of a'rhythm and a'rhythm and face
Humming of valves and a children's place
The sticks man gives the copper good excuse
To shut off the ganja and control the juice
Control the juice
Control the juice

(Chorus)

Bricks and bottles
Corrugated iron
Shields and helmets
Carnival time

Take it on crazy
'N moa ambassa
Take it on crazy
Sledgehammer sound
Take it on crazy
Ray symbolic
Take it on crazy
From jam-down town
