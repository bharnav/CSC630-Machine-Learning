Is your situation
Working out?
Well, I heard your playstation

So come downtown, hangin' around, alright

Eh

Did you dissapoint the chairman
Of the board?
And now your days getting longer
Than they did before?

Downtown, hangin' around, alright

There is always room for one more
All together now

We know you've been such a good boy
But now the day is done
Are you waiting to get older
To have a little fun?
You should come
Downtown, hangin' around, alright

Alright ye-eah

To take a holiday?

Oh yeah

Tell a lie
Watever it takes to get to

All together now

All together now
