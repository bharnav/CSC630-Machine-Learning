Come on, Baby
Why the long face?
You're messing up my head space!
I can see you've had a hard day
Let's talk about it anyway

Hey- there's million ways to do the same thing
Don't you know if you got problems
That I'm here to help you solve 'em?

Love, I'm only tryin to help
I'm only tryin to make it through another day

I don't always say the right thing
So let me make it better
But if I try to write it down
Don't go tearing up my letter

Hey- there's a million ways to do the same thing
I know I don't always get it
But you've got to give me credit

Love, I'm only tryin to help
I'm only tryin to make it through another day

Communication shake-down
It's always the same thing
You're still my favorite meltdown
I'd give you everything
I've seen this movie before
We give/ We take even more
You're still the team I am for
But you can't stop keeping score!

Love, I'm only tryin, to help
I'm only tryin, to make it through another day

Let me get my way
(You always get your way.)
