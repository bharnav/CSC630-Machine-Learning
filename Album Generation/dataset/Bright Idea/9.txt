I guess I'm hanging out alone
And I'm selfish to complain
Cause you've always got the best excuse

There's no use in forcing you to stay-
(You'd kick my weak butt, anyway)
I'll watch you on the evening news

It's just that I see you next to zero-
It's so hard lovin a super hero

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world

You're sliding on my favorite boots
And those tights are such a tease
But you never wear that stuff for me

Look up in the sky
It's not a bird or a plane
It's the sweetest crime fighter that I've ever seen-
I just wish she'd call in sick
And just stay home

So go and make the world just a little safer-
I'll read all about it in tomorrow's paper

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world

I'm so over jumping off buildings
You catching my fall
So I'll brush up on my Super Villain
And I might see you more

I know you're undercover
But I want you under the covers
It doesn't feel like I'm asking a lot...

You're too busy saving the world
And I think I need saving the most
And I know that you'd stay here if you could
But you're too busy saving the world
