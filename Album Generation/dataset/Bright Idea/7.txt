Last Call, unaware of all my surroundings
Off guard, and your cue to begin your scheme
I took a chance, you took my heart
And then you took all my money
I was blind-sided by a smile
That wasn't what it seemed

I'm talking about last night

Your mouth was making words that seemed
At the time, very sensible
Your body trembled
And secretly called my name
You said," Can I see you later? -
Cause I'd like to spend some time with you..."
How could I know that it was only just for show? -
Cause when the lights came on
You were gone
I was standing all alone

Last Night

Rock Bottom is where you'll find me
If you really need me
Rock Bottom-
With the other victims of your game

Now I'm on the floor
And I'm back for more
And I'm praying to be your prey
Now you're not so sure
More than you bargained for?

Last Night
