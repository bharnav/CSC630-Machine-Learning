Are you tired of counting eggs that will never hatch?
Did you bite off more than you can chew?
Are you sad cause the grass is always greener?
Well, babe, you look much better in red and blue

Everything will be okay
Just give it just a minute longer-
Cause a brighter star is on the way
Everything will be okay
Remember when the rain is falling-
It's alright

So fear itself is the only thing we have to fear?
But - fear can be so much fun with a friend or two
And don't you be so afraid to meet your Maker-
Cause I hear that She's just as scared of you

Everything will be okay
Just give it just a minute longer-
Cause a brighter star is on the way
Everything will be okay
Remember when the rain is falling-
It's alright to go outside and play
