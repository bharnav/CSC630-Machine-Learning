Did somebody tell you what I couldn't tell you?
I hope they did
(I hope they didn't)

Will I learn to regret it, or should I forget it?
Whatever this is- it feels electric

You shot me a sweet look
Gave me your Year Book
Told me to sign...
It was a signal

But I couldn't find the words
I just couldn't find the nerve
As usual

Here's my Bright Idea
I'll just disappear!
I'll just fly away from here

Now you're in Hollywood (right in my neighborhood)
Things are really looking up for you...
An army of managers and lots of pretty boys lining up
Just to meet with you

I could've sworn that it you that I bumped to just the other day
At the record store

But I still don't have a clue
I just couldn't talk to you
As usual

Here's my Bright Idea
I'll just disappear!
Here's my Bright Idea
I'll just disappear!
I'll just fly away from here

So I come to your Event
In my well-rehearsed mystique
I show up an hour late-
But I've been ready for a week
Then you float into the hallway
Like some neon silhouette
I'm slowly losing oxygen
And my hands are soaking wet
All the cameras and reporters
Piling up on one another
Just to get a look at you
They all want an interview
Then I make my move
Push them out of my way
But I still just don't know what to say...

Here's my Bright Idea
I'll just disappear!
Here's my Bright Idea
I'll just disappear!
I'll just fly away from here

Here's my Bright Idea
Here's my Bright Idea
Here's my Bright
Here's my Bright
Here's my Bright Idea, woah
