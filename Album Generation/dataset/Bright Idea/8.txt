Baby, wake up
Baby, come see
And if you lose your way
Just hold on to me
The flames have all died out
Our hearts are still beating
The rain is gone
The rain is gone

Just look around

Our time is not up
Our place is in the sun
So just wipe the ashes from your eyes, Girl-
There's so much work to be done
And there's no way to be sure
Just be sure to keep breathing
We'll just keep movin' on
We'll keep movin' on

And look around

We're not o. k
But, Baby- we're alright
So just make love to the day
And hold each other tight
Just remember your song
Don't forget to keep singing
Cause our love is a bomb
Our love is a bomb

Just look around
Keep your eyes open, it's alright
Keep your eyes open, it's alright
Make better years from bitter days-
This is our time, This is our place
Look Around

Just look around
