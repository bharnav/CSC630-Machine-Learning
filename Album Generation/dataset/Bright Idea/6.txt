You're so ahead of me
Don't see how that could be-
Did I just miss something here?
It's the worst I fear
My Dear

You're lookin oh-so-cute
Did you just buy that suit?
And you just changed your hair
It's so unfair
I'm tryin not to care

Just remember this-
It's just a kiss
Nobody has to know
And I won't tell anyone
But I know
And I'll be waiting by the phone

All those pictures that you gave me
And all those promises you made me
All mean nothing-
Since you decide to grow up on me
Sorry for this imposition
But I don't get your new condition
But I'll follow along-
And you can walk me like a dog

And I'll take you where you wanna go
And let you play with my radio
But is there nothing more that I can do
To please you?
How 'bout a little clue?

But just remember this-
It's just a kiss
Nobody has to know-
And I won't tell anyone
That I know
That you're just no good alone

All those pictures that you gave me
And all those promises you made me
All mean nothing-
Since you decide to grow up on me
Sorry for this imposition
But I don't get your new condition
But I'll follow along-
And you can walk me like a dog

Yeah
Tell me what to do !
Tell me what to do !
Sorry for this imposition
But I don't get your new condition
But I'll follow along-
And you can walk me like a dog
