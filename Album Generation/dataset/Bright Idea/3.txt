Cue the music
Curtain falls
The lights all fade to gray
Don't think there'll be an encore
For our secret Passion Play

It's time to play the final card
In a game I now despise
To me it seems so obvious-
To you it's such a big surprise

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry
It's already over-
We can't move forward
So let's move on...
Bye-bye

They say parting is such sweet sorrow
But I'm still looking for the sweet
I feel just like a baby-
These tears don't miss a beat

And I'd rather be anyone but Here
And anyplace else but Me
I'll just climb inside my head awhile-
My demons have a date with me

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry
It's already over-
We can't move forward
So let's move on...
Bye-bye

So go ahead, and hate me now
For breaking-up on the phone
But I know that I'd crack if i saw your face-
I deserve to be alone

And I hate that i still love you, girl-
And I only wish you well
But i'll never be man enough for you
And you're a psycho bitch from Hell

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry
It's already over-
We can't move forward
So let's move on...
Bye-bye

So long
Farewell
Bye-bye
