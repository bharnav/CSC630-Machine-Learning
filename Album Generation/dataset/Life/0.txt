[Chorus 1]
I'm going to swim the mountains
I'm going to climb the sea
I'm going to surf the fields in front of me
I'm going to past the buildings like silver cage
Pass the smiling faces with the hidden rage
Til I find you, feel you, breath you, touch you, taste your truth
And I... never going to stop til I get to you

[Chorus 2]
Going to change in a new direction
Make a move with a new intention You are my one and only temptation
I... till I get to you
Going to change in a new direction
Make a move with a new intention
You are my one and only temptation
I

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Til I find you, feel you, breath you, touch you, taste your truth
And I... not going to stop til I get to you

[Chorus 2] [x2]

[Outro]
You are my one and only temptation
Til I get to you
I... til I get to you
