[Verse 1]
You need to fly, to need to flow, you need to let it all go
You need to fall, but you say
Criminal wicked, dirty, sticky don't touch
Surf out the wave we are at the age we don't have to behave
And life is fast or you don't see the clock ticking for me and you

[Chorus 1]
A time to live, a time to love
A time for fun you want to come
Here we go just dance with me, dance with me
Slide you up against the door, tell me

[Chorus 2]
This is good
So what so bad (this is good)
T drives me mad (this is good)
So don't say no (dance with me tonight)

So good to be alive [x2]

[Verse 2]
She'll take a crash, she'll take a dive
And all this will drift with the time
And come to me, I got your salt skin dripping
On the tip of my tongue
So close your eyes and kiss my lips
As if you are as simple as this
We're here tonight and it's so criminal wicked
Dirty, sticky let's touch

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Come walk with me into the night
Feel me inside your body tonight

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
So good to be alive [x8]
