[Verse 1]
Dissipate your every mood
I got nothing left to prove
Something, something I can't explain
Every time I look at you, I realize what I got to do
It's soothing and take you under the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel so nice
Crossing all the lines, taking an chance
Doing what we need to feel alive
And I feel so right
Come and do it now, we got to scream, scream all night

[Chorus] [x2]
It's alright, don't be afraid don't hesitate now
Feels right, let's take it now don't wait for later
Tonight, and if it feels right just let it go
And if it's alright you got to let it flow

[Verse 2]
If I'm wrong don't want to know
If I'm right just let it show
It's crazy, so crazy it just might be
I only care about today, tomorrow is too far away
Let's take it, and run run away with me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I think I love you, and I need you by my side baby to the morning light
I know I want you, what I got for you is love
I got love, love, love, love...

[Chorus] [x2]

[Bridge] [x2]
Don't be afraid don't hesitate now
Let's take it now don't wait for later
And if it feel right just let it go
And if it's alright you got to let it flow [2x]
