[Chorus 1]
Drop it mami, drop it mami
Drop it on me, hey hey
Drop it on me, drop it on me
Drop it on me, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Muevete duro, muevete duro
Muevete duro, muevete duro
Muevete duro, muevete duro
Muevete duro, hey hey
Tonight it's a special night, to get you by my side
I've been waiting all week long to get it on with you
Sometimes we hit the floor, dance like we never did before
I'm going to put it on you Boricua style

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
La, la la la la [x3]

[Verse 2]
Let the music take control, once we start you can't say no
Move your eyes and follow me and te muestro mi amor
Let me feel all tonight
While you whisper something
My hands on your hips to watch you give it all

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x2]

[Outro]
Este canto es tuyo, Corazon es tuyo
Quieres que sea tuyo, dame amor puro
