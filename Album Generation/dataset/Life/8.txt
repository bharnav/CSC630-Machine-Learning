[Verse 1]
I met you on a side, an accidental Hi
And I missed you before I met you
Your lips I want to taste
It's not the time and place
And it can't be, I'm sorry
It's like we've talked a thousand times

[Chorus]
And made love with our eyes
But tonight is not the night
I'm with somebody else and I can't lie
With me and you, it's never good bye
Save the dance for another life

[Verse 2]
I'm guilty in my mind 'cause I can't close my eyes
My spirit, can hear it
So let the music play, the changes I can't make
To heal you, conceal you
It's like we've walked a thousand miles

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Without you
I wish that I could tell you
That tomorrow is all about you
But it's the time to meet you in another life

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
Save the dance for another life [x2]
