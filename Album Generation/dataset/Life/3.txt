[Verse 1]
I want to hide, in your eyes
Hold you tight, and wrap this night around me
I want to feel, to feel you breathe to be
To be where you are, where you are

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To hold while you're sleeping
To be there while you're dreaming

[Chorus]
I wish that we could stop time tonight
Stay in this moment forever
I wish that we could live in this kiss
And stay just like this
Together, together

[Verse 2]
I want to lay here with you
Kiss you slow and hold you close forever
I want to reach, and feel you near, right here
Right here in my arms, in my arms

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To hold you while you're sleeping
To be lost in this feeling

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I just want to stay with you, for always, always
I don't want this night to end
To hold you while you're dreaming

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
Stop time tonight
Stay just like this baby
Together, together
Stop time, tonight
