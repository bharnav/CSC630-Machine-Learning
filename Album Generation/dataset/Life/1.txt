[Chorus]
Sorry babe, won't forget all about you
Can't deny, all the ways that I've hurt you
All i know, life is harder without you, gone away
Baby I won't desert you

[Verse 1]
I was so lost, I was so gone and you so lonely
I didn't realize the things I've done to you
There's no excuse, there's not a way that I convince you
It's hard to find someone that loves the way you do

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the breath that fills my soul, ohhh
You know that now the road is my home
And it's calling me on and on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You want it all, but all we have it's just this moment
I can't promise you anymore than that
So babe look at me and we can make it through this
I never meant for this to make you feel so bad

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it feels like, every road leads me back to you
Sometimes it feels like, the thought of you takes me... home
Takes me home, and it takes me home
Takes me

[Breakdown]
Sorry babe, won't forget all about you, gone away (so much harder without you)
Baby, I won't desert you
Sorry babe, won't forget all about you (every road leads me back to you)
Can't deny, all the ways that I've hurt you (the thought of you takes me)
All I know, life is harder without you, gone away (the thought of you takes me home)
Baby I won't desert you

[Outro]
Every road leads me
Every road leads me darling
Leads me back to you
Back to you
