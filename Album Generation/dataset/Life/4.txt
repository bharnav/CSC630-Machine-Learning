[Verse 1]
Life it's the only thing that you get for free
Free is what we all want to be
Take a walk around the block till you see
Everything you want life to be

[Chorus]
Tell your mother, beg your father
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, don't try to save it
Sooner or later, you will discover
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure
You can make it and don't break it
Oh life is for sure, but it's for sure
You can make it and don't break it

[Verse 2]
It's the love alive gets that is both
Love it's the only dream in my heart and soul
Easier to dream than it is to cry
When you're in a love, goodbye

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Beg your father, don't wait don't bother
Sooner or later, you will discover
You will discover, tell your mother
Respect your sister, talk to your brother
Don't wait don't bother, you will discover

[Outro]
Tell your mother, respect your sister
Don't wait don't bother, you will discover
I thank your mother, thank your father
