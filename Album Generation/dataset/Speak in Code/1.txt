She's doing body shots off Italian guys in Mexico
I'm all alone
She's dancing with a vampire to bilingual disco
I'm all alone

Cause she went to La Playa for the fire show
If I could be a fly upon the wall I would know
I don't mean to be possessive
But baby please, I'm getting desperate

No, I don't believe you went to bed at 10:15
Victoria, you're tearin' me up
You said you'd call, I waited up
I don't know why I even try, I need another tequila

She goes out, lets her hair down, bumps up
I'm all alone
She's groovin' to a Coldplay dance mix turned up
I'm all alone

Cause she went to La Playa for the fire show
Am I in denial, is she dancing alone
You don't like my attitude, well
I don't like your latitude

No, I don't believe you went to bed at 10:15
Victoria, you're tearin' me up
You said you'd call, I waited up
I don't know why I even try, I need another tequila
Another tequila

I hope los gran mosquitoes gets ya
And your sun is stormy weather
I wish I never met you

No, I don't believe you went to bed at 10:15
Victoria, you're tearin' me up
You said you'd call, I waited up
I gotta, gotta say no, I don't believe you went to bed at 10:15
Victoria, you're tearin' me up
You said you'd call, I waited up
I don't know why I even try, I need another tequila
