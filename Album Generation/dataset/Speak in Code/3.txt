Girl you think you’re right all the time
No matter how despicable the crime
You’re a walking, talking B.O.M.B
I guess you just weren’t made for monogamy
When your lips move you’re lying
You talk all the time
The queen of the soap op
Rocking the soap box
A mouth full of wine
A scratch on the spine
She’s my best friend’s girlfriend
But he’s not her only one

She says C'est la vie
Not sure what that means
I can’t believe she’s my best friend’s girl
She says C’est la vie
I keep him happy
And what’s it to ya, I’m your best friend’s girl

I wish I did not mean to be mean
But when I dance in this direction I feel light on my feet
If I’m an asshole
That’s cool
As long as you know it
I’m the happiest prick this side of Detroit
When your lips move you’re lying
You talk all time
The queen of the soap op
Rocking the soap box
A mouth full of wine
A scratch on the spine
She’s my best friend’s girlfriend
But he’s not her only one

She says C’est la vie
Not sure what that means
I can’t believe she’s my best friend’s girl
She says C’est la vie
I keep him happy
And what’s it to ya, I’m your best friend’s girl

She’s my best friend’s girlfriend
The night’s young
She’s doing what she does best
Sweating in the back of a cutlass
Here she comes
Here she comes
Baby here she comes
Put your back in
Baby put you back in
Put your back in
Baby put your back into it
Put your back in
Baby put your back in
Put your back in
Get it on

She says C’est la vie
Not sure what that means
I can’t believe she’s my best friend’s girl
She says C’est la vie
I keep him happy
And what’s it to ya, I’m you’re best friends girlfriend

With your hips and your painted lips
You’ve got the boys on the avenue craning their necks
And when you come to see him he’s a nervous wreck
No you don’t need a service job to bring in the tips

She’s my best friend’s girlfriend
