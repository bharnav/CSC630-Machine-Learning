She said look at the moon
It's like a fingernail clipping
A sliver of light in the cold black sky
I gave her my coat, held her close and she cried
As the sun came up over the jagged skyline
The silence amplified our beating hearts
And I didn't answer when she asked why

One life to live
Many paths to take
One twists and turns and falls away
And flowers bloom in brilliant light
And fade into the night
So much to lose
Or so it seems
These idle games and children's dreams
How they confound and split the seams inside my mind
I just keep moving on into the unknown

And I go walking alone near the St. Augustine bell
And thinking about you since you went away
We used to sit here and watch as the shadows played
And if I try real hard, I can remember that sound
Ringing out just like a clarion
Echoing off of the wall of the dark arcade

One life to live
Many paths to take
One twists and turns and falls away
And flowers bloom in brilliant light
And fade into the night
So much to lose
Or so it seems
These idle games and children's dreams
How they confound and split the seams inside my mind
I just keep moving on into the unknown

You know being alone feels like I'm holding my breath
I try to be cool, I try to push it down
I walk like I know where to go on a Friday night
And the city streets are the fangs of a beast
Yeah it's always tired, but it never sleeps
I cry with the silence, dance with the freaks
Come on, I'm getting on into the unknown
