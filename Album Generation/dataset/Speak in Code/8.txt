I am a citizen, a friend, and a neighbor
(Towing the line, towing the line)
I'm always keeping on my best behavior
(Towing the line, towing the line)
I like to think I try to try to do what's right
But still I get this feeling that I can't deny
I tell myself I'm better than the average lot
But I'm not
I know it
And I'm about to show it

So take me downtown on the company dime
Punch me in the arm, make sure I'm alive
I need a weekend
Gotta kick out the dust
Get my motor running cause it's started to rust
Shake it off
Turn me on
I've been down on the ground for too long
So take me downtown
Take me downtown
Down, down, down

I'm a professional, the family is stable
(Towing the line, towing the line)
We join hands for the prayer at the table
(Towing the line, towing the line)
I like to think I try to try to do what's right
I go rolling in the dirt but I clean up nice
I tell myself I'm better than the average lot
But I'm not
I know it
And I'm about to show it

So take me downtown on the company dime
Punch me in the arm, make sure I'm alive
I need a weekend, gotta kick out the dust
Get my motor running cause it's started to rust
Shake it off
Turn me on
I've been down on the ground for too long
So take me downtown
Take me downtown
Down, down, down

I want to feel
To feel so far away
I want to feel
To feel so far away
To feel so far away
I want to feel

So take me downtown on the company dime
Punch me in the arm, make sure I'm alive
I need a weekend, gotta kick out the dust
Get my motor running cause it's started to rust
Shake it off
Turn me on
I've been down on the ground for too long
So take me downtown
Take me downtown
Down, down, down
