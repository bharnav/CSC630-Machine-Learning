You, the rock in my shoe, the thorn in my side
The bear in the room, the fly in the wine
The things that you do, the license you take
When you're talking to me
You're always talking to me
And I'm pretending I'm listening
But I'm bristling inside
Thank God for caller ID
Cause the thought of you makes me wanna run and hide
Where did we go wrong?

We used to go bowling
We used to light fireworks in the pouring rain
We were tight, thick as thieves
Blood brothers cut from the same cloth indeed
But now we whine
Split hairs and roll our eyes
We used to go bowling

Wait, I just need a break
A second to breathe
And wipe off the slate
I'm down on my knees
Praying for you to change
It doesn't seem to work
I'm racking my brain
When you're talking to me
I'm pretending I'm listening
But I'm bristling inside
Thank God for caller ID
Cause the thought of you makes me wanna run and hide
Where did we go wrong?

We used to go bowling
We used to light fireworks in the pouring rain
We were tight, thick as thieves
Blood brothers cut from the same cloth indeed
But now we whine
Split hairs and roll our eyes
We used to go bowling

Make new friends, but keep the old
One is silver but the other's gold
Make new friends, but keep the old
One is silver but the other's gold

Make new friends, but keep the old
One is silver but the other's gold
Make new friends, but keep the old
Where did we go wrong?

We used to go bowling
We used to light fireworks in the pouring rain
We were tight, thick as thieves
Blood brothers cut from the same cloth indeed
But now we whine
Split hairs and roll our eyes
We used to go bowling

Where did we go wrong?

Make new friends, but keep the old
Where did we go wrong?
Make new friends, but keep the old
Where did we go wrong?
