Burning like an open nerve
I'm running like a dog
On linoleum
I don't know how come
But the effect of you on me is too much
Bro it's like you speak in code
I'm only 3 months sober
Swear I'm so close
To buying a bottle of SoCo
A pack of smokes and saying fuck it all

'Cause I tried to forgive you
For the shit you put me through
But it's just the hardest thing to do

So I guess it's goodbye brother
Goodbye rock and roll
Guess it's goodbye to the only life I know
It's a shame you couldn't just say you were hurting
I will see you on the other side of the curtain

Turning like a broken wheel
My own Achilles heel
Tell me how does it feel
To have a normal day
Despite all my rage
I'm just a rat in a cage
Thoughts, they come and crowd my mind
And they're never kind
It happens all the time, it happens all the time
I'm running out of time, I'm running out of time

'Cause I tried to forgive you
For the shit you put me through
But it's just the hardest thing to do

So I guess it's goodbye brother
Goodbye rock and roll
Guess it's goodbye to the only life I know
It's a shame you couldn't just say you were hurting
I will see you on the other side of the curtain

And now the spotlight shines upon you all alone
Cuts a circle 'round your velvet throne
You take in the applause and give a shallow bow
I'm watching in the rafters now

And you're striking that pose as they're throwing the roses
Lifting up your arms like the statue of Moses
One door opens another one closes
I'm watching in the rafters now

So I guess it's goodbye brother
Goodbye rock and roll
Guess it's goodbye to the only life I know
Yeah, it's a shame you couldn't just say you were hurting
I will see you on the other side of the curtain

Goodbye brother
Goodbye rock and roll
Goodbye to the only life I know
Yeah, it's a shame you couldn't just say you were hurting
Guess I'll see you on the other side of the curtain
