High IQ
Loaded dad
Private schools
Brand new jag
The future is so bright, you’re wearing shades inside
You feel lost
Don’t know why
Hallmark ads make you cry
All these expectations crowd your mind at night
Now you’re looking to the world to save you
Feeling terminally unique
Brother I can hardly blame you for falling asleep

Tear up your certificates
And throw them to the sea
Let’s reclaim our innocence
And live in harmony
We can leave the past behind
And make a brand new start
Walk out of this lion’s den
Before we’re torn apart

Pretty face
Long brown hair
Slender waist
How they stare
A ring around your finger and a pain inside
You feel lost
Don’t know where
He goes at night
But he’s not there
You stay up and remind yourself that life’s not fair
Cause you thought he was the one who could save you
But he’s really nothing like your dad
Sister I can hardly blame you for being mad

Tear up your certificates
And throw them to the sea
Let’s reclaim our innocence
And live in harmony
We can leave the past behind
And make a brand new start
Walk out of this lion’s den
Before we’re torn apart

The sun goes down around us
We smile and nod but we walk alone
We lie here waiting for the ancient fear to loosen its hold

Tear up your certificates
And throw them to the sea
Let’s reclaim our innocence
And live in harmony
We can leave the past behind
And make a brand new start
Walk out of this lion’s den
Before we’re torn apart
Before we’re torn apart
Before we’re torn apart
