I was named for a saint, 1978
It seems a little bit ironic
But I don't think too much on it
'Cause I'm busy making pay
Twenty-four in a day
And if you fall into temptation
There could be a bad vibration

But I've been thinking 'bout you since the first time that I saw you
Think it's safe to say that I've been obsessed
Trying to figure out a way to tell you what I'm feeling
But I just can't get the words off my chest

We got a situation infatuation
We haven't even had a conversation
And I'm lying awake and picturing you naked
I already feel I owe an explanation

It's getting pathological
I'm totally irrational
We got a situation infatuation
Got a situation infatuation

I call an apartment a home
I've never broken a bone
I spent the last couple of weeks
Just sitting, staring at the phone

And as a rule, if you will
I think I'm pretty chill
Yeah, this behaviour's an exception
And I know it needs correction

But I've been thinking 'bout you since the first time that I saw you
Think it's safe to say that I've been obsessed
Trying to figure out a way to tell you what I'm feeling
But I just can't get the words off my chest

We got a situation infatuation
We haven't even had a conversation
And I'm lying awake and picturing you naked
I already feel I owe an explanation

It's getting pathological
I'm totally irrational
We got a situation infatuation
Got a situation infatuation

I'm standing at attention
Thinking things I can't mention
Can you see my intention?

Involuntary action
Object of my destruction
It's a natural reaction

We have a situation infatuation
We haven't even had a conversation
And I'm lying awake and picturing you naked
I already feel I owe an explanation

It's getting pathological
I'm totally irrational
We got a situation infatuation
Got a situation infatuation

I'm standing at attention
Thinking things I can't mention
Can you see my intention?

We have a situation infatuation
