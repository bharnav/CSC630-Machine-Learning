Heaven can you hear me I am calling from a land line
I need a good connection I feel like I'm losing my mind
The day is just about to break I think it's safe to say, so am I

Can you bring my legs to walk even though they're shaking
Will you get my head to stop all the plans it's making
The clouds are just about to burst I think it's safe to say, so am I

Open the floodgates now, let the water come down

The monster in the closet, when the lights turned on
Is just a jacket on a hanger and the fear is gone
And the world keeps turning, sun keeps burning
We are the lost and found, gonna make it through another day

Can you train my mouth to shut when I feel like talking
Get my ears to open up and let a little love in
Lately I'm a ticking bomb and so are you and we are here together

Can you set my heart to beat no matter what I'm feeling
Will you take the wheel and drive, for miles I've been dealing
The day is just about to break I think it's safe to say, so am I

Open the floodgates now, let the water come down

The monster in the closet, when the lights turned on
Is just a jacket on a hanger and the fear is gone
And the world keeps turning, sun keeps burning
We are the lost and found, gonna make it through another day
In the dark before the dawn now
I'm gonna hold it down with the lost and found

The monster in the closet, when the lights turned on
Is just a jacket on a hanger and the fear is gone

And the world keeps turning, sun keeps burning
We are the lost and found
And the world keeps turning, sun keeps burning
We are the lost and found, gonna make it through another day
Gonna make it through another day
And the world keeps turning, sun keeps burning
We are the lost and found, gonna make it through another day
