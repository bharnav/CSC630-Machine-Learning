You can kill from so far away
Analyze, edit and display
You images of death with a spin, and decay
My hopes for a better day

I can see you're in control
Abusing what you hold
Authority is bought and sold
Suffocate the truth, we breathe the lies you've told

So you send the kids off to war, (Not yours)
Once again the rich kill the poor
Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die for you
Safe inside your big glass towers
Sending kids out to be devoured
Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die for your war machine

You can kill from so far away
Analyze, edit and display
You images of death with a spin, and decay
My hopes for a better day
I just wanna breakaway
I wanna break you one day
And everyone who blindly obeys
The things you do and the lies you say

So I can see you're in control
Abusing what you hold
Authority is bought and sold
Suffocate the truth, we breathe the lies you've told

So you send the kids off to war, (Not yours)
Once again the rich kill the poor
Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die for you
Safe inside your big glass towers
Sending kids out to be devoured
Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die. Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die. Don't wanna kill (Kill!), fight (Fight!)
Or die for your war machine

I'm looking for a brand new day
With a fist in the air the kids all say:
War machine breakdown

I just wanna breakaway
I wanna break you one day
War machine breakdown

I'm looking for a brand new day
With a fist in the air the kids all say:
War machine breakdown

I just wanna breakaway
I wanna break you one day
War machine breakdown
