You changed man, you used to be about the music...

You know we're not the only ones who aren't afraid of you...
You want to change you think of what to do

One day you sing are hanging with the swinging sound
And your coming off swearing like a piece of rude crow

Singing one day youâ€™re a junkie running dry
Well now your on MTV and i can see it was just a lie

*None of the following is exact, its just a few words I could Make out or thought i made out*
(Apologies aside and rhythm??? were made
And your relying only on your mic

You look like I'm a monkey and your momma was a junkie collect money from the ***** on the right)

(The rest of the song is in the state of being translated.)
