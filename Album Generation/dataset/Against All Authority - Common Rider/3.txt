Where do we go from here when all is lost?
Nothing gained but we've sure paid the cost
Consciousness sold and bought
Turn the box on, turn off all thought
About the world around you
Consume so much it drowns you out
Holding you to your station
Another product of assimilation
Falling down, down!
Further than you know, still you make no sound
About it, shout it out real loud
Try to stand out and you're swallowed by the crowd

World dominator, world domination! [x7]
World dominator, domination!

Unwittingly comply
To those in control, and remain preoccupied
Sucking on the supply
That we rely on
We rely too much on those around us
Slowly surrounding us all, they pound us down
Down! Never making a sound
Let's light this match and burn it all down

World dominator, world domination! [x7]
World dominator, domination!

Domination... as you lead us into war. (Hey hey!)
Domination... we've come to ignore your
Domination... as you lead us into war. (Hey hey!)
Domination... we've come to ignore it

World dominator, world domination! [x7]
World dominator, domination
