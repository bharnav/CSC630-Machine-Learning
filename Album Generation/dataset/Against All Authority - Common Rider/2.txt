You can break our bodies
But our will, it just cannot be broken
Still you hide behind these barricades
You will never know
Just how it feels when the air's stinging your eyes
Watching your friends fall by your side
Dragged off and locked away for their beliefs
For their beliefs!
What do you see behind these barricades? Barricades!
Afraid to set us free behind these barricades
Our solidarity... Barricades! Barricades!
My thoughts are the enemy behind these barricades
You just want to hurt me
I just want to be heard
Killing freedom of speech
What happened to protect and serve?
Protecting corporate interests
Serving politicians
You can break my body
But you can't break the unity behind these barricades

You can break our bodies
But our will, it just cannot be broken
Still you hide behind these barricades
You will never know
Just how it feels when the air's stinging your eyes
Watching your friends fall by your side
Dragged off and locked away for their beliefs
For their beliefs!
What do you see behind these barricades? Barricades!
Afraid to set us free behind these barricades
Our solidarity... Barricades! Barricades!
My thoughts are the enemy behind these barricades
You just want to hurt me
I just want to be heard
Killing freedom of speech
What happened to protect and serve?
Protecting corporate interests
Serving politicians
You can break my body
But you can't break the unity behind these barricades
