More lies disguised, they're selling you
Vacant eyes tied tightly to the tube
Sealed shut just like they wanted
Truth's a ghost, we're all haunted
By the actions of those serving
Believed they were deserving
Of our trust we were misled
Devoured lies, we've been feed

Now I've got no sympathy
Now I've got this rage in me
I've gotta release, I just can't stop it
Watch our blood drip from the pockets
Of the thieves that rose to power
Thought control from the towers
Pull our strings push our buttons
At the mercy of the gluttons

You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...

By the ones that you once trusted
Promises have slowly rusted
Into what resembles just
Another pool of blood from you and me

Do you feel it coming?
Words spoken keep you numb and
Longing for some long forgotten change
To cleanse these spoken stains
We all just fell in line
We fall for it each time
Never bite the feeding hand
That pulls the strings that tie these hands

Now is the time to cut it
To take the mouth and shut it up
Hold back the rising tide of
Well placed words just drawing files
So feel this angry sound
Overtake each town
They cup their ears they can't take it
You and I are gonna break it

You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...
You're being lied to...

By the ones that you once trusted
Promises have slowly rusted
Into what resembles just
Another pool of blood from you and me

You're being lied to...
We're being lied to...
I get the feeling
We're all being lied to
You're being lied to...
We're being lied to...
Well, I get the feeling
We're all being lied to
You're being lied to...
We're being lied to...
Well, I get the feeling
We're all being lied to
You're being lied to...
We're being lied to...
I get the feeling
We're all being lied to
