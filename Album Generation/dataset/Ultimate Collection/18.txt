You don't call me anymore
But don't you think that I don't care
I check the numbers every night
Just to see if you are there
Was it just another love affair?
Was it just another love affair?

My clock goes ticking through the night
Counting the seconds I don't sleep
I wish that I could turn back time
But some things we'll never meant to keep
Was it just another love affair?
Was it just another love affair?

It will never be the same
It will never be the same

It will never be the same
Without you

Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Will never be the same
Never be the same

Was it just another love affair?
Was it just another love affair?
