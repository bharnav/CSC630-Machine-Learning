Now there was a time when they used to say
That behind every - "great man"
There had to be a - "great woman"
But in these times of change you know
That it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
Cause there's something we forgot to say to you (we say)

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singing with you
The "inferior sex" got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
Everybody - take a look around
Can you see - can you see - can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
(Just the same though)

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Thank you, I'll get it myself
