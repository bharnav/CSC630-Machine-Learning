[Refrain: Josh Homme]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: Mark Lanegan]
It's late enough to go driving
And see what's mine
Life's the study of dying
How to do it right
You're a holy roller
If you bettin' to lose
If you're hanging around
I'm holding the noose

[Refrain: Homme]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Lanegan]
Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rolling over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

[Refrain: Homme]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge: Homme]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Lanegan]
Come on, let's go driving
Come on, let's take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right

[Refrain: Homme]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro: Dave Grohl]
Hey!
