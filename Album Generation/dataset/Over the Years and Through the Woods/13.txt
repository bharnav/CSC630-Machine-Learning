[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where you gone?
Where you gone?

[Verse 2]
I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
Gone so long
Where you gone?

[Refrain]
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye

[Verse 3]
In every voice, I hear you speak
Waiting by the telephone
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Roll and tumble all night long
All night long
Where you gone? yeah

[Refrain]
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

[Bridge]
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Where have you gone again my sweet?

[Refrain]
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

[Hidden Track]
