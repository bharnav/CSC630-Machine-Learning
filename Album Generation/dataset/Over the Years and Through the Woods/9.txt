[Verse 1]
Setting sun deals hands of gold
There's velvet eyes in Mexico
Just a fall away
And all she said was true

[Bridge]
Speak in tongues
Speak in lies
Drooling livers
Born to die
It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you

[Chorus]
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever

[Verse 2]
Point and shoot
I know just what you mean
In a world that's full of shit and gasoline baby
One dog's dead one's on the phone
Just leave a lung or leave it alone
It's that same old song again
I hate it because it's true

[Chorus]
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
