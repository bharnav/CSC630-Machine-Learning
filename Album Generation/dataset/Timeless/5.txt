[Verse 1]
You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me any more, and I'll have to let him go
Now you say you're going to take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Chorus]
Women like you, they come a dime a dozen
You can buy them anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm going to stand right here
But it'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a man's caught looking at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you, but he's in love with me
Now I don't know where that leave's you, ah but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Chorus]
