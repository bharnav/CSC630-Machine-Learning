[Chorus 1]
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's got to be a little rain sometime
When you take you got to give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 1]
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter

[Chorus 2]
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]
