[Verse 1]
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
'till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus 1]
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend

[Chorus 2]
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
