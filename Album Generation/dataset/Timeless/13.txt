[Chorus]
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs, tailor made upon my back
Still I want you to set me free

[Verse]
I've found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything that money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long long night
No, you didn't keep me satisfied

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Satin sheets to lie on
