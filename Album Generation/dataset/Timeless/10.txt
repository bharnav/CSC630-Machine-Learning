[Verse 1]
I'll need time
To get you off my mind
I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you
From time to time

[Chorus]
Now and then
Lord ya know I'm going to need a friend
Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Til I can make it on my own

[Verse 2]
I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time
But they say
Oh there'll be a brighter day
But til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Til I can make it on my own
Surely someday I'll wake up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my cryings done
No more hurting memories to find me

[Chorus]
