[Verse]
Oh the sun's going to shine in my life once more love's going to live here again
Things're going to be the way they were before love's going to live here again
Love's going to live here love's going to live here love's going to live here again
No more loneliness only happiness love's going to live here again
I hear bells're ringing birds're singing love's going to live here again
And I hear bees a humming well I know the days're coming love's going to live here again
Love's going to live here
