[Verse 1]
Just you know why - why you and I
Will by and by - know true love ways

[Chorus]
Sometimes we'll sigh - sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways

[Verse 2]
Throughout the days our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care

[Chorus]
