[Verse 1
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together

[Chorus]
And I still miss someone

[Verse 2]
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere

[Chorus]
