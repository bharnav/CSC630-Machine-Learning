[Verse 1]
She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated

[Verse 2]
Women seem to fill her mind
And many men in so short time
But she's underrated, she treats me oh so kind
She's very complicated
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
We talk together and discuss
What is really best for us
She's sophisticated, my head's fit to bust
Cause she's so complicated
Break!

[Bridge]
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
She knows just how to please her man
She's softer than a baby lamb
But she's educated, doesn't give a damn
She's very complicated
Break!

[Bridge]
Na na na na na
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated
Break!

[Outro]
Break!
Na na come on, baby!
Na na na na na
Na na na na, yeah
A-come on, baby
Uh! Come on, babe
