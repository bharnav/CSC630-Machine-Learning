[Verse 1]
What you say, girl?
You see, what is wrong?
You must be joking
You was led along

[Chorus]
But the butler, the baker
The laughing cavalier
Will tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

I want to know
Tell me, baby, who's been sleeping...

[Verse 2]
What you say, girl?
Who'd you see that night?
I, I was doing
Doing something right

[Chorus]
Oh the soldier, the sailor
And then there's the three musketeers
Yes, they'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

Did I ever tell you I want to know?
Hey baby, who's been sleeping...

[Verse 3]
Don't you look like
Like a Goldilocks?
There must be somewhere
Somewhere you can stop

[Chorus]
Yes, there's the noseless old newsboy
The old British brigadier
But he'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

[Verse 4]
Who's been eating
Eating off my plate?
Who will tell me?
Who'll investigate?

[Chorus]
There's the sergeants, the soldiers
The cruel old grenadier
But they'll tell me now
Who's been sleeping here

[Outro]
Cause I want to know
Who's been sleeping right here
Was it your mummy, your daddy?
Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your auntie, your uncle?
Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your boyfriend, your girlfriend?
Who's been sleeping here?
All right
Who's been sleeping here?
