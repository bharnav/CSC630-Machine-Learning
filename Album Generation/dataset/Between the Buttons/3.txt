[Chorus]
All I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you

[Verse 1]
Everything is going in the wrong direction
The doctor wants to give me more injections
Giving me shots for a thousand rare infections
And I don't know if he'll let me go

[Chorus]
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make it, connection
All I want to do is to get back to you

[Verse 2]
My bags, they get a very close inspection
I wonder why it is that they suspect them
They're dying to add me to their collection
And I don't know if they'll let me go

[Chorus]
Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
And all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
All I want to do is to get back to you
