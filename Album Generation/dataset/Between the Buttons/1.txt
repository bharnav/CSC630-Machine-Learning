[Chorus]
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 1]
Well, after this time I finally learned
After the pain and hurt
After all this, what have I achieved?
I've realized it's time to leave

[Chorus]
'Cause who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 2]
I'm living a life of constant change
Every day means the turn of a page
Yesterday's papers are such bad news
Same thing applies to me and you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

[Verse 3]
It seems very hard to have just one girl
When there's a million in the world
All of these people just can't wait
To fall right into their big mistake

[Chorus]
'Cause who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world
