[Verse 1]
Why do my thoughts loom so large on me?
They seem to stay, for day after day
And won't disappear, I've tried every way

[Chorus]
But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry
Oh, no no no

[Verse 2]
Where does she hide it inside of her?
That keeps her peace most every day
And won't disappear, my hair's turning grey

[Chorus]
But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry

[Bridge]
"There's nothing in why or when
There's no use trying, you're here digging again
And over again"

[Verse 3]
That's what she said so softly
I understood for once in my life
And feeling good most all of the time

[Chorus]
'Cause she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And said don't worry
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no
