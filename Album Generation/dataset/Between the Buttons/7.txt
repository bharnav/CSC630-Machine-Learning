[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Every piece that I can get
My obsessions are your possessions
'Til my mouth is soaking wet
I think I blew it now, confession

[Verse 1]
You can't dodge it, it's simple logic
You'd be better off with me
And you'll know it when you lost it
Know it

[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Are you smiling on my way
My obsessions are your possessions
One that you should give away
Give it to me now, I've no objection

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if it's unkind
And it's not my property
But I want it just to be mine
Exclusively

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby, aah

[Verse 3]
You need teaching, you're a girl
There are things in this world
That need teaching with discretion
My profession

[Chorus]
My obsessions are your possessions
Are you used to the idea?
My obsessions are your possessions
Do you feel at home right here?
You should relax, it's my impression

[Verse 4]
Didn't see you were so young
I could almost be your son
Please turn in my direction
No objection
