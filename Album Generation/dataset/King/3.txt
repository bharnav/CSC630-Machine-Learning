[Intro: Just Blaze (Tip)]
No more hand claps

Guru's bass is about to knock 'em out the ceiling

I'm done playing with y'all fuck niggas
I can't catch all of you but I can make an example out of a couple of you
Everybody know, real niggas gon' relate to this shit right here, you understand that?
Grand Hustle, nigga
Everybody who down with me already know they down with me, so I ain't worried about it
P$C, pimpin'
Anybody who know somebody who spit that shit behind they back (What the fuck you said, nigga?)
But won't say the same thing when they get in they motherfuckin' face (Yeah, that's what the fuck I thought)
Tell them niggas, I'm talkin' to you , nigga
Do something about it!

[Hook]

Sucker nigga you can stunt all ya wanta stunt

Fuck nigga you can hate all you wanna hate
I know you a fake-make no mistake I'm talkin to you

[Verse One: T.I.]
Ay I'm the best you ever heard about, fresher than you heard about

For niggas wit dirty mouths, I got a lotta clean pistols to wash 'em out

The goons hit the room now you askin what's this all about
Fo' you know it ya noggins split ya bottom teeth is fallin out
Got a problem wit patna -I see him in the city and call him out
It wasn't for the chopper ain't shit I'm gettin all of mine
Pop 'em drop 'em call the plan a wake he out forever more
I give it to you straight nigga I don't need a metaphor
How many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more
Than a nigga twice as old way mo' popular and even selling more
Man I could send you to my pops, maybe he could tell ya better boy
Patient in the afterlife I'll waste ya in the after life
Even after my life haters be after my life
Cuz I'mma do in 06 what took 'em half of they life, man I'm talkin to you

[Hook]

Man all I gotta do is go buy a nigga a Charger
And he only come in to off ya, he don't even wanna rob ya
You done fucked up and started shit wit some real shit starter
You don fought with a chopper holla what it is patna
You better keep it proper you know what it is patna
This some lightwork ain't even gotta call godfather
Mobsta, had the old phantom now the drop son
3rd the king of cloverland, Slim Thug is the boss son
Paul Wall made me the hardest grill I done bought for
For a 100 K, a 100 carat Paul don't wanna talk bra
Nigga wouldn't buck won't dare, you just talk tough
Don't try to run from me now whatchu thought bra I'm talkin to you

Ya in ya video wearin' white T, that don't make you no dope dealer nigga
But I ain't talkin bout no Bankhead, Carver Homes, no Adamsville nigga
You dealin wit a lil gorilla nigga, 10 mill later I'm still the nigga
Killer Mike, Yung bloodz, David Banner
Bonecrusher they remember when y'all ain't feel a nigga
Had it out with Chris he still my nigga
Sat down, civilized, talk about it like niggas
So I ain't never been served, get ya facts right nigga
For this 40 cal make ya ass act right nigga
Coming against the king get ya stats right nigga
Wanna talk about nigga, wanna be a hot nigga
Gonna be a shot nigga, yeah I say'd it what nigga buck nigga
Like Lil Jon I don't give a fuck
I give a God damn if I never sell another milla
I take my ass right back to Cedar Hill and build up
Compound come down everyday sell yay
Just like the old days stack another mill up
Niggas ain't ready for the dust that we kick up
Go talk shit forget they get hit up
You better be bout that shit you kick
Like DipSet bitch you trynna get wit us
I don't politick, don't even speak see I don't kiss up
