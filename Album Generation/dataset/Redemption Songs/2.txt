Give to the wind your fear
Hope and be undismayed
God hears your sighs and counts your tears
God will lift up, God will lift up, lift up your head

(God will lift up your head) He'll lift up your head
(God will lift up your head) God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head) Lift up your head
(God will lift up) God will lift up, lift up your head

Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command
Then shall we wandering on His way
Know how wise, how strong
How wise and how strong

(God will lift up your head) Strong is His way
(God will lift up your head) How wise and hoes strong
(God will lift up your head) How strong is His hand
(God will lift up) Lift up your head

Through waves and clouds and storms, He gently clears the way
Wait because in His time, so shall this night
Soon end in joy (soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy (soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy (soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy (soon end in joy)

(God will lift up your head) Soon end in joy
(God will lift up your head) Soon end in joy
(God will lift up your head) Soon end in joy

(God will lift up your head) God will lift your head
(God will lift up your head) God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head) God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head) God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head) Your head, your head, your head, your head

God will lift up your head (God will lift up your head)
