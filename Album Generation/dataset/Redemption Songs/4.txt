What can wash away my sin
What can make me whole again
For my pardon this I see
For my cleansing this my plea

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing can for sin atone (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
Not of good that I have done (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
This is all my hope and peace (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
This is all my righteousness (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus

Now by this I'll overcome
Now by this I'll reach my home
Glory, glory, this I see (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
All my praise for this I bring (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
All my praise for this I bring (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)
All my praise for this I bring (Nothing but the blood of Jesus)

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing, nothing
