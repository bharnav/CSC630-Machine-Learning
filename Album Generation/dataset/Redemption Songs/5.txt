Let us love and sing and wonder
Let us praise the Savior's name
He has hushed the law's loud thunder
He has quenched Mt. Sinai's flame

Let us love the Lord who bought us
Pitied us when enemies
Called us by His grace and taught us
Gave us ears and gave us eyes

He has washed us with His blood
He has washed us with His blood
He has washed us with His blood
He presents our souls to God

Let us wonder grace and justice
Join and point to mercy's store
When through grace in Christ our trust is
Justice smiles and asks no more

He who washed us with His blood (washed us with His blood)
He who washed us with His blood (washed us with His blood)
He who washed us with His blood
Has secured our way to God

Let us praise and join the chorus
Of the saints enthroned on high
Here they trusted him before us
Now their praises fill the sky

Washed us with His blood

He has washed us with His blood
He has washed us with His blood (precious blood)
He has washed us with His blood
He has washed us with His blood

Washed us with His blood
He has washed us, washed us with His blood
Washed us with His blood
Washed us
He has washed us with His blood
He will bring us home to God
