O come and mourn with me awhile
O come near to the Savior’s side
O come together, let us mourn:
Jesus our Lord is crucified

Seven times he spoke
Seven words of love
And all three hours his silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men
Jesus our Lord is crucified

(O love of God) O love of God, o sin of man (sin of man)
In this dread act your strength is tried
And victory remains with love;
Jesus our lord is crucified

O break, o break hard heart of mine
My weak self love and guilty pride
His Pilate and his Judas were;
Jesus our lord is crucified

(O love of God) O love of God, o sin of man (sin of man)
In this dread act your strength is tried
And victory remains with love
Jesus our Lord is crucified

O come and mourn with me awhile

A broken heart a fount of tears
Ask and they will not be denied
A broken heart love’s cradle is;
Jesus our Lord is crucified
Jesus our Lord is crucified
Jesus our Lord is crucified
Our Lord is crucified

(sin of man)
And victory remains with love;
Jesus our lord is crucified

(O love of God) O love of God, o sin of man (sin of man)
In this dread act your strength is tried
And victory remains with love;
Jesus our lord is crucified

O come and mourn with me awhile
Crucified
Our Lord is crucified
