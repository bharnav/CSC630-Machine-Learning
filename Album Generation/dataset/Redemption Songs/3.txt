I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away

Some bright morning, when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls
I'll fly, I'll fly away

And I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away

O, how glad and happy when we meet
I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet
I'll fly away

And I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away!

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll, I'll fly away

I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly, I'll fly away

I'll fly away, O glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away

Yeah, I'll fly away
I'll fly away
