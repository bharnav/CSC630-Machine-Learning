I crawled for miles, slit open by a trail of thorns
I prowled, I prowled for vapid avenue
Slurring every word I wished I said
Stranded, a nocturnal hell hole
I have a dread of becoming a martyr
Pry it out. pry it out
Pavement
Spits back when the clock strikes
I crawled for miles and miles
Take the palms
Save the fright from...
I sprawled protypical creature
Mouthwide on a cobblestone canvas
Time lapse
Rejected donors
Flee from the scene
Blind numb
On a whiskey slicked highway
I'm reeling towards a the temptation at hand
Fog lights
Disjointed lightning
Nausceous nausceous
I'm drooling right on cue
I'm sleeping in a pew
It's all a misconstrued
God damn this night
Fabricate
Deny
Until the beat makes you sick
Guttershark
Prescribe
The man is void of reason
I crawled for miles and miles
Till the palm's called it quit's. yeah
I crawled for miles and miles
Take the palm's
Save the fright from...fear grips me
Drained, pissed, drowned
You might cut a man just to watch him bleed
You might cure yourself of this plague
You might spill your gut's to this blood thirsty crowd
They might think I'm you
I'm gonne end up you
You can't shake it the fear the voice the tremble the bittersweet melody is deafening so hide your broken halo from me
I crawled for miles
