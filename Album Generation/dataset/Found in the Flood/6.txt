The air raids at night, are keeping things serene
The president's men are closing in on me
And the crosshair grin you hold me in still doest not porpose an argument convincing me to shed the devil's clothes
Electrodes to spine
Tongeuning my wounds clean
That's when the nightmare stops
Oh yeah I had a dream, I had a dream
It went - shackled to the lover of another in a chapel so pristine
Baptisted as atheists
I never felt so clean
The more I hear dove's cry, the less I want to fly
The more I hear them crying out...
When does the seizure end?
When does the cyanide kick in?
I'd like to hike you up over this waste of love and back again
Oh my mistress sweet distress your dress is bringing it all back to me
And we are closer then whores caught up in a roundabout in hell
Twilight isnt in the dark on this one you can play me out on the hotel floor
The more I hear doves cry
This is where the plot it thickens
Not behind the ribs but below the truth
You can use your sleuth, cause I'm begging for proof
When does the seizure end?
When does the cyanide kick in?
I'd like to hike you up over this waste of love and back again
Oh my mistress sweet distress your dress is bringing it all back to me
And we are closer then whores caught up in a roundabout
No need to run away
The pig was snuffed and laid
We say this happening all on the front page
This is the last time we bet on landmines
We've got a lot riding on this one
So save your bullets for the call back
We've got a lot riding on this one
Don't turn your back till you see the blood flow black
