The Sky blistered red, shot's ring overhead
I'm scaling walls that the soldiers built to muffle out your screams
The message was dislocated. misconveted. incinerated
In the wake of war just listen for the flood
The arthritis in us all is choking me out
It's spilling me
Maybe you could finally be the one who reaches in and saves me from the flood
Collapse
This is our last chance
There's no time for relapse
Just listen for the flood
If not us, can I just save you?
Can't you hear the bombs are calling all our old habits their own
A sniper patiently awaiting me in every catacomb are you scared girl?
Won't you be my assassin?
Hunted you down for the last time and carried you home
The arthritis in us all is choking me out
It's spilling me
Maybe you could finally be the one who reached in and saves me from the flood
Collapse
This is our last chance
No time for relapse
Just listen for the flood
If not us, can I just save you?
Bring on the love' cause here comes the flood
Bring on the love' cause here comes the flood
We must have been seduced by the calm of the isle as we tied our wrist's, our wrist's too tight in the shallow
Maybe you could finally be the one who reaches in and save's me from the flood
Collapse
This is our last chance
No time for relapse
Just listen for the flood
If not us, can I just save you?
