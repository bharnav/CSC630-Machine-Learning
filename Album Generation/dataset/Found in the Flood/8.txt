Hey you, young love. don't let them cut out your tongue
Swallow the key to your heart and smile through your teeth
Hey you, young love. dont let them cut out your tongue
It's only over when we choose to forgive them
Give me your hand when no one else understand's the day the hostages making demands
We gave ourselves
When there was nobody else
We found what we were looking for in the summer
I never begged to be immune
To love a heart so out of tune
But I believed you when you told me I was ruined
And if the sun comes up again
I'll be waiting for the others to come in
They'll never take us alive
And they can never take away what keep's you safe when you're afraid to lose it all
Just love and nothing more until we love nothing more
Until we love
Het you. young love and all that's left of us
Hey you, young love
