If It Starts to Feel, Then we'll just shut it off again. We won't convince the Jury, we're guilty till we die
If It starts to sing, reach in remove the sirens, this respirator keeps a countdown to our cancellation
If It Starts to Bleed do not adjust the contrast. doctor, deliver us. heaven holds no truth for dreamers like you and I
Remember the day they cut our throats we learned to smile from our necks
This is the breech of etiquette with wires jutting out from arms
Ill neve look at you again, if its only a mirror in the end, and if there's no one after us, we'll turn the lights out when we leave
I'll never look at you again, if its only a mirror, we're guilty till we die, I'll never look We're guilty till we die. I'll never look at you, till we die
Siphon the Ivory with the tusk, we're guilty till we die
We only bleed when knives are drawn
Vultures pick the meat from the bones. we're guilty till we die
We only love when the camera's on
If it starts to feel, then we'll just shut it off again
We won't convince the Jury. we're guilty till we die
If it starts to feel, then we'll just shut it off again
We won't convince the Jury, we're guilty till we die
Do not adjust the contrast, my love our days are numbered
We'll remain guilty till our hearts give in and pull us under
We left our corpes on the beach, untouched and slightly out of reach
We paint the wall's with our dream's
We'll turn the lights out when we leave
