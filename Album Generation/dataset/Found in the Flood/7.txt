We fall asleep on the runway underneath the noon crucifix
Where they left the light on for us tonight
Fed myself to the sickness and purge myself of the cure
We watch the nurses pace the cage
You and I we're never gonna die
Never gonna die in the white lights
You and I are never gonna die
Servants
Suffocate the king
We'ce come to take what we don't need
And built a prison where catherdrals used to be
We burn every office
Zombies prowl through the school chanting "This is ours to love and take apart at will"
Here we are right now
Here we are right now
These wires, these woven webs, conceal blueprints from me
Here we are right now
Sometimes we kill the lights
Pretend that we survived
We're never gonna die
We're never gonna die
We're never gonna die
We're never gonna die
