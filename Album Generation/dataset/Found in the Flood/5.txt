Brace yourself for the plight of the born
As the spotlight strips you bare
Just a useless Act in the Play of Life
Cast as the role of "The Lover"
And I feel slightly misplaced in a world of "Fuck or Be Fucked"
Kill the lights
Letch
One more time and say it like you mean it
Lush
One more time and tell it like you feel it
Lover
You've got talent but I just don't see it
Wrap your hook around my neck and get me off, get me off, get me off your stage
In every coma-lover's kiss collides with truth
And every tongue that slips will drip onto your bruise
And I know disguise the lies that you fed me last night these plots are breeding grounds for nothing but the worst and nothing could be worse and I know why
And what do I have left?
The composer just went deaf
The singer lost his breath
In the glow of the crowd
The dancer's on a crutch
The writer drank too much
The director lost his touch
In the glow of the crowd
Can you resist the urge to burn the script we wrote? bring on the flood before we choke
Applause engulfs the room
We bow into out tombs
Sing me one more line so I can sleep
Sing me one more line so I can sleep
Sing me one more line so I can sleep
This is all you need
My love, it follows you to your grave
To your grave
My love, it follows you to your grave
To your grave
In every coma-lover's kiss collides with truth
And every tongue that slips will drip onto your bruise
And I know disguise the lies that you fed me last night these plots are breeding grounds for nothing but the worst and nothing could be worse and I know why
In every coma-lover's kiss collides with truth
And every tongue that slips will drip onto your bruise
And I know disguise the lies that you fed me last night these plots are breeding grounds for nothing but the worst and nothing could be worse and I know why
