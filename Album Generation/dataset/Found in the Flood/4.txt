I've got such a filthy heart sometimes
When you take me to that place and I never wanna leave
In the middle of the night
When everyone is sound asleep
Where will you be?
You'll be waiting with a gasmask in the dark
I can't stop myself
She calls home when im not there so I won't freeze
I need to learn how to breathe
When I'm inside you
Sever the ripcord, sever it
I drift away, further down
Inside it gets so fucking cold
I come to you to feel helpless
Further down
You know it's hard to free myself and you just keep driving until its over
Until they swallow every last drop of me and you
I need to learn how to breathe
Further down
I reach inside
Further down
I can't hide
I tried to show you that there's nothing you can take away from me
Nothing you can take away from me
Kill me
You're such a beautiful liar
Take me to the place where Im king
Nothing like the way that you wanted
When you left me behind
