The rain begins
The tide it pulls
And drags me down
It doesn't end
Keep rolling in
Keep rolling in
Alone you float
She won't let go
And it spins you out
Keep rolling in
Keep rolling in
Keep rolling in
Underneath a web of satellites
Concrete structures puncture holes in the sky
Nothing lives here and no one comes here anymore
Redesign me
I lost your grip
Peeled apart by the owned
Stick beside me on the road
Redesign me
I lost my grip
Peeled apart by the owned
Stick beside me on the road
She winks and glows
If I could run from this I swear I'd take you with me
But this place has got the best of us again
And it won't just go away
We're diving in with our hearts and halfmast and there's nothing left to say
Redesign me
I lost your grip
Peeled apart by the owned
Stick beside me on the road
Redesign me
I lost your grip
Peeled apart by the owned
Stick beside me on the road
Keep rolling in
