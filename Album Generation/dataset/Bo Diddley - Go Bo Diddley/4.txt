[Verse]
You don't love me
You don't care
You don't want me
Hanging round here
Hanging round here, hanging round here
Well, I love you
Yes, I do
Isn't nothing in the world
Woudn't do for you
I wouldn't do for you, wouldn't do for you, I wouldn't do for you
Yes, I saw you
On the street
Tell you man
You didn't love me, you didn't love me[x2]
Yes, I need you
Yes, I do
You know, pretty mama
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you[x2]
What I'll try for you[x5]
