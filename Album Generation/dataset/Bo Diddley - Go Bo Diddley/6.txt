[Verse]
The great grand-pappy when the land was young
Barred his door with a wagon tongue
Oooh-ho-ho-ho-ho
When the times got tough and redskins smart
Said his prayers with his shotgun cocked
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-whoa-oh
The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Cooked his grub in a frying pan
Picked his teeth with a hunting knife
He wore the same suit all-a his life
Oh-oh, ooo-oh-ooo, ooo-ooo
A-ay-oh
Twenty-one children, came to be blessed
The old man's house in the wilderness
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-a-whoa-oh
Doubt his story if you can
The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-hoo! (ah-hoo)
Ooow
