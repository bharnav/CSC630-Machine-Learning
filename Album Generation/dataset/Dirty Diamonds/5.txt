Theyre running in packs on a Saturday night
They got their own bark and they got their own bite
Waiting in line I can't wait no more, no
Slip right in you get kicked out the back door

I dont know
If its possible to tame one
I dont know
If shell follow me home
I dont know
What it is about her

Sunset babies
All got rabies
Sunset babies
All got rabies
I got my shots

They got a sick sense they know why youre here
They can smell the fear through the smoke and the beer
Theyre a vicious breed and they just dont care
You think youre in but youre going nowhere

I dont know
If its safe to pet one
I dont know
If shell go for my throat
I dont know
What it is about them

Sunset babies
All got rabies
Sunset babies
All got rabies
