[Verse 1]
Summer don't know me no more
Eager man, that's all
Summer don't know me
Just let me loathe in myself
'Cause I do know, Lord
From you that just died, yeah

[Hook]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine

[Verse 2]
Don't stop the buck, when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
If you do that
I'll be some
To find you

[Hook]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time you'll want to be mine

[Outro]
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
