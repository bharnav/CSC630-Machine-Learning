[Verse 1 : 2D]
Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and holding the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of the monkey's head

[Hook : The London Community Gospel Choir]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 2 : 2D]
Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but it wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul...
You're a whole one
Yeah, you're a whole

[Hook : The London Community Gospel Choir]
Don’t get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don’t go over the edge, hey
You’ll make a big mistake
Mistake
You’ll make a big
Mistake
You’ll make a big
Mistake
You’ll make a big
Mistake
You’ll make a big
Mistake
