[Verse 1]
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
But they won't be long
They're mesmerized
Skeletons

[Refrain 1]
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say mental

[Verse 2]
Drinking out (Push it real)
Pacifier (Push it real, push it)
Vitamin souls (Push it, push it real)
The street desire (Push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to (Push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (Push it real, push it)

[Refrain 2]
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to

[Chorus]
Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire
It's all desire

[Verse 3]
Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make side to
But it won't be long

[Refrain 2]
â€˜Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to

[Chorus]
Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire
It's all desire

[Outro]
Push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, real
