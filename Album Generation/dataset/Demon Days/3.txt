[Verse 1: 2D]
O green world
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to fallen town
Where someone is still alive
Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me
And I'm looking out somewhere I've never been before
Been before

[Verse 2: 2D]
O green world
Don't desert me now
Made of you and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no, sells to lie
From the darkest stars that force you
Down when youâ€™re in first
Does it seem so little to you?
I know you now, I know
You know, me too
You know, me too
Hope, sex and drugs will rust into myself holy
It feels holy
Feels far when you're with your father
In that place you are
