[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

[Verse 1: 2D]
Take a gun, or how you say
That’s no way to behave
You’re just alone when you begin
To sing a song that doesn’t sing
And it grows, hey, you know

[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

[Verse 2: 2D]
Are we the last to get away?
To a sun, another day?
Or do we know what we know?
Because it seems to be conveyed that way

[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

[Interlude: 2D]
Get up
Lord, save me

[Bridge: 2D]
'Cause all I have sung
I got it down wrong
I’ve seen myself to get
The Lord, seeing all now
Can you take us in?
The part that’s coming on
The coldest man who doesn’t say it’s wrong

[Verse 3: 2D]
I'm moving towards, to the car
I see you walk into the fog
But when you get there, what do you see?
You see the last, it’s you and me

[Chorus: 2D]
'Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
