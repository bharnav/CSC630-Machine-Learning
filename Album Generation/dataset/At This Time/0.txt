There was a song
I remember
Said "What the world needs nowâ€¦"

Where is the love
Where did it go
Who broke our hearts
Cause we need to know
Where are the dreams
That we once knew?
Please explain
Please explain

Where is the love
Where did it go
Who broke our hears
Cause we need to know
Where are the dreams
That we once knew?
Please explain
Please explain

The sun and the moon are crying
The stars and our hearts
Crying
Please explain
The fathers and mothers crying
Sisters and brothers crying
Please explain
Please explain

The sun and the moon are crying
The stars and our hears
Crying
