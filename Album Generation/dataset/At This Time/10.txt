Nowhere to go
To find the answer
'Cause there is
No one but you to find it

No world to save
Except the one in your heart
There's no love to lose
You'll lose it

No time to lose
No tears to waste
No world to change
No love to make but yours

I know that things may never ever change
Things will stay the same
But I know love is never far away
Always taking aim
