Who are these people that keep telling us lies
And how did these people get control of our lives
And who'll stop the violence 'cause it's out of control?
Make 'em stop

Who are these people that destroy everything
And sell off the future for whatever it brings
And what kind of leaders can't admit when they're wrong?
Make 'em stop

This stupid mess we're in just keeps getting worse
So many people dying needlessly
Looks like the liars may inherit the earth
Even pretending to pray
And getting away with it

Who are these people that keep telling us lies
And how did these people get control of our lives
And who'll stop the violence 'cause it's out of control?
We've got to make them stop

Who are these people that keep telling us lies
And how did these people get control of our lives
And who'll stop the violence 'cause it's out of control?
Make 'em stop

See things really have to change
Before it's too late
