I'll never change you
I'll never try to
I'll never understand love
I'll never get it

I'll never ever change you
I'll never try to
'Cause you're my only
Broken valentine
Just like you are

I'll never understand love
I'll never get it
But can't give it up

I'll never ever change you
I'll never try to
You'll be my only
Broken valentine
Just like you are

I'll never understand love
I'll never get it
But can't give it up

I'll never ever change you
I'll never try to
'Cause you're my only
Broken valentine
Just like you are
