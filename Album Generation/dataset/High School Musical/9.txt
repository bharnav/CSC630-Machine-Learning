[Ryan & Kelsi]
It's our last chance to share the stage
Before we go our separate ways
High school wasn't meant to last forever
It's our last chance for us to shine
To bring you music one more time

So come on, come on, come on
(Come on, come on, come on)
Come on, come on, come on

[East High Cheerleaders]
W-I-L-D, Wildcats, you know we are
W-I-L-D, Wildcats, come on, come on
East High boys, let's make some noise, oh yeah
W-I-L-D, Wildcats, now's the time

[East High Basketball Team & Cheerleaders]
This is the last time to get it right
This is the last chance to make it our night
We gotta show what we're all about
Team, work together

This is the last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are
This is the last time to make it count
It's now or never, yeah

[Ryan]
I want it all! I want it, want it, want it!
The fame and the fortune and more, I want it all!
I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door

I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews
I want it all, want it all, want it all
Want it all, want it all!
Kick it girls!

I want it all, want it all, want it all
Want it all, want it all!
My band, thank you, East High
You're amazing, good night

[Sharpay]
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I gotta lot of things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's coming soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens, I know I've got you

You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
Even if we're miles apart
Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart!

[Jimmie]
All, I wanna do is be with you, be with you

[Sharpay & Jimmie]
There's nothing we can't do

[Sharpay]
Eww!

[Sharpay & Jimmie]
Just wanna be with you

[Jimmie]
Only you

[Sharpay & Jimmie]
And no matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart

[Sharpay]
A-a-achoo!

[Jimmie]
I just wanna be with

[Sharpay]
Eww!

[Jimmie]
You

[Troy, Gabriella, Both]
You know how life can be, it changes overnight
It's sunny then raining, but it's alright
A friend like you always makes it easy
I know that you get me every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything, you can count on me!

All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can do
I just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart, you know it's true
I just wanna be with you, you, I just wanna be with you

The sun will always shine, that's how you made me feel
We're gonna be alright, cause what we have is real
And will always be together

[Troy, Gabriella & Company]
All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can do
I just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you! (All I wanna do)

All that I wanna do is be with you
All that I wanna do is be with you
All that I wanna do, I just wanna be with you
All that I wanna do, I just wanna be with you

[Guys]
Who's that girl? She's so fine
Who's that girl? I don't recognize
Who's that girl? She looks so good, yeah
Guess we've never really noticed
But we probably should

[Tiara]
