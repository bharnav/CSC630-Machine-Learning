[Troy, Gabriella, Both]

[Verse 1:]
Take my hand, take a breath
Pull me close and take one step
Keep your eyes locked on mine
And let the music be your guide

[Hook:]
Won't you promise me?
(Now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget?)
We'll keep dancing (to keep dancing)
Wherever we go next

[Chorus:]
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

[Verse 2:]
Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn we'll be safe with me
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you through it all

[Bridge:]
And you can't keep us apart
(Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)
'Cause my heart is ('cause my heart is) wherever you are

[Chorus:]
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

[Verse 3:]
Oh, no mountain's too high and no ocean's too wide
'Cause together or not, our dance won't stop
Let it rain, let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe, that we were meant to be
Oh

[Chorus:]
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you (oh, like you)
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way we do (way we do)
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better

[Outro]
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
