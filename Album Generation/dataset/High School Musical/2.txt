[Verse 1: Sharpay & Ryan]
Imagine having everything we ever dreamed
Don't you want it?
Maybe
Can't you see it?
Kinda
Imagine first audition after college, I get the lead
A part for me?
Well, of course (yeah, right)
You've gotta believe it
Keep talking
You and I, all the fame
Sharpay, and what's his name?
Sound exciting?
Inviting
Let's do it then!
Listening
Personal stylist, agent, and a publicist
But where do I fit into this?
With you, we can win
Win the part?
Think bigger
Become superstars?
That's better

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you see that
Bigger is better
And better is bigger?
A little bit is never enough
No, no, no

[Chorus: Sharpay, Sharpay & Dancers, and All]
Don't you want it all?
You want it, you know that you want it
The fame and the fortune and more
You want it all
You want it
You know that you want it
You've got to have your star on the door
You want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press
Only giving you the best reviews
Say it!
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
My name in lights at Carnegie Hall
I want it all

[Post-Chorus: Sharpay & Ryan]
Can't you see it?
Yeah
They're gonna love me . . . I mean, us

[Verse 2: Sharpay, Ryan, and Both]
Red carpet, rose bouquets
Crowd waiting back stage
I'm with her, don't stop me, I'm not the paparazzi
Invitations (oh)
Standing ovations
Magazines
Yes, please
Gonna be celebrities!
Photographs, fan club
Give the people what they love
Now you're excited
I like it
Let's do it then
Yeah!
Times Square, jet-setter, sequels pay better
New York today, tomorrow the world!
Sold out shows?
Think bigger
And the Oscar goes to
That's better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
Don't you see that
Bigger is better
And better is bigger?
A little bit is never enough
No, no, no

[Chorus: Both]
I want it all
I want it, I want it, I want it
The fame and the fortune and more
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
Radio City Musical Hall
We want it all!

[Post-Chorus: Ryan, Sharpay, and Both]
Here in the spotlight we shine
Look at who we are
When Broadway knows your name
You know that you're a star!

[Interlude: Ryan, Sharpay, and Gabriella]
Dance!
Madison Square Garden!
They love you!
Thank you! Thank you all!
It's Oprah calling . . . again
She wants you on the show
"They're gonna have to get back to you"

[Bridge: Both & Dancers]
I want it, I, I, I want it, want it
I want it, I, I, I want it all
I want it, I, I, I want it, want it
I want it, I, I, I, I want it all
I want it, I, I, I want it, want it
I want it, I, I, I, I want it all

[Chorus: Both]
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
The fame and the fortune and more
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews
I want it all

[Outro: Sharpay, Ryan, and Both]
Paris!
London!
Rome!
Toronto, L.A!
Sydney!
Buenos Aires!
Tokyo!
Moscow!
Bollywood!
New York City!
We want it all!
