[Intro]
[Troy:] Whoo!
[Ryan:] Come On!
[Sharpay:] Alright!
[Chad:] Little louder now!
[Gabriela:] Hey!

[Verse 1: Troy, Gabriella, Both]
Looking forward from center stage to graduation day
Time to get the future started!
What we leave, what we take with us
No matter what, it's something we're apart of!
We learn to fly, together side-by-side
I just hope the rest of my life
Will feel as good as my

[Chorus: Everyone]
High school musical
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical
Let's celebrate where we come from
The friends who've been there all along
Just like
Our high school (high school) musical!

[Verse 2: Ryan, Sharpay, Both]
Improvisation without a script, no one's written it
And now we have the chance to
Someday we'll be looking back, memories we've had
All the songs that we lived through!
The best of times, so why leave them behind
Why can't the rest of my life
Be like my

[Chorus: Everyone]
High school musical
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical
Let's celebrate where we come from
The friends who've been there all along
That's right!

[Verse 3: Chad, Taylor, Both]
Now we finally realize
Who we are, it just took some time
We had to live and to learn to see the truth
(Can't you see the truth?)
But nothing's ever impossible
Into the future we all free fall
Until forever, we'll always have high school

[Troy, Gabriella, Both]:
Time to party, now celebrate!
'Cause the worlds one big stage, but any part you want can be yours!
(Everybody sing, yeah!)
Can you show us, now we're gonna go?
It's what got us here, we know

[All]
High school, lives on forever more!
High school, high school musical!

[Chorus: Everyone]
High school musical
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical
Let's celebrate where we come from
The friends who've been there all along
Oh yeah!

[Chorus: Everyone]
High school musical
Who says we have to let it go?
It's the best part we've ever known
Step into the future
But hold on to high school musical
Let's celebrate where we come from

[Outro: Everyone]
All together, makes it better
Memories that last forever
I want the rest of my life to
Feel just like aâ€”
High school musical
