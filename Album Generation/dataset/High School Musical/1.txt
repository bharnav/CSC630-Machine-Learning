[Troy, Gabriella, Both]

[Intro:]
Hmm yeah
Hey yeah

[Verse 1:]
Can you imagine what would happen
If we could have any dream?
I'd wish this moment was ours to own it
And that it would never leave
Then I would thank that star
That made our wish come true (come true), oh yeah
Cause he knows that where you are
Is where I should be too

[Chorus]
Right here, right now (yeah)
I'm looking at you and my heart loves the view
Cause you mean everything
Right here, I promise you somehow
That tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)
But right now, there's you and me

[Verse 2:]
If this was forever, what could be better?
We already proved it works
But that two-thousand one-hundred twenty-three hours
A bend in the universe
Is gonna make everything (everything) in our whole world change (this time changin')
And you know that where we are (where we are)
Will never be the same, (oh no) oh no

[Chorus:]
Right here, right now (right now)
I'm looking at you and
My heart loves the view
Cause you mean everything (everything)
Right here (right here), I'll promise you somehow (somehow we're gonna)
Tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me

[Verse 3: Gabriella]
Oh we know it's coming (coming)
And it's coming fast (it's always always you and me)
Oh yeah
So let's make this second last, make it last!

[Chorus]
Right here, oh right now
Yeah I'm looking at you
And my heart loves the view
Cause you mean everything
Right here, I'll promise you somehow
That tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me

[Outro]
You and me
Ohh, you and me
But right now there's you and me
