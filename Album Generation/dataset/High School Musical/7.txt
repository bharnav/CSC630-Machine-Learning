[Verse 1]
I guess I should have known better
To believe that my luck had changed
I let my heart and forever
Finally learn each other's names
I tell myself this time it's different
No goodbyes 'cause I can't bear to say it
I'll never survive the one that's coming
If I stay, oh no

[Chorus]
Just walk away, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's going to hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late, oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Ooh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away

[Verse 2]
I really wish I could blame you
But I know that it's no one's fault (no one's fault)
A Cinderella with no shoe
And a prince that doesn't know he's lost
This emptiness feels so familiar
Each goodbye, just the same old song
But this time I will not surrender
'Cause I'm gone
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Just walk away, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's going to hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late, oh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Ooh, just walk away
Walk, walk, walk away
Ooh, just walk away

[Bridge]
I've got to let it go
Start protecting my heart and soul
'Cause I don't think I'll survive
A goodbye again
Not again

[Chorus]
Just walk away, oh, and don't look back
'Cause if my heart breaks, it's going to hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that
Before it's too late, just walk away
(Walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, yeah
(Walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, oh
(Walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away
(Walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, oh no
