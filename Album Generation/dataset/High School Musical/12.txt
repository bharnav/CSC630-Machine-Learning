[Intro]
"Remember that time"
I've heard those words before but now they're mine
Every memory of the sweet sunshine
Is living here in my heart and mind

[Verse 1]
Oooh
Every laugh
We share together
Yeah, we still give back
Can you believe all the fun we've had?
Just getting ready for the other half
You know a friend becomes a part of you
Like this dream that's finally coming true
Coming true!

It's all good, alright
See ya later doesn't mean goodbye
Cause it ain't over, just time to fly
And we're just getting started
Oooh

Let's celebrate
Life is coming, yeah, and I can't wait
It's a ride that we all get to take
We're going to help each other find our way, oh
Every friend is now a part of me
Together we're just like a family
Breaking free

[Chorus]
It's all good, alright
See ya later doesn't mean goodbye
It ain't over, just time to fly
And we're just getting started
Just getting started!
It's all good, alright
Our world is changing, that ain't no surprise
But they can't stop us, just let it fly
Cause we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
Who knows what we'll find? It's the great unknown
The stepping stone
Wherever we're going, I know
We're gonna get there from here
Hey yeah

[Chorus]
It's all good, alright
See ya later doesn't mean goodbye
It ain't over, just time to fly
And we're just getting started
Just getting started!
It's all good, alright
The world is changing, that ain't no surprise
That can't stop us, just let it try
We're just getting started
Yeah
It's all good, alright
See ya later doesn't mean....

[fades out]
