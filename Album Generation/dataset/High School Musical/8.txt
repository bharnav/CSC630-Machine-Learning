[Intro]
The day a door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
They won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart
To find what you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard

[Verse 1]
Voices in my head
Tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushing, pushing - they're pushing
I know they've got a plan
But the ball's in my hands
This time it's man to man
I'm driving, fighting inside
A world that's upside down
And spinning faster

[Chorus]
What do I do now - without you
I don't know where to go
What's the right team
I want my own thing
So bad I'm going scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean
I want my own dream
So bad I'm going to scream

[Verse 2]
I'm kicking down the walls
I gotta make them fall
Just break through 'em all I'm punching, crashing - I'm going to
Fight to find myself
Me and no one else
Which way, I can't tell
I'm searching, searching
Can't find the...way that I should turn
I should turn right or left
It's...It's like nothing works - without you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah the clock's running down
Hear the crowd getting loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her? Is it love
Can the music ever be enough?
Gotta work it out, you can work it out
You can do it, you can do it

[Chorus] x2
I don't know where to go
What's the right team
I want my own thing
So bad I'm going scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean
I want my own dream
So bad I'm going scream!
I don't know where to go
What's the right team
I want my own thing
I want my own thing!
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean
I want my own dream
So bad I'm going to scream

[Outro]
Aaughhhhhhh!
