When you meet someone who inspires your worst angry voice
Just retreat-happiness is always a much better choice
Why chargin?
If you're in-
Sisting on the last word
It's quite over-rated
Like our mothers taught:
Unkind words we just ought not to
Hey, everything you're saying is so contra-bliss
Okay, I think I can see where you're going with this
True, we have had our differences there all along
But who, who of us can say he has never been wrong?
