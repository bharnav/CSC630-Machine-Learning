I was convinced
That Life was just a Ship of Fools
That happiness always
Had a broken string
Then Karma kicked in
While wandering through an ancient forest
I found a feather from an angel’s wing
Now I know
Now I know the destination’s there
If I want it
My eyes were slow
To notice the Master Plan
Now I see
Now I see the Path (if I can only stay on it)
My history has made me the man I am
I learned to forgive
I learned to put the past behind me
I learned only love
Is worth remembering
The lives I have lived
The friends and loved ones on my journey
All of them feathers
From an angel’s wing
Now I know
Now I know the destination’s there
If I want it
My eyes were slow
To notice the Master Plan
Now I see
Now I see the Path (if I can only stay on it)
My history has made me the man I am
