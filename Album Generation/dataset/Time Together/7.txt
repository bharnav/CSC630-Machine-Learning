We said goodbye one last time at the Louvre
Our long happy Summer was through
Just lovers in Paris as common as doves
But I still think of you, Samba Blue

Just how long has it been?
I still remember when
We strolled the Champs Elysees
Sharing a warm baguette
Coffee with anisette
We kissed in the Metro
In love very retro

I've visited Paris so many times since
And it always reminds me of you
And happily now all these many years hence
You are still by my side, Samba Blue

To Astrud Gilberto tunes
We made love in the afternoon
Then strolled down the Champs Elysees
Sharing a warm baguette
Coffee with anisette
We kissed in the Metro
In love very retro

We're together again, by the Seine, Samba Blue
On the grand avenues, me and you, Samba Blue
