[Verse 1]
I know a man who fills his emptiness
With strangers (strangers)
I know a girl who drinks herself to sleep at night
You can't change her (changer her)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know people who use chat rooms
As confessionals
I know down and outs who once were
Once they were professionals

[Post-Chorus]
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet

[Verse 2]
I know a single mother who loses her mind
On weekends (weekends)
She pleads with lady luck on scratch cards with money lent to her
By old friends (old friends)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know people who take midnight drives
For head space
I know what they'd give for just
One loving embrace

[Post-Chorus]
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet

[Chorus]
We're just the same, we all get desperate sometimes
Feeling black and blue
I know you'll find it hard to accept it sometimes
We all feel black and we feel blue

[Post-Chorus]
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet

[Verse 3]
I know a rich man who has everything you could wish for
But children (children)
I know an old lady who talks a lot but could teach you
If you listen (listen)

{Pre-Chorus 3]
I know people who believe in gods and demons
I know ones who think there's nothing there at all

[Post-Chorus]
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet

[Chorus]
We're just the same, we all get desperate sometimes
Feeling black and blue
I know you'll find it hard to accept it sometimes
We all feel black and we feel blue

[Post-Chorus]
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet
Wipe it off your sleeve, your superiority
Don't roll your eyes, my sweet
