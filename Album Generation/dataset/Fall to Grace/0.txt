Do you think of her
When you're with me?
Repeat the memories you made together
Who's face do you see?
Do you wish I was a bit more like her?
Am I too loud? I played the clown to cover up all these doubts

[Pre-Chorus:]
Perfect heart, she's flawless
She's the other woman shining in her splendor
You were lost

[Chorus:]
Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces
She left behind

I found a photograph
Behind the TV
You looked so happy, are you missing the way it used
Be?
And I have changed this room around more often lately
It's clear that me and this four walls
Still know it's hers and yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Perfect heart, she's flawless
She's the other woman shining in her splendor
You were lost

[Chorus:]
Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces
She left behind

[Bridge:]
Are we liars?
In denial
Are we smoke without the fire?
Tell me please, is this worth it?
I deserve it

[Chorus]
Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces
She left behind

Oooohhh! Picking up the pieces of broken heart
Who have saidt it! Who have said it!
Picking up the pieces
Oooohhh! Picking up the pieces
Somebody save me!
Somebody save me!
Whooo-ohhhh-oh-oh!
