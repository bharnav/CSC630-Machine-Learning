[Verse 1]
There’s no angels left in this scene
We both landed somewhere in between
You can’t teach cause you’ll never learn
There’s nothing left, there’s no return

[Chorus]
The more you talk, the less it means
And what I want’s not what I need
While we’re flesh and blood and I still bleed
I know you’re bad for me
But maybe on the streets of glory
I’ll see you on the streets of glory

[Verse 2]
It may hurt to leave but is worse to hold your hand
The shattered glass it falls upon places where you stand
I will be your momento mori
While you hide behind all your made up stories

[Chorus]
The more you talk, the less it means
And what I want’s not what I need
While we’re flesh and blood and I still bleed
I know you’re bad for me
But maybe on the streets of glory
I’ll see you on the streets of glory

[Bridge]
Baby one day, I’ll see you on those streets
Oh those glittering streets, streets of glory
And you’ll take my hand
And take me down to the river, wash my sins away
Oh, and you’ll come with me Won't you take my hand
Meet me on the streets of glory
I’ll see you on the streets of glory
