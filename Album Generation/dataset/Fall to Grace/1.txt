[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

[Verse 1]
The city lead me out one night
Through lonely streets and neon light searching again
I met a stranger singing songs
Sat in that doorway I belonged with him, just talking

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He was so beautiful there in my dreams
I left my heart and my memories

[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

[Verse 2]
He told me he'd be there tomorrow
I knew where he led I would follow
I flew and he knew
When I went back he had disappeared
My hopeful smile had turned to tears
Let down, no sight nor sound

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes it's better just to let them go
Cause your illusion's more than what you could know

[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

[Bridge]
Falling from the sky for him, I'll never regret it
He took my breath away
And although it was the shortest time
I'll never forget it
He gave me such a beautiful lie
Oh, my

[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
Now I'll never forget it
It was best when we left it
Now I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair
30 minute love affair
Our 30 minute love affair
