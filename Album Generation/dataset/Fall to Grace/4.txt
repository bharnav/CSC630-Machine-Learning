Let me down easy
All your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong
I know it's not over
But the last goodbye, oh woahhhh

Let me down easy
When you pass by me babe
Say hello once in a while
When you pass by me baby baby
Does it hurt so much to smile?
We promised that we'd still be friends
Till the very, very end
I'm begging you baby please
Let me down easy

I remember our first time
It was so nice dear
I never thought we'd have to part
But now it's all over
But the last goodbye
I'm telling you baby please
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
