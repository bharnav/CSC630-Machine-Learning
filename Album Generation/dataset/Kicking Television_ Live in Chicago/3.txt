[Verse 1]
When the devil came
He was not red
He was chrome, and he said
Come with me

[Verse 2]
You must go
So I went
Where everything was clean
So precise and towering

[Verse 3]
I was welcomed
With open arms
I received so much help in every way
I felt no fear [x2]

[Verse 4]
The air was crisp
Like sunny late Winter days
A Springtime yawning high in the haze
And I felt like I belonged
Come with me

[Outro]
Come with me[X7]
