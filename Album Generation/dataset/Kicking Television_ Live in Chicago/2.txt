[Verse 1]
The greatest lost track of all time
The Late Greats' "Turpentine"
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it anywhere you go

[Verse 2]
The best band will never get signed
K-Settes starring Butcher's Blind
Are so good, you won't ever know
They never even played a show
You can't hear them on the radio

[Verse 3]
The greatest singer in rock and roll
Would have to be Romeo
His vocal chords are made of gold
He just looks a little too old

[Verse 4]
The best song will never get sung
The best life never leaves your lungs
So good, you won't ever know
I never hear it on the radio
Can't hear it on the radio
