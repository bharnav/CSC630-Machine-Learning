[Chorus 1]
I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you

[Chorus 2]
Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown[x2]

[Verse 1]
They were translating poorly, I felt like a clown
I looked like someone I used to know
I felt alright
And if I ever was myself
I wasn't that night

[Chorus 3]
Oh it's okay for you to say
What you want from me
I believe that's the only
Way for me to be, exactly
What you want me to be

[Chorus 3]
Oh it's okay for you to say
What you want from me
I believe that's the only
Way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Oh it's okay for you to say
What you want from me
I believe that's the only
Way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?[x2]
