There's an airline plane
Flies to Heaven everyday
Past the Pearly Gates
If you want to ride that train
Have your ticket in your hand
Before it's too late
The world looks wrong
And your money's spent and gone
And your friend has turned away
You can get away to Heaven
On this airplane
Just bow your head and pray
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
Take this airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
Oh, a lot of people guess
Some say no and some say yes
Takes some and leave some behind
But you will surely know
When to the airport go
To leave your sins behind
Lot of speakers speak
Lot of preachers preach
When you lay their salary on the line
Well, the only earthly way
Is to bow your head and pray
You can fly to Heaven on time
Fly to Heaven on time
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
And take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
Your ticket that you obtain
On this heavenly airline plane
To leave this world behind
You've got to make that flight
May be daytime, might be night
But you can't see your way if you're blind
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
Take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
