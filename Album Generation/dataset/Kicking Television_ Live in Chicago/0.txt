[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When you're back in your old neighborhood
The cigarettes taste so good
But you're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood
There's something there that you can't find
Honest when you're telling a lie
You hurt her but you don't know why
You love her but you don't know why

[Verse 2]
Short on long term goals
There's a party there that we ought to go to
You still love rock and roll
You still love rock and roll
It's only a quarter to three
Reflected off of your CD
You're looking at a picture of me
You're staring at a picture of me

[Verse 3]
Take the guitar player for a ride
He is never been satisfied
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
Be years before he gets over it

[Verse 4]
There's a fortune inside your head
All you touch turns to lead
You think you might just crawl back in bed
The fortune inside your head
You know you're just a mama's boy
Positively unemployed
You're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood

[Outro]
I know you've got to God-shaped hole
Leaning out your awful soul
You're so misunderstood
I'd like to thank you all for nothing
I'd like to thank you all for nothing at all
I'd like to thank you all for nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing at all
