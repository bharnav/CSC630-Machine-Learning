[Verse 1]
Cheer up, honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off

[Verse 2]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words

[Chorus]
Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
