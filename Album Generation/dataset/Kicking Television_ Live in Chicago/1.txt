[Verse 1]
I attack with love, pure bug beauty
I curl my lips and crawl up to you [x2]
And your afternoon
And I've been puking

[Chorus]
I move so slow, a steady crushing hand
Holy shit, there's a company in my back [x2]

[Verse 2]
Hide your soft skin, your sorrow is sunshine
Listen to my eyes [x2]
They are hissing radiator tunes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty
I'll curve my flight [x2]
Under your bended knee
And I will always die
I will always die
I will always die
So you can remember me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
There's a company in my back
