-CHORUS-
Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train
I'd like to be in Tennessee
But they don't want me
I'm an outcast
This train's my home

I just caught the 904, don't know where she's headin' for, or been. If I don't get caught by a railroad guard, i'll sleep
Tonight in a lumber yard in the next old town she pulls in

Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train
I'd like to be in Tennessee
But they don't want me
I'm an outcast
This train's my home

It's always from town to town
I really wanna settle down somewhere
New Orleans to Birmingham
Or out here in this Midwest town
Where I am right now

Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train
I'd like to be in Tennessee
But they don't want me
I'm an outcast
This train's my home

It's always from town to town
I really wanna settle down somewhere
New Orleans to Birmingham
Or out here in this midwest town
Where I am right now

Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train
I'd like to be in Tennessee
But they don't want me
I'm an outcast
This train's my home

Wheels go 'round, hypnotic sound
In Tennessee
They don't want me, this train's my home
