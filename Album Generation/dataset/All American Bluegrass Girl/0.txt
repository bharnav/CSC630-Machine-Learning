Bill might be from Kentucky, and
Jimmy from Tennessee
I'm an all American bluegrass girl, and
Proud as I can be

Each day I greet the morning
With the sounds of the radio
Lester Flatt was singing on that
Martha White show
"Big K" on the banjo, Marty on the mandolin
I'm an all American bluegrass girl
And proud of where I've been

-CHORUS-
Bill might be from Kentucky, and
Jimmy from Tennessee
Though I might be from Missouri
I'm as bluegrass as can be
A life of bluegrass music
With friends and family
I'm an all American bluegrass girl
And proud as I can be

All my life they told me
'You're pretty good for a girl
Some day you'll play the Opry
Just like Sonny, Bob and Earl.'
I'm livin' dreams I never dreamed
Mom and Daddy, they taught me right
To be an all American bluegrass girl
Who's singin' here tonight

Bill might be from Kentucky, and
Jimmy from Tennessee
Though I might be from Missouri
I'm as bluegrass as can be
A life of bluegrass music
With friends and family
I'm an all American bluegrass girl
And proud as I can be

Bill might be from Kentucky, and
Jimmy from Tennessee
Though I might be from Missouri
I'm as bluegrass as can be
A life of bluegrass music
With friends and family
I'm an all American bluegrass girl
And proud as I can be

I'm an all American bluegrass girl
And proud as I can be
