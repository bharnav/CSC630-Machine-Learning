-CHORUS-
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties

Took His people by the hand
Led them 'cross that barren land
Pharaoh chased them night and day
But the angel of the Lord kept him away

Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties

A humble carpenter by trade
You'll know him by the works he made
No towers of stone, nor works of steel
But a wooden cross on a wind swept hill

Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties

No boulevard, no avenue
Not a road by man can carry you
A highway built by hands unseen
To that city of gold for eternity

Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties

Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties

Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails, and two cross-ties
