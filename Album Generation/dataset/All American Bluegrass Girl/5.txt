You're a midnight angel
At twelve is when you start
Searching for a victim
To feed your hungry heart
You say you don't love me
Still, I wait all alone
For my midnight angel to come home

-CHORUS-
It seems I've spent a life time
Between midnight and dawn
Watching from my window
For someone to bring you home
Listening to the silence
While waiting all alone
For my midnight angel to come home

I see you through my window
As he is bringing you home
You know that I'll be waiting
And you know I'll be alone
But come tomorrow morning
You'll look and find me gone
Goodbye my midnight angel from now on

It seems I've spent a life time
Between midnight and dawn
Watching from my window
For someone to bring you home
Listening to the silence
While waiting all alone
For my midnight angel to come home
