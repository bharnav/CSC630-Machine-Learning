Way back in the hills
As a boy I was once wondered
Buried deep in her grave
Lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth
A jewel for Heaven
More precious than diamonds
More precious than gold

A jewel here on earth
A jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom
Around God's great throne
May the angels have peace
God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart
And they've left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen
We courted each other
She promised someday
To become my sweet wife
I brought her a ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her
To heaven one night

A jewel here on earth
A jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom
Around God's great throne
May the angels have peace
God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart
And they've left me to roam

This world has it's wealth
It's trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures
Of diamonds and gold
But she can't hold the soul
Of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace
In that Heavenly home

A jewel here on earth
A jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom
Around God's great throne
May the angels have peace
God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart
And they left me to roam
