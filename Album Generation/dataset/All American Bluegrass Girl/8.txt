I came into the parlor
A precious soul had gone home
I grieved with the family
Who'd been left all alone
The tears were freely flowing
Their loss so hard to bear
It was then I looked around me
She was the prettiest flower there

-CHORUS-
Angels stood at attention
When she was called away
For she'd held the hand of Jesus every day
Heaven's choir played her anthem
As they welcomed one so rare
Heaven knows she is
The prettiest flower there

I placed a rose by her side
It seemed I saw her smile
I remembered how she blessed all those
She met o'er the miles
Eternally she's resting now
In a garden so fair
And when Heaven looks upon her
It sees the prettiest flower there

Angels stood at attention
When she was called away
For she'd held the hand of Jesus every day
Heaven's choir played her anthem
As they welcomed one so rare
Heaven knows she is the
Prettiest flower there

Heaven's choir played her anthem
As they welcomed one so rare
Heaven knows she is
The prettiest flower there

Heaven knows she is the
Prettiest flower there
