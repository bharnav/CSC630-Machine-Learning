I thought I'd take a quick ride
To ease my worried mind
But lonesome was the blacktop
So I pulled off to the side
As I drove into the parking lot
I couldn't believe my eyes
Oh there's that pretty Jenny
With that man of mine

-CHORUS-
And it's another heartbreaker's alibi
It's another cold-hearted, dirty lie
They'll be a long trail of tears left behind
But my eyes have been opened
Now she's the one who's blind

He had no time to call me
'Cause he never stayed at home
He refused to take me with him
He'd rather go alone
Well, he didn't wanna hold me
And he had no time to talk
About our pain and troubles
Now he's the one in fault

And it's another heartbreaker's alibi
It's another cold-hearted, dirty lie
They'll be a long trail of tears left behind
But my eyes have been opened
Now she's the one who's blind

And it's another heartbreaker's alibi
It's another cold-hearted, dirty lie
They'll be a long trail of tears left behind
But my eyes have been opened
Now she's the one who's blind

Yes my eyes have been opened
Now she's the one who's blind
