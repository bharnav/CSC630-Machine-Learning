You cannot gossip, and cheat and lie
And make it to those pearly gates
You must love your neighbor
As you love yourself
Your heart can't be filled with hate

-CHORUS-
Don't act, but be a Christian
Like the Bible says to be
If you're gonna live right
Let go of the wrong
Brother, fall down on your knees

There's more to religion
Than Sunday mornin'
It takes seven days of the week
You just don't know who might be listenin'
Be careful what you speak

Don't act, but be a Christian
Like the Bible says to be
If you're gonna live right
Let go of the wrong
Brother, fall down on your knees

Don't act, but be a Christian
Like the Bible says to be
If you're gonna live right
Let go of the wrong
Brother, fall down on your knees

Brother, fall down on your knees
