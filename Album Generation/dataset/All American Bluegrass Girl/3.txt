"I met a soldier, on the base at Fort Hood
I said, 'how do you do it?'
He said, 'there's bad with the good.'
And no matter how tough it gets
The soldier stands strong
Keeping our family, flag and country free
And righting the wrong

I met a soldier, she was thanking me
At first it was strange to hear
Then I started to see
What it meant to have someone
Appreciate her sacrifice
And everything she gives for us
Defending our rights

-CHORUS-
God bless the soldier
As they walk the streets
Let them know how much it means
To have them keep our country free

When you meet a soldier, stand and salute
Take a moment to show your love
For everything that they do
Don't be afraid, give them your praise
For this is the stranger that is willing
To give their life for you

God bless the soldier."
