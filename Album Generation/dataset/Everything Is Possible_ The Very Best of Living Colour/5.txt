[Verse 1]
Do you remember anyone here?
No, you don't remember anything at all
I'm here flat on my back
I never woke up; had no regrets

[Chorus]
There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
They party all the time
Gonna party till they drop
Other people can go home
(Other people can go home)
Other people, they can split
(Other people, they can split)
I can never stop
(I can never stop)
I can never quit

[Verse 2]
Take a walk through the land of the shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Don't look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?

[Chorus]
There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
I'm stuck here in the seat
And I may not stand up
Other people can go home
(Other people can go home)
Other people, they can split
(Other people, they can split)
I can never stop
(I can never stop)
I can never quit

[Outro]
Everything is quiet
Everyone's gone to sleep
I'm wide awake
But these memories
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
No, these memories
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
Oh, these memories can't wait
(Can't wait)
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
