[Verse 1]
I don't have a need
To be the best
Don't want to be
Just like the rest
Just stay who I am
Just an ordinary
Middle man

[Verse 2]
Give me
The happy medium
Don't want to be
The one whose leading them, no, no
I've got no master plan
Just a simple
Middle man

[Bridge]
Standing on a fine line between this and that
Just biding my time
Waiting for a sign
To tell me that I'm something special
Well, well

[Verse 3]
My ideas
Are mine alone
Not yours, not theirs
But I care
I hurt for you
But not with you
I love that thing
That's inside you

[Chorus]
But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man

But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man

[Outro]
Middle man yeah, yeah
I'm not your fan
I'm just a middle man
Yours, theirs, but I care
I've got no master plan
Just be who I am
Just a middle man
