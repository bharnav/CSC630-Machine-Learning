All the ways that, I have tried
To keep New Mexico, still near
And the rain, done come
And gone

Now sleep far, away, where you come from
Where you come from

It's a rain
Rainbow
Rainbow river day
It's a rain
Rainbow
Rainbow river day

In that same ol', familiar
Familiar way
With no decision
To live, that weigh
Mountain crystal sparrow, lead, the way

Star blanket river child
Will be alright, after a while
After a while

After a while, after a while
