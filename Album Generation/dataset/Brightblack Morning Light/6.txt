With crystals raised
Slept by the rainbow hillside
Come to see the time like
The brightest morning light

And it's a long ride
By a wooden canoe to be free
And it's a long ride
By a wooden canoe to a high time

And when I get back
I'm gon' give back
And when I get back
I'm gon' give back

With a crystal raised
Calling midnight rainbow
Black feather wishes rise
For able grateful eyes

When I get back
I'm gon', I'm gon' give back
When I get back
I'm gon' give back

Black feather wishes rise
Black feather wishes rise
