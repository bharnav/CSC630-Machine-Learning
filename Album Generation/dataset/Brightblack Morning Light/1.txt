I told you 'bout the silver rain cloud
It came down, cleaned the ground
Well, it's about time
Well, it's about time

To think about time is wasted time
To think about time is wastin' time
It has taken all of me
It has taken all of me

Well carry that load, friend of mine
Carry that load, friend of Time
In the morning, we'll be fine
In the morning, we'll be fine

Well friend I'm bound to take a fall
You ain't show me no help at all
When you know it's the Man's fault
Yes you've wasted, your light
