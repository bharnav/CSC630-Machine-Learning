All rainbow woodland go still
When owl candle call the blessed near
Nearby

Still nearby
The wild mountain woodfire light
It gets golden beside
All we have
All we have

And after all this time
Broken shines

I still believe
Still believe
Still believe
Still believe

Gray owl told rainbow friend
"Let it be, let the blessed be."
Wake up beside, the morning light
With bright silver rain, and broken clouds

All we have, all we have
Still believe
Still believe
Still believe
Please don't shake, me
Friend
Please don't shake, me
Friend
Please don't shake, me
