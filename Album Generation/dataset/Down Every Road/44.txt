I love the women, I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody, well enough to change her name

Women make a fool out of me

Hey my pappa scolded me, My mamma she sat and cried
Oh my pappa scolded me, My mamma she sat and cried
I got too many women, For any little boy my size

And women make a fool out of me

When I'm in the parlour, the girls think it's a treat
Yeah when I'm in the parlour, the girls think it's a treat
Cos even in the wintertime, They turn off the heat

Hey, but women make a fool out of me

Now flurry on me one time

Yeah I love the women, Lord I love 'em all the same
I love the women, I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody, well enough to change her name

Women make a fool out of me
