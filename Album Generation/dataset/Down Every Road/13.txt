[Verse]
My house of memories, is all i own
I live in misery, now that you're gone
A constant reminder, of what used to be
Is torturing me, in my house of memories
My house is a prison, where memories surround me
There's no place to hide where you're memory won't find
Me
My house of memories, is all i own
I'm all alone, in my house of memories
My house is a prison, where memories surround me
There's no place to hide where you're memory won't find
Me
My house of memories, is all i own
And i'm all alone, in my house of memories
In my house of memories
