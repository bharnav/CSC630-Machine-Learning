[Verse 1]
The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
"Let my guitar playing friend do my request." (Let him)

[Chorus]
Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

[Verse 2]
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers "There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die [x2]
