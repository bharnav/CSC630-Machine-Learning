[Verse 1]
It gets longer in between each time you call
I'd be safe in saying you no longer care at all
We're never seem together like we used to

[Chorus]
Tell me darling whatever happened to me

[Verse 2]
I once played a big part in your world
Think back and i know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world

[Chorus]
Oh but whatever happened to me

[Verse 3]
I made up my own excuses for so long
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
Please forgive me if i'm just too blind to see

[Chorus]
Tell me darling whatever happened to me

[Outro]
Please forgive me if i'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me
