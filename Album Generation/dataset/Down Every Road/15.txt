[Chorus]
Mary's mine and she'll always be till the end of time
She gave her heart to me
No truer love could i ever find than mary's love
And mary's mine

[Verse]
I once lived the life without meaning
Just the face with no place in this world
At last i found reason for living
And i owe it all to the love of a girl
Her love gave me reason for living
To make her happy is first on my mind
Because of her my life has real meaning
I love her so and i know mary's mine

[Chorus]
