[Verse 1]
In old padres nadres old mexico
Once in my travel i happened to go
I met maria and we fell in love
It seemed like heaven came down from above
Dark skin and dark eyes and dark wavy hair
All kept me spellbound as love filled the air
I held her tightly then to my surprise
She whispered soft words with tears in her eyes

[Chorus]
Go home, go home, your people would not understand
Go home go, home, go back to your own homeland

[Verse 2]
With gentle persuasion i changed her mind
I said they'd love her and treat her so kind
So we went together to my old hometown
I wanted to show my old friends what i'd found
But hate made my sweet dream a nightmare
One day i came home and she was not there
A note on the table tore my world apart
My old friends has been there and told my sweetheart

[Chorus]
