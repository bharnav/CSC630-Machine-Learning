[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm bringing home some good news
Got some things you'll be glad to hear
Like I'm leaving town and won't be back around
Just long enough to get my gear

[Chorus]
There won't be any goodbye kisses
Well, I'm putting on my leaving shoes
This is the end we're through it's over
Yeah, I'm bringing home some good news

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sitting downtown in a tavern
And I made up my mind to go
And I knew you would be so glad to be free
I just thought to call you to let you know

[Chorus]
Oh, you can tell all your backdoor daddies
That your big daddy's done blew a fuse
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringing home some good news

[Verse 3]
To you I been known as bad news
Well, I'm changing my first name
And I'm giving you your freedom baby
That old race won't kind of change

[Chorus]
Yeah, go to hide your lookman slippers
I won't be looking around for blues
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah I'm bringing home some good news

[Outro]
Good news, there's some good news for you honey
I'm bringing home some good news [x2]
Honey
