[Verse 1]
You taught me how to love with all my heart
With all my soul i trusted you
And now you say we'll have to live apart
A thing i don't know how to do

[Chorus]
You say someday i'll find somebody new
And i'll have not one regret
Stay a while if what you say is true
Stay and teach me to forget

[Verse 2]
You taught me how to worship you alone
And now you say that you must go
And people call me on the telephone
Just to say i told you so

[Chorus]
You say someday i'll find somebody new
And i'll have not one regret
Stay a while if what you say is true
Stay and teach me to forget
Stay and teach me to forget...
