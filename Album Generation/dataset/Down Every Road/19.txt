[Verse 1]
There hasn't been one bit of laughter in this house so long
Just the howling of the wind asking why
I know this house ain't growing but it seems bigger since you're gone

[Chorus]
And the loneliness is eating me alive

[Verse 2]
If there's any forgiveness in ye wrap it up and come on home
Yeah i may not change completely oh but i'll try
And honey you have to hurry or there'd be no reason to come home

[Chorus]
Cause this loneliness is eating me alive

[Verse 3]
The bigger the house the harder the tear falls i found it out since your goodbye
And honey you'll have to hurry or there'll be no reason to come home

[Chorus]
Cause this loneliness is eating me alive yeah this loneliness is eating me alive
