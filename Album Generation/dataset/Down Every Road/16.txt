[Verse 1]
I played the brand new record on the jukebox
And i scarcely could believe the song i've heard
It told of how you left me for another
It was almost like i'd written every word

[Chorus]
Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you've done me wrong
Someone told my story in a song

[Verse 2]
The writer must've seen the way you done me
For he told it all and never missed a line
He told of swinging doors and the jukebox
And he even knew i almost lost my mind

[Chorus]
