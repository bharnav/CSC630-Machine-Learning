Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
I made a big mistake when
I introduced her to my friend
And gave him a chance to dance with her
As I watched them in the crowd
I could hear my heart beat loud
Because it meant goodbye to me
When she said hello to him
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
She just held on to his hand
When it was break time for the band
And it was plain to see that I'd lost out
So I slipped to wait and cry
Felt so low I could die
Because it meant goodbye to me
When she said hello to him
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Is there anywhere to go
Where a broken heart won't show
Everyone must know what's wrong with me
They can tell about my ways
I go around lost in the days
Because it meant goodbye to me
When she said hello to him
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
