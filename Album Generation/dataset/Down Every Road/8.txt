[Verse 1: Merle Haggard]
This old smoke filled bar
Is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you
Satisfied
And I just called to let you know
Where I'd be living
It's not much
But I feel welcome here inside

[Chorus: Merle Haggard]
I got swinging doors
And a jukebox
And a barstool
My new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me
Anytime you want to
Because I'm always here at home, till closing time

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
Well, I got everything it takes
To drive me crazy
I've got everything I need
To lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere
Is just right for it
And thanks to you
I'm always here till closing time

[Chorus: Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard]
