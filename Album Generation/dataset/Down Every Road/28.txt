[Chorus]
Today I Started Loving You Again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then Today I Started Loving You Again

[Verse]
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun

[Chorus]
