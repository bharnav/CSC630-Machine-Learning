[Verse 1]
Well not long ago I was a happy man
Money in my pockets with the rings on my hands
My money's all Gone and I'm feeling low
Standing on the corner of skid Row
I got an old John Beam with the pain more through
Got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
My wine's all gone and I need some more
Standing on the corner of skid row

[Chorus]
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes
When you're hanging around on Skid Row

[Verse 2]
Well my girl friend left me she don't want me no more
We had a great big fight just a night before
She said I got no class because she knows
I've been hanging around on skid row

[Chorus]
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes
When you're hanging around on skid row
When you're hanging around on skid row
