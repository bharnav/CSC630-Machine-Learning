[Verse]
I'm going to break every heart I can
I'd be a find-'em-and-fool-'em man
I'm going to dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well if I live and have enough time
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm going to break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm going to think of lotta good lies
I'm going to laugh when a woman cries
I'm going to have myself a style to recognize
I'm going to travel all around the world
I'd be a friend to the sweetest girl
I'm going to break every heart I can
And all my name ain't Merle
Well if I ever get around to you
You going to know about the things I do
They going to tell about the harm
I've done in the latest News
Because if I live and have enough time
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm going to break every heart
I can in everyone I find
I'm going to break every heart I can
I'd be a love them and leave them man
I'm going to dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well if I live and have enough time
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm going to break every heart I can in everyone I find[x2]
