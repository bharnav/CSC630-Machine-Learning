Our love keeps drifting and you keep giving me to blame
I go on loving you although it's all in vain
Now you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try

I've done all I can do and I'm standin' at the end
Although I know it's over my heart just won't give in
So you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try

I've done all I can do and I'm standin' at the end
Although I know it's over my heart just won't give in
So you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try
