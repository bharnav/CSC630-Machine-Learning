[Verse]
Sing me a song of sadness
And sing it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear it's because she's not here
Sing a sad song and sing it for me
She's unhappy with me she told me so
I'm unhappy without her
And I still love her so
Oh sing me a song of sadness
Pretend it's the end of the world

[Chorus][x2]
Sing it sweet and sing it low
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me
