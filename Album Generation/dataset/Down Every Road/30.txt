[Verse 1]
Revenge must be the reason
Why forgiveness was a thing i never knew
And someday soon i know you plan to hurt me
But don't plan on getting by with the things you do

[Chorus]
'Cause i'll always know when you been cheating
And i'll always know you've been untrue
I'll always know

[Verse 2]
Your heart is like a window
But when i look inside i see another man
But go on and lie and tell him how you fooled me
But remember i saw through you're evil plan

[Chorus]
'Cause i'll always know when you been cheating
And i'll always know you've been untrue
I'll always know
And don't forget it either
