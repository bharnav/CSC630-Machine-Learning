[Verse 1]
All around the water tanks
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can i show
Get off, get off, you railroad bum
And he slammed that boxcar door
He put me off in texas
The place i dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above

[Chorus]
Nobody seemed to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from frisco
I'm going back to dixie land
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waiting for a train. [x2]
