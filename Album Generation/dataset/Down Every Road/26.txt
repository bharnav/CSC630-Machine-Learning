[Verse]
Well, I'm going to get me a seeing eye dog to help me find my way
I'm so much in love with you I can't even see the light of day
My mind is cloudy like a winter storm before the rain come pouring down
I feel so good and I got to get my feet on the ground on the ground

[Chorus x2]
Well. I'm walking real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometime I want to holler out loud
Well I'm going to take me a coming down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I got to get my feet on the ground on the ground

[Outro]
(On the ground)
