[Verse 1]
Once i lived the life of wine and roses
And i drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn

[Chorus]
But now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose

[Verse 2]
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn i made was not the one i'd planned
And i watched my social standings slip away from me
While i watched the bottle slowly take command

[Chorus]
And now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose
