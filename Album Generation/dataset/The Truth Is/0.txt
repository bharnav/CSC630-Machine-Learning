[Verse 1]
You know I'll be the one who gets falling down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I've got an '82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the interstate
I've got a beer-stained t-shirt, looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Getting trailer trashed tonight

[Chorus]
'cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

[Verse 2]
I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly, hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Living it up, living it up
Being a lowlife

[Verse 3]
A gun-packing, bitch-smacking, mess with me, it's gonna happen
Loving life, living in sin
Passed out, on the floor, sorry, just don't work no more
Giving up on giving in
Ah, fuck it!

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
Cause deep down I really know everyone is

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Living it up, living it up
Being a low life
