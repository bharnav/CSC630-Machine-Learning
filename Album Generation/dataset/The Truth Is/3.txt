[Hook:]
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights and
All the things that we did
I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 1:]
Maybe it was the way you talked
Maybe it was the way you laughed
I don't know just what it is
But I know I want you back

[Hook]
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights
And all the things that we did
I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 2:]
Maybe it was the way you smiled
Maybe it was the way you kissed (yeah, maybe)
I don't know just what it is
But I know I want this to last

[Hook]
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights
And all the things that we did
I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head

[Bridge:]
I keep trying to sleep
But I'm lying awake
I'm thinkin' about the love I threw away (threw away)
But it won't let me go
And I need you to know that...
I-I-ah-I-I
I-I-ah-I-I (h-I-I)
I-I-ah-I-I
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head

[Outro:]
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
In my whole life
I never had it this bad
I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head (whoa)
Out of my head (whoa)
Whoa
I-I-ah-I-I can't get you out of my head
I-I-ah-I-I...
