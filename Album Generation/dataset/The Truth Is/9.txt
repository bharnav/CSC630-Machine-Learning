[Verse 1]
I feel so dirty in my hotel room
I got a king size bed that smells like cheap perfume
And I say to myself: Tyler what were you thinking?
(Tyler what were you thinking)
My head is heavy from all the drinks last night
I had too, too many Jagers, I don't feel so right
Am I crazy as hell or is the whole place spinning?
Oh, I've just made a big mistake
I'm caught in a nightmare wide awake

[Chorus]
I've got girls outside my window
And girls outside my door
I'm gonna learn, that's too damn easy
And I can't take it anymore
I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling guilty for all the things I've done
I've got a stomach full of knots and my poor heart is numb
Can I live with myself or will I get what's coming
I say I'm sorry and that there's nothing to feel
But it all went to hell without you here
And I'm hating myself so I guess I'll keep drinking
So please just stay, forget this day
Cause you can't be the one that got away

[Chorus]
I got whiskey on the table
And whiskey on the floor
I've got fans who will forgive me
Banging on the tour bus door
And I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

[Hook]
What was I thinking
What was I thinking
What was I thinking
When all I really want is you

[Bridge]
Please, please come and save my soul tonight
Please, please come and make everything alright

[Chorus]
I've got girls outside my window
And girls outside my door
I've got girls just dying to take the clothes off
And I got a house in every city
I got so much to loose
I got everything any guy could want
But all I really want is you

[Hook]
What was I thinking
What was I thinking
What was I thinking, yeah
When all I really want is you
What was I thinking
What was I thinking
What was I thinking, yeah
When all I really want is you

[Outro]
Tyler what were you thinking?
