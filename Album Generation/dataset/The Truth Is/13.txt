[Verse 1:]
They don't seem to know your name
Does it really matter?
They don't even shed a tear, for you
They didn't seem to waste no time
To fill your locker
They don't give a second thought, to you
Oh, things have gotta change

[Hook:]
I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
Now you're gone

[Verse 2:]
You're spending all your time alone
Cause you don't need them
No one can see the pain inside, of you
You just wanna say goodbye
You're giving up now
I think the letter says it all, it's not your fault
Oh, things will never change

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?

[Bridge:]
Did it hurt as much that day
As every other?
So I light a candle in, your name

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry that I never said
How much you had really meant
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?
I'm sorry that I never tried
To tell you I was on your side
It's hard to say but now you're gone
So does it really matter?

[Outro:]
It's hard to say but now you're gone
To me it really matters
Does it really matter?
