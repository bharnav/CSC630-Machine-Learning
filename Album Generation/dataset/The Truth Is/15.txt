[Verse 1:]
Watching you walk out the door
I think I've seen it all before
But this time's different
This time's not the same
All those memories of us are gone
How could all this be wrong?
Oh, this time's different
You won't be back again

[Hook:]
Those whirlwind loves they fade so fast
I hoped this one was meant to last
Maybe, just maybe, maybe, baby

[Chorus:]
Can't leave love in the sun like that
A heart may die, it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To remember these words baby
We can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive, maybe
We'll remember these words for better or worse

[Verse 2:]
If we could only go back in time
Maybe we could see the reason why
This time's different
This time's not the same
All those hurtful things you shouldn't have said
Why can we just forgive and forget
I'm thinking this time's different
You won't be back again

[Hook:]
Those whirlwind loves they fade so fast
Please make this be meant to last
And maybe, just maybe, maybe, baby

[Chorus:]
Can't leave love in the sun like that
A heart may die, it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To remember these words baby
We can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive, maybe
We'll remember these words for better or worse

[Bridge:]
The moment you were gone I had to feel your touch
You already broke my heart, well isn't it enough?
Baby, please

[Hook:]
Those whirlwind loves they fade so fast
Please make this be meant to last
And maybe, just maybe, maybe, baby

[Outro:]
We can't leave love in the sun like that
A heart may die, it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To remember these words baby
We can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive, maybe
We'll remember these words for better or worse
For better or worse
We'll remember these words for better or worse
