[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't we forget?
Why can't you forget?
