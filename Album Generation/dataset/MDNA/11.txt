[Verse 1]
When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I'd kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And pure, so sure, I'd struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark
See our hearts are intertwined
Then I'm free, free of mind
I'm falling free

[Chorus 1]
And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
And deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind

[Verse 2]
When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love
And when you lift, you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

[Chorus 2]
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

[Verse 3]
When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The face of God that stands above
Pouring over hope and love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, free to go
I'm falling free

[Breakdown]
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free

[Chorus 2]
Deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go
Deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go
