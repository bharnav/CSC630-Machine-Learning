[Verse 1]
You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor?
I guess if I was your treasury
You'd have found the time to treasure me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How come you can't see
All that you need is right here with me?
Up until the end
All this pretend wasn't for free

[Chorus]
Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it 'til there's nothing
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me

[Verse 2]
If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt?
Frankly, if my name was Benjamin
We wouldn't be in the mess we're in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You played with my heart
"Till death do we part," that's what you said
Now you have your flash car, women and bars
It's gone 'till your head

[Chorus]
Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Love me like your money
Spend it 'til there's nothing
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold onto me 'til there's nothing left

[Breakdown]
Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Feeling love spent
Wondering where it all went

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms until there's nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left

[Breakdown - Variation]
Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Feeling love spent
Wondering where it all went

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms until there's nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left
(Nothing left...)
