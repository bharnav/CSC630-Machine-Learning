[Intro: Madonna]
And the beat goes on, I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song, in my happy world
I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday, huh

[Chorus: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Verse 1: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
Light my candles, got to make a wish
Wrap up the present and seal it with a kiss
Give me a spanking, start the day off right (woo-wee)
Because it's my day, you are going to sing my song tonight

[Chorus: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Post-Chorus: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
My type of party, there's no hangover
So grab your things, you better come over
We get high and we still stay sober
We throw it down and then we going to start over
My type of party there's no hangover

[Chorus: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Verse 3: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
I want a diamond, don't give me a fake (That's what I said)
I'll let you lick the frosting off my cake (Yeah)
Give me a spanking, start the day off right (woo-wee)
Because it's my birthday, you'll be singing my song tonight

[Chorus: Madonna]
And the beat goes on (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a happy girl (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
It's my birthday song (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
In my happy world (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)

[Post-Chorus: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
I know it's gonna be a good day, oh yeah, today is my birthday
(I'm a happy girl), in my happy world
I know it's gonna be a good day, oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
(It's my birthday everyday)

[Outro: Madonna (& M.I.A.)]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (gonna sing my song tonight)
"Happy birthday!"
