[Verse 1]
When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth and saying your name
Is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out
When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again off the back of my hand and I know it sounds tragic

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love! (I'm addicted to your love!)
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

[Verse 2]
Now that your name pumps like a blood in my veins
It pulses through my body, igniting my mind
And it's like MDMA, and that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

[Bridge]
I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice
I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm willing to take this chance
I need to dance!

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

[Outro]
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A
M-D-N-A, M-D-N-A (I'm addicted)
