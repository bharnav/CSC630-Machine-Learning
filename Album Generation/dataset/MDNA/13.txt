[Chorus]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

[Verse 1]
I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back, I'd have no fear
If I took another path, things would be so different, but they're not
I could've just kept my big mouth closed
I could've just done what I was told
Maybe I should of turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

[Chorus]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

[Verse 2]
I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
You wanna know how to make God laugh?
Tell him your plans

[Bridge]
We could've bought a house with a swimming pool
Filled it up with Warhols, it would be so cool
Could've gone riding stallions in the countryside
With a pack of great danes, racing eye to eye
We could've toured the world in a private jet
Gotten naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We could of climbed the mountains
Seen the perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We could've gotten drunk and driven on the Autobahn
We could've got ourselves arrested in St. Germain
We could of lived life crazy 'til the day we died
Instead I made you cry

[Outro]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, je suis désolée
I wish I could take it back
But I can't
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back, maybe one day
Or not
