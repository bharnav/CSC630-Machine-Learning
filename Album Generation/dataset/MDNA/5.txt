[Verse 1]
Some girls can do anything
Whole world hanging on a string
She's flawless, so fresh and clean
(Like a virgin, sweet and keen)
Some girls got an attitude
Fake tits and a nasty mood
Hot chick when she's in the nude
(In the naughty, naked, nude)
Some girls got a sexy slur
One drink and it's all a blur
Cash now if you wanna flirt
(Cash or credit, it's going to hurt)
Some girls going off the deep end
Some girls living for the weekend
Some girls like to get their freak on
(Freaky, getting freaky)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouths and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine
Some girls make you feel like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging, "baby, please"
I got you begging, "baby, please"

[Verse 2]
Some girls wanna call the shots
Come first, wanna be on top
Gotta work till you hit the spot
Some girls have a filthy mouth
All talk and they never stop
Just takin, it's not enough
(Too much is never enough)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouths and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine
Some girls make you feel like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging, "baby, please"
I got you begging, "baby, please"

[Interlude]
(A wet dream, wet dream, wet dream...)
You're big and hard enough

[Bridge]
Wrap you arms around my neck
It's time to deal, so cut the deck
If you wanna play this game with me
I'm not like all the rest
Some girls are second best
Put your loving to the test, you'll see
Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging, "baby please"
I got you begging, "baby please"
(Got their "fuck me" porn star heels on)
Some girls are not like me
I'm better than you ever dreamed of
I got you baby on your knees
I got you begging, "baby, please"
Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
(Got their "fuck me" porn star heels on)
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls
(Freaky, getting freaky...)
