[Verse 1]
Like the sun, like the light, like a plane
Like the storm, I'm born through everything
Like a bomb in the night, like a train
Thundering through the hills, let it rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Chorus]
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Have the magic pass tonight

[Hook]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Verse 2]
Like the moon with no light of my own
Surfs the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my hand in the fire
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Chorus]
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Have the magic pass tonight

[Hook]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
Praise the Lord and I like it that way

[Bridge]
Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross
Died for our sins, it's such a loss
Saint Christopher, find my way
I'll be coming home one day
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry
Let those poison arrows fly
Saint Anthony, lost and found
Thomas Aquinas, stand your ground
All those saints and holy men
Catch me before I sin again

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Hook]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Outro]
You're a sinner, you're a sinner
You're a sinner, you like it that way
We're all sinners
We're all sinners
We're all sinners
I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner
And I like it that way
Hail Mary, full of grace (The Lord is with me)
Hail Mary, full of grace (Your love is with me)
Full of grace
