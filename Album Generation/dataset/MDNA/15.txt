[Verse 1]
I miss your brain, the way you think
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws
It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent, what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Verse 2]
I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times: I don't miss all of it
You'd write me poetry, you had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Bridge]
It's so sad that it had to end
I lost my very best friend
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend
I put away your letters
Saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Outro]
It's so sad that it had to end
