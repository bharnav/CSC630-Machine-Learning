[Verse 1]
Dark eyes on a dangerous face, you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place, you are a beautiful killer
You don't have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don't understand
I don't know much about you are a wanted man

[Chorus 1]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
'Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Verse 2]
Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die
You are a beautiful killer
I like your silhouette when you stand on the street
Like a samurai, you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

[Chorus 1]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Chorus 2]
Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer, and I love your disguise

[Bridge]
(Beautiful killer)
You've changed the past
Good guys always finish last
(Beautiful killer)
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

[Chorus 1]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Chorus 2]
Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer, and I love your disguise

[AdLib]
You're a beautiful killer, but you'll never be Alain Delon
