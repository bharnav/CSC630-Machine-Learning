[Verse 1]
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang - bang bang
I thought you were good, but you painted me bad
Compared to the others, you're the best thing I had
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead

[Verse 2]
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
Made a decision, I will never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead, in the head

[Verse 3]
Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead
I made a decision, I will never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead

[Chorus]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang - shot you dead, in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Verse 4]
And then I discovered it couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin, you were driving my hearse
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - in the head
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
I made a decision, I would never look back
So, how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang - shot you dead, in the head

[Chorus]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang - shot you dead, in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Interlude]
I need you to die for me, baby

[Breakdown]
You have to die for me, baby
That's right, you have to die for me, baby
How could I move on with my life?
If you didn't die for me, baby
If you didn't die for me, baby
I need you to die for me, baby!

[Chorus - Variation]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead and I have no regrets
(He deserved it)

[Bridge]
And I'm going straight to hell
And I got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
Cause I want to see him die
Over, and over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over, and over
Now drive, bitch! I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die, bitch!
That's right, drive, bitch
Now drive, bitch! I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die bitch!
That's right, drive bitch!

[Outro]
Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch
