[Verse 1]
If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It seems to me it's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

[Verse 2]
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It seems to me it's what you're like
The "look, but please don't touch me" type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

[Bridge]
And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
