[Intro]
In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Chorus]
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys

[Intro]
In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Outro]
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
