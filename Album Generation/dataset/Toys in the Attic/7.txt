[Verse 1]
If you believe in me
Like I believe in you
You would be telling me things
That weren't exactly true

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everything changes
Ain't nothin the same
I'm having the strangest feel, baby
I can't remember my name

[Chorus]
Because the life I've been living
And the love I've been giving
Will be sure to send you spinning
With your feet never touching the ground
Going round n' round

[Verse 2]
When it was one for all
And it was all for one
And everything that we did
Never bothered no one

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Can you remember the days
When you were sweet sixteen
And always followed the ways
Of someone else's dreams

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
Going round n' round n' round n' round
