[Intro]

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 1]
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year
Some sweat hot mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
Because the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 2]
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
Because a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand
