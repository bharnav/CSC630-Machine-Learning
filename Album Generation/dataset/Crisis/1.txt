[Verse 1: George Pettit (Dallas Green)]
This town has its claws buried in my neck
This town, it takes lives without mercy, without hate
(The streets are in distress
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies)
The grass is growing on top of my feet
I'm sinking, won't be long before I'm too deep to run
(The lineup seems endless
Underneath the salvation signs)
We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the bend before the break, our steps seal our fate

[Chorus: Dallas Green]
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts
From broken homes
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope
Left for these souls

[Verse 2: George Pettit (Dallas Green)]
Every step I take, I leave a small piece
Of myself behind - soon there will be nothing left
(The cracks in the pavement
Match the cracks in their weathered skin)
The sky's a brick wall, the ground's a juggernaut
Each day they get a bit closer; between them I am caught
(I stare in amazement
I can't believe this is where I live)
Every breath I take, I feel my lungs seal
This breeze feels more like shards of glass
I'm more scars than skin

[Chorus: Dallas Green]
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts
From broken homes
Because this city, this city is haunted
There's no hope
Left for these souls

[Bridge: George Pettit (Dallas Green)]
Our steps seal fate
Our steps seal fate
This is our celebration - come join the lost souls
This is our celebration - come join the lost souls
(This city, this city is haunted)
Ohhh! Walk with us, ohhh!
Down!
Walk with us!

[Chorus: Dallas Green]
City, this city is haunted
By ghosts
From broken homes
Because this city, this city is haunted
There's no hope
Left for these souls
