I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
You can always make new friends (oh no)
But when you sell 'em out, they won't be worth as much (oh no)
[2x]

Now this bridge is ashes
It might as well have never been built
It might as well have never been built
Little river that it crossed
Looks like an ocean now, looks like an ocean now

Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
(Love to play the victim)
You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
(Was it all for nothing)
Keep it on wax

You're not the only one
Who's had to make sacrifices
Who's had to make sacrifices
And time won't heal shit
When you got your hands in my pocket
When you got your hands...

Kick, Kick, Kick
Scream, Scream, Scream
Won't change a god damn thing (It won't change)
Kick, Kick, Kick
Scream, Scream, Scream (A god damn thing)
[2x]

I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends [3x]

OOOHHH, what a fucking shame
OOOHHH, that you had to mess things up this time

Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
(Love to play the victim)
You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
(Was it all for nothing)

It's gone, it's gone
There's nothing left
Keep it on wax
[2x]
