[Verse 1]
I went out walking the other day
Seen a little girl crying along the way
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again
Someday your crying, girl will end
And you'll find once again

[Chorus]
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one

[Verse 2]
Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes
But I was living in a world of childish dreams
Someday these childish dreams must end
To become a man and grow up to dream again
Now I believe in the end

[Chorus]
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it might seem like it was planned
For you to roam empty hearted through this land
Though the world turns you hard and cold
There's one thing mister, that I know
That's if you think your heart is stone
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one

[Chorus]
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
Ooh
