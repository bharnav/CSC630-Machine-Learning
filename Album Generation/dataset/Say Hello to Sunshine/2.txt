Hate sin not the sinner
A mold of ugliness thrown into the fire
Brother bleed brother
What have you done, my son, with your desire?

[Chorus]
I'll hold my breath
Until the end
A prayer for us to make it through
I'll hold my breath

Miles of conviction to carry the weight of your own mistakes
Open your eyes
In the end everything
Everything dies

And I'd die for you, and I'd die
And I'd die for you, and I'd die

Sifting seasons through the sand
(Time moves so slowly)
Spitting treason in your hand
(I won't hear it)
Sifting seasons through the sand
(Time moves so slowly)
Spitting treason in your hand
(I won't hear it)

[Chorus]

I'll hold my breath
I'll hold my breath
