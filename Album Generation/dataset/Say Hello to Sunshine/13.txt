All along the water's edge
The ripples curl and bend as the moon bleeds
“Satire's no match for a matter of fact” (That's blasphemy)
There's got to be another way

I wrote it down in blood
“Never forget my love”
Faith as endearing
As the other side

Before nightfall cast a broken shadow much too tall
“Look, it's just me”
Graveyard pulls apart the earth revealing all the broken hearts
I'm not the only one who bleeds

I wrote it down in blood
“Never forget my love”
Faith as endearing
As the other side, I'm on this
Freight train
With creeping suspicion
Hell to pay

Glassy eyeballs feeling red
Painful voices in your head
And he walked to the stone to engrave his claim of a thousand souls
Filled with shame reaching to the highest notch at the top
With the blood of his wisdom he began to call on the names
Of the vain and the week willed alike
“I will have you”
Anoint you wrap you in lies, to devour you
All in the blink of an eye
In the presence of his majesty
The rise and fall of the hands that begat the writing on the wall
Dripping with blood, “Never forget my love”

It's criminal
More than you know
The loss in your eyes
It's critical
It's critical now
The look in my eye
I have damned myself to hear this out
One more time around
I have damned myself to hear this out
One more time

I wrote it down in blood
“Never forget my love”
Faith as endearing
As the other side, I'm on this
Freight train
With derailed suspicion
Writing it all down in blood
