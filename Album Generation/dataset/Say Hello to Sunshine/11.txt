“Meier may we be this way forever
And tell me, lover, what will become of the others?”
Bones, skin, nails and flesh
On a bed of “lack of passion”, a medieval consequence
They worry you with all the talk of how you're not their kind

[Chorus]
Now I'm stealing her body and taking it home
There is always one more fall

Maladjusted you must trust me, darling
Subsequently, you see, you deserve more than me
They bury you while wearing garments of funeral fire

[Chorus] x2

This will hurt you
It's killing me
(This is the salt in my side, this is the thorn in my eye) x3

This will hurt you
And I will, too
And I will

Bloodlust, bloodlust - for this girl
Bloodloss, bloodloss - for this boy
Bloodlust, bloodlust - for this girl
Bloodloss, bloodloss - for this boy
This boy
Another puncture wound, and once again, forgive my sins

[Chorus] x2
