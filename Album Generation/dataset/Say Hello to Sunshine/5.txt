Communications down
I float without a light to lead me back
I'm lost again
They say silence is golden
Loneliness never shined like this
Diseased, the leper sits, the leper is me

[Chorus]
Fireflies illuminate your eyes
The moon will lead me back to earth again

Caught between the stars, a well lit drowning
Darkness mocks me with a broken compass
So I swim in a sea of distress, broken down and helpless
The leper sits diseased, the leper is me

[Chorus]

Floating all alone
Floating all alone

[Chorus] x2
