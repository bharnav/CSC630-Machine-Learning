Slumber has erased me
Comfort is only skin deep
A dirty mirror reveals reason
To digest corrective medicine

[Chorus]
I burned up, I burned up
Ablaze upon re-entry
Slow down
I woke up, I woke up
Face down along the shoreline
Paradise is mine

Shadows and living trees
Reach out to embrace me
This place, here, is where we don't exist
He carries dead weight with his fist

[Chorus]

You can't take it with you
You can't take it with you
Frame by frame we begin to change, skeletons and robot brains
She found a book that writes itself, that plays it all upon a stage
Over and over again
Over and over again
Where is the end?
