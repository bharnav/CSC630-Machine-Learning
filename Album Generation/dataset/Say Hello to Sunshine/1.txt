Feel like a riddle today?
Glamorous - and I must say
That you are barely ok
Meanwhile I fight for reason
Clamor in hand to defend
This: my only body stands

[Chorus]
Take a look around
Everything - in turn - will come down
Don't depend on this - broken promises
They won't hear a sound

Last chance to find the way out
Rearrange life till sundown
Fears of a stick in the mud
I solved the riddle today
Glamorous and I must say
That none of us are ok

[Chorus]

Plant the seed
To grow the tree
But save room for the family
Evolution turns
Another ugly hand
Suddenly man cannot stand
Matchstick starts a fire
Pinpoint the blame
Through the trees I scream your name
Matchstick! Matchstick!
Matchstick! Matchstick starts!
Matchstick! Matchstick!
Matchstick! Matchstick starts a fire!

[Chorus]

They won't hear a sound
They won't hear a sound
