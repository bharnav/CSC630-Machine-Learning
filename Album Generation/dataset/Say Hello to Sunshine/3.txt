Treacherous hold on me
With daggers for teeth
A pound of flesh for regret tied to a marionette limp around my neck
Who knows which way to go?

Charcoal burnt sunrise
Sent by the river
To tell me lies

Cold shades of sanity
Are bleeding over
I broke apart the disguise, the demon lives in the eyes and underneath your breath
A softly spoken death

[Chorus]
Hate that it tastes this way
Medicine gets so stale
A cut from a piece of mind
Then will you listen?
I'm only me

“This man is using his mind as a weapon…
…And woe betide the creature
Who steps into his garden”
Let's see if I can't get it on me
Let's see if I can't get him all over my hands

“He's had another attack”, there's nothing bringing me back, sailor says full mast
Following the sun

[Chorus]

A cut from a piece of mind
Then will you listen?
A cut from a piece of mind
Then will you listen?
Where are you?
Where are you?
(Where are you?)
