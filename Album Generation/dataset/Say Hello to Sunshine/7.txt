Behind a mask, a man can bask only for so long
Before being exposed to the sun
The moon is up, a whisper of "Till death do you wrong"
Patients bother a patient doctor

Plastics itch and bandages, the aftermath won't add up to this
The fever breaks, it would take a masochist
To live like this

[Chorus]
Buried my wife today
Restitution for my sanity

Chasing demons dressed like me, their eyes are not like mine
Ignorance is divine
Instincts are reduced to teeth that bite the hand that feeds
Fear thy father, love thy martyr

The verdict of the jury hung on the weight of what has become
A starry night, a vengeful wish, “It doesn't have to be like this”

[Chorus] x2

Sound the alarm and make no mistake about this
All the king's horses and all the king's men have been sent to put this boy back together again
But somehow he must have been predicting the fall

Caged rats, experiments, a brain with no oxygen
Release all the hostages, you've got to wash your hands of this
Caged rats, experiments, a brain with no oxygen
Release all the hostages, you've got to wash your hands of this
This
This

The verdict of the jury hung on the weight of what has become
A starry night, a vengeful wish, “It doesn't have to be like this”
“Murderer!”, “murderer!”, “murderer!”, “murderer!”
