I feel the pain
(Carotid arteries exposed to cold skin)
Feeding me
(Diastolic curdled oxygen)
I look suspicious when I look in the mirror
Swallow placebo and the mountain gets steeper
Stomach won't digest demons
One wound for every reason why

[Chorus]
Pills are contagious
Prayers for ageless sight
Monsters religion
Bleed me through to midnight

Peeking red
(Another episode of playing pretend)
Medicine
(Cut the feed for one moment)
Released endorphins and then it's over
Hands of the shadows grope dirty diseases
Somebody tell me why I should believe this
One more unknown condition
One wound for every reason why

[Chorus]

Pills are contagious
Prayers for ageless sight
Monsters religion
One more, one more

Try as I may
Inside this creature's still alive
Try as I may
Inside this creature's still alive

Focus on the fire burning virus in me
Hopeless host hooked to a wire keeping me
Focused on the fire burning virus that is meâ€¦
A hopeless host
A hopeless host
A hopeless host
A hopeless host
A hopeless host

Sickness
Sickness is crumbling me
Born into disease, stomach won't digest demons
Mother, please, I beg. Just finish the stitch
Sew me up to live
