Woke up this morning without a face
I've fooled myself again
I've sold myself again
Another wasted day counting shades of gray, another fool's attempt to fall from grace

A casual line. A sip of wine
To sympathize while you're laughing
But on the inside I've lost the insight that just might be the truth…

[Chorus]
Old man loneliness is a son of a bitch, both hands bound, can't scratch the itch
Cut off all loose ties, and bleed for days, who could stand veins
With friends like these?

Pick my teeth out of the mud
And sink the sun, what have you done?
Cut the bandages, remove the oxygen
Hey, man, what's with that stupid grin?

I cut and bleed myself along
A man alone can do no wrong
Another wasted day counting shades of gray, another fool's attempt to fall from grace

[Chorus] x2

Taste of sunshine

No sympathy for the Devil
God gave him wings, God gave him wings (x2)

“These hands
They've made for you
Your wings
That stick to you”

It's dirt beneath your fingertips
It hurts too much to wait for it (x3)

[Chorus] x2

Taste of sunshine
