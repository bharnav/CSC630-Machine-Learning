Below the earth lies a serpent
Fire and brimstone
Remove the backbone
Say hello to sunshine
Wake up, you're baptized

[Chorus]
The temple is me
Something to believe in
Is something to be
The evidence is all we taste

Under the skin the heart is pumping
What brought you to this?
Meat once was useless
Focus on the fiction
Lose sight of the vision

[Chorus]

Man makes changes
Man wants everything!
Man makes changes
Man wants everything!
Everything!
Everything!
Everything!
