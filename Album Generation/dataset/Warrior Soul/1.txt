If you wanna see me
I'm easy to be found
Just look for the darkest cloud
And the lightning crashing down

Try to come by midnight
That's when the madness starts
Help me chase the ghosts away
From my haunted heart

Chorus:
Free my haunted heart
Take this haunted unwanted heart

Ever since you left me
Your spirit has remained
Your voice echoes off the wall
Trees whisper your name

The wind hits my skin
And it feels like your touch
Oh, come back and rescue me
From this painful love

Chorus:
Free my haunted heart
Take this lonely unwanted heart
Free my haunted heart
Take this lonely unwanted heart
