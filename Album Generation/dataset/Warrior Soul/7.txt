Rise and take a stand
Standing hand in hand
Above the ashes
Fight
Until the end
And we shall stand
Above the ashes

I feel it in my heart
Feel it in my soul
Feel it running through me
We all share ancient blood
You're the ones I trust
You're the ones I love

There are those who desire
To have us walk through fire

Rise and take a stand
Standing hand in hand
Above the ashes
Fight
Until the end
And we shall stand
Above the ashes
Above the ashes

We all can fall from grace
But face to face
We're proudly standing
'Cause now it's all for one
And one for all
So strong together

Life is full of evil games
And we all know how it feels getting burned

Rise and take a stand
Standing hand in hand
Above the ashes
Fight
Until the end
And we shall stand
Above the ashes

Rise and take a stand
Standing hand in hand
Above the ashes
Fight
Until the end
And we shall stand
Above the ashes

Rise and take a stand
Standing hand in hand
Above the ashes
Fight
Until the end
And we shall stand
Above the ashes
Above the ashes
