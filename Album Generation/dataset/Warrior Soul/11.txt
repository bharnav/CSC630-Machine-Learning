Was later that night when I got the news
I couldn't believe what was true

Heard somebody say that you drove that night
An ice cold road, your last ride

With tears in our eyes
We were standing, no one spoke
Now we gotta move on without you

But you'll live in our hearts
And your soul will live on too
And forever it's you shining on
And where you're going
And whatever you might do
Yeah forever it's you
Shining on, shining through
Shining through, shine on
We miss you

It was hard, so hard, so hard to let go
We're standing here, no one knows
The reason why that had to be your last ride
This ice cold road took your life

You live in our hearts
And your soul will live on too
And forever it's you shining on
And where you're going
And whatever you might do
Yeah forever it's you
Shining on, shining through
Forever it's you
Shining on, shining through
Shine on, shine on, shine on
We miss you, shine on through
