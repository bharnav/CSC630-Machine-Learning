I look at you, Heaven I see
All that you do, Angel to me

You hold me when I'm sad
And you love me when I'm bad
It feels like I'm falling

Heaven I see and it's Heaven I feel
And the devil in me
Gets down on his knees
Heaven I see

I thought I would die before I met you
You brought back to life all that is true

You hold me when I'm sad
And forgive me when I'm bad
It feels like I'm falling

Heaven I see and it's Heaven I feel
And the devil in me
Gets down on his knees

I've walked through the fire
Been raked through the coals
You lifted me higher
Both body and soul, yeah

Heaven I see and it's Heaven I feel
And the devil in me
Gets down on his knees
Heaven I see, yeah
Heaven I see

And the devil in me
Gets down on his knees
Heaven I see

Heaven I see and it's heaven I feel
And the devil in me
Is finally set free
Heaven I see, yeah
Heaven I see and it's heaven I feel
And the devil in me
Is finally set free
Heaven I see, yeah
