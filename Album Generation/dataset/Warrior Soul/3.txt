Long time
I searched for gold in the heart of mine
And I feel lone alone at night
Run for my life

Yeah I was broken down
I feel so lost no one around
Can you please help to find away
Before I loose my mind

Can you seek love?
Can you feel love?
Can you seek love in my heart?

Chorus:
Heaven's coming from above
Can you feel the thunder
Heaven's turning grey and dark
Can you see the thunder
Will it mean a broken heart
That's the spell I'm under so long
Heaven's like a fire from hell
With heavy metal thunder

It's a cold night
I see the clouds
I see the sky
I'm not the only one
Who cries, struggles and fightsâ€¦

And when I close my eyes
I see the truth behind these lies
I see the difference in our lives
Comes from inside

Can you feel love?
Can you seek love?
Can you feel love in my heart?

Chorus
