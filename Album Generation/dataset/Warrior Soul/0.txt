Everyone hurts, everyone bleeds
With all this pain right underneath
All we need is holding on
We got the key
To carry on
'Cause you are

Chorus:
You're my family
You're my destiny
The only ones
The only ones I want
You mean more to me
More than life can be
The only ones
The only ones I love
We're united in our hearts

The world is turning cold and dark
Our lives so wounded
Full of scars
And when I'm out here on my own
I don't have to face it all alone
'Cause I know

Chorus:
You're my family
You're my destiny
The only ones
The only ones I want
You mean more to me
More than life can be
The only ones
The only ones I love
We're united in our hearts
