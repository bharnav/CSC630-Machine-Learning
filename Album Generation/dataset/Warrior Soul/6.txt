Laying low on money
And I'm on the run
Don't know anybody
I can lean on

No help in sight no
And no one gets the phone
I call for help
And no one knows what's going on

Chorus:
And I keep on running
Cause eye to eye
I feel your influence
And I fear I'm gonna die
And I've seen it coming lie by lie
I feel you creep into my brain
And I'm hypnotised
Feel like I'm hypnotised

When I met my lover
I must have been blind
I went straight to the gutter
And I don't mind

Yeah it took a long time
To open up my eyes
But in the long run
All I heard were only lies

Chorus:
Eye to eye
Lie by lie
Feel like hypnotised
