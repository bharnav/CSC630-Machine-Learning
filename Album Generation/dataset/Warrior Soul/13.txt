I met you on a rainy night
Back in 1999
I truly felt my heart was yours
And I know your love was mine
Still every night you're in my dreams
And that's a real bad sign
I wish someone could take me
Back to 1999

I need to feel this way again
I want to feel the love that we had back then
I know you're forever gone
But you live on in my mind
I wish someone could take me
Back to 1999

I remember that September day
In the year 2001
The towers fell and war would come
Beneath the desert sun
Some survived the battles
While others had to die
And all I can think of
Is 1999

I want to feel this way again
I want to feel the love that we had back then
I know you're forever gone
But you live on in my mind
I wish someone could take me
Back to 1999

I want to feel this way again
I want to feel the love
That we had back then
Those times are forever gone
But they live on in our minds
I wish someone could take us
Back to 1999
I wish someone could take us
Back to 1999
I wish someone could take us back
Back to 1999
I wish someone could take us
Back to 1999
