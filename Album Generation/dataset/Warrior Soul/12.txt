I always used to dread the dark
It reminded me if my empty heart
Lonely nights brought so much pain
At times I thought I would go insane

Had no one to talk to nothing to do
Emotions ran from black to blue
I kept my thoughts bottled up inside
Felt so bad I thought I'd die

Yeah I have prayed
To the moon and stars
But I came out
All bruised and scarred
I never thought I would find a way
To see the light at the end of a day
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark

Darkness comes now I don't care
Because I know that you'll be there
To keep me warm when the night turns cold
Things like that stir my soul

I light a candle when you're gone
Then I don't feel so all alone
I see your spirit in the candle light
It helps me make it through the night

Yeah I have prayed
To the moon and stars
But I came out
All bruised and scarred
I never thought I would find a way
To see the light at the end of a day
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark

You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark

Yeah I have prayed
To the moon and stars
But I came out
All bruised and scarred
I never thought I would find a way
To see the light at the end of a day
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark
