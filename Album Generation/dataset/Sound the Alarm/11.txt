[Verse 1]
They're at the house
They're breaking down the doors
They came to kill us all
There's no way out

[Chorus]
All night I dream that they're really out to get me
The lines on my face, getting deeper every day

[Verse 2]
They'll drag me out
And hang me from the trees
Upside down and leave me
To die alone

[Chorus]
All night I dream that they're really out to get me
The lines on my face, getting deeper every day

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
All night I dream that they're really out to get me
The lines on my face, getting deeper every day

[Outro]
But I'm not at all delusional
There's no way out
