Cut off my failing limbs
Pawn off what's left within
Land of the living dead
Time to face the end

Smile for the camera; suck in that gut
Don't shame your family, you'll have bad luck
Oh, the whole world is waiting to see when you fall

The cracked coffee cup from your senior prom
Your faded red dress on the neighbor's lawn
Oh, the whole world is waiting to see when you fall
The whole world is waiting to see when you fall

I'm a danger to myself
Always blaming someone else
Got a grenade in my mouth
And my finger on the pin, ready to rip it out

Yeah, that's right

Cut off my failing limbs
Pawn off what's left within
Land of the living dead
Time to face the end
