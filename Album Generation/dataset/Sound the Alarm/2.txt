[Verse 1]
Crawling, all alone, along the floor
Woke up this morning
With a trail of teeth under the door
I took a wrench to my chest
Cracked all my ribs
Let the blood run all over my hands

[Chorus]
I can't stand my own face anymore
The mirror is on the floor
Shattered, a million eyes, all crying, please
Please, don't forget about me

[Verse 2]
You say I'm gonna break up
And drive my car into a wall
No, they're gonna wake up
And wonder why they didn't care
After I pull out my tongue
Tie it 'round my neck
Hang myself alone in the dark

[Chorus]
I can't stand my own face anymore
The mirror is on the floor
Shattered, a million eyes, all crying, please
Please, don't forget about me

[Bridge]
Please, don't forget about me
(Wrench to my chest, cracked all my ribs, let the blood run over my hands)
Please, don't forget about me
(Pull out my tongue, tie it 'round my neck, hang myself alone in the dark)
Please, don't forget about me

[Chorus]
I can't stand my own face anymore
The mirror is on the floor
Shattered, a million eyes, all crying, please
Please, don't forget about me
(Forget about me)
Please, don't forget about me
(Forget about me)
Please, don't forget about me
