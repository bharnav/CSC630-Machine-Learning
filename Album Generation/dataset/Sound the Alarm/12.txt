I don't know what to say
The whole world's burning today
Staring into the grave
Hey...

Smoke into the sky
See the flames arise
Hell is here, at last

Watching buildings collapse
Bridges buckle and snap
City swallowed by waves
Hey...

Say another prayer
Hoping things will change
Here under the stars

But I, I don't know why
Everyone you know will someday die

We all have to say goodbye
Let go of the love we share
Take one last look into my eyes

Climb into the hearse
To watch the ocean burn
Nothing left but dust
