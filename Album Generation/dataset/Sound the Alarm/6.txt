[Verse 1]
Hammer nails into my eyes
Now I'll never notice
When you're staring at the ground
Wishing that you didn't know
What I'm really thinking
You won't even look at me now

[Chorus]
Say you'll never leave, please
This war inside my mind is killing me

[Verse 2]
See myself in shredded skin
Sew my lips together
So I won't have to say a word
What I never meant to say
I wish I could erase it
Make it right again some day

[Chorus]
Say you'll never leave, please
This war inside my mind is killing me

[Bridge]
I'll cut out my throat and I'll eat it raw
And drown in the blood as it fills my lungs

[Chorus]
Say you'll never leave, please
This war inside my mind is killing me

[Outro]
It's killing me
It's killing me
