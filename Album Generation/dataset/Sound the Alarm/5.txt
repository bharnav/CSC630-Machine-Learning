How long?
How long will I have to go on?
When I'm with you
Take a gun to my head, swallow it

I hope you're on the way
To an early grave
Nothing left to change

And I don't know how long I can keep talking
Till I come over and tear off your ears
You'd never hear

'Cause I was gonna say
Never meant a thing
No one left to blame

The stars are out tonight
Will they fall out of the sky?

And come crashing down
On your house

'Cause I was gonna say
Never meant a thing
No one left to blame

I hope you're on the way
To an early grave
Nothing left to change
