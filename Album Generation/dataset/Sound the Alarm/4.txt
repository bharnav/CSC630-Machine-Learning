[Verse 1]
I'm living in a dark and dying day
And everything is lost along the way
The feeling in my heart is not the same
So what's to say?

[Verse 2]
The pictures of the past are on the wall
They'll hang there in the dark until they fall
Forever are they lost in long ago?
Whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And it seems so long to let live a life that I don't live no more
And in the setting sun, my life leaves a shadow that'll soon be gone

[Verse 3]
I'm standing in the grave
I wait to bleed
Been tearing out my tongue in misery
Been choking on the weight of my mistakes
Though, I can't change

[Chorus]
And it seems so long to let live a life that I don't live no more
And in the setting sun, my life leaves a shadow that'll soon be gone

[Bridge]
And all I want is one more second chance
I live my life under a trance
Been blinded by the pain of my regrets
Wasted life reliving yesterday

[Outro]
I'm living in a dark and dying day
And everything is lost along the way
The feeling in my heart is not the same
So what's to say?
The feeling in my heart is not the same
So what's to say?
The feeling in my heart is not the same
So what's to say?
