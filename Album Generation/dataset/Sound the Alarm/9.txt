I don't know where to go
Ain't no light along the road
Stumbling under the stars above

Somehow feel someone's stare
Turn to find nobody there
Never knowing if I'm all alone
'Cause paranoia is the only friend that I know

And everybody else is gone
Their eyes are burning into my heart
The falling feeling
Fear I can't go on
And nobody will sound the alarm

They're all out late at night
Sitting by the fireside
Planning how to bury me alive
And when I'm gone they all will laugh about how I died

'Cause everybody else is gone
Their eyes are burning into my heart
The falling feeling
Fear I can't go on
And nobody will sound the alarm

In the darkness of my mind
I hear a voice that seems to sigh
I'm going to die before I save myself

And everybody else is gone
Their eyes are burning into my heart
The falling feeling
Fear I can't go on
And nobody will sound the alarm

The falling feeling
Fear I can't go on
And nobody will sound the alarm
