There must be something wrong with me
I get so tired, I can't sleep
The voices in my head are haunting my dreams
No matter how I try
To kill the thoughts inside
I cannot, I cannot hide

The mirror staring back at me
The cracking lines along my face
The times I tried to get things straight, but could not
I know how hard I try
To keep myself alive
But I don't know, I don't know why

Funny how
When the darkest of nights falls down
Worry that I will never see
The sun is shining again

The world goes round
What was up is again back down
Wonder if I could stick around
Feel the light of the day

Sometimes I feel like I am dying down here
I feel a raging storm inside of my skin
The dial tone is there but no one's holding

I feel the weight of time
Wonder when I will die
But I don't know, I don't know why
