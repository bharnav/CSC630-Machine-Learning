They're all going out
To meet inside an empty warehouse
To hatch a plan to run me out of town
They'll come when I sleep

And they'll circle the house
Put cyanide into the water pipes
Wait 'til I walk out, fall onto my knees
To surround me

Then they'll drive me out
To the wasteland
To leave me for the wolves
To eat my face

We'll sit and stare as the maggots eat out my eyelids and my ears
We'll sit and stare as the maggots eat out my eyelids and my ears

They'll all laugh about it tomorrow
When my body's rotten and hollow
And the lights are finished on time
Nothing left except for my bones
