[Verse 1]
I see your eyes, in my mind
But the moment fades, slips away
And when I wake, I curse the day
Wanna torch the sky
See it falling in flames

I'd burn up to see you again

[Chorus]
I'll carve out my lungs and it's all just to see you again
I'm sick in my gut from the poison I drank to forget

[Verse 2]
And since you've gone, I can't forget
What I didn't say
That it's much to late
I feel you here, in my heart
But sometimes, I fall
I'm gonna crawl in the dark

[Chorus]
I'll carve out my lungs and it's all just to see you again
I'm sick in my gut from the poison I drank to forget

[Bridge]
I'm trapped in my withering skin
Oh, no, no
To pride and remember the dead
I'll dig my grave and wait here for you to realize

[Chorus]
I'll carve out my lungs and it's all just to see you again
I'm sick in my gut from the poison I drank to forget

[Outro]
You leave me empty inside
I'm trying to hold on
