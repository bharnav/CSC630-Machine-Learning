[Verse 1]
Walking down the hall but all the doors are locked inside
Searching for somebody just to stay with for the night

[Chorus]
Please, help me, please
I let my heart go
I'm dead, I'm diseased
I dream a life of sorrow

[Verse 2]
Sifting through the pictures of the ghost inside my mind
Somehow can't forget the times I fail to get things right

[Chorus]
Please, help me, please
I let my heart go
I'm dead, I'm diseased
I dream a life of sorrow

[Bridge]
Head hangs low
Stare at the telephone
Forget the friends you'll never know
The night is long
Shadows grow on my wall
I'm calling out, but no one's home

[Chorus]
Please, help me, please
I let my heart go
I'm dead, I'm diseased
I dream a life of sorrow

[Outro]
No strength left to scream
Ohh...
