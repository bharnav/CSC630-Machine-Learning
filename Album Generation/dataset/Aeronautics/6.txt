No one knows the way
It's all a secret
Hunt for knowledge
On your journey home
Gotta fight for freedom, independent power
Living for now, trying somehow
Praying for the day

She's a blazer
I'm a soul chaser
We'll keep on searching for more
Cruising this firestone
Burn till it's over
Leading our ship to the core

Go, aim for the centre, explode
Till you fall out of time

Nothing's new, we wonder about our fathers
Try to learn from what they made of life
Like a gladiator, you're a broken hero
Building your shield for the battlefield
There's no easy way

Cruising this firestone
Burn till it's over
Leading our ship to the core

Go, aim for the centre, explode
Gotta Fight For Our Lives
Into The Arena We Go
Till you fall out of time

She's a blazer
I'm a soul chaser
We'll keep on searching for more
Cruising this firestone... burning
Leading our ship to the core... yeah
