[Verse 1]
Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

She says
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"

[Break]
("I'll never make that mistake again...")
("I'll never make that mistake again...")

[Verse 2]
Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money

"But she doesn't even like me
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"
