[Verse 1]
Learn to love me, assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
My only weakness is- well, never mind, never mind, oh

[Chorus 1]
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

[Verse 2]
Learn to love me and assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans for a future war was all I saw on Channel Four

[Chorus 1]
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

[Verse 3]
A heartless hand on my shoulder - a push and it's over
Alabaster crashes down (six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began

[Chorus 2]
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over
