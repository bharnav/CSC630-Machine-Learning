[Chorus]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 1]
Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream and rip
Your brand new jacket at the seams
You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah, I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

[Chorus]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 2]
Top ten idol, king of your age
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?
Don't you remember you once knew a girl
You loved her more than the world
Is life always like this, brother?
Good for one side but bad for another
I must put you behind me tonight
Cause you belong to the lights

[Chorus]
Those golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, my darling
Why, why did you change?
Oh, whoa, oh
