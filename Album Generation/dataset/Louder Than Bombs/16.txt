[Verse 1]
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many bad memories
Too many memories there

[Verse 2]
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there or have you moved away ?
Or have you moved away?

[Verse 3]
I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will
