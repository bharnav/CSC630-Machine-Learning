[Verse 1]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 2]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Message received loud and clear, loud and clear
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 3]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Oh, message received loud and clear, loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 4]
I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
But I know that you would like me if only you could see me, if only you could meet me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
