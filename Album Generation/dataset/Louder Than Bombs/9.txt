[Verse 1]
If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus 1]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now

[Verse 2]
If you're wondering why
When all I wanted from life was to be famous
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
But you wouldn't believe me

[Chorus 1]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby
And I'm telling you now

[Verse 3]
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
Today I am remembering the time
When they pulled me back and held me down
And looked me in the eyes and said

[Chorus 2]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, my son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must stay on your own for slightly longer
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now

[Outro]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)
You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)
