[Verse 1]
Though you hardly know her
The light's on its way
The hand that rests upon it
Still wanna stay

[Verse 2]
No way of recognizing
The cat knows the call
Fair child is rising
There's no mystery at all

[Chorus]
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
You'll be waiting
You'll be waiting

[Outro]
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
