There's no such thing as freedom
Without some responsibility
All this shock and surprise
But we've been throwing out a mean boomerang
And now it's coming back at us

Wouldn't you like to see a change?
Are you willing to pay?
Stopping the screams and guns and pain
I'd like to throw them away
We put the innocent to test
By all the thoughts we invest
Children learn from what excites us
That's such a sad legacy

Do you really think no connection?
With the polarity we emit?
And worship walks in the wrong direction
We keep feeding it
And I am thinking something
But I'm really doing nothing

Wouldn't you like to see a change?
Are we willing to pay?
Stopping the screams and guns and pain
I'd like to throw them away
We put the innocent to test
By all the thoughts we invest
The children learn from what excites us
That's such a sad legacy

Wouldn't you like to see a change?
Are we willing to pay?
Stopping the screams and guns and pain
I'd like to throw them away
We put the innocent to test
By all the thoughts we invest
Wouldn't you like to see a change?
Bustin' the sad legacy....
