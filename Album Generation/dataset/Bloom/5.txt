All these things we chase outside
Pull us down
Endless desire to give us joy
Can't be found
Catching up to get my breath in this fight
Something is about to stir and it feels right
From my heart

Working in a new mirage to grab onto
Climbing up another's fence, no better view
Where's my heart?

I can't say much
"much" is just words; they're not real
Lead to the truth
Substance inside
I won't hide
From my heart

So much has been said
Turn off your mind, learn to feel
Close to your breath, all that you need
All that's real

I just can't hide, hide from the truth
You describe
So break me down into my soul
I return... to my heart
