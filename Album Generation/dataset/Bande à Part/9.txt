White on white translucent black capes
Back on the rack
Bela Lugosi's dead
The bats have left the bell tower
The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines
The black box

Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead

The virginal brides
File past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room
The count

Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Oh Bela...
Undead undead undead...
