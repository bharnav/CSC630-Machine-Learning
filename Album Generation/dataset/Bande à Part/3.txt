Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor
Love just like addiction now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love gonna see me through
Can't stop now
Don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go - don't go!
Baby
Make your mind up
Give me what you got
Fix me with your lovin' shut the door and turn the lock
Hey
Go get the doctor
Doctor came too late
Another night I feel alright my love for you can't wait
Can't stop now
Don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go - don't go!
Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor
Said he was a killer
Now I know it's true
I'm dead when you walk out the door
Hey babe
I'm hooked
Can't stop now
Don't you know
...
Can't stop now
Don't you know
. . 
Can't stop now. don't you know
