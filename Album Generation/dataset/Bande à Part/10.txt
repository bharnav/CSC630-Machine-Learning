So many feelings
Been up in here
Left alone I'm with
The one I most fear

I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Just want to break out
Kick off this skin

I can't escape myself

All my problems
Lume larger than life
I can't swallow
Another slice

Seems like my shadow
Marks every strike
Cannot learn to live with
What's stuck inside

I can't escape myself
I can't escape myself

So many feelings
End up in here
Left alone I'm with
The one I most fear

I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Cannot learn to live with
Kick off this skin

I can't escape myself
I can't escape myself...
