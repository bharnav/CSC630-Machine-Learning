Waves
And then goodbye
I live in a wafer thin dream
I, I can't cry
You know the time
Time's not kind

But I remember the way we were
The slow, slow sad love
I wonder do you miss my love
I know you can't
It's just a wave passing over me

What are these waves
They're coming over me
It must be my destiny

Waves
They're coming by
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Waves
They're coming by
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
