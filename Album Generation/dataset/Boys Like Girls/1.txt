[Verse 1]
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives are stuck in the undertow
But you know the places I wanna go
Cause oh oh oh
I've got a sickness, you've got the cure
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you wanna
Just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Sing it oh oh
Got all we need so here we go

[Chorus]
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive

[Verse 2]
We could
Pack up and leave all our things behind
No fact or fiction or storyline
Cause I need you more than just for tonight
You're oh oh all I care
I can't stop my breathing in
I'm weak and you were my medicine
I won't stop till I am under your skin

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you wanna
Just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Sing it oh oh
Got all we need so here we go

[Chorus]
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive

And when the clock strikes twelve
Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell?
Cause you know I never will
I think we should strike a match
We'll hold it to the wind to and see how long it lasts
We can make the time stand still

[Chorus]
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
