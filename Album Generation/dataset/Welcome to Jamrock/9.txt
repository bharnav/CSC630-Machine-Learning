[Chorus: Stephen Marley & Rovleta Fraser]
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
She look so good in her clothes, she get dressed and roll
So much man a flay down, call the pest control
Confident princess, she address them bold, she nah manifest
Fi dem sexual goal, she wish them the best, Rasta bless them soul
Her mouth nah filthy, like nuh cess tank pool
Smarter than most intellectual fools, weh spend dem time pon internet chat rooms

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
She said Jr. you're a genius, you think with your mind and not your peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos, drinking blue mountain cappuccinos
Well I seh baby you the cleanest, the true definition of what my queen is
Nothing coulda ever really come between us, share the same room and Jah will feed us

[Chorus: Stephen Marley & Rovleta Fraser]
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Why mi love fi all she's worth, sitn' fi gwan she wi start it first
Wheel and pop off, supn' outta she purse, whole heap a fool have to start disperse
Police ah come you see how fast she splurt, can't find no sign of she khaki skirt
Light up the place like we spark there herbs, Love watch the way that she gwan
When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set, selector rewind every chance dem get
The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat, all when morning a shine she nuh start dance yet
Man clear the line when she walk and sweat, but she nah pay no mind to remarks dem mek
Always on time tek a chance and bet, she's a fine piece of mind with the right mindset

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
She said Jr. you're a genius, you think with your mind and not your peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos, drinking blue mountain cappuccinos
Well I seh baby you the cleanest, the true definition of what my queen is
Nothing coulda ever really come between us, share the same room and Jah will feed us

[Chorus: Stephen Marley & Rovleta Fraser]
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
So Boom!
Animal you never know from you born, places you only see when travel channel tun on
Our means of trans-p is when the camel run on
Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion
"Fliminitti" weh she have and that is the attraction, what she want is what she get and that is satisfaction
Well she want it all night and not jus fi a fraction, Well too much long talking now a time fi action, well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time
And if mi gone fi ten minutes, then she call me ten time
If mi nuh pick up then she panic then she panic then she call mi friend line
Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine, a substantial amount of african fly squat
I have to sip a roots and bun a one night cap, and she love the veteran him always hit the right spot
And the way she feel so good I have to bounce right back

[Chorus: Stephen Marley & Rovleta Fraser]
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside
