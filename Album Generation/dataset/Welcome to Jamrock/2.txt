[Intro]
Out in the street, they call it Merther

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Jamrock
Camp where the thugs dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna ya hand bag, ya knapsack
It inna ya backpack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals ah nuh back to
Di thugs dem will do whe dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff ting come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laff an block off traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down an it ah beat rapid
Police coming inna jeep and dem cyaan stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, ah playboy rabbit
*Funny man ah* get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it merther

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jam down
Poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, cyaan done
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the kings of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unuh hand if you with me
To see this sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me,
To win election dem trick we
Then dem don't do no ting at all
C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most ah de youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff likkle youth have up some fat 'matic
With di extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Glocks, ah dem a lock rocket
They will full you up ah current like ah short circuit
Dem a run ah road back which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin' nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock
(Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock
(East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock
(Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey, yah)
Hey, welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it merther

[Outro]
Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, now
Jamaica, Jamaica, yo, Jamaica, Jamaica
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
