Should I try to Taken you in?
Another fool brought to the fold
With not a gaze or arms
But deathlike grip to hold
To hold
To hold
To hold

Should I try to Taken you in?
And hope for the perfct docile pet
Hope that you'll not defille or wreck my home
Sweet home
Sweet home
Sweet home

Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere
Here is where you can choose the place
With pleasure and plain in equal share
A refuge for truth ant deceit
Where all who come are taken in

Should I try to Taken you in?
Pretending what you have not felt
In passion sorrow sleep or death eyes closed
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
Eyes closed

Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere

Here is where you can choose the place
With pleasure and plain in equal share
A refuge for truth ant deceit
Where all who come are taken in

Should I try to take you in
Who'll pity me if I forget
It's said to be and not to be in love
Its to regret
Regret
Regret
Regret

Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere
Here is where you can choose the place
With pleasure and plain in equal share
A refuge for truth ant deceit
Where all who come are taken in

Should I try to take you in
Who'll pity me in my regret?
For those who've never been in love
Need not forget
Forget
Forget
Forget
