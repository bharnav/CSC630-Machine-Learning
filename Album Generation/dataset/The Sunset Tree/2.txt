[Verse 1]
I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

[Verse 2]
My broken house behind me
And good things ahead
A girl named Cathy
Wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood
Crashing and kicking
Aha! Listen to the engine whine

[Chorus]
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me

[Verse 3]
I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of Scotch rich on my tongue

[Verse 4]
And then Cathy showed up
And we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle
All bitter and clean
Locking eyes
Holding hands
Twin high maintenance machines

[Chorus]
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me

[Verse 5]
I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come

[Verse 6]
I down shifted
As I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out
Stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly
As you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing
In Jerusalem next year

[Chorus]
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me
