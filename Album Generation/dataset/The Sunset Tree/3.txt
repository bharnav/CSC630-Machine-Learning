[Verse 1]
The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
Let's pretend the fog has lifted

[Verse 2]
Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't

[Verse 3]
If we get our full three-score and ten
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street
And stay sweet

[Verse 4]
All the chickens comein' home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them trying to fly
'Cause you just can't do
Things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets
I know you

[Verse 5]
If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake
For Christ's sake!
