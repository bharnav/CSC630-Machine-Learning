[Intro]
Sometimes a girl
Will come and go
You reach for love
But life won't let ya know
That in the end
Youll still be lovin her
But then shes gone
Youre all alone

[Bridge]
Sign of pain
Is on my face, well
My hearbeat stops
But I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love I had withing
My love was strong
Something went wrong, no! no!

[Verse 1]
It takes a fool to learn
Yes sir
That love don't love nobody
Love love love love love love
It takes a fool to learn
Yes it does, girl
That love don't love no one
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
Stop to think about it, well
That love don't love nobody
Oh! Oh no!
It takes a fool to learn
When youre down and out, shout about it
That love don't love no more
Tell the world, oooh babe
No more
Ohhhhhh, babe
It takes a fool to learn
Going to be more careful about myself
That love don't love nobody
It takes a fool to learn
Woah baby, took me a long time to learn, to learn, well

[Outro]
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
I was a fool, you were a fool
That love don't love nobody
Now we got love, we need love
It takes a fool to learn
