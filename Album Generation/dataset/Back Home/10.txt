[Verse 1]
We went down to the seaside
One cold frosty morning
Just to go out for a drive
For an hour or two

I walked down to the water
With my love and our baby
Watched the waves breaking in
We're enjoying the view

Then I heard myself saying
"We should do this more often
To watch the little ones playing
On that bright stony shore"

And I wished deep down in my heart
That we could stay here forever
In these sweet simple moments
That will come back no more

When it's 3 o'clock in the morning
And something scared you from your breast
I will gently rock you in my arms
And lay your little head on my chest

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you run, from my arms
Know we'll always find you
And when you run, out of loving
And run home to me, run home to me

[Chorus]
Run home to me
Run home to me

[Verse 2]
And the years fly by so quickly
Like a plane before my eyes
And you've grown up into a woman
Before I had time, had time to realize

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Chorus]
