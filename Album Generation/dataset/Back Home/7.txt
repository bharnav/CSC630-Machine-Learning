[Verse 1]
My life was always dragging on
You showed me how to be in love
I realize when you were gone
And I love everything about you, baby

Because you're the vision in my mind
Your spirit is so sweet and strong
You help me up when I'm broken down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love everything about you baby
Never let our love fall away

[Chorus]
Because this is heaven when your close to me
Oh, it flows like a river
Because this is heaven when your close to me
And I'll give a piece
A piece of my heart

[Verse 2]
Because you're the star in all my dreams
You keep me going on and on
No one knows what you do for me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Don't let go)
(I'm living for you baby)[x4]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Heaven, close to me)
(Heaven, close to me)
(I'll give a piece, piece of my heart)
(I'll give a piece, piece of my heart)
