[Verse 1]
One day, I believe
One day, I can see

Baby, out in the country, maybe down by the sea
Going to wake up one morning and find that I've been set free

[Chorus]
One day
One day

[Verse 2]
Some day, I can't say how
Some day, but I don't know now

Maybe tomorrow when I'm old and gray
All I ever wanted will finally come my way

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
One day, this dream will come true
One day, one day, one day baby, maybe you will too

Maybe flying high, maybe close to the ground
I will hear your voice and I'll know I've been found
Hold me tight, baby make me stay
I can hear every word you've been trying to say

[Chorus][x4]
