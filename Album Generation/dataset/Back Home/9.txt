[Verse 1]
Tossing and turning all night long
Down in my pillow felt so strong
I had to get up and write this song
Baby, where do we go from here?

I can't do anything to make you see
You've been your loving was made for me
What can I do to make you see
That with you I can't go wrong

[Chorus 1]
All I do is pray
You will come my way
No doubt about it
I've got a one track mind

[Verse 2]
You took my breath so easily
And you touched my heart so carefully
And you give your love so tenderly
And you can't do nothing wrong

[Chorus 2]
I got no time for no one else
And I got no love for no one else
Because I don't believe in no one else
With you I do belong

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Verse 3]
You take my breath so easily
You took my heart so carefully
You give your love so readily
You can't do nothing wrong

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Bridge]
A one track mind
Got a one track mind
One track mind

[Chorus 2]
