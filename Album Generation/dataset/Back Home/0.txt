[Verse 1]
Get up in the morning
Already yawning and I'm so tired
I haven't had a wink of sleep
Seems like all week, we're so tired

The baby's only feeding and one of them is teething
They're so tired
They get up before the dawn I don't know how we carry on
We're so tired

Thank God their mama is a natural
She knows exactly what to do
And as for me I think I'd go insane
I just wouldn't have a clue

You know we try to do our best
Just don't get no rest
We're so tired
Would do it all again, you can bet your life, my friend

[Chorus]
But I'm so tired
We're so tired, so tired
So tired, so tired

[Verse 2]
Just can't wait until the sun goes down
And all the kids have gone to bed
Trying to sleep you know but sleep won't come
With all the stuff going through my head

Well its play group on Thursday
Music class on Friday, I'm so tired
And now mama's getting snappy
Daddy won't change no mess

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sometime I think I'll just go on to bed
I must have better things to do
When Its time to get my good night kiss
My dreams have all come true

[Chorus][x2]
