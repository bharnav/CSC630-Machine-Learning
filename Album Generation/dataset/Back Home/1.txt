[Intro]
Say what you will
Good love is hard to find
I've had my fill of the hurting kind

[Verse 1]
Take a lot of money
To buy up all the pain
Take a lot of honey
To fill me up and put me back
On my feet again

You've seen the worst
Still you find the best of me
My love was cursed
Loosing destiny

Take a lot of living
To dry up all the tears
Take a lot of grinning
To cheer me up and put me back
On my feet again

[Chorus]
You know I needed a friend
I could tell my troubles to
And you have been my friend
So I will give my love to you
Good love from me to you

[Verse 2]
Here it comes again
I feel I'm not good enough
Can't remember when
It ever felt so tough

Take a lot hugging
Drive away the fear
Take a lot of loving
To pick me up and put me back
On my feet again

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Good love
Good love
Good love from me to you
Good love
