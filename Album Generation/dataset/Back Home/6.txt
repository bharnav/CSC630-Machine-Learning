[Verse 1]
Falling in the deep end
Stop messing around
I can't keep from falling
When your not around

I can't rest when you leave
Your love keeps me burning
You got me lost and found
And my world keeps turning

[Chorus 1]
It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
Because I need to have you around

[Verse 2]
I need to hear that sound
Of you creeping in the morning
I need to look in your eyes
When it keeps me learning

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Because I can't keep my feet on the ground
You keep me lost and found
And girl it feels good
So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2][x2]
