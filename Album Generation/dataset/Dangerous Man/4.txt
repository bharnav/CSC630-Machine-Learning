[Verse 1]
Ain't no ride like a 65 Mustang
Ain't no cool like James Dean cool
Ain't no man alive tough as old John Wayne
And ain't no woman like you
Ain't no rose like the yellow rose of Texas
Ain't no freedom like the last day of school
Ain't no whiskey like Tennessee Whiskey
And there ain't no woman like you

[Chorus]
I haven't been around the world
But I've been around the block
Don't claim to know it all
I just know what I got
Something I've never had
And I ain't going to lose
No baby
Ain't no woman like you

[Verse 2]
Thought I knew sweet
Until I tasted your kisses
Thought I'd been moved
Until I saw you move
Thought I knew love but now I know what I was missing
Because there ain't no woman like you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ain't no sound
Like a wide open Harley
Ain't no blues
Like the Memphis blues
And baby by the way did I forget to mention
That there ain't no woman like you
No, there ain't no woman like you
No other woman
Ain't no other woman like you babe
You're the only one
