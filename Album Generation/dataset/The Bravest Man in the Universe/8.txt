Where does a heart beat?
Does it dream inside?
A new day
It can come alive

The dawn will come
The sun will rise
Hope it turns
As fish, upside

Time will heal and see the change
Love can bring you past the pain

[Hook]
Love is gonna lift you up (x8)

Where there's construction
There's a future lying
A new city under the bright lights

The dawn will come
The sun will rise
Hope it turns
As fish, upside

Time will heal and see the change
And love will bring you past the pain

[Hook] (x2)
(I'll be honest and by your side
Whatever more)
