Preacher is preaching
How you should live
Instead of teaching
With the love they give
They ask for money
In the name of the Lord
And they line their pockets; keep coming back for more
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
What they feed you
Strive to believe
Giving you just enough to make you needy
By the time you wake up they're already gone
Looking for the next fool to come along
Dragging you down 
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your world
Spoiling your mind
Keeping your heart
Prayer divine

Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your heart
Foiling your mind
Prayer divine
