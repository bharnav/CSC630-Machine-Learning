If you see me running through some streets in life
Baby it’s alright, don’t even pay me no mind
I’m just looking for, for my yesterday
So my only memories, I watch them fade and fade away

The night will come and the dawn will fall
Put that falling bird, put it back in its next
And the bird would sing, sing out loud
Whoa, sing out loud, throw whispers

I always do something to make her cry
Like yeah, tear her castle down
If you see me running through some streets in life
Baby it’s alright, don’t even pay me no mind

I’m just looking for, for my yesterday
So my only memories, I watch them fade and fade away
Whoa, sweet baby mine
What ever happened to those good times

Sweet, sweet baby mine
What ever happened to those good times
People like to know that, I’m not by myself, I’m not alone
