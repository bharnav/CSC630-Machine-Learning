I was kind of dreaming
And my heart was making plans
Try to hold on
But it was falling through my hands

Did you hear me babe
Did I get close to your soul
Try to reach you
But I had to let it go

Like nothin' can save ya

A song fight took you there
You were never really mine
You lend get in the twilight
And slowly clip a tool way

Heavens hands you down
For a moment in my life
Thanks towards a wonder
Was a falling from the sky

Like nothin' can save ya

Was kinda of dreaming
And my heart was making plans
I tried to hold on
I tried to hold on
Did you hear me babe
Did I get close to your soul
I tried to reach you
But we had to let it go

Like nothin' can save ya

Never, never, never...
