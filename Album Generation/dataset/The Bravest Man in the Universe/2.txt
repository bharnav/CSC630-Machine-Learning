Deep river, my home is over Jordan
Deep river, you know I got long to stay here
You know I got long to stay here
My calling down the thunder
From this land just wait for me
Just wait, swimming the ocean

I make it love for you baby
Deep river, oh, I over drown
Deep river, I want to cross over into camp-ground
You want I want to cross over into camp-ground
