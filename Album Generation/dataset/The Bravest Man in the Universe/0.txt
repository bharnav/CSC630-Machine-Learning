[Intro:]
The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who has forgiven first
(The bravest man in the universe)

[Verse 1:}
I got a story I want to tell
Gather 'round me
Gather 'round me boys and girls
I once was lost
But now I'm found
When I beer up so high
I always know how to come down

[Chorus:]
The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who has forgiven first
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Humming)

[Verse 2:]
Shame on me
Shame on you
It's up to us
What we say and what we do
Would you stay in the sun
Would you stay in the sun much too long
You try to find a shade
A shade that makes you feel at home

[Chorus:]
The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who can forgive the other one first
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(The bravest man in the universe)

[Outro:]
Oh oh oh oh
(The bravest man in the universe)
