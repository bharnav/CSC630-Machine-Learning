Don't you let nobody
Turn you 'round
Turn you 'round
Turn you 'round

Don't you let nobody
Turn you 'round
Keep on walking on solid ground

Heard somebody say the other day
People always got away
By destructing or getting away of your vision
Sometimes you gotta move them aside

Make me think about the girl on my mind
She don't know Jack, but she said

Don't you let nobody
Bring you down
Bring you down
Bring you down

Don't you let nobody
Bring you down
Keep on walking on solid ground

Don't you let nobody
Turn you 'round
Turn you 'round
Turn you 'round

Don't you let nobody
Turn you 'round
Just keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
