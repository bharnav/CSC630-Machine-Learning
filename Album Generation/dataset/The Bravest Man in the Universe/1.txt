[Verse 1]
I could try to say I'm sorry
But that won't be quite enough
To let you know the pain that I feel
And it just won't let up
Oh, it feels like the sky is falling
And the clouds, clouds are closing in
Where did I lose control?
When did it all begin?

[Hook]
Please forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar, I'm in a dream
Going my own way
Nothing to rely on

[Verse 2]
Oh, the dawn is a silent witness
To the blindness of the night
And we see our reflection so clear
In the blush, blush of the morning light
Time can pass so slowly
When you face your burden down
Your term is not commuted
It lingers, lingers without a sound

[Hook]
Please forgive my heart
It's not that the problem, problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar, I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely on
Please forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar, I'm in a dream
Can't you see my going on my way
Nothing to rely on, rely on, rely on
