Do you feel happy? Do you feel glad?
Do you get that feeling? Things ain’t so bad?
Cos you seem caught up, so full of spite
You’re never happy and that ain’t right
Do you feel happy? Do you feel good?
When you’re watching someone fuck up
And you really hoped they would
When they’re just trying, trying to get along
That ain’t happy that’s just wrong
You tell her what you love, she tells you what she hates
She slags off all her friends then she slags off all your mates
She seems caught up, so full of spite
She’s never happy and that ain’t right
Lighten up and smile!
Do you feel happy, when you criticize?
When you make someone feel stupid
Really cut em down size
You don’t see no good, only see the bad
You’re never happy and that’s just sad
You tell her what you love, she tells you what she hates
She slags off all her friends then she slags off all your mates
She seems caught up, so full of spite
She’s never happy and that ain’t right
Lighten up and smile!
HAPPY!!
