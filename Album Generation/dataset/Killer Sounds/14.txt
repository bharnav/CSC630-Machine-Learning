Sweat 'til you make your money

They repossessed my guts, boarded up my head
Taken everything, left us all for dead
My heart is pumping and my shirt is sopping wet
The boss he thinks I'm lazy
But he ain't the one who has to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat

You've got to, you gotta give it all
I'm burning up, I've gotta get myself checked
Sweat 'til you make your money

Darling, I've got plans I want more of this
And if you want to you could come along for kicks
You're working twice as hard just to get respect
The boss, he thinks I'm lazy
But he ain't the one who has to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat

Dignity keeps running out on me
Scared to fail cos failure won't repair
The holes in your shoes buy new clothes to wear
They won't let you forget, you must sweat

They repossessed my guts, boarded up my head
Taken everything left us all for dead
Working twice as hard just to get respect
The boss, he, thinks I'm lazy
But he ain't the one who has to sweat

You've got to, you gotta give it all
I'm burning up, I've gotta get myself checked
Sweat 'til you make your money

Why don't you come a little closer? Don't be shy
The night is winding down, they'll soon turn up the lights
We're just two people out for all that we can get
I just wanna take you home, make you mine
Make you sweat, sweat, sweat

You've got to, you gotta give it all
I'm burning up, I've gotta get myself checked
You've got to, you gotta give it all
I'm burning up, I've gotta get myself checked

You've got to, you've got to
You've got to, you've got to sweat
