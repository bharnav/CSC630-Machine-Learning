Getting out of my head so I don’t lose my mind
Spend all of my money on a Friday night..
Excitement! Can’t get none…
I’m like a real live wire, feelin fit to burst
People see no good, only fear the worst…
Excitement! Can’t get none…
Shootin the breeze, just letting off steam
The night gets freezing, I need some..
Excitement!
No fun to be found unless you’re on one
So bored of being so bored
No kicks I can’t get no fun, I need some…
Excitement!
No love around here can’t get none
So bored of being ignored
No kicks I can’t get no fun, I need some…
Excitement!
Standing in line for the bar bathroom
Follow your nose, tick tick tick BOOM!
Excitement! Can’t get none…
I keep turning up, but you just turn me down
All I need…
Excitement!
No fun to be found unless you’re on one
So bored of being so bored
No kicks I can’t get no fun, I need some…
Excitement!
No love around here can’t get none
So bored of being ignored
No kicks I can’t get no fun, I need some…
Excitement!
Getting out of my head…
(Is there anybody out there!!??)
Excitement!
No fun to be found unless you’re on one
So bored of being so bored
No kicks I can’t get no fun, I need some…
Excitement!
No car no money just the policeman
So bored of being so bored
No kicks no no I CAN’T GET NONE, I need some…
Excitement!
Shootin the breeze, just letting off steam
The night gets freezing, I need some..
EXCITEMENT!
Getting out of my head…
