Lipstick, perfume, reminders of you
Deny it, don't buy it, never admit but the fact is i'm a liar
And my heart is on fire!

I said "I'm too scared, too proud"
Can't you tell cos i'm talking too loud
Just trying, trying, gotta gotta gotta gotta cover up my desire
Cos my heart's on fire!

But it feels so good, but it feels...

Your name keeps running around my brain
You're cocaine, you're gradually driving me insane
You're sending me up in flames, you're propane
You're running around my brain...
You're running around my brain...

I can't eat i can't sleep, you're a hole and i'm in way too deep
I'm too tense i'm making no sense
I'm a violin string and you keep on turning me higher
Cos my heart's on fire!

And it feels so good, yeh it feels so good
And it feels so good, yeh it feels.... so good

Your name keeps running around my brain
You're cocaine, you're gradually driving me insane
You're sending me up in flames, you're propane
You're running around my brain...
You're running around my brain...
You're running around my brain...

(And my heart's on fire!)

And it feels so good...
And it feels so good...
And it feels so good...
It feels...

Your name keeps running around my brain
My membrane, you're gradually driving me insane
Keeps running around my brain, you're cocaine
You're running around my brain...
You're running around my brain...
You're running around my brain
