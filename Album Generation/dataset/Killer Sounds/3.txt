Don't write cheques that you can't cash
You've been telling lies and you're gonna crash and burn
The music's loud try to forget, the things you did, the things you said
Try to lose myself into the crowd, people here are jumping, people freaking out..

Hold out, cos everything will come my way
Come on, cos I'm only gonna tell you one more time...

So if you're ready come on..
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on come on bring it on...
Cos I'm the winner and the winner stays on...

If you want trouble it's coming your way
If you wanna war you've only gotta say
But you can't stop, once you start me up
Gonna take you out, gonna fuck you up..

Hold tight, cos someone's ganna take you down
Hold out, cos everything will come my way
Come on, cos I'm only gonna tell you one more time...

So if you're ready come on..
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on come on bring it on...
Cos I'm the winner and the winner stays on...

So when you come to rip my heart out
I'll be waiting in my armour
Cos ever since I was a small boy
It's always been like this...

You gotta try a little harder
Cos I won't let go, I won't let you...no

So when you're ready come on..
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on come on bring it on...
Cos I'm the winner and the winner stays on...

So if you're ready come on..
Take me on, bring it on, bring it on come on bring it on...
Cos I'm the winner and the winner stays on...

Go get your army, go get your guns
Gonna take you down, gonna take you on
