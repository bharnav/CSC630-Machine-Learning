Oh the weight upon your shoulder as you feel you’re getting older
Everybody wants to tell you…
Get a job, check your life, pay the rent and get a wife
Get a loan, pay it off then die
In your sleep, in your dreams you’re on the streets of New Orleans
Mardi Gras, dancing Second Line Style
You were young, you kicked back, All night parties at your flat
You let go but it’s all been a while..
You were cool you had fun, you took no shit from anyone
Front it out with a Second Line smile
Pretty girl, pretty face, made this God awful place
Come alive feel like Vegas on the Strip..
But the weight upon your shoulder as you feel you’re getting older
Everybody wants to tell you…
Get a job, check your life, get a baby, get a wife
Get a loan, pay it off then die
In your sleep, in your dreams you’re on the streets of New Orleans
Mardi Gras, dancing Second Line Style
You were young, you kicked back, All night parties at your flat
You let go but it’s all been a while..
We would run through the streets, singing songs at the police
Disappear down the Second Line mile
Pretty girl, pretty face, made this God awful place
Come alive just like Vegas on the Strip..
But the weight upon your shoulder as you feel you’re getting older
Everybody wants to tell you…
Get a job, check your life, get a husband or a wife
Sing this song as you’re dancing down the aisle…
Sound familiar?
Get a job, pay the rent, hope your pension don’t get spent
By the boss on the moonlight mile
In your sleep, in your dreams you’re on the streets of New Orleans
Mardi Gras, with a margharita smile
Get a job, check your life, get a baby, get a wife
Get a loan, pay it off then die
In your sleep, in your dreams you’re on the streets of New Orleans
Mardi Gras, dancing Second Line Style
Get a job, check your life, get a husband or a wife
Sing this song as you’re dancing down the aisle…
