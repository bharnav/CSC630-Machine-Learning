Just like a politician, always playing to the crowd
Changing his position, whatever to be crowned

I see the store detective, he's always follow me about
But man you've gotta get real cos there's nothing to steal let me out!

Give it up! give it out!
Wanna scream wanna shout
Easy come, easy go, let it roll...

Well there's a bomb in new york city
Feels like we're hanging by a thread
Well do you worry and fret or just try to forget? i confess i don't now...

Give it up! give it out!
Wanna scream wanna shout
Easy come, easy go, let it roll...

Give it up! give it out!
I love you baby when you scream and shout
Just wanna lose control
Let it roll...

Give it up, give it out
You know you make me wanna scream and shout
Singing hey la la...

You've got to get it, you get to me...

Give it up! give it out!
I love you baby when you scream and shout
Wanna feel you, in my soul...
Let it roll...

Give it up! give it out!
Wanna scream wanna shout
Easy come, easy go, let it roll...

Give it up! give it out!
I love you baby when you scream and shout
Before you lose control
Let it roll...

Give it up, give it out
