Hey, Don’t you know you wear me out?
Don’t know if I’m lost or found
Blow my mind, bite my lip…
Hit me like a bad trip

Oh yeh this modern life
She’s just like suicide
Hits you right between the eyes..

I’ve gotta thousand people telling me
A million things that I should be, (Take it easy now)
We all get pulled this way and that
Count your blessings don’t look back. (You and I we’ve gotta..)

Stay Alive, come on honey stay alive
When they’ve got you spinning round and round and round…

Hey! It’s time to get some living done
Cos this is looking like a car crash
I don’t wanna fade away
I ain’t going like that…

Oh yeh this modern life
She’s just like suicide
Hits you right between the eyes..

I’ve gotta thousand people telling me
A million things that I should be, (Take it easy now)
We all get pulled this way and that
Count your blessings don’t look back. (You and I we’ve gotta..)

Stay Alive, come on honey stay alive
When they’ve got you spinning round and round and round…
We’ve gotta stay alive

This is the modern life, suicide, a point forty five, right between your eyes..
Put the kick back in your step, put the kick back in your head
I ain’t going out this way, shake it like an earthquake…

I’ve gotta thousand people telling me
A million things that I should be, (Take it easy now)
We all get pulled this way and that
Count your blessings don’t look back. (You and I we’ve gotta..)

Stay Alive, come on honey stay alive. Stay alive…
This is suicide, we’ve gotta stay alive...
When they’ve got you spinning round and round and round you know
We’ve gotta stay alive
When they’ve got you spinning round and round and round you know
We’ve gotta stay alive
