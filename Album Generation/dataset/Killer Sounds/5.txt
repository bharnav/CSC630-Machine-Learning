Wonder what the hell should I do
Sit waiting for a breakthrough
I know I've been wasting my time

Look in the mirror I'm a disgrace
Bored of my clothes bored of my face
(I won't let you down)
Oh no I can't stop now, cos this is the only drug I've found..
And when you call my name, can't help it it's all that I know

Out of control, I flip and then I flop
Got a pocketful of problems but I just can't stop - STOP!
Can't think straight gotta make it to the top
I'm bag of contradictions but I just can't stop - STOP!

Wake up to a sunset, need a break gotta reset
Just one more time I can't give you up
Are you feeling lost? Kind of out of place?
Hours, days, months, years gone without a trace

(I won't let you down)
I move at double speed, I want all the things that I don't need
You turn me inside out, whatever cos all that I know..

Out of control, I flip and then I flop
Got a pocketful of problems but I just can't stop - STOP!
Can't think straight need to kick it to the top
I'm busy doing nothing and I'm never gonna stop - STOP!
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
I'm out of control I just can't stop - STOP!

This ain't over yet, no no this ain't over yet..
Won't ya come on! Come on! Come on!

Out of control, I flip and then I flop
You're a beautiful addiction and I just can't stop - STOP!
Gonna stop at nothing, gonna make it to the top
Turn it on turn it up cos I just can't stop - STOP!

I'm out of control
