Between the seasons we find room
And I like the way your lips turned legendary
And I like the way the sun will come to light

And I like the way your lips turned legendary
And I like the way the sun will come to light

But it won't be long until it's your very last goodbye
Decide to make it hard to find, but make it

And if you decide that you need a thousand heartaches
A thousand heartaches
Heading to this hotel room, was the greatest mistake
The greatest mistake

And I want this all to be just necessary so when the darkness comes we won't need the light
And I want this all to be just necessary so when the darkness comes we won't need the light

But it won't be long until it's your very last goodbye
Decide to make it, between the seasons we find room

And if you decide that you need a thousand heartaches
A thousand heartaches
Heading to this hotel room, was the greatest mistake
The greatest mistake

This is as real as it gets with weapons in hand
We opt to not lay down our guns

And if you decide that you need a thousand heartaches
A thousand heartaches
Heading to this hotel room, was the greatest mistake
The greatest mistake

Between the seasons we find room to breathe out
Between the seasons we find room to breathe out

And if you decide that you
And if you decide that you
And if you decide that you
And if you decide
