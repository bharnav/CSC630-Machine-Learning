There will be many nights alone to pour the kerosene
Scissors cut harness free, the spotlight on the bed of the serene
And when you call me out in victory...

It's been a long night, and I still came up missing

And I touch to believe
I gather my faith to help me sleep

Stare deep from the south
Watermarked and straightened all out
Lions spit broken teeth when armies of insects surround
And when you call me out in victory....

It's been a long night, and I still came up missing

And I touch to believe
I gather my faith to help me sleep

And when you call me out in victory
And when you call me out in victory

Come call me out and gather me
Hearts tear out in victory

Whoa!

It's been a long night, and I still came up missing

And I touch to believe
I gather my faith to help me sleep, to help me sleep, to help me sleep, to help me sleep
