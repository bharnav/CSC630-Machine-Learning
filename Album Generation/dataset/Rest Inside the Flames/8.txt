We cannot deny
What I would give for memories that wouldn't keep me up at night
We cannot deny
It's a shame that all we have is a memory that cannot kill the fear
And get out get out alive
You won't find any comfort here
When I begin
And I may have friends, some of them the best that any man has ever known
But they have troubles; they have troubles all their own
