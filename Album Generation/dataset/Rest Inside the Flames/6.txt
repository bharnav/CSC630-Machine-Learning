Are you comfortable with the skin you're in?
Are you screaming loud enough to be important?
Are you following the path that you thought you would or wouldn't?
And you backed it all along when you're pulling from what's inside; it's honest there

It took all these nights alone
Alone we are

Aurora, don't leave me yet
Aurora, don't leave me yet
Your lipstick-stained life is arriving. (It does arive, Fly)

So at ease with the night that we drove along
From the top of the hill where we don't go
And the stop where we claim our life, our place, forever
And we dreamt it all along, from the nights when the light stayed alive, we shared

It took all these nights alone
Alone we are

Aurora, don't leave me yet
Aurora, don't leave me yet
Your lipstick-stained life is arriving. (It does arive, Fly)
Your lipstick-stained life is arriving. (It does arive, Fly)

In hope I speak your name for closure
By a thread we'll hang, to never give in

Aurora, don't leave me yet
Aurora, don't leave me yet
Your lipstick-stained life is arriving
Your lipstick-stained life is arriving
(Tonight may be the last night in these shoes.)
