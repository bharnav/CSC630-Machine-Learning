Could I be any further along when a room leaves nothing?
We close our eyes to avoid the sound
You were traveling by an aeroplane over the ocean
I was deciding the way to perform the rescue

Could I be any more this way, done starting over
The silence in you, and this could be
This could be the hardest thing to leave without a single trace
Here without you
Here without you,, I fall apart
I fall apart

Sleeping in the water so warm in a dream so stalking
Dancing in darkness with the air so alive, believing
I have been here more than I'd like to
But it's the only way I know how to rescue

Could I be any more this way, done starting over
The silence in you, and this could be
This could be the hardest thing to leave without a single trace
Here without you
Here without you,, I fall apart

Wake me up
Come on just, wake me up
When it's over
Turn down the lights
Don't wait for me
I'm pretty sure I won't be coming home tonight
(we'll place these stars inside our hearts)
Turn down the lights
Don't wait for me
I'm pretty sure I won't be coming home tonight

This could be the hardest thing to leave without a single trace
Here without you
Here without you,, I fall apart
I fall apart
