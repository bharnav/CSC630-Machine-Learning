And in the harbor she sleeps on her anchor waiting direction
Then through the storms we align life and search forever after

So we gather our way to answer all of our failures
With hope and redemption
Rest inside the flames

Continue the chase through the darkest
Across the mouth and into this ocean
We see through skin to never forget
When all hope is lost
Hearts turn to lock
Set your sights to improve

We gather our way to answer all of our failures
With hope and redemption
Rest inside the flames

Continue the chase through the darkest
Across the mouth and into this ocean
We see through skin to never forget
When all hope is lost
Hearts turn to lock
Set your sights to improve
Set your sights to improve

Don't let the lights turn out
This watery grave, inside every page
Avoiding, avoiding
Don't let the lights turn out
Don't let the lights turn out
Don't let the lights turn...

Across the mouth and into this ocean
We see through skin to never forget
When all hope is lost
Hearts turn to lock
Set your sights to improve

And Rest Inside The Flames
Rest Inside The Flames
Rest Inside The Flames
Rest Inside The Flames
