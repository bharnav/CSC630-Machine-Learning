I hate choking on past words, I swim upstream
The ones to never ever let you try
Blackout, clear hearts won't counteract; see through the dirt in your eyes
You must stand on battle lines
If you want to own blue skies

The situation, has turned the tide
The waters caving cast aside

And you were barely coming through, but then it's you
The ones who never ever let you die
Blackout, clear hearts won't counter act; see through the death in our lives
You must stand on battle lines
If you want to own blue skies

The situation, has turned the tide
The waters caving cast aside
And since the dance floor has come to shine
The time has come to light the night

Unearth the things that you're afraid of
Unearth the things that you're afraid of

And since the dance floor has come to shine
The time has come to light the night (light the night)

Situation, has turned the tide
The waters caving cast aside
And since the dance floor has come to shine
The time has come to light the night

Unearth the things that you're afraid of
Unearth the things that you're afraid of
Takes more than death in our lives
Takes more than death in our lives
