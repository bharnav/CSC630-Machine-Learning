I wrote this story so many days ago
And the words kept falling onto pages
Without the loss we can't go on
And with the loss we became strong
It's how it is
As we stare it down

Oh my god do I think that this is the end of everything
When everything inside wants me to feel like this is normal

And in the quiet
The silence screams aloud
And the panic resides along our inners
And with the tragedy we go
Pushing the hell so far below
Desperate hands cover my face

So stay calm this way in case we're needed for emergency
And if we are we'll be prepared for action
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
Somebody better call a doctor
Somebody call a doctor

And maybe this could be the end of everything that we want (Don't panic!)
And from a distance it seems that the water will wash panic away
Oh my lord, believe
There's no need for emergency
But in case there is, distract it

This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
Somebody better call a doctor
Somebody call a doctor

And maybe this could be the end of everything that we want (Don't panic!)
And from a distance it seems that the water will wash panic away

The Water (water)
Will wash
Panic (panic)
Away (Away)

If this is the great descent, I won't be running for the exits
If this is the great descent, I won't be running for the exits
