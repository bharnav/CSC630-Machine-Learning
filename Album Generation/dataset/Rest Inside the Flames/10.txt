It's a midnight swim
Where it is late and the air is all clear
And I remember that evening:
You on the floor
I was attached to the ceiling

Look behind
That glass in your mouth
It's what I am
Due for

The sun will set tonight
On all the lonely dreamers
Only to rise again
So we can start it over

Start it again

And you were right
When you whispered in my ear
And it all became so clear

It's gonna be alright
Everything will be alright
Even if the city ignites

Look behind
That glass in your mouth
It's what I am
Due for

The sun will set tonight
On all the lonely dreamers
Only to rise again
So we can start it over

We start it again

Now to get back to
The room where there's windows
As large as the city

The sun will set tonight
On all the lonely dreamers
Only to rise again
So we can start it over

Start it again
