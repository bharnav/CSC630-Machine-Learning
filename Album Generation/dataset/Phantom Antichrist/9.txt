Those who serve, and those who rule
Lepers, kings and mindless fools
Empire leaders, tyrant's tools
All will fade with time

Hail the cowards, brave at heart
The ugly, and the beautiful
Those who never found their souls
All live transient lives
All side by side, as the tragedy strikes
Fearless through life's joy and pain
Though they are gone, their spirit lives on
Until our paths cross again

Those who left us in this place
Those who dreamt they'd rule the world
Those whose minds inspired our ways
All the young and stale
All side by side, as the tragedy strikes
Fearless through life's joy and pain
Though they are gone, their spirit lives on
Until our paths cross again

The end justifies the means
Our lifetime, our best dreams
Those that are blind soon shall see

The end justifies the means
Our lifetime, our best dreams
Those that are blind, the ones that are blind soon shall see

All will be the mourning ones
All the daughters, all the sons
Still we're here, but soon we're gone
Circle of our lives
Let's embrace the time we have
From our first to our last breath
Don't drown in your memories
For now is your time

(Guitar solo)

The fate of the Earth rests on the shoulders of the fallen ones
Know however long the night the dawn will break
Passing the flame from one generation to the next that comes
Stay here, only the soul will remain
Only the soul will remain
(Soul will remain)
(Soul will remain)

Mortal are we,so blood memories
Forgotten will be our life's gain
So let it be, whatever may be
Until our paths cross again
