After all these centuries of preaching godly wrath
Punishment and afterlife pandemonium
Gods that tortured, gods that judged
Breed the guilt they make you feel
Minds deceived by psychopaths
I see through the web you weaved
Your heave, my hell
Your heaven has become my hell
You are the virus of this scorched earth
Your heaven, my hell
Your heaven will always be my hell
Fear has possessed the hearts of men

Now the angels of justice
Preparing their descent
All illusion and poison
Praying this will be the end
It shall fall apart now
Kill their conscience and desires
A lifetime of penetration
Unchain your soul and end their smiles

Your heaven, my hell
I, destroyer of your faith
Your heaven, my hell
I, creator you shall fear my name

At the end of religion
My spirit will not die
I will only see clearer
No longer haunted by these times
I'll be stronger than ever
No temptation to resist
So come on take my hand now
Let's celebrate the apocalypse

Your heaven, my hell
I, destroyer of your faith
Your heaven, my hell
I, creator you shall fear my name

Let this last farewell be heard across all countries, all cultures
No more cholera Messiahs
Embrace the dawning of a new earth, unlike the first
So let them bleed
As a new light shines

Let's kill all gods
Let's crush the hypocrisy
My eyes are open wide
My eyes are open wide

Your heaven, my hell
I, destroyer
Your heaven, my hell
I, creator
Your heaven, my hell
I, destroyer
Your heaven, my hell
I, creator
Grrr my eyes are open wide!
