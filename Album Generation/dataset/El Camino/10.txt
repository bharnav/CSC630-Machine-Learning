[Verse 1]
When I need to replace her
I am the mind eraser
Anything goes, yeah, anything goes

Got this sin in her brain
But she ain't gonna see me again
See me again, this I know
But oh, deep down I can't let go

[Chorus]
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
Oh, don't let it be over, let it be over, over

[Verse 2]
Seen me stack up my woes
Into a wall, around a rose
Now I'm the rose, now she knows
Oh, it hurts so, and I can't let go

[Chorus x2]
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
Oh, don't let it be over, let it be over, over
