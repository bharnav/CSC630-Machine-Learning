[Intro]
Nah nah, nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah
Nah nah (wo oh oh), nah nah (wo oh oh), nah nah nah, nah nah

So long
Why you waiting so long?
After every single word is said
I'm feeling dead and gone

[Verse 1]
Along
Don't you drag me along
If you do, you know I'll follow you
Until the truth is known

[Hook x2]
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
All the way, all the way

So long
Why'd it take you so long?
Every time I hear the whistle blow
I'm down below, your pawn

[Verse 2]
"Don't call me, I'll call you"
Is what you say, I'll obey
'Till tonight, oh it ain't right
I need to say, gotta say

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro]
