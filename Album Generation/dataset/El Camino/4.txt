[Verse 1]
Oh, she wants milk and honey
Oh, she wants filthy money
But oh, that's not the way it goes
I wanna buy some time but don't have a dime

[Chorus]
Hey my my she's a money maker
Hey my my she's gonna take ya
Way down down she's bound to break ya
Hey now she's a money maker

[Verse 2]
Oh, she just keeps me guessing
Oh, never tells me yes and
Oh ooh, I just can't let go
And nothing that I show will ever do for you

[Chorus x2]
Hey my my she's a money maker
Hey my my she's gonna take ya
Way down down she's bound to break ya
Hey now she's a money maker
