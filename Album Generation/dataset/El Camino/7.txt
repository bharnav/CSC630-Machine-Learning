[Verse 1]
Even though
You don't know
You're reacting all along
What I see
Is killing me
You won't make it on your own

[Chorus]
In this hell of a season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, yeah
Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
Know I do, oh

[Verse 2]
Even though
I don't know
I'm pretending that I do
It's my curse
I can reverse
I'm still waiting here for you

[Chorus x3]
In this hell of a season
Give me more of a reason
To be with you
Be with you, yeah
Say you'll be better
I'll keep waiting forever
You know I do
Know I do, oh
