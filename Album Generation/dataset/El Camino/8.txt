[Verse 1]
You're wound up like a weapon
You've got an evil streak
They told me to stay away
But I was much too weak

[Chorus]
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl

[Verse 2]
I hounded/hunted you forever
But you never saw
This love was so strong it should'a
Been against the law

[Chorus]
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl

[Verse 3]
You tear me all apart
Then act so warm
Like being cooled by the rain
In the eye of the storm

[Chorus x2]
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you hear me call
And singing gotta stop, stop it girl
Yea you gotta stop, stop can't you see me fall
And singing stop, stop it girl
