[Verse 1]
I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
He keeps everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way

[Verse 2]
The dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to bark
The dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl
Watch out, all you kinfolk
My little red rooster's on the prowl

[Verse 3]
I tell you that he keeps all the hens
Fighting among themselves
Keeps all the hens
Fighting among themselves
He don't want no hen in the barnyard
Layin' eggs for nobody else, no

[Organ and Piano Interlude]
Play it, Billy
Answer him, Ray
Lord have mercy, yeah
Oh, yeah!
I like that, mm-hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me tell everybody!

[Verse 4]
Now if you see my red rooster
Send him home
Said if you see my red rooster
Send him home
I ain't had no peace in the barnyard
Since my red rooster been gone
