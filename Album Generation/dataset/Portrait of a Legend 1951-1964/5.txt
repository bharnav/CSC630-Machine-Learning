Just for you, just for you, just for you, my love
Wo oh for you, just for you, my love
Wo yes my dear, i finally realize
I finally realize that it's just for you

When you see me workin' all night long
Workin' till my stress was gone

I finally realize that it's all for you
Yeah, when you see me workin' all the day
Workin' all of my stress away

I finally realize that it's all for you

Just for you, wo oh, could it be for you
Just for you, just for you, wo wo, just for you

I finally realize that it's just for you

When you see me workin' all the day
Workin' all of my stress away
It's for you, oh yes it is
I finally realize that it's all for you
Yeah, when you see me spendin' all of my money
Just to give you a good time, honey
It's for you, oh i finally realize
I finally realize that it's for you

It's for you, for nobody else but you
My love, it's for you
Sweetheart, i know it's for you, wo, it's for you
Yes my dear, i finally realize
I finally realize that it's just for you
