[Sam Cooke]
Oh Lord, the time is growing nigh
When I must breathe my last breath inside
Lord in my dying hour
Stay with me Lord

Oh Lord, my friends will gather 'round
They're watching me slowly
I'm slowly sinking down
Lord in my dying hour
Stay with me Lord

[Paul Foster] [Be with me Jesus as Background]
Now Lord, Lord, now Jesus time has come
When I'm must my earthly home
Friends standing around, tears in their eye
They know that I am about to die
But I'm not worried, I'm not afraid
I know you do Jesus, what you said
Just what you say follow me and you be right
You will be with me Lord, day and night. I'm not afraid
I said I'm dying. Don't leave me now

[Sam Cooke]
O Lord, I know you'll stand by me
When I'm trouble, when I'm in misery
Lord in my dying hour
Stay with me Lord

O Lord, I know you'll stand by your word
Whenever I call you
I know you always you have already heard
Lord in my dying hour
Stay with me Lord

[Paul Foster]
O Lord, I said farewell
Fare thee well, fare thee hell
To my friends down here
I got loves ones
Waiting for me up there

[Sam Cooke]
O Lord, others are waiting for me, what a reunion
I know that will be
Lord in my dying hour
Stay with me Lord
