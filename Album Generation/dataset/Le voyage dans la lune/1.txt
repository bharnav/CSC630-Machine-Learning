How long will it take you
To reach the stars
No man in this desert
Or where you are
No one could escape this
Behold the rise
No hand nor companion
When you arrive
Would you ramble on?
Up to the skies
No one for the taking
You will be mine
Forever you're willing
The seven stars
The seven stars

No man in this desert
Or where you are
Do you know where you're going
The seven stars
