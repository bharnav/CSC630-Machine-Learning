Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing

You ever love someone so much
You thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
I didn't think so
You ever tried with all your heart and soul
To get your lover back to you?
I wanna hope so
You ever pray with all your heart and soul
Just to watch her walk away? Yeah

Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Feel like crying
Feel like crying

You ever toss and turn, you're lying awake
And thinking about the one you love?
I don't think so
You ever close your eyes you're making believe
You're holding the one you're dreaming of?
Well, if you say so
It hurts so bad when you finally know
Just how low, low, low, low, low she'll go

Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Feel like crying
I feel like crying

Ooh
Feel like crying
Feel like crying
Ooh
Feel like crying
Feel like crying, ooh

Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Feel like crying
