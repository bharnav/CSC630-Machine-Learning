I stay out late
But I don't cry
I did my best
I don't know why
Somebody asked
To take my place
Another smile
Another face

Baby lets have a party
If your leaving
Let me know
Lets have a party
If your leaving
Tell me so

Cause I don't want to feel
The way I feel right now
I don't want to feel
This hurt inside
Somehow

Let me know
Let me know

Everybody needs a friend
Yes they do
I'll be yours until the end
Just let me know
Let me know

This broken heart
Not much to show
Why be sad
Before we go

Baby lets have a party
If your leaving let me know
Lets have a party
If you leaving
Tell me so

Cause I don't wanna feel
The way I feel right now
I don't wanna feel
It hurt inside
Somehow

So let me know
Let me know
Let me know
