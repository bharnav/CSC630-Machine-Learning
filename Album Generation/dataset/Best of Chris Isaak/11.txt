Here I go again
Dreaming
Here I go again

(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)

Having a good time, baby
Wish you were here
Thinking about you, baby
It feels like you're near

And you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)

Days can be lonely
Nights dreams come true
Making love with somebody
Exactly like you

And you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Oh, try

(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now) Oho
(Can't do a thing to stop me)

Couldn't stop myself if I tried
Because I got you too deep inside

You can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Try

(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dream, baby
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dream

(Can't do a thing to stop me now) Dreaming
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming

(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming
