Only the lonely know the way I feel tonight
Only the lonely know this feeling ain't right

There goes my baby
There goes my heart
They're gone forever
So far apart

But only the lonely know why I cry
Only the lonely
Only the lonely

Only the lonely know the heartaches I've been through
Only the lonely know I've cried and cried for you

Maybe tomorrow
A new romance
No more sorrow
But that's the chance

You got to take
If youy lonely heart breaks
Only the lonely
Only the lonely
Only the lonely
