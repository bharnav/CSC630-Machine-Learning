I want you to want me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
Oh I need you to need me
I want you to want me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

Put on my old brown shoes
Put on my brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

Baby, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin
Feelin' all alone without a friend ya know you feel like dyin
Oh baby, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'

I want you to want me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
Oh I need you to need me

Kick on my old brown shoes
Put on my brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

Oh didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'
Feelin' all alone without a friend ya know you feel like dyin
Oh baby, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'

Feelin' all alone without a friend ya know you feel like dyin
Baby, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see ya cryin'

I want you to want me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
Oh I need you to need me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
