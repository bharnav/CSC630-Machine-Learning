No stars in the sky
The night seems so dark around you
You won't say a word
And wonder why no one's found you

Waiting for love
Praying for love again

Love's a heavyweight
Give it to me, don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing
Too heavy for one heart to

Bring me your love
Give me your love again
It's not your fault
One heart can never win, it takes

Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold your love
Your love

And if your heart should ache
Remember me
And if your heart should break

Two hearts
Two hearts they can mend it
Heartache
Heartaches can be ended by love
By love

Love's a heavyweight
Give to me don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing
Too heavy for one heart to bring me your love

Give me your love again
It's not too late
One heart can never win, it takes

Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts
Two hearts just to hold your love
Your love
