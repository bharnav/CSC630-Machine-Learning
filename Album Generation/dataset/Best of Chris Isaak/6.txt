Like a king, without a castle
Like a man without a home
I call your name, but there's no answer...
And I'm left here on my own
Just wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin...where did our love go?
Does anybody know?

A man alone he has no future...
A man alone he has no friends
There was a time I thought I found her
One to love me till the end
Now I'm wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin....where did our love go?

Does anybody know?

Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin (wonderin)

I'm like a king, without a castle
With a heart condemned to roam
I'll keep searchin, till I find you
Till I do I'll be alone
Just wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Wonderin
Where did our love go? Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Anybody know?
