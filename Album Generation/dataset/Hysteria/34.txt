[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the distance, I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady across the street, she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting as she turns out the light

[Chorus]
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

[Verse 2]
London boys are gazing, girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream, stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

[Chorus]

Standing by the trapdoor, aware of me and you
Are the actor and the clown, they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life, she always plays the fool

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Is it all too late?
Much too late?
Can't you see it's all too late?
Yeah, it's too late

[Chorus][x2]
