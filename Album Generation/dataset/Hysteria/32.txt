[Verse]
Hold onto your hat, hold onto your heart
Ready, get set to tear this place apart
Don't need a ticket, only place in town
That'll take you up to heaven and never bring you down
Anything goes! Anything goes!
Women to the left, Women to the right
There to entertain and take you through the night
So grab a little heat and come along with me
Because your mama don't mind what your mama don't see
Anything goes! Anything goes!
Rock! Rock! Until you drop
Rock! Rock! Never stop
Rock! Rock! Until you drop
I say Rock! Rock! to the top
Riding into danger, laughing all the way
Fast, free and easy, living for today
Got to lip service, get it while you can
Hot, sweat and nervous love on demand
Anything goes! Anything goes!
Rock! Rock! Give it to me
It's what I got going through me
Don't ever stop do it to me
Yeah, Rock! Rock! You really move me
Hold on, hold on, hold tight
We're going to rock tonight
Too loud man, too loud
