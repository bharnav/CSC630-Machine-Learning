[Intro]
Are you excitable?
Are you excited?

[Verse 1]
Ah, this obsession
It's getting a-inviting
A little a, X-rated
A little bit exciting

[Chorus 1]
Stand up, stand up, say yeah
Stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up, say yeah
Say yeah, stand up

[Chorus 2]
Come on get in the groove
You know I get so excitable
I really get so excitable
I want to get you excitable
So come on, let's go
Ah, baby, don't say no

[Verse 2]
Ah, this temptation
It gets-a a-outrageous
Ha, it's such a, a sensation
A little bit contagious, hey, hey

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Are you excitable?
Are you excitable?
Obsession, obsession
Check it out, hey

[Verse 3]
Inch by inch, mile by mile
What I do I do in style
You got your leather, la-lace, long and lean
Ballistic a lipstick dream machine
You got to do it
Ah, do it, do it
Hey, come on and do it

[Chorus 2][x3]

[Outro]
Baby, let's go, excitable
You got me shivering, excitable
