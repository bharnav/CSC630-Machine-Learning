[Verse 1]
You got the fire, baby, I got the heat, can you handle it?
I got the time, baby, you got the need, oh surrender it

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a passion crime with a danger sign, oh, can you handle it?
You're just another girl, I'm just another man, it's just another night
Don't give me love and affection or what you think it should be
Don't give me love, the wrong reason, yeah, it won't matter to me

[Verse 2]
I got the heart, baby, you got the beat, take a chance on me
We got the night baby, we got the dream, oh imagine it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't need your understanding, oh babe, can't you understand me?
Come on, try it and see

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a passion play in a different way, oh can you handle it? Yeah
You're just another girl, I'm just another man, it's just another night
Don't give me love and affection or what you think it should be
Don't give me love, the wrong reason, yeah, it won't matter to me

[Outro]
I don't need your understanding, oh babe, can't you understand me?
I don't need it
(I don't need) don't need your heart
(I don't need) no understanding, (I don't need) no affection
Don't need your love
Don't give me love and affection, don't give me love, give me what you got
I don't need it, I don't need it I don't need your understanding
