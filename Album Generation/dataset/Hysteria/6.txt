[Verse 1]
Feeling like it's all over
Feeling like there's no love
Feeling like it's not easy
Breathing life in the dust

[Chorus 1]
On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't going to be heroes
There ain't going to be anything, oh

[Chorus 2]
Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

[Verse 2]
When we all fall down
When we walk into silence
When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence, oh
Then the damage is done
Put away that gun
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be anywhere, oh

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war but I'm a rebel
And I ain't going to fight no more, no way

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war
And I ain't going to fight no more
(Stop)

[Outro]
Stop fighting for the Gods of war
(Stop fighting for the Gods of war)
Yeah what the hell we fighting for?
(What in the hell we fighting for?)
We're fighting with the Gods of war
Heavy!
