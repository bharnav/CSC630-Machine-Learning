[Verse 1]
Let's welcome home the soldier boy
(Far away, far away)
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy
(Far away, far away)
Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes
The scars on his mind took so many lives
Die hard the hunter

Welcome home soldier boy
Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy
Yeah, they can take the gun away from you
But never take away your attitude

They can't do that, no no no, they can't do that

You got no enemy, no front line
The only battle's in the back of your mind
You don't know how to change from bad to good
You brought the war to your neighborhood
You can't do that, you can't do that

They can't do that, no no no, they can't do that

[Chorus]
(Die hard)
You're caught in a trap
(Hunter)
There's no looking back
(Die hard)
He's lost in the crowd
(Hunter)
Die hard and proud

[Bridge]
Die hard the hunter[x4]

[Verse 2]
Back in the city he's a man on the loose
He is the shadow that's following you
He takes no prisoners, when he's hunting for game
He's got a bullet and it carries your name

You can't do that, you can't do that, you can't do that

[Chorus][x2]


[Bridge]
Die hard the hunter[x4]

[Outro]
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
You can't do that
You can't do that, no no no
