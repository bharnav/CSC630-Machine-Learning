[Verse 1]
Today could've been the day
That you'd blow out your candles
Make a wish as you closed your eyes
Today could've been the day
Everybody was laughing
Instead, I just sit here and cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would you be?
What would you look like
When you looked at me for the very first time?
Today could've been the next day of the rest of your life

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
That I don't think of you
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose
Such a ray of light we never knew
Gone too soon, yeah

[Verse 2]
Would you have been president
Or a painter, an author, or sing like your mother?
One thing is evident
Would've given all I had
Would've loved you like no other

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would you be?
What would you look like?
Would you have my smile and her eyes?
Today could've been the next day of the rest of your life

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
That I don't think of you
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose
Such a ray of light we never knew
Gone too soon, yeah

[Bridge]
Not a day goes by
Oh
I'm always asking why

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
That I don't think of you
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose
Such a beautiful light we never knew
Gone too soon
You were gone too soon, yeah
Oooh
Oooh, oh

[Outro]
Not a day goes by
That I don't think of you
