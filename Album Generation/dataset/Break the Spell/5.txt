[Intro]
Like a moth into a flame
I'm hypnotized
And like a stone
I'm paralyzed
'Cause I can't look away

[Verse 1]
You found your way under my skin
And I'm trying not to love you
But I hate the way I keep on givin'

[Chorus 1]
In to you, like I always do
No matter how I try
Or maybe could it be
You're the part of me
That's keepin' me alive?

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
I got your poison running through my veins

[Chorus 2]
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back, I can't get enough
I can't go without you

[Verse 2]
I could fight you 'til the end
But I would lose you if I win
So I guess I'll just keep on givin'

[Chorus 1]
In to you, like I always do
No matter how I try
Or maybe could it be
You're the part of me
That's keepin' me alive?

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
I got your poison running through my veins

[Chorus 2]
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back, I can't get enough
I can't go without you

[Verse 3]
This feeling is far from sober
There's beauty buried deep inside
You're the only one that gets me high
And I know it's far from over
As you can see, you're the part of me
That's keepin' me alive

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
I got your poison running through my veins

[Chorus 2]
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back, I can't get enough
I can't go without you
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back, I can't get enough
I can't go without you

[Outro]
I keep coming back, I can't get enough
I can't go without you
