[Verse 1]
It's a world full of heartbreak drive-by's
We've seen our fair share of hard nights
Looked right into the face of a goodbye
While we walked on the edge of the dark side
After all this time, yeah

[Chorus]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Just when these four walls try to cave in
And the ground underneath starts shakin'
It's the hope in your eyes that I cling to
And I hope to God it never leaves you
After all this time, yeah

[Chorus]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Even if they come for us
Everything can turn to dust
You and I are never going down
The bullets and the bombs of love
Go ahead and fire at us
We will never give it up

[Chorus]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, no-oh-oh
