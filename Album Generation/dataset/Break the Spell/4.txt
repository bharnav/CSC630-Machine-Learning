All my life I been an unlucky bastard
Two days later without that dollar
Skating through life and getting there faster
Waiting for the next big, cold disaster

The luck of the Irish it don't apply here
The bad luck Mexican is what i feel
Mama raised me right, daddy was proud
So I'll sing my songs until im found

Unlucky Bastard
Unlucky Bastard

Unlucky Bastard
Unlucky Bastard

Unlucky Bastard
Unlucky Bastard
