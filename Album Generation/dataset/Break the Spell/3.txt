I crashed in the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, and alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home

But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted, and my girl in Lover's Lane?

And meanwhile, back in the States...

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, glad as he can be
So, come on pretty baby, just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle...

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me, like an atomic bomb
When I woke up, and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cooking, and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cooking me

Meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, glad as he can be
So, come on pretty baby, just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle

I jumped out of the pot, and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So, I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was getting mighty slim
So, I thumbed down a whale who was heading my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
And when I got to Lover's Lane, I was almost dead
But my soul was gone, and here's what I said:

Baby, baby, the man is no good
Oh baby, baby, you should have understood
You can trust me as long as you need
So, come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you
I love you!
