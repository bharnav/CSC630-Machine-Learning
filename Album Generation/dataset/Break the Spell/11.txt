[Verse 1]
Hood of my car
Radio's just loud enough so I can hear Levon
Where you are is anybody's guess but mine
Just a song that we grew up on
Constellations seem so outta line
But I'm wishing we could make it this time

[Chorus]
If somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere
Like a shooting star
Or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me
We can't be too far 'cause
I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find
That we're not the only ones
That we're not the only ones

[Verse 2]
Call me a fool for
Daydreaming in the dark and
Throwing bottles at the moon
Why you're gone is nobody's fault but mine
Another song that we grew up on
Can anybody tell me where I can find
That girl I can't get out of my mind?

[Chorus]
If somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere
Like a shooting star
Or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me
We can't be too far 'cause
I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find
That we're not the only ones
That we're not the only ones

[Verse 3]
Looking for love and
Looking for something more
When it's not enough
We gotta stay above the clouds
'Cause with our feet both on the ground
We'll never learn
I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find
That we're not the only ones

[Chorus]
If somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere
Like a shooting star
Or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me
We can't be too far 'cause
I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find
That we're not the only ones
That we're not the only ones

[Outro]
Come see for yourself if you don't believe me
Together, we will find that we're not the only ones
We're not the only ones
