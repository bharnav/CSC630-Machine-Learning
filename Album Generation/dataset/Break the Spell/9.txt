[Verse 1]
Our story's old
Older than the wind
It's been sad for years
But how can we pretend
That we all know just how it's gonna end?

[Chorus 1]
Rescue me
The middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say it's easier to give up on it
I say it's time to rescue me

[Verse 2]
Lost and lonely people standing by
Afraid to try
Some of them here
Same as you and I
The differences are all but left behind
So I need you now

[Chorus 2]
Rescue me
The middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say its hard to make the changes
Rescue me, and I'll never be the same

[Chorus 1]
Rescue me
In the middle of my darkest hour
Time will tell, I never really had the power
Some say it's easier to give up on it
I say it's time to rescue me

[Verse 3]
We gotta get out
How foolish have we been
To say it's all just wasted time?
We may lose, and we may win
But like the sun, we will rise again
We will rise again
But until then

[Chorus 2]
Rescue me
The middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say it's hard to make the changes
Rescue me, and I'll never be the same

[Chorus 1]
Rescue me
In the middle of my darkest hour
Time will tell, I never really had the power
Some say it's easier to give up on it
I say it's time to rescue me

[Outro]
Rescue me
In the middle of the ocean
