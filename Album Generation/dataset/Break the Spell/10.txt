[Bridge]
Heard that song on the radio
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real-life time machine

[Verse 1]
You were there in the front seat
Windows down, we were burnin'
It was just like a movie scene
Those dashboard lights
And your pale blue eyes cutting through me

[Chorus]
Two hearts on the getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singing louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone
But I hear it louder than ever

[Verse 2]
We spent that whole summer long
You and me in the moonlight
Chasin' dreams in a fast machine
No way that it could go wrong
When it all felt so right
Real-life California queen
How can I forget all of the ways that you loved me?

[Chorus]
Two hearts on the getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singing louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone
But I hear it louder than ever

[Verse 3]
I can't help but turn it up
Oh, it can't get loud enough
Yeah, I just wanna hear it
Over and over
Over and over

[Bridge]
Heard that song on the radio
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real-life time machine

[Chorus]
Two hearts on the getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singing louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone
But I hear it louder than ever
Two hearts on the getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singing louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone
But I hear it louder than ever
