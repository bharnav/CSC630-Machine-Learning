What's the matter with kids today?
Is there something wrong with what they're saying?
No one wants to listen does anyone have time

Everything is veiled in a cheap disguise
Kids are shooting kids on the news today
And if you ask me I'm not surprised
Look what they've created, a monster by the age of five

SAY GOODNIGHT
Poor Johnny, he's crazy
Has problems you can see
Don't worry, be happy
Now tell us what you see
They listen, no problem!
Homegrown from society
JUST LIKE ME!
Are you ready for the fall!
When you're not prepared for the world at all
You thought you had it all

Keep spreading your destiny
And they'll follow your mediocrity
Tell the kids a bedtime story about what life should be
When you embrace life with broken arms
And their truth can't set it free
Brought up with resistance
Condemn the world for being me!

SAY GOODNIGHT
SAY GOODNIGHT
SAY GOODNIGHT
SAY GOODNIGHT

Are you ready for the fall!
When you're not prepared for the world at all
Are you ready for the fall!
When you're not prepared for the world at all
You thought you had it all
