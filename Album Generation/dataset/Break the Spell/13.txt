[Verse 1]
Hard times
Just another let down
White lies tearin' up a small town
What goes around, comes 'round
Lost cause, someone's gotta break through
Coin toss, will give away your next move
So much talkin', backwards walkin'
Is this really what we wanted?
I don't think we'll ever know

[Pre-Chorus]
No use sayin'
Hell we're payin'
Everything we want is fading
Faster than you'll ever know

[Chorus]
Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we're falling
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you calling
So maybe we're already gone
Maybe we're already gone

[Verse 2]
Caught up, temporary meltdown
So what, it doesn't matter right now
Right now, anyhow
What goes around, comes 'round
Out for something, all or nothing
Goes right by us in slow motion
While we let it take control

[Pre-Chorus]
No use sayin'
Hell we're payin'
Everything we want is fading
And all is lost and heaven know

[Chorus]
Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we're falling
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you calling
So maybe we're already gone

[Bridge]
Maybe we're already gone
Yeah, yeah
We'll make it through
Yeah, there's nothing else that we can do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll make it through
Yeah, there's nothing else that we can do

[Chorus]
Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we're falling
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you calling
So maybe we're already gone
Can you see the signs?
Have we lost our minds?
Looks like we've fallen
Feels like we're falling
Down and down we go
Never felt so low
Can't hear you calling
So maybe we're already gone
