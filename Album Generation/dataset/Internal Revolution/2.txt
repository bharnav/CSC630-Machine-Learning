Horrified
By what we've become
Glorifying
All the damage we have done
Our time is running out
Are you the one to change it

Hourglass is running short of sand
The candles burning again

I dont want to live forever
I dont want to live to see this world decay
I dont want to live forever
To be the one to see the end of days

Take a look
The wounds arent healing
You can make all the pain we're feeling fade
To restore all thats gone
To the way it was before
Hourglass is running short of sand
The candles burning
Again am I the only one to understand

I dont want to live forever
I dont want to live to see this world decay
I dont want to live forever
To be the one to see the end of days

And all the endless suffering will always grow and prosper
And all the endless suffering will always grow and prosper

I dont want to live forever and be the one
I dont want to live forever and be the one
