(Intro)
You're gone

(Verse I)
Such a fool
To think that I could go though life alone
A difficult rest decision

I refuse to see
How I needed your help to complete
And reinforce my existence

(Chorus:)
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me beating

You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better

(Verse II)
For searching for another way
To steal a second chance
I pray for absolution (absolution)

Now I know that I'm
Missing your comicality
You're the one that listens (one that listens)

(Chorus:)
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me beating (for me beating)

You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better

(2nd Chorus:)
What's (What's) left to say
Except for you're the reason

Except for you're the reason
You're gone

(Bridge)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing I could say
To bring you back tomorrow (Nothing I could say)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing I could say
To dissipate my sorrow

All I had to
Do was let you
Know

(Chorus:)
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me beating (for me beating)

You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better

To be something better
To be something better (What's left to say?)

To be something better
To be something better (What's left to say?)

To be something better
To be something better (What's left to say?)

You make me feel
Something better
