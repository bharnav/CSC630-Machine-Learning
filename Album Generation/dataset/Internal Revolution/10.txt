Alone again
Haunted by all your shadows
And memories

Coldest rain
Hides emotions that are pouring
From me to you

Crazy again
Forced to face all truth

And exist
And exist

All you had to say
Would you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I'd be gone

The torturing
That I put myself through within
Won't end

Dying within
Cracking up, breaking down
Down to nothing

All you had to say
Would you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I'd be gone

Oh, oh, oh
I carry on alone

Knowing that my dignity is strong
If I catch it all away

You'd still be mine today
But inside I'd be hollow

All you had to say
Would you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I'd be gone

Then you walked away
With nothing more to say
I never felt this helpless

This helplessâ€¦ Before
You couldn't carry on
I guess you had enough

You made your choice
You made your choice
And now you fade away

The coldest rain
Hides emotions that are pouring
From me to you
