[Verse 1]
Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

[Chorus]
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

[Verse 2]
You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

[Chorus]
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

[Verse 3]
Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
