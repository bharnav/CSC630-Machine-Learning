[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will Nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

[Verse 2]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

[Bridge]
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man

[Verse 3]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
