[Verse 1]
Please excuse me but I got to ask
Are you only being nice because you want something?
My fairy tale arrow pierces
Be careful how you respond, 'cause you'd not end up in this song
I never gave you an encouragement
And it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

[Chorus]
The more you try to erase me
The more, the more, the more that I appear
Oh, the more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more, the more that you appear

[Verse 2]
You know all the answers so why do you ask?
I am only being nice because I want someone, something
You're like a kitten with a ball of yarn
And it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

[Chorus]
The more you try to erase me
The more, the more, the more that I appear
Oh, the more, the more
The more I try to erase you
The more, the more, the more that you appear

[Outro]
No, you're wrong, you are wrong
You are wrong, you are wrong
You are wrong, you are wrong
You're wrong
