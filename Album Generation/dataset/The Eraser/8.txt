[Verse 1]
Try to save it but it doesn't come off the rug
Try to build a wall that is high enough
It's all boiling over
All boiling over
Mmm
Mmm
Try to save your house, try to save your songs
Try to run but it follows you up the hill
It's all boiling over
All boiling over
Your loved ones
Your loved ones

[Verse 2]
A normal conversation
A normal conversation
You should have took me out when you had the chance
You should have took me out when you had the chance
All the rooms renumbered
And losers turned away
Don't turn away (You should have took me out when you had the chance)
Don't turn away (You should have took me out when you had the chance)

[Outro]
There were ten in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over
There were ten in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over
