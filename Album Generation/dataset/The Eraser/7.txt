[Verse 1]
Don't walk the plank like I did
You will be dispensed with
When you've become inconvenient
Up on Harrowdown Hill
Near where you used to go to school
That's where I am
That's where I'm lying down
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Did I fall or was I pushed?
And where's the blood?
And where's the blood?

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
So don't ask me
Ask the ministry
Don't ask me
Ask the ministry
We think the same things at the same time
There are so many of us
So you can't count
So you can't count

[Verse 2]
Can you see me when I'm running?
Can you see me when I'm running?
Away from them
Away from them
I can't take their pressure
No one cares if you live or die
They just want me gone
They want me gone

[Chorus]
But I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time
There are too many of us
So you can't
There are too many of us
So you can't count

[Outro]
It was me lead onto the back of Harrowdown Hill
It was me lead onto the back of Harrowdown Hill
It was a slippery, slippery, slippery slope
It was a slippery, slippery, slippery slope
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
