The soldiers will run and the guns they will blow them away
They're choking on sand in some faraway land today

Don't go
Stay at home

Was it you that I saw in the market just losing your way
With your head in your hands and baby just crying away

Don't go
Stay at home

Such a sad sight to see all the sweethearts alone in their rooms
The dancehalls are empty under the summer moon

Don't go
Stay at home

Stay home
