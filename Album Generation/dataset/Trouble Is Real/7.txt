You started over yesterday
In dirty rain the sky was so grey
You listen to the engine sing
And you forget about everything

Let the sun shine
Like it's never shined
Across a blue sky
And watch the time fly

Free all the lonely boys who love no one
And dream on through the years and leave the light on

You never felt a night so cold
Your angry eyes were tightly shut closed
You fell out of love with rock and roll
You shot a hole in your radio

Let the sun shine
Like it's never shined
Across a blue sky
And watch the time fly

Free all the lonely boys who love no one
And dream on through the years and leave the light on

Don't you dream on
