I take the train across town
New York City take me down
Beneath my feet the city street
The dirt the shit and the concrete

Well I'm on my way
Get closer every day
Gonna close my eyes and pray
For salvation day

Another year another war
Something else worth dying for
So spill your blood for the land you love
And bring them fire from above

Well I'm on my way
Get closer every day
Gonna close my eyes and pray
For salvation day

Breathe honey breathe honey breathe
While you still can

Well I'm on my way
Get closer every day
Gonna close my eyes and pray
For salvation day
