Put me in your holy war
I will lay my body down
I will lay my body down
I will run into the flames

Put me in that holy warv We will do most anything
We will ride on angels wings
Like new crowned Christian Kings

All god's children
Got automatic weapons
We're coming after you
We're coming after you
'Cause Jesus loves you too
