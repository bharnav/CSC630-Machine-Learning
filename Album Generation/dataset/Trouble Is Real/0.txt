I walked through walls to be with you
In the early nighttime morning came so soon
And on Thursday night New York glowed
I was in your arms black water flowed

And if you were told
Would you ever know

Do you see me tonight
With the coins on my eyes
Love's sweet surprise
The light upon your face
And all the lovers at war
That roll down the line
Love felt so fine
The light upon your face

And while we lie he is alone
Wide eyed lonely and dreaming of home
There is nothing more that I can say
I Just close my eyes let you carry me away

And if you were told
Would you ever know

Do you see me tonight
With the coins on my eyes
Love's sweet surprise
The light upon your face
And all the lovers at war
That roll down the line
Love felt so fine
The light upon your face

Love is always looking for an open grave
To lay down unfold its arms and die

Do you see me tonight
With the coins on my eyes
Love's sweet surprise
The light upon your face
And all the lovers at war
That roll down the line
Love felt so fine
The light upon your face

Laura has the brightest eyes
Laura has the brightest eyes
