No love
No love
Stop right where you are

Yeah, there's no use pretending
There's nothing left to see
Below, love
Below, love
Our little window
Yeah, there's the sound of shouting
Explosions in the street

So sleep well tonight, my dear
Sleep sound, shut out the noise you hear
You know, it gets harder with each passing year

No love
No love
Stop right where you are

Yeah, there's no use pretending
Yeah, there's nothing left to see

So sleep well tonight, my dear
Sleep sound, shut out the noise you hear
You know, it gets harder with each passing year

City in love
City on fire
City in love
A city on
City in love
City on fire
City in love
A city on
City on fire
I awoke to find the city on fire
I awoke to find the city on fire
I awoke
