Let me carry your bags
Let me lighten your load
Let me mellow your mind as we drive down the road

Oh Lady Memphis let me ride
Your beautiful slide guitar suicide
I'll find you baby don't try to hide
You know love is true and it ain't no lie
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels

Baby take off your clothes
And roll with me
Baby nobody knows
That you're here with me

Oh Lady Memphis let me ride
Your beautiful slide guitar suicide
I'll find you baby don't try to hide
You know love is true and it ain't no lie
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels

Well it's late in the day
You say you got to go home
I'll send you on your way
Leave me on my own

Oh Lady Memphis let me ride
Your beautiful slide guitar suicide
I'll find you baby don't try to hide
You know love is true and it ain't no lie
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
