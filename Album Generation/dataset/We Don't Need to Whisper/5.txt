[Verse 1]
The ocean, is on fire
The sky turned dark again
As the boats came in
And the beaches
Stretched out with soldiers
With their arms and guns
It has just begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe, you want this
Believe, I want this too

[Chorus]
Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over?
Why must this
Tear my head
Inside out?

[Verse 2]
And the houses
Laid out like targets
With the deafening sound
We watched them all go down
And the families
Now useless bodies
They lay still black and blue
A gift from us to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe, you want this?
Believe, do I want this too?

[Chorus]
Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over?
Why must this
Tear my head
Inside out?

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe)
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe, you want this too)
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

[Chorus] x2
Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over?
Why must this
Tear my head
Inside out?

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
