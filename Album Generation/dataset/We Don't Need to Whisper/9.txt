[Verse 1:]
The ash set in then blew away
It’s getting lost into the sea
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had to leave forever
I left the chill and voice of screams and kids and ran for shelter

[Hook:]
You know I won't say sorry
You know I won't say sorry
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
You know what it's like to believe
It makes me wanna scream

[Verse 2:]
I see a glow from far away
A faint reflection on the sea
I left some words quite far from here to be a short reminder
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever

[Hook:]
You know I won't say sorry
You know I won't say sorry
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
You know what it's like to believe
It makes me wanna scream



[Verse 3:]
I see the stars, they’re in your eyes
A playful kiss, can you tell I'm excited?
A fast escape in the nick of time
If you lost your wish, can I help you find it?
I'm on my knee, just one to start
A fresh new start, don't be undecided

[Outro:]
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen
If love’s a word, that you say
Then say it, I will listen (I will listen)
