[Chorus:] x17
It hurts...

[Verse 1:]
Is this what you want?
Cause everybody acts without a clue
Every little kiss and grin you gave
Was just a little bullshit I saw through

[Verse 2:]
The alcohol is scented with your breath
You're always all done up to just be used
I'm waiting for excuses that deceive
I'll meet you in the back to see them through

[Pre-Chorus:]
How did I let her inside?
We're dripping of sweat, I'm feeling alright
Her lips were the last thing touched tonight
Your best friend is not your girlfriend

[Chorus:] x17

[Verse 3:]
Are you out of your mind?
You dug yourself into a liar’s hole
You made a little spark to live inside
It’s now a fucking fire out of control
And when the morning comes you’ll act surprised
And when the word gets out it will get old
And every day you’ll try to live your life
And every little scandal will unfold

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Sherrie, do you want it?
Sherrie, I want it too
Sherrie, do you want it?
Sherrie, I want it too

[Chorus:]

[Outro:] x4
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts)
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) Your best friend is not your girlfriend
