"Good Day"

[Intro:]
(Whispering:)
We don't need to whisper

[Verse 1:]
I should have turned back
I should have known better
Than to walk away defeated
I'll say it tonight, I'll say it forever
And this time I really swear I mean it

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh I need you now
The Earth fell fast asleep
This room is safe and sound
Will you lay here with me
And feel it..

[Chorus:]
I think I like today
I think its good
Its something I can't get my head around

[Verse 2:]
True love is something that comes easy
Just one kiss god I swear I want to...
I heard a pin drop and a nervous heartbeat
Have you ever heard me scream I love you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh I need you now
The Earth fell fast asleep
This room is safe and sound
Will you lay here with me
And feel it..

[Chorus X2:]
I think I like today
I think it's good
Its something I can't get my head around

[Outro X8:]

Dadah da dah dah dadadah

[Chorus X6:]
I think I like today
I think it's good
Its something I can't get my head around
