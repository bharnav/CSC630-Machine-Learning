[Intro]
Oh yea yes
Oh
Can I talk to you
For a minute
There's something on my mind
That I wanna say

[Verse 1]
Oh reality is, takin control of me cause I know, baby
I know that your loving me
Oh loving you boy
I wanna contradict my word
I belong with you, I do truly wanna know (wanna know)

[Hook]
When you hear me talkin, watcha think
When you lookin into my eyes, watcha see
I know you ain't tryna to be my man
Watcha think about us bein friends, makin plans
To be everything we wanna be, makin our dreams turn reality
I'm diggin everything you appear to be
And I'm wonderin if we could be real good good friends

[Verse 2]
So emotional, you know I am
That's why you do me the way you do me, if you be cool wit me
You'll see, that I'm all you need and all that you dream
And never would leave, you'll be right by my side forever
Swear to God we'll grow old together, then reality would be you and me

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
If we could be friends, baby
It be all I need, baby
I'll give you what ever you want and never would leave you a front
And be what you need, baby
Be all I have, baby
And I'd be there for you, and never would front do wat you do

[Hook]

[Outro]
If we could be friends, baby
It be all I need, baby
Oh shuba dub du du du
Be everything you wanna be
Making our dreams turn reality
