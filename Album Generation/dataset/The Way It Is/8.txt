[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Hey, she can't love you like I love you
Started really simple
Coming through causeI missed you
And I couldn't wait to kiss you
I tried to play shy a little
But not trying to move fast but not too slow
Because I know, you're the kind of guy
I see you already got me

[Pre-Hook]
She could never beâ€“oh no
Half as good as me, let me show
You know what I mean
Cause I'm the real thing and I got to have you
Been here by your side
Living for you day and night
Can't understand why you're not my man but
I should be your girl

[Hook]
(oohh uh-oh)
I'm falling in love again
God damn we kissed again
It went a little bit further than
I'm falling, oohh
I thought this boy was just a friend
I need my baby here
Cuz can't nobody love me like he can

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
And now it's late now no talk
Convos on the phone getting sparked
I'm about to jump in my car
And come and see you
No holding back I miss you
I'm letting go tonight
Oh, and baby I need you
And nothing can stop me
We're too close now

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 3: Chink Santana]
Dang shorty I got my mind on my money
And the hood got me tied up
Plus my baby momma keep me fired up
These other broads probably get me wired up
But a fly nigga could see that you a rider
That's how you got me creepin' and crawlin'
Deep into a bawl six in the morning
We in the zone deep then we all in
Trying to get it on then the b*tch keep callin' (I need you)
And she be killing it though, I see you
Trying to fight it but you feelin' me though
Look, I'm feeling you right back
I'm gonna pick you up in the back I know you like that

[Hook]
