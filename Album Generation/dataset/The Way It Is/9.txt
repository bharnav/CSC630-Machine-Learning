[Chorus: 2x]
I want to get you, want to get
Let's go and get down and dirty
Baby play the game, play my way
But either way it's all the same baby

[Verse 1]
You're the type of guy to drive a girl wild
And you're the type of guy to make a girl smile
Boy you've got me tripping deep down inside
And all these feelings for you that I have I can't hide
People say, don't get down with you, but I know how I feel for you
Though I may deny it, I'm digging you and that's how I

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way, they can make me think I should go away
I've been around you baby everyday
And the song I sing
Every word I mean cause I can't stop something sent from above
Baby don't stop your touch, I could never get enough
Sweetie feel me up
With your precious love cause that's how I want to get down

[Chorus: 3x]
