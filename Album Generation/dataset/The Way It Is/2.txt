Every girl's got to go through it
And every man's got to go through it
It's a thing called love
Listen to me now, listen to me
I still remember the day that you said you was a bad boy
Man I should have listened when you said you was a bad boy
You took control of me
I thought you would change for me
Everything different now reminiscing ain't the same boy
How I let you come and hurt me like this boy
I am open now
I want to get away but you are forcing me to stay
Love, I thought you had my back this time
But man I am wrong this time
It's a thing called
(Thought you had my back)
Love, I thought you had my back this time
But man I am wrong this time
It's a thing called love
I loved you for your ways but your ways hurt me bad boy
Hurt me so bad why you want to see me sad boy
I am tired of crying over you but I miss you so much
I don't know what to do
Seems that I gotta move on live life with out you
But every time someone comes around to talk about you
I get feelings inside again
I wanna be right back by your side again
Love, I thought you had my back this time
But man I am wrong this time
It's a thing called
(Thought you had my back)
Love, I thought you had my back this time
But man I am wrong this time
It's a thing called love
You got me yea
You got me
You got me yea
And I don't know what to do
Yea, I thought you had my back
I am so wrong, I am so wrong
[Incomprehensible]
Yea it's all good though
Sometimes in life you know situations come your way
You just gotta make good decisions man
You know, you gotta know your focus in life
(Love, I thought you had my back this time)
And if love is your focus then man pay attention
(But man I am wrong this time)
You got me yea
Love, I thought you had my back this time
But man I am wrong this time
(I am so stuck right here)
