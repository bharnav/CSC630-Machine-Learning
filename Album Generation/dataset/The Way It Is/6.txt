[Intro]
I already heard your side of the story - hear mine
I'm gonna tell you why cause you changed when you got doenananana no you listen

[Verse 1]
I remember like yesterday the very day I met you
You was lookin fly I was acting shy so when you walked on by
I ignored you but then you turned around and asked me my name in an instant
My attitude changed swept me off my feet you were so sweet full of comedy
You amused me gave you my number next day you called asking if you can see me
So I said alright you can stop on by it gave me butterflies
30 minutes knock knock its you I'm glad to see you but I keep my cool from day one
I fell in love with you but now I ask myself who are you

[Chorus:]
You changed
You changed
You got doe and changed
You got doe and you changed baby
You changed it wasn't the same
You got doe and you changed
You got doe and you changed what was I to do

[Verse 2]
You were never there why should I be there
Their know one there to hold me
I am young at heart and age
And these are the days when a girl like me needs loving
Then someone else is getting what he calls his
You wasn't taking care of home
Left me there alone so whats a girl to do
When she's feeling in the mood
We were together but we grew apart
Thinkin with my mind and not my heart
Packed up all my things
Left the engagement ring
Cause from the looks of things
I can't do this live this life that I call my life
And if this is what is like being your wife
I'd rather be your friend then through thick and thin
But now it's the end my suffering

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What was I to do, sit around and wait for you to call
When I wanted to be in your arms missing you every minute
You were gone you were gone to long
Doing who knows what who knows where
You act like you didn't care when I told you
I wouldn't be here, cause you changed

[Chorus]

[Breakdown: 3x]
No it ain't about the cars with rims or the rings
No it ain't about the lies and houses and minks
Perpetrating with the clothes broken promises please
No ain't about the hype that you given to me
No it ain't about it, no it ain't about it, No it ain't about it
