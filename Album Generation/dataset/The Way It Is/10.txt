[Intro]
Yeah superstar, whoa superstar

[Verse 1: Metro City]
Rollin with my window dropped
Wind blowing, about 6 o clock
Then this feeling came over me
Got to find myself a pretty young thing
So I took a left on the next block
Saw this shorty so I had to stop
Girl was looking as fine as could be yeah
I said do you want to ride with me

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
Your car is looking real smooth
And you looking kind of cute too
But boy I don't even know you
Where the hell you think we going to?

[Metro City]
Girlfriend had a little spark
So I parked the car and just walked
I don't mean no disrespect love
I'm just trying to see what you're made of

[Hook: Keyshia Cole & Metro City]
Superstar, face from a movie screen
Superstar, like the cover of a magazine
No matter what you do, you'll always be my superstar
Superstar, I'm your number one fan by far, superstar

[Verse 3: Keyshia Cole]
Baby boy, listen to me now
It's time you let me break it down
I just reminisced on how we met
And this is something I would never forget
From the moment your lips said hi
It's like I pictured your name in lights
I bought tickets to all your shows
And I'm going to be there sitting in the front row

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook: Metro City]
Mon Cheri don't you worry about a thing
I know you're feeling sexy
I want you to know, you'll always be my superstar

[Hook: 2x]
