People talking 'bout how you runnin' 'round
Wylin' up, how you been livin' life
Said you steppin' out
I tell you, I just can't complain
Got me feeling good, girl you feed me good
They've got you misunderstood
I'm wishin' they wouldn't try and mess up everything

[Hook]
See the writing on the wall
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna listen no, no
People talking everywhere
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, but I hear...

They call you Hollywood, Mrs. Hollywood
Tarnish your name and drag it out through the hood
I don't wanna go, traveling down this dusty road
Mind your business, if she ain't or if she is, I don't wanna know
I'm gonna keep holding on

[Hook]
See the writing on the wall
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna listen no, no
People talking everywhere
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, oh but I hear

Everything
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright...
I don't wanna hear that
It's my life, it's my life...
And I'm grown
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright baby
It's my life...
Cause I'm grown

Writings on the wall
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna hear nothing, nothing, nothing from no one
People talking everywhere
People keep talking
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen, I don't wanna hear a thing no

See the writing on the wall
I'm too afraid to call, I don't wanna listen
I don't wanna hear it, it, it
People talking everywhere
When the smoke begin to clear
I don't wanna listen

I don't wanna listen
To nothing from no one
