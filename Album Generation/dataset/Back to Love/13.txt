Follow follow follow

Follow follow me I wanna play inside
Catch a game of love and let this go go high
We can do whatever let the time go by
As long as we're together

Sit in the room
Focus on you
Beautiful you
Show me your eyes
Heavenly eyes
Let's share our hearts tonight

[Chorus]
I'm ready to be with you
I'm ready to follow you
I'm ready we can do whatever
Whatever you wanna do
Whatever I do it for you
I'm ready let's follow our hearts tonight

Open open let's go take a chance on love
Follow in these footsteps like a child of love
It's alright the heavens open up for us
It's what wonderful means

Sit in the room
Focus on you
Beautiful you
Hand in hand
The harder than hard
With all of my heart

[Chorus]
Follow our hearts tonight
Oh oh oh
Love's alright alright alright
Love's alright alright

I'm ready to be with you
I'm ready follow you
I'm ready we can do whatever
Whatever wanna do
Whatever do it for you
I'm ready we can do whatever
I'm ready follow you
I'm ready to follow you
I'm ready to love you
Whatever wanna do
Whatever all that you wanna do
I'm ready I'm ready baby oh

Oh I'll I'll go for you
Follow follow follow
Forever
