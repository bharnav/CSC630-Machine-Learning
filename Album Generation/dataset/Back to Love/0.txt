Here we are in the storm of our life
Both posing the strangers who never fell in love
Knowin' damn well it's a shame, so this evening
I just want us back the way we were
We lost it all in the blink of an eye
We stopped sayin' I love you, spendin' quality time
Lord help us help us, we're runnin' out of seasons, uuh

How we gonna get us back to love
Get on back to lovin' baby
How we gonna get us back to love
Uh how we gonna
I want you to want me
I want you to love me
I want us, to fall in love again
Fall in love again

Here we are on the ride of our life
Goin' our separate directions, holding no end in sight
No idea when we lost sight of the (?)
Our love compass ain't dead, we put no effort in it
And we chose to play it on
Knowin' everyone sees there's a hole in our hearts
And Lord help us help us, make it easy
We're runnin' out of seasons, hey

How we gonna get us back to love
How we gonna get us back to love
How we gonna get us back to love
Hey baby baby baby
I want you to want me
I want you to love me
I want us, to fall in love again
To fall in love again
To fall in love again
