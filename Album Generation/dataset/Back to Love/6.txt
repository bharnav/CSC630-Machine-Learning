[Verse 1]
I'm mad at the way she loves me
And I'm mad at the way she cares
I'm mad at the way she touch me
At the way that she comb her hair
[Chorus]
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't care
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't love her
I'm still here, I'm still here
[Verse 2]
I'm mad at the way she loves me
I'm mad at the time we spent
I'm mad about our conversation
Damn, I'm mad about everything
[Chorus]
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't care
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'm still here, I'm still here
[Verse 3]
And I'm made about the way she loves me
And I'm mad at my next of kin
And I'm mad about the Sunday dinners
And I'm mad that they count me in
[Chorus]
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't care
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't love her
I'm still here, I'm still here
[Bridge]
I ain't never gonna leave
I'm still here
[Chorus]
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't care
I'd be lying, if I said it didn't mean a thing
I'm still here
