[Verse 1]
It's simple, I love it
Having you near me, having you here
Our conversations, outrageous
You smile, and I smile then I say
Oooh, this is getting personal, personal, personal
Let's stay for a while and play
Girl let's make this a moment, oh

[Hook]
Giving you the best of me
Amazing, amazing, oh
Having you close to me
Amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me

[Verse 2]
Good morning, here's breakfast
Lost track of time but, we had a ball
Let's catch a movie, then dinner
Tonight's the night we'll
Just unwind, and stay, hey
Let's stay personal, personal, personal
Let's stay for a while and play
Such a beautiful moment

[Hook]
Giving you the best of me
Amazing, amazing, oh
Having you close to me
Amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me

Giving you the best of me
Amazing, amazing, oh
Having you close to me
Amazing, outrageous
Give your best to me
