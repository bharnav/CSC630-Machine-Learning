I saw you on the town, looking all night
Had to come talk to you
Are you from around, or in for the night
Tell me who's keeping you?
I see it and I want it
Trying to get to know you
I'm taking a chance, a hell of a chance
Cause I want you

I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
I got something to prove, so much to do
I'm a sucka for you, I'm a sucka for you
I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
Got me breaking the rules, so much to prove
I'm a sucka for you

Is honey your name, oh you look sweet
What kind of things you like?
Do you like to dance or wine and cheese
I'm just your type
I see it and I want it
Let me into your life
Tonight is the night, let's get it right
Cause I want you

I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
I got something to prove, so much to do
I'm a sucka for you, I'm a sucka for you
I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
Got me breaking the rules, so much to prove
I'm a sucka for you

Every time I see you I wonder, what we could be, yeah
I can tell my heart to wait till morning, naturally

I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
I got something to prove, so much to do
I'm a sucka for you

I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
I got something to prove, so much to do
I'm a sucka for you, I'm a sucka for you
I ain't too proud to care, I ain't too tired to stay up all night
Got me breaking the rules, so much to prove
I'm a sucka for you

I'm a sucka for you, I'm a sucka for you
I know that
You see me watchin', you see me talkin'
I need you baby
I can't get enough of you lady
