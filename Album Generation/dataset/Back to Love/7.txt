I wait for you to fall in love
I hold myself for you
You know I will baby
Along the way I try my hand in love
In hope (?) that unity
The one that is magical (?) movie
We belong in love
As a (?) I give to stay
I wait for you to fall in love
I wait I wait
I hold myself for you
I try to set around before
I try I try
But ain't no other loving... about you
But once I can open my heart and show my feelings
Make me (?) give a life time baby
Cause there is no woman out there who can do
I wait for you to fall in love
I hold myself for you
I try to set around before
There is no other love than you
All the love I wait love I gave
Love don't (?) make me feel like you do my baby
I wait for you to fall in love
I hold myself for you
I try to set around before
There is no other love than you
I wait for you to fall in love
I hold myself for you
I try to set around before
There is no other love than you
