She was just a teenager living in a grown woman's world
Reading in her school books, had herself a little baby girl
Did it all with no father, left there to care on her own
Got caught up in the street life, damn near lost her soul

Oh baby girl, this is for you
Oh baby girl, this love is for you
Ohh baby girl, this is for you
Don't ever give up, things are getting better, yeah

Doing with a broken home, got tired of being all alone
Caught up in a strip club, just to have somewhere to go
And money start coming in need managed to get herself a home
Now she's back in school and she's moving right along

Oh baby girl, this is for you
Oh baby girl, this love is for you
Ohh baby girl, this is for you
Don't ever give up, things are getting better, yeah
Ooh

Ooh, this love is for you
Oh baby girl, this love is for you
Ohh baby girl, this love is for you
Don't ever give up... things are getting better now
Oh baby girl, right when you talk...
I'm turning round, not to many people will be
Put on the table... Oh baby girl, you looking good now...
