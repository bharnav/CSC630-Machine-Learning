[Verse 1]
I always thought that I'd move further from
Further and further and further and even further from
The very people closest to me
I see these in daydreams

[Verse 2]
And like so many other things
It happened
Slowly happened, slowly happened
And without notice I've become someone who's out of reach
I'm as much to blame

[Verse 3]
But I don't want to sound as though I'm wishing
Always wanting, always hoping
I had not made the choices I have made
Because what's in that?
One is gained, one lost

[Verse 4]
And still to say I've made grave mistakes
And every upon every upon every
I think about and hope it's all worked out to either end
What acts, what cost

[Bridge] (x4)
Cannot be destroyed with a friend's ring at the side
Don't break ties that hold them round the ring

[Outro] (x10)
Don't break
