[Verse]
So they say practice makes you perfect
So they say you can't teach an old dog
So they say have an apple a day
So they say better safe than sorry

[Interlude]
Everyone knows what they say

[Chorus]
And when I slow it down
It's clear just how
It's what they don't say
That's what counts

Deep down (what counts)
Step up, step off

[Verse]
So they say practice makes you perfect
So they say you can't teach an old dog
So they say have an apple a day
So they say better safe than sorry

[Interlude]
Everyone knows what they say

[Chorus]
And when I slow it down
It's clear just how
It's what they don't say
That's what counts

[Outro]
It's counting
And be sure it counts
