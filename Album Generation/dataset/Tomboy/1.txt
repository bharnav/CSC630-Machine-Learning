[Verse]
Take my life
What's my life like?
What's my work like?
How do I pass time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Open my eyes so I might see mine
So I'll be with mine

[Chorus]
No matter what it takes
Take my life so high
Take my life so high
Take my life so high
Keep my life light

[Verse]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
