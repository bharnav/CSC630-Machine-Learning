[Intro]
[Talking]
Yo heh heh tell him it's like uhh you know uhh
[Singing]
Sweet sweet tell him

[Verse 1]
Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and tell him

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love, then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect, and not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end
And tell him

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

[Bridge]
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him, tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 3]
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
