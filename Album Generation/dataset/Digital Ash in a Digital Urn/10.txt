I wish I had a parachute
'Cause I'm fallin' mad for you
I can see the ground approachin' now
But I'm not sure what to do

I feel like the pinata
Once you take a swing at me
If you could just crack the shell open
I think inside you would find something sweet

And I hear you're like a hunter now
Your footsteps in the leaves
And I would gladly leave my hidin' place
I'm hopin' to be seen

So let your arrow fly and sing
I'm well within your aim
Lay your traps for a thousand miles
Please don't let me escape

Winter came to Omaha
It left us looking like a bride
A million perfect snowflakes now
And no two are alike

So it's hard for me imagining
The flaws in this design
I know debris, it covers everything
But still I am in love with this life
