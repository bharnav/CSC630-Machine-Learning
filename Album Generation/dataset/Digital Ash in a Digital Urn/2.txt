You can make a plan
Carve it into stone
Like a feather falling
That is still unknown
Until the clock speaks up
Says it's time to go
You can choose the high
Or the lower road

You might clench your fist
You might fork your tongue
As you curse or praise
All the things you've done
And the faders move
And the music dies
As we pass over
On the arc of time

So you'll nurse your love
Like a wounded dove
In the covered cage of night
Every star is crossed
By phrenetic thoughts
They separate and then collide

And they twist like sheets
‘til you fall asleep
And they finally unwind
It's a black balloon
It's a dream you'll soon deny

I hear if you make friends
With Jesus Christ
You'll get right up
From that chalk outline
And then you'll get dolled up
And you'll dress in white
All to take your place
In his chorus line

And then in you'll come
With those marching drums
In a saintly compromise
No more whiskey slurs
No more blonde hair girls
For your whole eternal life

And you'll do the dance
That was choreographed
At the very dawn of time
Singing "I told you son
The day would come
You would die, you die, you die, you die…
You would die, you die, you die, you die…
You would die, you die, you die, you die…
You would die, you die, you die

To the deepest part
Of the human heart
The fear of death expands
‘til we crack the code
We've always known
But could never understand

On a circuit board
We'll soon be born
Again, again, again, again…
And again, again, again, again…
And again, again, again, again…
And again, again, again
