I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Covered yourself up in snow
Baby, tell me where'd you go for days and days
Did they make you stay up all night?
Did they paint your face that pasty white?
You're thirsty but your appetite gets chased away

The sun turns us to stone
It's a cloudy day
But we still can't go
Up and out that cellar door
Till we see the moon
We're invisible

No one ever takes the garbage out
A neighbor kid gets dared to touch the house
He runs back only to announce there's no one home
As we paint the foil with the flame
Smear the soda, taste butane
For every fear that can't be named to calm you down

Your heart starts skipping steps
So you're farther gone
Than you might expect
If your thoughts should turn to death
Got to stomp them out
Like a cigarette

I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Covered yourself up in snow
Baby, tell me where'd you go
For days and days and days
Days and days and days and days
Days and days and days and days
Days and days and days and days
