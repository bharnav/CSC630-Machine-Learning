[Intro]
New Orleans!
What the fuck's up?
Come on!
There we go!
There we fucking go!
Woo!
Let's go! Alright!
Here we go!
I wanna see those fucking hands in the air!
Alright, 1, 2, 3, 4!

[Chorus]
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar

[Verse]
Enemies on your knees
Suffer please
Enemies carry the M16

[Chorus]
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar

[Verse]
If you've seen what I've seen
Bury me
Burn the trees, baby please
Finish me

[Chorus]
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
