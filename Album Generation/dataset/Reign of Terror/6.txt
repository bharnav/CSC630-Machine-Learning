[Verse 1]
You drink the wise blood
You're gonna hear about it
You'll be taken down brick by brick by brick
Burn the orphanage
You're gonna pay for it
They will purify block by block by block

[Chorus]
Demons
Come on
You've got a vision
You're on a mission
Demons
Live on
And when I die, hang me high

[Verse 2]
They're gonna bury you
They're gonna finish
They're gonna stand em up six by six by six
You pull the hood back
I wanna know
Which way will the heavenly go

[Bridge]
Take it down, take it down, take it down
Take it down, take it down, take it down
Take it down, take it down, take it down
Take it down, take it down, take it down

[Chorus]
Demons
Come on
You've got a vision
You're on a mission
Demons
Live on
And when I die, hang me high
Demons
Come on
You've got a vision
You're on a mission
Demons
Live on
And when I die, hang me high

[Outro]
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
And you will answer to no one else but me
