[Intro]
Told me, darling, that you had to go
Done take your money, I don't care no more
I know you're happy, try to get along

[Chorus]
Money won't change you[x3]
But time will take you on
Lookie here

[Verse 1]
If everybody had once been hurt
Then you know how it mean to be treated like dirt
Go ahead, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman and my only girl

[Chorus]
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
I said, "Money won't change you
But time will take you on"

[Bridge]
I [?] you're happy
[?] know you're happy
And now you're gone

[Chorus]
Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
Money won't change you
I said, "Money won't change you
But time will take you on"

[Verse 2]
Lookie here, lookie here
Look here
I said, "One time, one time"
Oh, yeah, hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold it, slow it down, hold on

[Bridge]
Get it, get it, get it, get it[x3]
Get it, get it
Get on up, get on up[x2]
Come on, baby[x2]

[Outro]
Everybody stand up[x2]
Raise your hands[x2]
