[Verse 1]
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me

[Chorus]
I know it's true, I love you
I found someone to love me

[Verse 2]
Do you need someone to love you?
Do you need someone to love you?
Do you need someone to love you?
Do you need someone to love you?

[Chorus]
I know it's true, I love you
I found someone to love me

(I know it's true)
(I know it's true)

[Verse 3]
I found someone who wanna believe in me
I found someone who wanna believe in me
I found someone who wanna believe in me
I found someone who wanna believe in me

[Chorus]
I know it's true, I love you
I found someone to love me

[Fade Out]
(I know it's true)
(I know it's true)
(I know it's true)
(I know it's true)
