When you and your baby are tight
And everything you say or do is mellow
She keeps everything all right
And you know that you're the only fellow
Ain't that a groove, ain't that a groove
Ain't that groove, ain't that a groove

Now look here fellows
Girls like to be in a mood
Whenever they think their man is yellow
Hit me band You fight real hard
To make things right'cause he's the only fellow
Now ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove do you hear me people
Ain't that a groove, ain't the a groove

Look you here I want to know do you love me, yes I love you
One more time, do you love me, yes I really, really do

Do you love me baby, yes I love you
I just gone, gotta . . . know

Hit me band
One more again

Look you here
I got to tell you, dig this
This will kill you
A little piece of money and plenty of love
Will keep everything together, come on band
Well forget about the money
Plenty of love and ain't that mellow
Now ain't that a groove, it's go groovy
Ain't that a groove, it's so groovy
Ain't that a groove, it's so groovy
Ain't that a groove

Look here, I'm not gonna talk all day
But 1, I wanted to get the feeling
One more time
Hit me band, listen to that band
I want to ask them
Do you love me, yes I love you

Do you love me baby, yes I love you
Do you love me, yes I love you
I just gotta, gotta .... know
Hey ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove let me count
One for the meney, two for the show
Ain't that a groove now here we go
Goin'on, and one more thing
I want to say, this is better than cushions
Christmas only comes once a year
And this is all year bound
People can, I'm livin'
Let me out, I'm gone, yeah I'm going back
