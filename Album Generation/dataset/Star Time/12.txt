I've got money
And now I need love
I've got money
And now I need love
When I get my lovin'
I'll be the happy one

I've got money
No more money I need
Woah, I've got money
No more money I need
Hey, I don't have to worry
I don't have to let my heart leave

Hey, come on now
I need your love now
I need your love real fast
You're the best thing I ever had
Ohh yeah

I've got money now
No more money I want
Ohhh, but love, don't leave me don't
When I get my lovin'
I'll be the happy one

Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need your love so bad
I need your love so bad
Turn your love-light on me
And ease my misery

Hey
I believe I'll sing the blues one more time
I believe I'll blow it one more again
I've got to try it one more time
I'm going insane

Hey come on
Ohhh yeah
I got to sing the blues
The best thing I ever had
I need your love so bad
Ohhh
Ohhh
Tell the truth
Tell the truth now, the truth
I gotta sing the blues for you
Goodbye, so long
That's all, I'm gone
Ahhhh
