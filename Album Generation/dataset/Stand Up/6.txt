[Chorus]
Everybody wake up
If you're living with your eyes closed
See the man with the bomb in his hand
Everybody wake up

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby it's not easy sometimes
We make these walls ever higher and hide behind them
Seems an odd way to try to make things right
Oh, I feel like I'm crazy sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
And our finest hour arrives
See the pig dressed in his finest fine
And believers stand behind him and smile

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Remember the words of the misguided fool
Do unto others as you'd have them do
Not an eye for an eye as the golden rule
It just leaves a room full of blind men

[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody wake up[x4]

[Chorus][x2]
