[Pre-Chorus]
Last night, no way
I was going to be left hungry
But then your daddy caught me sneaking out your bed
It's just a game I play
It's just I roll that way
Don't think, sweet baby
I'm messing with your head

[Chorus 1]
I'm a smooth rider, baby
You know I just keep moving on
Don't know why I like to carry on the way I do
It's just that I'm in love with you

[Chorus 2]
If see me out there running
And you hear the sheriff's coming
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand
If you know they're coming for me
And you know they're running for me
You know my love won't let them keep me away

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
