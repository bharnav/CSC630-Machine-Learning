Out on my window ledge
I don't feel safe
But I stay looking down on you

It's out of my hands for now
It's out of my hands for now

I can't just walk away
Be nice to walk away
But I don't feel safe
Get away
All the way up here

It's out of my hands for now
It's out of my hands for now

Oh, it is
Down from here
Down from here
Start to feel insane, betrayed
Out on my window ledge

Now our finest hour arrives
See the pig dressed in his finest vine
And all the believers stand behind him and smile
As the day lights up with fire

Let me in
Let me in
I stop to feel like crazy, betrayed
Out on my window ledge

Now our finest hour arrives
See the pig dressed in his finest vine
And all the believers stand behind him and smile
As the day lights up with fire

Looking down from here
It's out of my hands for now
Out on my window ledge
It's out of my hands for now

So let me in
Let me in
