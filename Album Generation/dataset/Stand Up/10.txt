[Verse 1]
Hello again
Seem like forever between now and then
You look the same
I mean you look different but you haven't changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny to think how the time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again

[Chorus]
Stole me away
First time I saw you, you did me that way
What should I say?
I saw you laughing and I was afraid
I might get in the way

[Verse 2]
I did not think I would see you again
So how have you been?
Do you remember... and how's everything?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Never thought I would see you again
How have you been?
(Been) watching the years as they trickle away
It's everything, how time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again
Steal me away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I never thought I would see you again
How have you been?
Do you remember I mean everything?

[Chorus]
