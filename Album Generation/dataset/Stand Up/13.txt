[Chorus 1]
Oh great light of love[x4]

[Verse 1]
Here you go, you dirty girl
Good God, try to love, try to ah
God's love is alive inside you
You know who needs you

[Chorus 2]
I want to be your only
I want to see you open wide
And when I go down for you
I want to blow your mind
It's my aim to kill you
My aim to love you

[Verse 2]
You and I is such a pretty thing
Smile smile you know thrill me
Cross your heart and hope to die
You know I'd love to

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Youth comes like an answered prayer
Praise God
Try to love, try to ah
I have the littlest delight
Ooh, oh, I love you

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You, you[x3]
