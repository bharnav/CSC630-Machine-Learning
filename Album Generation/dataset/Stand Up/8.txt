[Verse 1]
Said I've done my share of this
Still hope the Lord forgive me my sin
Ten years ago down by the lake
I sunk my sweet love, her watery grave
I close my eyes and still see her face
I'd give my soul to take back that day

[Chorus 1]
Hello again
It's been too long
Too long, too long
Hello again
You know you got what it is I want
Anyway, I'm going take it from you
Hello, you know you got what it is I want
Anyway I know I'm going take it from you
Hello, hello
You know
Hello again

[Chorus 2]
Still I make my way there
Over and over
I'm gonna see her face
Blown away on that day
Yes I am

[Verse 2]
I'm not worth the flesh on my bones
I am a waste of the air in my lungs
Run far from me, go and be saved
The Devil, not God, runs through my veins

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Said I've done my share of this
Still hope the Lord forgive me my sins

[Chorus 1]
