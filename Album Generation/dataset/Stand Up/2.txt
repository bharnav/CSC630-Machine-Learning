[Chorus 1]
Stand up[x4]

[Verse 1]
I woke up to the angels
Singing in my head
They looked so good naked next to me
An angel in my bed

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I feel like a drug
Is cooking in my veins
I'm so out of my mind
Gonna shoot you up again

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Let the water save me soul

[Verse 3]
Smell like smoke and fire
Is burning in us all
You drop me in the water
Lift me up and save my soul

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
