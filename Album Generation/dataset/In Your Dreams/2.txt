Every night you
You tell me everything
Is gonna be fine
You calm my nerves when
You hold my hands
Yea, it feels so fine

I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams

Every night you
You love to hear me sing
It's gonna be fine
You calm my fear down
It's not a problem
No need to cry

I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams

Are all those tears necessary
For all that pain that you carry
You just send those tears away
Come in and out of the darkness
It's a beautiful day

I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams

I'm wishing your wish
I'm wishing my wish
Is gonna come true
I'm just a dreamer
A storyteller
It's all about you

I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams

Ooh, in your dreams
Aah, in your dreams
