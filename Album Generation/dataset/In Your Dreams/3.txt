In the beginning she was stunning and pure
When he first saw her he fainted to the floor
She was distant and arrogant from the start
She did not see the fragile state of his heart
She fell in love with him on that very day
She became softer in every way

Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love

So paradise found was not paradise to him
Oh yes he loved her
But he was still an Englishman
Tropical birds and the heat and the ocean
Only drove him crazy
Drove her away from him

Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love

She burned his house down saying
You may have forgotten me
But you'll remember this
You fell to the ground when you saw this
My face, my eyes, my lips
You may have forgotten me
But you'll never forget that kiss

Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love

When that big house burned down all around her
In the smoke and the fire
In the devastation they never found her
She went back into her red dress
Back to her white house to her ocean
And after that no words were spoken
About the two of them ever again

Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love

In the beginning
She was stunning, and pure
In the smoke and the fire
Well they never found her
She went back into her ocean
Back to her white house

For awhile they were so in love
For awhile they were so in love
She burned his house down

My face
My eyes
My lips
You may have forgotten that
You may have forgotten that
You may have forgotten that
But you'll never forget that kiss
