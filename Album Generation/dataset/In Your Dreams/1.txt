I got to sing, I got to dance
I got to be a part of a great romance
Still forbidden
Still outrageous
Only a few around us knew
But no one said a word
It was contagious

Looked out the windows
We watched the cars fly by
I look at you and I start to cry
What you did was…
You saved my life
I won’t forget it

You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth

I got to love, I rode the rails
You came with me because you cared
I was broken, I was scared
You held my hands and took away my fear
We knew it couldn’t last
And that was hard

We looked out the windows
We watched the cars fly by
I look at you and I start to cry
What you did was…
You saved my life
I won’t forget it

You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth

I got to sing, I got to dance
I got to be a part of a great romance
Still forbidden
Still outrageous
Only a few around us knew
But no one said a word
It was contagious

We looked out the windows
We watched the cars fly by
I look at you and I start to cry
What you did was…
Well you saved my life
I won’t forget it

You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth

For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
