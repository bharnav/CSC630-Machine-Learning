What's cheaper than free
You and me
What's better than alone
Going home
What does money not buy
You and I
What's not to feel
When love is real

What's faster than a fast car
A beating heart
What's deeper than a deep well
The love into which I fell
More important than freedom
Being needed
More exciting than high fashion
High passion

What's brighter than a smile
You child
You child
What's brighter than a smile
You child
You child

You child
You child

What's warmer than a sun drenched land your hand
Your hand
Your hand
