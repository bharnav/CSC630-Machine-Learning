In the city of dreams
Lies the city's ghost
There's a beginning
There's a middle and an end in this city
We reach out for the middle ground
We throw a great party
So hearts will start to mend
We forgiveâ€¦ at least we try

In the midst of the sea of dreams
Lies a perfect storm
In the sea of tears
Lies a city ghost
In the spirit of the Mardi Gras
Well, the people hope
That their lives will get better
The people hope
That their lives will get better

I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
And go down Bourbon Street

I see a sea of smiles
I see a haunted city reachin' out
I see hope in all their faces
Behind the mask of Mardi Gras
Where the good and the righteous walk
And the wicked as well

I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by the vampires

I wanna dress up, ooh yea
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
And go down Bourbon Street
Mmmm, go on down Bourbon Street

Within these rooms
I go up to my balcony
And I hang the paintings on the wall
And I open up my gallery
And I open up my doors
I stare at the city
I stare at my city

I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by the vampires

I wanna get back to New Orleans
I wanna sing out in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
Go down Bourbon Street
Go down Bourbon Street
Go on down Bourbon Street
Go on down Bourbon Street
Go on down
Go on down
Go on down
Go on down Bourbon Street

In the city of tears
Lies the city ghost
