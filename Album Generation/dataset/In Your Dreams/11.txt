The rose stood out
Red against the golden wall
The sun comes through the silken drapes
The room begins to glow
All in cream-colored ivories
And soft yellows
You say hello
Put down that guitar and handed me a rose

At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls

The sun fades out
And the mountains grow tall
The mists rush in and they take it all
From the islands you see
Li Galli and Capri
I remember it all
Love was everywhere
You just had to fall

At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls

At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls

The sun fades out
And the mountains grow tall
Then the mists rush in
And they take it all
From the islands you see
Li Galli and Capri
I remember it all
You just had to fall
