I am a soldier's angel
Through the eyes of a soldier
Through the eyes of a soldier
I am a soldier's mother
Through the eyes of an angel
I am a soldier myself
And no one walks away
From this battle

I'm a soldier myself
In the presence of angels
I am a soldier's widow
In the background at night
I am a ghostly shadow
As I follow close behind them
I try to push them gently
Back into the light

I am a soldier's angel
Four years later
In a war of words between worlds
Mmmmm
About what is wrong
About what is righteous
I am a soldier's girl

I am a soldier's memory
As I write down these words
I try to write their stories
And explain them to the world
I float through the halls of the hospitals
I am a soldier's nurse
I keep the tears inside
And put them down in verse

I am a soldier's angel
Four years later
In a war of words between worlds
Mmmmm
About what is wrong
About what is righteous
I am a soldier's girl

I am a soldier's girlfriend
As I look upon their faces
They make me remember my first love
And going out to dances
They make me remember Camelot
And being young
And taking chances They make me fall in love again
They give me all the answers

I am a soldier's angel
Four years later
In a war of words between worlds
Mmmmm
About what is wrong
About what is righteous
I am a soldier's girl

I'm a soldier in their army
They are the soldiers of my heart
I try to make them smile again
Though it tears me apart
Their bravery leaves me spellbound
I…try to be a small part
Of bringing them back again
They are the soldiers of my heart

I am a soldier's angel
Four years later
In a war of words between worlds
Mmmmm
About what is wrong
About what is righteous
I am a soldier's girl

I'm a soldier's angel
Through the eyes of a soldier
Through the eyes of a soldier
I'm a soldier's mother
Through the eyes of an angel
I'm a soldier myself
No one walks away
From this…battle
