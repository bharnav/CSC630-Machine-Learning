What happened to her
I thought she was here
Through the eyes of love
I saw her through her tears
I saw her smile
I saw her move on
Like a ghost through the fog
The ghost is gone

What happened to them
I thought it was here
Through the eyes of a child
After all these years
He wasn't true
He wasn't clear
Oh no not even to his song

The ghosts are gone
Gone are the ghosts
Now forgotten
Yea...
Gone is the lost world
It's easy to change
Gone are the lost girls
Gone are the lost girls
The girls went home

What happened to them
They opened their doors
They walked right through
They knew it was wrong
Wrong to be swept away
To think they belonged
Now there's only sadness
The boys are gone

Gone are the ghosts
Gone is the lost world. Yea
You're too crazy to change
But never forgotten
Gone are the lost girls
Gone are the lost girls
Gone...
The girls went home

What happened to him
I thought he was here
Through the eyes of love
I saw him through his tears
I saw him smile
I saw him move on
Like a ghost through the fog
A ghost through the fog
Close to the fog
The ghosts are gone

I saw him smile
I saw him move on
Like a ghost through the fog
And the ghost is gone
What happened to him
I thought he was here
Through the eyes of a child
I saw him disappear

He wasn't clear
Not even to his song
The ghost is gone
The ghosts are gone

Ghost thru the fog
Like a silver shadow gone wrong
Like a ghostly whisper she's gone
Like a silvery rainbow
Like a ghost through the fog
Like a ghost through the fog
Like a golden rainbow
Like a golden rainbow
Like a song
Like a ghostly whisper gone wrong
Like a silvery rainbow
Goin' down
Goin' down
