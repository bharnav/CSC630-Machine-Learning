You may be the one
But you'll never be the one
You think you'll understand
But you don't understand
You may be my love
But you'll never be my love
You may take my hand
You who demands so much

And then there was the kiss
Right out there in the universe
How did that happen
No, it could not have been worse
You forgot yourself
It could not have been worse
You broke my heart
You broke my heart

I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child

You may have the question
But you'll never answer to me
You may have the goodness somewhere
But you'll never let me see
You may be the righteous one
But it won't be right for me
How it's lasted so long
It's a mystery to me

I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child

You may cry the tears
But the tears aren't really for me
You say it's taken years
Years of regret and pain
Forget me not
He says I'm so afraid
He says there's no fear in your eyes
Tell me another lie

I hear the islands calling
I hear angry words
Flying across the ocean
Like some sea birds
Never stopping
I feel my blood racing
I can't believe what you are saying
I used to love you so much

I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel

I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child

And we were magic
