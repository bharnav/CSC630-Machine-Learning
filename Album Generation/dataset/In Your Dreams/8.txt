She was so enticed
By his smile
She was so unaffected
By his dream
For his dream of her
Was just not possible
She was so not that girl

It was just one of those things
That happened or didn't happen
A strand of golden hair tangled
Like the words of a song
Like a spider's web
And then he said

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one

She was so enchanted by his voice
She was so shaken by his words
His plan for her...
Was just not possible
She had no words...

Ooh it isn't just that
We cause each other such pain
Everywhere we go now
At home or on stage
Sometimes it was heavenly
Sometimes it was too heavy
I looked the other way

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one

Don't come here again
Unless fear of fire leaves you cold
And the cold makes you tired
If you feel it all
It's all about desire
About when you were true
About a bird on a wire
And that was you

She does still hear him
All night long
The same song over and over
It heals her heart
No voice of a stranger
Could play that part
It broke her heart
Broke her heart

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one
