Well, beggars can't be choosers
But winners can be losers
Now you’re all dressed up
With nowhere to go
Just let the good times roll
As the night unfolds
You're like a loaded gun
You're on the run

You are all alone
And there’s no more bets
You're in the danger zone
This is russian roulette
Eye for an eye
Life on the street
I've got some humble pie
For you to eat

Try it again
It's no sweat
Try it my friend
It's russian roulette
It's russian roulette

I can see you laughing now
But you'll cry much later
Cause I hold the power
Of your fate
The bullet is in the chamber
But now you are feeling strange
You can't be very wise
Cause this is suicide

You are all alone
And there’s no more bets
You’re in the danger zone
This is russian roulette
Eye for an eye
Life on the street
I've got some humble pie
For you to eat

Try it again
It’s no sweat
Try it my friend
It's russian roulette
It's russian roulette
