Crowded mind working overtime
In a shrinking, stinking shrine
A presence arrives just out of sight
Hides in the maze, collects all mistakes

White noise withering weed of deeds
Worshipping wild filth in the temple of guilt
Filing its womb with pleasure and doom

Monstrous urban paranoia
Sweeping over my minefield mind
Trigging random horrors
Cause and effect is a bittersweet sect
And I'm a priest of loons, carrier of wounds
A battle-fatigued random seed
Placed on this earth and fucked up from birth
I say, who?.. Who gives a flying shit anyway?
Come on conquest at those, what do you say?

In a room without view I, cold-sweating and drew
My theories of everything and anything would do
Reading the mind of mankind's daemon
Pushing the line forward all the time
A deep-space satellite on light-speed depressed
Torn and obsessed by a lifetime of jests
