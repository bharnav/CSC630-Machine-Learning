[Chorus: Danny]
Lights out, you're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, can you feel it now?
We're calling you out, who the fuck are you now?

[Verse 1: J-Dog]
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless
Checked in the real world that don't ask questions
Dodging 'em bullets like a fucked up western
Drag you on a rope till you're choked out senseless
Kings are crowned, we're the best around
Got an underground army, yeah, we holding it down
We built our base and what we found
It takes blood and sweat and always moving a crowd
No skill when you've gone the fast lane
Let me see you dance, one from the AK
Bullshit, now he's droppin' names
Who you know, what you do, it all sounds the same
A piece of advice: quit droppin' mine
You'll be gone way before it even is your time
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage
You'll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage

[Chorus: Danny]
Lights out, you're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, can you feel it now?
We're calling you out, who the fuck are you now?

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'ma light your ass up 'cause you ain't got what it takes
Your crew's riding my nuts, they'll tell you how my dick tastes
Yeah, I'm shitfaced in all black, looking creepy
It's Charlie Scene, this shit is way too easy
I'ma give it you quick, going straight to your throat
Or put the burner in your mouth and turn you into a ghost
All these people making music with nothing to show
Who doesn't have a band? Shit, I don't know
What kind of sane person drops his own name?
What kind of sane person boos his own band offstage?
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this?
These damn meds ain't working, I'm just too damn sick
Just you coming out here has got me provoked
Now I'ma cut your ass up like a line of coke
I'ma roll your crew up like a fat ass roach
And put you in my ashtray 'cause you just got smoked

[Chorus: Danny]
Lights out, you're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, can you feel it now?
We're calling you out, who the fuck are you now?

[Bridge: Danny & Funny Man]
Another classic case, you crash and burn
And it's true, you're dead wrong
It's lights out, your last song
The world has turned its face, you'll never learn
And it's true, you're dead wrong
It's lights out, your last song
Walls closing in, they're falling down

[Chorus: Danny]
Lights out, you're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, can you feel it now?
We're calling you out, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, can you feel it now?
We're calling you out, who the fuck are you now?
Lights out, you're talking too loud
Who the fuck are you now? Who the fuck are you now?

[Outro: Danny]
Lights out
