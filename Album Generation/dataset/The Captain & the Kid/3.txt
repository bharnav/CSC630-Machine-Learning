[Verse 1]
Nostradamus said I predict
That the world will end at half past six
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

[Chorus]
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

[Verse 2]
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and june
The sun descends down in mexico
While a fancy car back on savile row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change
Some holes along the road get filled

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Pressure's going to cook us if we don't unlock it
Guns going off if we don't uncock it
We've got to climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket

[Chorus]
