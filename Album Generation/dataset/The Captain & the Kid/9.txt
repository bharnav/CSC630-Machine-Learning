[Verse 1]
I've been out on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around
I've seen it growing from next to nothing
Into a giant eating up your town
Called up the tealeaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands
She saw a mountain and wild deer running
A crazy kid becoming a better man
But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waiting to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasing the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine silk suit
And a heart out west in a wrangler shirt

[Chorus]
And you can't go back and if you try it fails
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail
A sign hanging from it saying "truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

[Verse 2]
We've been missing at times in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh we've conjured up what we created
Way back then when i was standing up in six-inch heels
Now you're riding off into the sunset
And i'm still spinning like a catherine wheel
But we stuck around for the battle
Waiting for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Digging into our roots
But i got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

[Chorus][x2]
