[Chorus 1 -- Keith Richards]
Let’s drink to the hard working people
Lets drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Lets drink to the salt of the earth

[Verse 1]
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

[Chorus 2]
And when I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of Gray and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange

[Chorus 1]
Raise your glass to the hard working people
Lets drink to the uncounted heads
Lets think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

[Verse 2]
Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the Gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

[Chorus 2]
And when I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
Or don't they look so strange

[Chorus 1]
Let’s drink to the hard working people
Lets think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Lets drink to the salt of the earth

[Chorus 1]
Lets drink to the hard working people
Lets drink to the salt of the earth
Lets drink to the two thousand million
Lets think of the humble of birth
