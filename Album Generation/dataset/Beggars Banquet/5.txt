[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
Because summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy
But what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 2]
Hey! Think the time is right for a Palace Revolution
But where I live the game to play is Compromise Solution!
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!

[Verse 3]
Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King I'll rail at all his servants
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band

[Chorus]
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!
