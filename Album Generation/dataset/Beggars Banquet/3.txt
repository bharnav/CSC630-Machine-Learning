[Chorus]
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight

[Verse 1]
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Caroline

[Chorus]
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride

[Verse 2]
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time

[Chorus]
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?

[Verse 3]
Well, my heavy throbbers itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down
