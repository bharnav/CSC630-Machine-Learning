My life
Charred remains of a flame that's burned out
My lips move but they won't make a sound
I stand motionless, eyes to the ground

Back for more
With reopened scars I remain
Battered savagely, knees start to shake
I just stand there, I take it, I wait

I'm just waiting for time to erase
And the world to change
Until then I will strive for nothing more
I'll just wait for my heart to break
And arise from ash, reborn, reborn

Look at me
Cut my eye and allow me to see
What my life has become on my knees
I hear the screams, I watch myself bleed

But I can't feel a thing, what am I
But a victim unwilling to rise
Wretched shell of a man and his pride
Why stop living, I'm just waiting to die

I'm just waiting for time to erase
And the world to change
Until then I will strive for nothing more
I'll just wait for my heart to break
And arise from ash, reborn, reborn

My life, it's so familiar
Why lie when everything's the same
But who am I
And what am I
Waiting for anyway?

I'm just waiting for time to erase
And the world to change
Until then I will strive for nothing more
I'll just wait for my heart to break
And arise from ash, reborn, reborn ...
