I can remember when
There were times I thought we'd never eat again
And salvation was our drinking

Things were different then
It was five of us against the world but then
The world sure seemed much smaller

Broken down, down and out
Out of gas, out of food, without a doubt
Broken up, up in arms
Armed to the teeth with ways to kill the pain

I was around back when we would fight each other for a couch or bed
Though we'd never end up sleeping
We could rely on friends through the good, the bad, the ugly times that
We spent together when we were
Stealing our daily bread, naming vans until they all became our friends
At least until they left us

Broken down, down and out
Out of gas, out of food, without a doubt
Broken up, up in arms
Armed to the teeth with ways to kill the pain

I wouldn't trade these drunken days to be like you
And say "I willll be safe, I'm just waiting for
Waiting for life to start."
You can hate what we create
But we'll be standing here when everything falls apart

Broken down, down and out
Out of gas, out of food, without a doubt
Broken up, up in arms
Armed to the teeth with ways to kill the pain
