I've seen it before
Everyone seems eloquently bored
The laughter stops and starts again too forced
So what's the use in trying anymore
Nothing makes you stop and notice
(And where did you go)

When did you give up
And decide you had enough
In the last five years of your life what have you done
You feel pray to the throne they passed on

Run your mouth
Precious little thought while others drown
Your standards put you high above the crowd
But your safety net won't let you hit the ground
And nothing makes you stop and notice
(And where did you go)

When did you give up
And decide you had enough
In the last five years of your life what have you done
Except shine the throne you sit on

Reflections of your pretty face
Betray a soul you can't replace
At the end of the day
The high horse that you rode for so long
Has trampled you and now moved on
But you'll never change

Cause you're lying
To yourself and
When did you become so boring
Just stop trying
To pretend you're right
You lost touch before you started out

You were never cool
And we're not impressed, so tell me

When did you give up
And decide you had enough
In the last five years of your life what have you done
But become the throne you sit on
