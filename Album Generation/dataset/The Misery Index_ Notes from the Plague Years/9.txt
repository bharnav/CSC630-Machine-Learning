Relax, just sit back and absorb
Make sure you've got all that you can't afford
Listen for your cue to help you deal with the shame
It makes you wonder who is holding on to the reigns

It's the way its always been and the way it will remain
It doesn't matter when you've got nothing to believe

Sit down, shut up, just consume and be bored
You know your place and you'll find it so easy to ignore
That everybody knew it wasn't gonna be tame
Cause honey, the kill is just part of the game

It's the way its always been and the way it will remain
It doesn't matter when you've got nothing to believe
And why be born again, if it's so hard to get in
It doesn't matter when you've got nothing to believe
Don't bother trying

From the dawn of time, should come as no surprise
What we've set out to achieve
A little pressure there, a little money here
And they'll be begging us, "Please"
We'll make it squeaky clean
Ignore the blood for now
Mundane and so pristine
Come on, just dance to the sound

It's the way its always been and the way it will remain
It doesn't matter when you've got nothing to believe
And why be born again, if it's so hard to get in
It doesn't matter when you've got nothing to believe
Think it over
