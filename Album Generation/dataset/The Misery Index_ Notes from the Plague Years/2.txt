Right now you've got us right where we want you
Below the radar sucking all you sold us
Patient and waiting while plotting and baiting
A stake through your heart with a smile on our face

1,2,3,4, we've found a new obsession
4,3,2,1, counting down to your extinction
1,2,3,4, we've found a new obsession
4,3,2,1, zero hour for the march of the damned

You'll never see us coming, striking from the shadows
Head first fist raised to the sky
Pull the trigger, released in anger
We'll bite off the fingers that feed us your shit

1,2,3,4, we've found a new obsession
4,3,2,1, counting down to your extinction
1,2,3,4, we've found a new obsession
4,3,2,1

Prepare for judgment in black masks with hearts of fire
Your time is up, we have decided
We won't give up until you lay down
And die you bitch
