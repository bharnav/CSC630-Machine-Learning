She cries, "It's freedom that we need"
But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)

It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed
Before you get to die

Can we give it one more shot
Have we thrown all hope away
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives
On bended knee
Choosing not to be free

He sighs, "I'm quickly burning out"
All that's left of me are jaded memories
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)

Of what I could have been
If I had only been
Less of what they wanted

Can we give it one more shot
Have we thrown all hope away
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives
On bended knee
Choosing not to be free

And we're still here
All together and all alone
Consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover
How empty we've become

Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone

Can we give it one more shot
Have we thrown all hope away
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives
On bended knee
Choosing not to be free
