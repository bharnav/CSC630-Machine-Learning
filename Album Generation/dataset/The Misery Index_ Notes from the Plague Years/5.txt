So here's the door
I changed the lock and time
Ten minutes past "I love you"
(Gotta fight the urge to start again)

Despite the cost or rhyme
We lose and change our mind
Before we even try

Circles, corners, gravity forces us
Back to where we started from
Love and weapons kill much the same way
With shaking hands we start again

This stagnant air
Feels cold and unaware
As I fight the urge to kiss you
(Every instinct says just walk away)

Attempt and fail again
Envision at the end
That we could make it right

Circles, corners, gravity forces us
Back to where we started from
Love and weapons kill much the same way
With shaking hands we start again

I believe
Please heal me
Your eyes so
Revealing

Circles, corners, gravity forces us
Back to where we started from
Love and weapons kill much the same way
With shaking hands we start again

We start again

Circles, corners, gravity forces us
Back to where we started from
Love and weapons kill much the same way
With shaking hands we start again
