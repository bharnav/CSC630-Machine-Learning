Here I am with my empire
I'll bring you to your knees
Ebb and flow with my desire
Cause it's all that you've been taught to be

Yeah, I'm the bastard son
Of what's been overcome
And again we plant the seed
So place your fork to mouth
Eat, consume, be proud
Of what I let you see
Cause we've made quite sure you can never leave

Here I am with my empire
I'll bring you to your knees
Ebb and flow with my desire
Cause it's all that you've been taught to be

I speak, you throw parades
Ignore the sense of rage
Welling up inside
Pay no mind to what we do
Cause we'll sell it all to you
In modern luxuries
And we've made quite sure you believe you're free

Here I am with my empire
I'll bring you to your knees
Ebb and flow with my desire
Cause it's all that you've been taught to be

From the cradle to the grave
We try not to be saved
From what we own

For next to nothing spent
Turn your dollars into cents
Fighting for the right to die alone

(Just believe, believe you're free)
Cause you're on your own
It doesn't matter just be sure
That this is our empire, this is war

Forgotten heroes
Chessboard roles
To make you think you're something more
But you're on your own

Here I am with my empire
I'll bring you to your knees
Ebb and flow with my desire
Cause it's all that you've been taught to be
