It's no wonder we're all scared
When our submission makes demands
And who the hell are you
Is it asked or forced to do

Do you pray for holiness
Or just prey on my willingness
To starve, beg, consume
For something you can't prove

If I'm unworthy, it's you that brought me here
I sacrificed so much just to let you own my fears
Please don't let go of me

And I will carry on
With your burden on my shoulders
Where's the white washed tomb out of which your god's been exhumed

A corpse to force my guilt
Through lips you thought you'd sealed
And sins you can't let go
Have blinded you on your throne
And left me here alone

If I'm unworthy, it's you that brought me here
I sacrificed so much just to let you own my fears
Please don't let go of me

While god sleeps the righteous feed upon the meek
What kind of father sits and lets his children bleed
Don't just stand there show us all if this is true
That your love and mercy isn't for a chosen few

If I'm unworthy, it's you that brought me here
I sacrificed so much just to let you own my fears
Please don't let go of me
