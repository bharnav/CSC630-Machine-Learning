The world outside can't describe my inner life
The river's long, the road rolls on in my inner life
I know you're a good man, but you can only guess

This body has traveled on, this body is fine and strong
This body has given life, nurtured and sacrificed
This body has done so much, this body needs your touch

All I want is a little tenderness
A warm embrace to wake up my senses
I just want a caring hand, I want you to understand

That this body has traveled on, this body is fine and strong
This body has given life, nurtured and sacrificed
This body has done so much, this body needs your touch

This is sacred ground, waiting here to be found

This body has traveled on, this body is fine and strong
This body has given life, nurtured and sacrificed
This body has done so much, this body needs your touch
