On a flight path out of Berlin
I had a sense what I was falling in
I caught the light refracting from your eyes
On the runway below making me blind
I had a hurricane warning in my chest
Listening for the voice that knows me best
It's all so simple and so true but I'm so slow to learn

Yeah you've got me
I 'm in your world
Caught in your sunset
Overturned

So I put down in Nova Scotia
In the pine tree sun I could smell the ocean
I was trying so hard not to remember
Washing it clean in the icy water
But the energy I can't resist
And when the fog rolls in I think of your kiss
So I light a fire to stare into
But love's so slow to burn

Yeah you've got me
I 'm in your world
Caught in your sunset
Overturned

Well some will say that nothing lasts forever
And some will say it's better to be safe
I don't care; I'll stay with you whatever it takes

Yeah you've got me
I 'm in your world
Caught in your sunset
Overturned
