I'm done drifting, I'm ready for living
I'm done drifting, I'm ready for living
With you

And though the world is big and wide
What I want is peace inside
And though there's still so much to do
All I need is you

I'm done searching, I'm ready to dig in
I'm done searching, I'm ready for dig in
With you

And though we still have far to go
That's alright, we'll take it slow
And though the days are often long
With you here I can be strong

I'm done wishing, I'm ready to giving
I'm done wishing, I'm ready for giving
With you

And though the world is big and wide
What I want is peace inside
And though there's still so much to do
All I need is you
