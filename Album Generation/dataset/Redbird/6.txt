Your face so beautiful it makes me cry
I was not thinking I would get this high
But here I am mesmerized

Life gets heavy but bright
Deeper blue, crystallized
I'm so weak, so alive
Mesmerized

A light appearing in my broken sky
Night falls around me as the stars shoot by
While here I stand mesmerized

Life gets heavy but bright
Deeper blue, crystallized
I'm so weak, so alive
Mesmerized
