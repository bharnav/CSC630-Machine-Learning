Do you think I can't see through to who you are?
All the life that shines below the pain, the scars
Did you think that you could hide?
Build up a wall inside?
Just turn yourself to stone, and go through this alone?
No, I'll be there
Like a bird, singing to you
I'll be there
Like a bird, singing you through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Holding the light for you
Making it right for you
Singing you through

Do you think that I don't know how far you've come?
All the heights you've had to climb, the miles you've run
Did you think I'd let you down?
Just turn this ship around
And leave you in the dust?
But you must know you must
That I'd be there
Like a bird, singing to you
I'll be there
Like a bird, singing you through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Holding the light for you
Making it right for you
Singing you through

People think that they can heal without the touch
Learn to live without the love they need so much
But everybody hurts, and everybody cries
And everybody needs a helping hand sometimes
And I'll be there
Like a bird, singing to you
I'll be there
Like a bird, singing you through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Holding the light for you
Making it right for you
Singing you through
