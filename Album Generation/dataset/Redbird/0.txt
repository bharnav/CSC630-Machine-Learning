I see you standing in the doorway
A shadow in the sun
I'm reaching out to touch you
Is it better when you know
That you're not the only one
That I can hear you

And there's so much I can do for you
Give it time, I know that I can prove
Now my world is offered out to you
Let it fly

And I say (welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside (wel, wel)

I see you picking up the pieces
The pieces of a dream
You tried to build around you
I know you're looking for a reason
A reason to believe
Now I found you

And there's so much I can do for you
Give it time, I know that I can prove
Now my world is offered out to you
Come inside

And I say (welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside (wel, wel)

Come inside

There is so much I can do for you
Give it time, I know that I can prove
Now my world is offered out to you
Come inside

And I say (welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside (wel, wel, welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside (wel, well, welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside, Yeah, yeah (welcome)
To my life (welcome)
To my world (welcome)
Come inside (wel, wel)
