[Verse 1]
It’s all too revealing
Your words are deceiving
I can’t let you get in my way
I sense all your actions are meant as distractions
You must know I won’t play your game
Fake, you’re more than I can take
And something’s gonna break
Get out of my head
No shame, you’re passing all the blame
And nothing’s gonna change
Get out of my head

[Chorus]
You made me realize that it’s all a lie
And it comes as no surprise
Stay for a while
Stay ‘cause you make me smile
There’s no compromise

[Verse 2]
I’m sick of pretending
The thoughts are unending
I can’t let you get in my way (there’s no way home)
I’m no longer bending
My mind set is mending
And now I have something to say (deny me)
Fake, you’re more than I can take
And something’s gonna break
Get out of my head
No shame, you’re passing all the blame
And something’s gonna change
Get out of my head

[Chorus]
You made me realize that it’s all a lie
And it comes as no surprise
Stay for a while
Stay ‘cause you make me smile
There’s no compromise

[Bridge]
Fake, you’re more than I can take
And something’s gonna break
Get out of my head
Shame, you’re passing all the blame
And nothing’s gonna change
Get out of my head

[Chorus]
You made me realize that it’s all a lie
And it comes as no surprise
Stay for a while
Stay ‘cause you make me smile
I see no compromise

[Outro]
Stay for a while
Stay ‘cause you make me smile
I see no compromise
Stay for a while
Stay ‘cause you make me smile
There’s no compromise

No Shame, you're passing all the blame
And nothing's gonna change, get out of my head
