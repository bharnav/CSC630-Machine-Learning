[Verse]
It's so depressing how you wag your tongue
And maim with words as you please
I'm second guessing you're the chosen one
Think you can cure my disease

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear out and lay claim to my mind
Get out
I'm begging you please

[Chorus]
You're so excited to bleed
You've got me on my knees
Betrayed desire for need
But I'm giving up
Yeah I'm giving up

[Verse]
As a confession you reach for your gun
Then cry a hole in my sleeve
It's overrated kissing you for fun
Now all I taste is the sleaze

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear out and lay claim to my mind
Get out
I'm begging you please

[Chorus]
You're so excited to breed
You've got me on my knees
Betrayed desire for need
But I'm giving up
Yeah I'm giving up

[Bridge]
You've got me right where you want me
You've got me feeling so small
You've got me right where you want me
I'll never deliver myself

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear out and lay claim to my mind
Get out
I'm begging you please

[Chorus]
You're so excited to bleed
You've got me on my knees
Betrayed desire for need
But I'm giving up
Yeah I'm giving up
But now I deliver myself
