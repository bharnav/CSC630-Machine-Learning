I'm doing fine
Even though you preyed upon my mind
Been living a lie
Seems every day it eats me

Yeah and there's no resolution
Yeah but it makes me think twice
Yeah and I need retribution
You don't get it man I'm your pollution

I'm breathing sigh
In passing away I'll take my time
I'm still getting high
I love the way it feeds me

Yeah and there's no resolution
Yeah but it makes me think twice
Yeah and I need retribution
Just don't get it man I'm the solution now

You can't keep me down my friend
You can't keep me down my friend

I'm doing fine
Even though this hatred plagues my mind
I'm living a lie
But I love the way you need me

Yeah and there's no resolution
Yeah but it makes me think twice
Yeah and I need retribution
You don't get it man I'm your pollution

Yeah and there's no resolution
Yeah but it makes me think twice
Yeah now I need retribution
You don't get it man I'm the solution now
