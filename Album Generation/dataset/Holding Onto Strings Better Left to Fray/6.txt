I think it's time for a change
'Cause things feel out of touch
And I watch you walk
Away again

Well this feels like to much (Can you take it away?)
And things won't go my way
Now I'll have to fade
Away my friend

So pass slowly!
And carry me down!
And render me lonely!
When you're not around!

I need to shake off this pain
But courage takes too much!
So I have to walk
Away again

Oh God, I miss your touch! (Can you take it way?)
The way you keep me safe
I won't let you fade
Away my friend

So pass slowly!
And carry me down!
Remember me only!
When you're not around!

Oh, yeah!
Can't you stay a while longer?
Oh, yeah!
Won't you stay?
God, please stay!

And pass slowly! (It's time for a change)
And whittle me down! ('Cause things feel out of touch)
Render me lonely! (I watch you walk, away again)
When you're not around!

So pass slowly! (Feels like to much)
And let me down easy! (And things won't go my way)
Render me lonely! (Now I have to fade, away my friend)
When you're not around!
