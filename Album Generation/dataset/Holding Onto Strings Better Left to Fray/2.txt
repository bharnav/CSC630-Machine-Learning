This fear has me chilled
Down to the bone
And I have been haunted by
These things I still have left to say

I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to
Strings much better left to fray

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt out to be
Half the man that I could be

I'll never belong inside your world
So black out the sun and leave me
To play out the same old tragedy

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is a part of you
