Fade out like a photograph
Just a memory to forget
You burn black like a cigarette
I'll discard you when I'm done
You break down when you need the rest
What a selfish way to drown
Then lay down with the thief you met
And enjoy the pride you've won

So let loose those tears darling
Cause I'll turn my back
So tell me the story
How you lose this all I'm guessing
But don't tell me you're sorry
I am through with it all and I won't be back again

I'm burnt out on your etiquette
How you caponize the son
Then lay down with another one
As you canonize yourself

So let loose those tears darling
Cause I'll turn my back
So tell me the story
How you lose this all I'm guessing
But don't tell me you're sorry
I am through with it all and I won't be back again

You're breaking all the rules and killing
All my self esteem that's left
You take me for a fool
You're killing all my self esteem that's left

So tell me the story
How you lose this all I'm guessing
You're looking so worried
Can you feel it come undone?
Such a pitiful story
But I finally learned my lesson
Don't tell me you're sorry
I am through with it all and I won't be back again
