[Verse 1]
If I could speak, I'd tell you all my fears and deprivations
If I could feel, I'd take away your pain
If I could bleed, I'd show you all my scars and imperfections
If I could breathe, I'd hold you in my veins

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down in fear and paralyzed
You've got me feeling like I have no other hand to hold in this assisted suicide

[Chorus]
So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation, I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation, I will only let you down

[Verse 2]
If I could breed, I'd show you all my infantile obsessions
If I could sleep, I'd hold you in my head
If I was strong, I'd keep you close and render you defenseless
If I was gone, I'd hope you take my place

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down in fear and paralyzed
You've got me feeling like I have no other hand to hold in this assisted suicide

[Chorus]
So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation, I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation, I will only let you down

[Break]

[Chorus]
So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation, I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation, I will only let you down
