Now I'll take the blame
So forget my name
Just close the blinds
So I can come down

I'm naked and shamed
Moth to the flame
Just take my hand
So we can both drown

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only relief is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again

The same sweet game
Your halo is a flame
Feel my heart race
And breathe a sad sigh

Let me wash away
And let go of the pain
Just look away
And turn a blind eye

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only relief is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only relief is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again

So hold me down
If I feed I'm stronger
I don't feel no longer

So hold me down
If I feed I'm stronger
I don't feel no longer

So hold me down
If I feed I'm stronger
I don't feel no longer

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only relief is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only relief is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again

I'll never believe in you again
I'll never forgive those things you said
My only release is gone and dead
I'll never forsake myself again
