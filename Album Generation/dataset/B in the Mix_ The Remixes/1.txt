[Intro]
It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just want to dance with you

[Verse 1]
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Your public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watching
Feels like the crowd is saying

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)

[Verse 2]
The center of attention (Do you feel this?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission, you got my permission

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watching
Feels like the crowd is saying

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)

[Bridge]
I just can't control myself, oh!
They want more?
Well I'll give them more
Ow!

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more, babe
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)
I just want more

[Interlude]
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
(Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

[Outro]
Bet you didn't see this one coming
The Incredible Lago (more, more, more)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
‘Cause I ain’t going nowhere
