[Verse 1]
This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good ish, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing, I notice when you're staring
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit-list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook]
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook]
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel, it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
