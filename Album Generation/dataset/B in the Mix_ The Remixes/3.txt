[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with the Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you so hard, so hard
Wonder if you knows you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And when you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
(That's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

[Verse 2]
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you so hard, so hard
Wonder if you knows you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And when you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
(That's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

[Spoken Interlude]
I got my eye on you and I can’t let you get away

[Bridge]
Hey baby, whether it's now or later (I gotcha)
You can’t shake me (no)
Cause I got you on my radar
And whether you like it or not, it ain't going to stop
Cause I got you on my radar (I gotcha)
Cause I got you on my radar

[Chorus]
I'm checking you so hard, so hard
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And when you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
(That's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
