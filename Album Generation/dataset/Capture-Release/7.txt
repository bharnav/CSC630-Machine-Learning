[Verse 1]
I suggested at a truce, you spat out some excuse
You're violent, violent
They don't like you hanging 'round
You're bleeding on their ruby ground
You're violent, violent
Took you to a part of town
When amber calming people down
It's no use, you're violent
Just what everybody needs, another fucking gallery

[Pre-Chorus]
You're violent, vi - o - lent

[Chorus]
We'll take your dreams or lack of money
We'll take your dreams or lack of money (violent)
We'll take your dreams (violent)
Or lack of money (violent)
We'll take your dreams (violent)
Or lack of money (violent)

[Verse 2]
You would always around, the dangerous part of town
For some excuse, for violence
Bumping into those with bling bling on their wrists
You're violent, violent
Mum said keep an eye on you, she's scared of what you might do
Your future, is over
I would be amazed if you made it past 25

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Introduce you some new friends, that would be the end of them
You're violent, you'd eat them
Gave you a chance to be a part of their society
It's no use, you'd eat them
People would run away, when your mate would hit the stage
You're violent, violent
Demonic males are bound to fail, in the ground or in jail

[Pre-Chorus]
Violent, vi - o - lent

[Chorus]
We'll take your dreams or lack of money
We'll take your dreams or lack of money, (violent)
We'll take your dreams, (violent)
Or lack of money, (violent)
We'll take your dreams, (violent)
Or lack of money, (violent)
We'll take your dreams, (violent)
Or lack of money, (violent)
We'll take your dreams, (violent)
Or lack of money
Violent
