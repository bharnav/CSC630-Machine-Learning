[Verse 1]
Shoot to kill, I dropped a pill
Then I threw a bottle of drink down my throat
I went at first looking for assistance
T-Bone burst in with both guns blazing

[Chorus]
T-Bone
Clear out the till

[Verse 2]
Mother spilled her veils and her baby's milk
When I walk past in my balaclava
Stepping through glass and past a cadaver
Up to the counter, I could smell the sulphur

[Chorus]
Honey
Makes me feel ill
T-Bone
Clear out the till

[Verse 3]
I took two hills with both rifles empty
I ran for miles when T-Bone went to town
As he ran around, the people had their hands up
All that he found was his next victim

[Chorus]
Honey
Makes me feel ill
T-Bone
Clear out the till

[Outro]
T-Bone
T-Bone
T-Bone
