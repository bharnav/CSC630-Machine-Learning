[Intro]
This is a true story!

[Verse 1]
I just woke up
Everything was fucked
From the night before
I was beyond repair
I had just woke up
Everything was wrong
All the cats were dead
And the phones were gone
I had just woke up
Like a heart attack
I weren't coming back
And mum was dressed in black

[Pre-Chorus]
I had just woke up
I had just woke up
Everything was fucked
Everything was fucked

[Chorus]
The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation

[Verse 2]
I had just woke up
In someone elses bed
She was overweight
Who did I do last night?
I found paradise
In between girl's thighs
It was quick and nice
The feelings cold as ice
I could hardly walk
And I had the shakes
Had to eat some food
Or I was gonna faint

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One day a week
For my cuts to heal
Take every Monday off
With my blood shot eyes
If work only knew
What I got up to
At the weekend
They wouldn't speak to me
Or pretend to be my friends
Take every Monday off
With my blood shot eyes
With my blood shot eyes

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
