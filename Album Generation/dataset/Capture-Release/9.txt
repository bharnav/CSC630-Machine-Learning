[Verse 1]
Baby don't go
To the haunted hotel
I've got a really bad feeling
In my lungs and my bones
Science can't save you
And your parents are away
On holiday in Mexico
Buying trinkets in the town

[Verse 2]
The haunted hotel
In a dream that I've been having
Has got me waking up sweating
Afraid to turn on the news
My internal dialogue
Is rutted and confused
Trying to find some peace and quiet
But the damage was done

[Bridge]
And my job in the city won't matter no more
When the network is down and my flesh is all torn

[Chorus]
Baby stay here
In the shadow of the buildings
In familiar surroundings
In your safety zone
Every plane is a missile
Every suitcase a bomb
There's no reason in my head now
Only fear in my bones

[Outro]
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
(Pull yourself together, no reason staying in)
