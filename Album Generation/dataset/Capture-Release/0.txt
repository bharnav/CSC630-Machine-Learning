[Verse 1]
I'll meet you in West Germany
October 1983
I know that freedom was a lie
And your husband was a spy
Say that words are impotent
They can help us pay the rent
I knew for sure there was nothing left
Except the vodka on your breath

[Chorus]
We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg

[Verse 3]
Courage that your father plucked
From inside a cattle truck
Will help us fix the exit polls
The children must have rock'n'roll
Surveillance cameras captured dawn
Breaking on the autobahn
I knew for sure our chance was blown
When rifles made us feel at home

[Chorus]
We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg

We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg

Eins, zwei, drei, vier!

[Verse 4]
Ideas can change the government
They never listen to our arguments
On TV our friends smashed cement
And pulled down the bastards monuments
I went outside for a cigarette
I saw things I tried to forget
The news showed us who we had left
I could smell the vodka on your breath
