[Verse 1]
Maybe lack of sleep or last nights drinks
Now my eye's twitching
If that prick coughs again
In the back of my head
I'll smash your fucking face in

[Pre-Chorus]
Ok, that's it, take a deep breath
I've got to get out of here
I've got to clear my head
I've got to clear my head

[Chorus]
It's all these words, ideas and different arguments
Someone's always talking when I try to make some sense
From all this stress that is constantly going on
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
Lean back, stare up at the ceiling
I just drift along with no focus or meaning

[Verse 3]
I've got the same shirt on for two days in a row
With a soya sauce stain so everyone knows
A shower and scrub, still smell like the smoking bit in a Wetherspoon's pub

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll have my lunch early, get some sugar in my blood
My clothes still smell of last night
I've got to clear my head

[Chorus]
It's all these words, ideas and different arguments
Someone's always talking when I try to make some sense
From all this stress that is constantly going on
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
Lean back, stare up at the ceiling
I just drift along with no focus or meaning

[Bridge]
Why do these tourists walk so slow?
Especially now I've got somewhere to go?
And a posh sounding girl, going on and on
About her dog, Mr. Morgan
It sounds so funny when I hear you calling!
Mum be like 'boy what you doing?'
Please shut up and try and sound confident
In a crap job when your minicourse is done

[Chorus]
It's all these words, ideas and different arguments
Someone's always talking when I try to make some sense
From all this stress that is constantly going on
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
Lean back, stare up at the ceiling
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
