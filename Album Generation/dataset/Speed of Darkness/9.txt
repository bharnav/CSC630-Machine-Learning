Oh! Oliver Boy what did you do?
But crush the hand you never shook
Then rob the rights of people to be free
Oh! Oliver Boy it's a terrible state
You left behind a worse off race
Where dignity and pride fought for their place
Oh! Oliver Boy now you are gone
And we're still here where we belong
Forgiveness being our strength you'll never see

Now the sun shines on this page I write
Though it's raining hard in Palestine
No lands are promised lands
When will we see?
So don't tell me that your God's my God
I don't think they even care at all
Just a pantomime behind a curtain lies deceit
Oh listen to me bark out loud
Without a voice and little growl
Snapping at the heels I wait
For something more to change
The more they stay the same

Chorus
Oliver Boy! It's the same militia
Oliver Boy! Just the clothes are different
Oliver Boy! It's the same old story
Where there's blood there's death not glory

Look into these empty eyes
Fed upon by parasites
As beauty's ugly head devours its plight
While the borders of our hate create
Nothing more than each our fate
Trapped between our comfort and our crime
So stand along the graveyard wall
And watch the souls perform their song
Sing to us the dead above
As the mourners come to pray
The living stay away

Chorus
Oliver Boy! It's the same militia
Oliver Boy! Just the clothes are different
Oliver Boy! It's the same old story
Where there's blood there's death not glory
Oliver Boy! We're all someone's sons
All of our Boys! Just put down the guns
Oliver Boy! You're dead but listen
You were wrong but we're no different

Marching to the left, everyone in step
Don't ask the question, why we're here with no direction
Marching to the right, this is not our fight
The curse of friction, born of man and contradiction

Chorus

All of our boys!

Now the sun shines on this page I write
Though it's raining hard in Palestine
