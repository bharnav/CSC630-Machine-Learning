Sad days are kissing the cheeks
Of the families who are walking away
Tragic the pubs are all closing
The system is broken decay

Business is down at the Depot
Defenses are the only things built
Neighbors wave goodbye to each other
This country is over they say

Chorus
Now this is life in a modern town
The windows smashed open
With the doors kicked out
It's not a good day left to be in a fight
Living is hard through the struggles of life
If nothing gets done it will never be right
But don't shut 'em down

Lately the 21st century's been crazy
It's the sign of the times
Buildings decomposing in slumber
There's no work for all 'til they wake

Chorus

Too many faults, no reasons
The rains that fall dry bleeding
Upon the ashes of our homes, out homes
Save our homes

(Manic the word on the street here is panic)
(There's a riot on hand)
People taking care of the people
There's no other way or we'll break

Chorus
