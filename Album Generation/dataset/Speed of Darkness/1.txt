I spent twenty-seven years in this factory
And the boss man says, 'hey you're not what we need'
The penguins in the suits they know nothing but greed
It's a solitary life when you've mouths to feed
But who cares about us?

Now I'm back on the streets
With my hands held shut
I'm a workingman without any work
Well is this the way it's meant to be
Because I signed off for the American Dream
Now, I write my name to the welfare scheme
The money in the bank, well it's history

So take me down to where the worlds collide
And leave me here 'til I'm satisfied
So let the Revolution begin

Now I drag these bones
'Cross the barren land
Where once a city, now an outstretched hand
We can't lose our sense of dignity
While the fat-faced cats lap up the cream
Another disappearing act falls up their sleeves
While the shirts on our back seek refugee

So take me down to where the worlds collide
And leave me here 'til I'm satisfied
'Cause there'll come a day
When all of us will show, we won't be afraid
Although we're crashing, we won't burn
Let the Revolution, the revolution begin

I spent twenty-seven years in this factory
And the boss man says, 'hey you're not what we need'
The penguins in the suits they know nothing but greed
It's a solitary life when you've mouths to feed

So take me down to where the worlds collide
And leave me here 'til I'm satisfied
Do take me down to where the worlds divide
And leave me here I won't compromise
'Cause there'll come a day
When all of us will show, we won't be afraid
'Cause from these ashes we will grow
So let the Revolution, the Revolution, the Revolution begin...
Begin...begin...begin...begin...begin
