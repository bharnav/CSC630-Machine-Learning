I've been walking miles forever
Through these footprints of my life
When I offered you my sadness
You took home with delight
Eat my heart when you are hungry
I have nothing more to give
Let us not forget each other
When our wounds begin to spill

Chorus
So say a prayer for me in silence
No cathedral mock our hearts
That's when I will be forgiven
Let us never fall apart

I've been wrong on more occasions
Than I'd like to recognize
But there's room in our vocation
If we read between the lines
Every house needs a foundation
So the mortar we'll supply
We'll be broke but never broken
Let us laugh until we cry

Chorus
