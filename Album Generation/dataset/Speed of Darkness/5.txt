Time to take a breath once more
Before the hammer blow
Wrap myself around the veil
Against the bitter cold
Body bruised from selfishness
The penny dropped too late i guess

Chorus
So sail on
To all now born
So sail on to you

Raise my glass to all before
True friends I have known
Take me to my virgin grave
Beneath the haunting snow
Nothing left but fare thee well
I wish you health, so please take care

Chorus
