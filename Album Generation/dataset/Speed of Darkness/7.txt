In this present state of grace
I hold my head up high
Though the water damage froze
Another flood will soon be by
Here and now is all we'll be
So it's this present state of grace I offer thee

Welcome home to the men
And the women who defend
Back to their lives and the lies
Shat on them by government
Through the barbs and the pokes
And the ones we'd like to choke
It's this present state of grace I offer thee

In this present state of grace
A poor man robbed me blind
Though I offered him the cash
He said 'don't insult my pride'
To each their own
We're just flesh and bone
An this present state of grace I offer thee

In this present state of grace
I saw the wall capsize
And through the banks they fell
Into the swelling tide
Let them eat cake
For our mistakes
And this present state of grace I offer thee

So let's sing goodbye to Auld Lang Syne
Under the carpet sweep behind
Where passengers making turns
Towards the coming great divide
The true prophet never spoke
He just smiles and saw the joke
And this present state of grace I offer thee

'Cause only life, yeah only life has loneliness to sell
So celebrate, yeah live your life, live it and raise hell
The true prophet never spoke
He just smiled and saw the joke
And this present state of grace we creatures need

Yeah, it's this present state of grace we creatures need
