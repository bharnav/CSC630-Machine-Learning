Bury me in silence
For I'll never hear the truth
My coffin will be empty
Cause you'll never steal my youth

I was born to live beside you
But you tried to stop me grow
Now I'm living on the run
From all this hatred you now love
Who said it only rains
From the heavens above

Chorus
The speed of darkness lights our way
We set our course for America
No bitterness will bite my tongue
The speed of darkness has begun

It's something of a pity
But you'll never understand
How a boy can grow and
Still never be a man

I would trade the sun for nothing
And the glancing of a star
If you could just remember
Grains of dust is all we are
It only takes a second
For a beat to kill a heart

Chorus
The speed of darkness lights our way
We set our course for America
No bitterness will bite this tongue
I've reconciled with all that's gone
The speed of darkness has begun

Only time and life will tell
But it's a long way home when you're in hell
Where constant demons fracture souls
Once a nightmare, now just lifeless ghosts

The speed of darkness lights our way

You tore this land asunder
But my pride will bring it back

I would trade the sun for nothing
And the glancing of a star
If you could just remember
Grains of dust is all we are
It only takes a second
For beat to kill a heart

Chorus
