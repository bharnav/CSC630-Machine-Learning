Saints and sinners are but we
Twisted wrecks of symmetry
Like broken arrows split
Against the mindless rift we feed
Saints and sinners are
And each other's company we seek

Though we took our separate paths
Back to the womb where we collapsed
On buildings full of living bricks
Cementing walls a dangerous fix
Saints and sinners are
Begrudgers who will never mix

Contemplating right from wrong
In retrospect we don't get on
So Armageddon here we come
Who are the chosen ones?
Consequences who you've been
For in damnation Satan grins

Chorus
We're saints and we're sinners
Nothing more than lost beginners
Both now facing endless falls
Its hell or heaven cry's
The pulpits' scorn

Every saint now has a past
So may the sinners' future last
Every ghost still has a haunt
Where he or she feels they belong
All possessing tortured souls
Confessing all that's yet to be
Saints and sinners are
Lunatics a vicious breed

So Armageddon here we come
Who are the chosen ones?
Consequences who you've been
For in damnation Satan grins

Chorus

Chorus
We're saints and we're sinners
Nothing more than lost beginners
Wise men crank the guillotine
Where heads will roll for all to see
