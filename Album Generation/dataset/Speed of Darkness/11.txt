God you say is always the answer
But what is the answer for our cruelty
We punish a life 'til it's life ever after
Ever after the place that we all end up being

O' such is a morn' as this to awaken
Forgotten the hour that was yesterday
With a standing blow to the head of frustration
Divide and we fall have you nothing to say?

Chorus
So let us rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of futility

Many's the word that's been broken true anger
Lips that are sealed as the hour slips away
Belief is a joke to this lost generation
Building the walls as the mind segregates

But when all is said
The voice that is silent can't be heard

Chorus

For we, we shall overcome... someday

So we bring the head of the ol' palace tribe
For there is the rapture that bleeds out a life
Hand over fist from their pulpit they spew
Liars they'll crumble not knowing the truth

But when all is said
The voice that is silent can't be heard

Chorus
So let us rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Let us rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of futility
Rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Let us rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of all human greed

For we, we shall overcome...
