No matter where we run
It's only a car-length away
No matter where we run
It's only a car-length away

This is the time, if it were up to me now
This is the time we could rise above the ground
This is the time, hold onto me now

No matter where we run
We'll do this 'til our legs will break

This is the time, if it were up to me now
This is the time we could rise above the ground
This is the time, hold onto me now

In a bed for liars, can we be true for once?
Am I the ruiner of you too much?
I am so fucking bored
I am so fucking bored

And every second is an hour, what's a minute when you weren't counting it?
'Cause every new day's a struck match, a falling out now
It's doctor's scripts and 666, it's a voodoo doll stabbing at the chest of the heartless
Can't you refrain from all that shit for now?

Give me the warmth of an island
Give me the sense of a want to go home
Give me a loss due to damage
Give me the strength or the balls to be hated

I am so fucking bored
I am so fucking bored
I am so fucking bored
I am so fucking bored

No matter where we run
It's only a car-length away

This is the time, if it were up to me now
This is the time we could rise above the ground
This is the time, will you look to me now?
This is the time, hold onto me now
