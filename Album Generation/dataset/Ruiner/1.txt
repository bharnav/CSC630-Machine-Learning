To lose my words in this
Smoke-filled room, if there's a way out
I will find out
'Cause it burns my black eyes red

Repress this, my only regretless memory
So we can convince them
That this is all we are
That this is all we are

Watch the martyrs when they face the ghosts
Shake hands as the waste surrounds you

Killing it, killing it will only make it stronger
Killing it, killing it will only help it box you in
Killing it, killing it will only make you lose your way

Shot down the last witness
Committed to finish, this is the beginning I can't miss
The fucking looks those people gave us
No fucking bullets can erase this

Repress this, my only regretless memory
So we can convince them
That this is all we are
That this is all we are

Watch the martyrs when they face the ghosts
Shake hands as the waste surrounds you

Killing it, killing it will only make it stronger
Killing it, killing it will only help it box you in
Killing it, killing it will only make you lose your way
