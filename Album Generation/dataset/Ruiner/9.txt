I kicked it altogether last night
I had this dream I was alone
Been lying with me for nine years and counting
Got what I want, why am I miserable?

Kick this new addiction out, it's grown up
Inherited on the hush
From a smiling drunk to the embarrassing lush, love what?
I'm a magnet to whores and such

Now the happy disguise
The pill does this on its own

And like Thoreau
It's a quiet place for me
The sticks or the woods
It's all miles away from you

I got an angry thirst, we're all whores
I got a sad, sad thirst, we're all whores
I had a happy thirst, but then came you

I'm getting right back on it later tonight
It takes my mind off of the phone
How it's been silent for two weeks in my pocket
How'd I get so fucking lovable?

Take my Midas shit powers to give out
Apologize to who I touch
I could have ruined you too but I was beaten to the punch, hug what?
Why should I care who you go fuck?

Now the happy disguise
The pill does this on its own
And like Thoreau, it's a quiet place for me
The sticks or the woods, it's all miles away from you

I got an angry thirst, we're all whores
I got a sad, sad thirst, we're all whores
I had a happy thirst before you and I

If I loved us, why do you make me sick?
Why do you make me sad?
Why do you make me sad?

Sick of your poor sick mouth, stop running it
For the last few months seem fucking years
Oh, to crack for this marginal sex with your dirty shit to spit
Why do you make me sad?

How many tricks until it drips
With this ugliness I've found?
I'm falling down
Why do you make me?
