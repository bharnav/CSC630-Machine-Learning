The knife or the rope or the lemon, this brain and I
The sight of the drop got me off the roof
Hey, the garage looks cleaner when you look at it sideways
From high

To finally admit we are born alone
And that your only one's got an only one of their own

We'll get the right sunblock for the nice explosions
Oh, the king is dead
To absolve the joy from me is to erase what made me a slave
I'm a king to be

Traded my life for art
And the guilt is weighing down my arms

Tell me again what a monster is, give me the words to describe
Can you tell me what the use of endorphins is when my city dies in lights?
Take away this sentence of house arrest and watch me ruin it right
Put me in the back of an ambulance cause my city dies tonight

I see the levity of every meeting of the minds
I lie to myself, it's my right to do
I'm separated like an elevator door for privacy
For my eyes

To finally admit we are born alone
And that your only one's got another robot to take the throne

Heartless of the world deny
The king is dead, fuck, the king is dead
Heartless with your burning eyes
The king is dead, fuck, the king is dead

To wade through the virus of your lies
To cheat through death is only in my eyes
To wade through the virus of your lies
To cheat through death is only in my eyes

And the sinking feeling came over me
And it said never again, never again
Never again, never again
The king is dead

Traded my life for art
And the guilt is weighing down my arms

Tell me again what a monster is
Tell me again what a monster is
Tell me again what a monster is
Cause my city dies tonight
