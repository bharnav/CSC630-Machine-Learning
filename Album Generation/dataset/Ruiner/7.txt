There's a waiting list to the bottom, under you
Ex-husbands, romantics and perverts and masochists, I'm gonna be there too
Where's the stop when the train's gonna hit me? True, I live for when you bullshit me
Tell me you want me, tell me you need me, undress me with your eyes, lie to me

Here we are in love again, congratulations
I'm here as the entertaining fool

Must have broke every bone in your wrist, how romantic of you
We both got this sickness, goddamn, it's addictive, it's got me bleeding for two
Where's the truck full of bricks here to crush me? Don't you fuck with this halo above me
Tell me caught me, tell me I'm sorry, kick me back in your life, torture me

Here we are in love again, congratulations
I'm here as the entertaining fool

Here we are in love again, congratulations
Here we are in love again, congratulations
Here we are in love again, congratulations
I'm here as the entertaining fool
