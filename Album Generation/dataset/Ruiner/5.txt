Tearing up the walls
Scratching out her name
Staring up the walls
Dulling up the razor blade

I'm washing it down
Watch me call the port on

Tearing up the walls
Scratching out her name
Staring up the walls
Dulling up the razor blade

I'm washing it down
Watch me fall
It's the shock of the sound
Of the ants to carry me off towards home

I'm better now, get up, get up, get up
Not behind the eyes
I'm better now, get up, get up now
Not behind the eyes

Staring up the wall
Scratching out her name
Tearing up the wall
Dulling up the razor blade

I'm washing it down
Watch me call the port on
