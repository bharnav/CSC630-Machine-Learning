Don't forget to waste your blood
Mix it with your tears now
Don't forget to waste your love
Inside me to crawl out

I know it's here inside
Why am I so afraid?

God loves a liar
God loves a liar
It's turning on me now

Accidents are what follows
If only you could see her now
Don't mistake someone's daughter's crying
For fuck sounds

For rainy days you're mine
Why are we so afraid?

God loves a liar
God loves a liar
God loves a liar

Today is the day that I laugh for the fun of it
Today is the day that it tears me apart
Today is the day I defile your saccharine way
Or at least take aim

Today is the day that I drown for the fun of it
Today is the day that I laugh in the dark
Today is the day that I see myself for what I really am
Dead to the world

Liar, liar
Liar, liar
