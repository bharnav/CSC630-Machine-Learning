The sudden sight of mirrors brought the hero's demise
Hey operator, operator, stop acting civilized
I want to be you

And the ones to resurrect sex and death bought the copyright
They ate shit on the record, did you get the mix right?
Not quite, I want to be you

With a graceful fall, did you waste it all?
I found a way
For the rest of you
I miss me too

Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak

Fuck me if it pours, you're not built for this
But it's not raining, is it?
I want to be you

Now we've got the rest of our lives
To be our fathers, what a dream to wet the eyes
I want to be you

With a graceful fall, did you waste it all?
I found a way
For the rest of you
I miss me too

Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak, tell me that I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not so weak

Did I hear you crawling on your back?
Did I hear you crawling on your back?

Did I hear you crawling on your back?
Do I hear you folding up to fear?
Did I hear you crawling on your back?
Do I hear you folding up to fear?

Did I hear you crawling on your back?
Do I hear you folding up to fear?
Did I hear you crawling on your back?
Do I hear you folding up to

Brave you, I missed me too
Brave you, I missed me too
Brave you, I missed me

We are all we have
We are all we have
We are all we have
We are all we have
We are all we have
