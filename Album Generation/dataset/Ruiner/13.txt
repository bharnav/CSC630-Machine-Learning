You knew it all inside your head
Was graceful
You knew suffering was fair
Thank you much

Do we deserve this type of fate?
I need this now
Do we deserve this type of fate?

You knew the blood inside my veins
Was wasteful
You knew I was bound to wake up scared
I made you up

Do we deserve this type of fate?
I need you now
Do we deserve this type of fate?

Nobody needs nobody after all
Nobody needs nobody after all

Do we deserve this type of fate?
Do we deserve this type of fate?
Nobody needs nobody after all
