The body's singing
Without speaking
You bit your brass ring off like a monster wouldn't leave you alone
You skinned the bastard to his bones in case you got cold

Normally sent with a dream
I had to laugh when I woke to the sound of a gun
That was the best nightmare that I just woke up from

Normally sent with a heart attack
All your attempts were canonized
Blessed with a wreck of a heart of lead
I broke my back to spite my spine

Delightful ring around your neck, you fooled them all
Don't I feel so goddamn worthless
I'll bet that took all of your last nerves
But you're used to this

It's not plugged in
The phone is ringing
Time's up for devouring, your appeal's waning, you want to right the wrongs
But you chewed up everyone that you spit on

Sometimes halcyon weeks make me believe
I should be relieved enough
You were the best nightmare that I just woke up from

Normally sent with a heart attack
All your attempts were canonized
Blessed with a wreck of a heart of lead
I broke my back to spite my spine

The last night that I waited on, you'll lose your step in time
Your mind knows what your body wants, you'll lose your step in time
You move so fast sometimes, I fell so far behind
You'll lose your step in time, you'll lose your step in time

You'll lose your step in time
You'll lose your step in time
