I can hit record, erase what I'll write
Cement my place in time
It's been a life-long sofa ride
I'll be a fossil before I'm thrown in that hole

I'll make this ghost come back to life
I'll make this ghost come back to life

I lived for hope, that fucker died
Wrote all this garbage audio
Signed off with my first initial
I put it in bold to put down other egos

I'll make this ghost come back to life
I'll make this ghost come back to life

When you tell me to calm down, all eyes
Don't tell me to calm down with those eyes upon me
How can you fight what you can't target, how do you rest when you know you can't slow down?
Help me out, I can say it now, help me out

I'll make this ghost come back to life
I'll make this ghost come back to life
