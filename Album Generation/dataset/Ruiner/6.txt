Tell me a doll once came dead from above
How did you lose your way?
It stole a year from your best ones
A waste to ground you

When I get to your house
Off my back I'll lose the weight
When I get to your house, swear to God
I won't trust the model or the make, I will trust you

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

Tie me up to the radiator
Trust the sweat, not the face it's on
Tie me up to the radiator
Don't leave those lights on me, don't put those lights on me

The same doll came to walk over us
How did you lose your way?
It broke mold, got stretched like the weak ones
Cracked and dried up slow

When I get to your house
Off my back I'll lose the weight
When I get to your new fake god
I won't trust the model or the make, I will trust you

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

Tie me up to the radiator
Trust the sweat, not the face it's on
Tie me up to the radiator
Don't leave those lights on me, don't use those lights on me

Tie me up to the radiator
Tie me up to the radiator
Tie me up to the radiator
Tie me up, tie me up

Our vanity's a sickness
There's a world outside prescribed
And I won't live in it
