I would while away the hours
Conferin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain

I'd unravel every riddle
For every individle
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts you could be thinkin'
You could be another lincoln
If you only had a brain

Oh I, could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thought before
Then I'd sit, and think some more

I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and by merry
Life would be a dingle derry
If I only had a brain

Oh I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thought before
And then I'd sit, and think some more

I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and by merry
Life would be a dingle derry
If I only had a brain
