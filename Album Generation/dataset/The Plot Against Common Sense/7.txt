Different bodies - similar minds
Where will we go now - now we're alive?
Fasten your proteins - fatten your thighs
Different bodies - similar minds

Bob do it
Bob do it to me
Bob do it
Bob do it

Quantum mechanics - my only vice
Show me your raincloud - bring it inside
Make it eternal - make it exist
Different bodies - forever forever forever forever

Bob do it
Bob do it to me
Bob do it
Bob do it

Old stones collected
In plastic bags on a bloody isle
Then placed in rows on the ocean floor
Your friend: polymers

Pulling me down and then I'm dead then I'm gone
They are pulling me down and then I'm dead then I'm gone
