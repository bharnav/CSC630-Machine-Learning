Sobriety demands
That my face ignore my hands
That my sweat destroy my grip
And leave me at the mercy of crows

There's money in it
Baking in the shit of a Saturday night
At last, a job to love
Now get 'em boys

(No one, no one, no one, no one, noonenoone)
(No one, no one, no one, no one, noonenoone)
(No one, no one, no one, no one, noonenoone)
(No one, no one, no one, no one)

No one will, no one will, no one will know
No one will tell if you carry it well
No one will care if you throw the bottles in your neighbour's garden twice a week

No one will, no one will, no one will know
No one will tell if you carry it well
No one will care if you throw the bottles in your neighbour's garden twice a week
(Twice a week)

Force my tongue down the back of her throat
In a silent place
Camp cams and Atlantic winds
Waiting for a biblical flood

I've got nothing on it
An intern has got nothing on me
I crack the code on the second go
Dragging my fists on the beggars (boys)

But no one will, no one will ever know
No one will, no one will ever know
Said no one will, no one will ever know

Drain yourself on Wednesday, prepare your liver for the weekend
Drain yourself on Wednesday, at midnight we begin
Drain yourself on Wednesday, prepare your liver for the weekend
Drain yourself on Wednesday, at midnight we begin

No one will, no one will, no one will know
No one will tell if you carry it well
No one will care if you throw the bottles in your neighbours garden twice a week

No one will, no one will, no one will know
No one will tell if you carry it well
No one will care if you throw the bottles in your neighbours garden twice a week

Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice a week
Twice
Twice
Twice
Twice
