I've got a place for the American base
Right in the middle of Rotherham's steel mills
Imagine the boost for the local economy
Like anybody cares about the north of England

But a failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget
A failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget

I've got a home for the Millennium Dome
A heart disease ward underwritten by McDonalds
You got funding while I got fat
On a training programme for type 2 diabetes

But a failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget
A failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget

I've got a hole for Sebastian Coe
Saddam Hussein won't be needing it now
Glue the beard on and wake him up
When London speaks then the north won't listen

But a failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget
A failed Olympic bid leaves some kids so upset
They can't forget
