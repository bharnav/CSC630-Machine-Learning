Dan, Dan, you're a good man
But you better not speak for me
I spent sixteen hours in a luggage rack
With these children at my feet
They thought I was Brazilian
They made me sign their boots
A special talent trapped inside
The body of a youth

The favelas of Nottingham are more
More than just a weekend in the sun
In the end he moved to Hull
First on loan and then on glue

Chris, this shouldn't change you
You'd be better off kept indoors
Cos as racist strikers go, my friend
You're the best this club has sold
And I have to say that woman
Was hardly innocent
Accepting drinks from animals
In lieu of paying rent

The favelas of Nottingham are more
More than just a weekend in the sun
In the end he moved to Hull
First on loan and then on glue

More than just a weekend in the sun
The shanty towns of Derby are more than an hour in a life
More than just a weekend in the sun
The rolling plains of Swindon are more than a line in a song
