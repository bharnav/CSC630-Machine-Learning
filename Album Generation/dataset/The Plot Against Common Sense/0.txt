Paralysed by paperwork
It took a special woman to commit
But Sheena is a clever girl
She paid for our equipment with her tits
She tore off her t-shirt
(I didn't know I wanted to
I didn't know I wanted to until I did)
Dumb is the new black

One of us - the sober one
Should sit her down and tell her how we feel
Cos Sheena is a slogan now
A comma in the common cattery
He made her a mix tape
(He didn't know he needed to
He didn't know he needed to until he did)
Dead is the new good

Autistic -tistic -tistic radio
Artistic licence (celebrate a bus pass)
Autistic -tistic -tistic radio
Artistic licence (melanoma shake-down)

Bring a bracket to the county fair
Does anyone here have the ear of the devil?
Or a piece of his hair?

This song is dedicated
To the merchandise manufacturers
Who made it possible
With their hard work, talent, application
And love of tote bags
