Camp Cappuccino
At forty seven degrees
Pray for me later
I'm heading for the beach at full speed
Psychic biplane
Moulded muffins on stalks
Camp Cappuccino
Never underestimate the power of cock
Now we're talking
At least you're moving your mouth
Camp Cappuccino
Vitamin deficiency trout
On the menu
But not approaching the plate
Camp Cappuccino
We could build a helipad and make a lot of money
We could build a helipad and make a lot of money

Camp Cappuccino
In 1973
They had better landslides
I still remember digging you free
No survivors
They used their berets as rafts
Camp Cappuccino
I hear they even partied as the island collapsed
That's the spirit
Give them something to mourn
Camp Cappuccino
Where even child abduction is wrong
Western values
They'll be the death of us all
Camp Cappuccino
We could build a helipad and make a lot of money
We could build a helipad and make a lot of money

The middle class
Took their petty cash
For the waiting staff
To blow...at Camp Cappuccino

We could bait the lion
But who would fix the futon?
