Three men walk into a caf√©
Take a corner booth - and wait for context
Excuse me madam, this service is a joke
I came in here for anecdotes and left with
Friends I'll never sing for

You're not just a punchline now
You're more than the end of something
Don't get found out

No fish - mother can't do seafood
Drop omega three - in her brandy
Waiter waiter, there's movement in my soup
I swear I saw the chicken making eyes across
The table at me

You're not just a punchline now
You're more than the end of something
Don't get found out

No way, you'll never find peace
You'll never find peace with the name they gave you
No way, you'll never find peace
You'll never find peace with the name you've got
No way, you'll never find peace
You'll never find peace with the name they gave you
No way, you'll never find peace
You'll never find peace with the name you've got
