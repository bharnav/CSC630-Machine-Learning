This is a song about breaking bread
With enemies of fantasy
The kind of one-note titty slaves
Who'd sooner die than think aloud
Civilised people don't fuck bears
Civilised people don't play fair
Civilised people don't hide cats in wells
Because the Sibyl says
Civilised people don't go grey
Civilised orgies twice a day
Civilised is as civilised does and civilised people walk among us
Given the option

History is written by the man who stays acquainted with
The thug who has the biggest sword
Conquest is the compromise between the borders of his mind
And waters of the Rubicon
This is a song about total war
Civilised people don't fuck bears
Civilised people don't play fair
Civilised people don't hide cats in wells
Because the Sibyl says
Civilised people don't go grey
Civilised orgies twice a day
Civilised is as civilised does and civilised people walk among us

Were they holy emperors?
Or were they horny actors?
Holy emperors? Horny actors?
Holy? Horny? Emperor penguins?
This is a song about total war

This is a song about common sense
Folded backwards into itself
