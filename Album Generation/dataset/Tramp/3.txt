True
Tell everyone you know
It's all we ask
If it were all up to me, i would say
Come up with these truths instead

You dig your own grave
You dig your own grave

Buried in masculine pain all the time
Envy all less, we know
Crazy. basic
In your own breath, you cough

Ooh, in your own breath
Ooh, in your own breath

Take on yourself
It's the only way i will breathe
Temples... temples...
In your own breath

Ooh, in your own breath
Ooh, in your own breath for me
