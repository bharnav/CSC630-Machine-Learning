[Verse 1]
It was a close call
Sitting in the back of the room
With a boy you could own
But they didn't know
Close in on my black eye
I feel safe at times
Certain emblems
Tell me it's time

[Chorus]
Serpents in my mind
Looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I don't want mine to this time

[Verse 2]
You enjoy sucking on dreams
So I will fall asleep with someone other than you
I had a thought you would take me seriously
And listen on

[Chorus]
Serpents in my mind
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes
In time
You'll stay frozen in time
Collaging girls
Controlling minds
You hold the mirror well
To everybody else

[Chorus]
Serpents in my mind
Trying to forgive your crimes
Everyone changes in time
I hope he changes this time
