Come home in the morning
Drive me to work
Tell me I'm worth all the miles
That you put on your car
I'll tell you I'm fine
Without you for a little while and then I'll work inside
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me it hasn't been that long

"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
To believe in any song you sing" --
Tell me this even though you can't believe it
Tell me I'm wrong to make it feel right again

Stay home
At night and read a book and finish songs
That I hum along to all the time with you
But I don't have words to say

Tell me I'm right
Tell me I'm funny
Even when I'm not
It rings and I feel your sum in the odds

"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
To believe in any song you sing" --
Tell me this even though you can't believe it
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me you're lonely
Tell me this song is not about you only
And I'm a lie

You know you've been gone long
"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
To believe in any song you sing" --
Tell me this even though you can't believe it

Tell me I'm wrong
Please tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm wrong
Please tell me I'm wrong
