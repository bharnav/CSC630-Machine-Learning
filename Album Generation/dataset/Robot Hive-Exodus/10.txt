After defying the grip of the hangman’s noose
And recovering my cognizance
Spun the compass North by Northwest
And took liberty out for a long slow dance
Took a good look around, what did I see?
A big red tent and people coming in like the tide of the sea
I ducked in to catch the shade, Preacher jump up all ablaze
“They say this year rock is coming back, Jack.
White gnashing teeth like wolves in the pack
Carnivorous, no mercy hon
There’s plenty here for everyone so come get you some!”

10,000 witnesses, show ‘em how it’s done, son
Fist full of cottonmouth, rock that podium
Walk on the ashes, no half stepping, kid
Their fans are flashing in expectation

All right now!

“They say this year rock is coming back, Jack
White gnashing teeth like wolves in the pack
Carnivorous, no mercy son
There’s plenty here for everyone so come get you some!”

Living on the lamb and all cut loose
Number of the Saints march on in
Gonna find my executioners
And show them exactly what it means to live
