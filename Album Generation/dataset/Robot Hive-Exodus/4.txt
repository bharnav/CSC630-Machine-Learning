Oh, but to just dance on steel, the Sky Pulaski way
By the fires of Elizabeth, never cease to amaze
So hats off to the industry’s casualties
Tra loo tray lay

Oh that swamp full of grabbing hands
Pull you under New Amsterdam
Chinese boxes hold their secrets well
How many are there one can never tell

Got to get religion, they gonna join that underground church
Even the mole people got to get religion
They gonna join that underground church

Art class for the bourgeoisies, lab rats for the cat
Real estate moguls, Chump Towers
When the wind blows you can hear the windows go rat a tat rat a tat tat tat

Jimmy Hoffa in the Meadowlands, weighing down that union man
Grab his ankles, stevedores
Oh how those Jets do roar

Got to get religion, they gonna join that underground church
Even the mole people got to get religion
They gonna join that underground church

Oh but to just dine on sewage, cold seagull pie
Wrestle albino alligators and spin the good lie

Oh that swamp full of grabbing hands
Pull you under New Amsterdam
Chinese boxes hold their secrets well
How many are there one can never tell

Got to get religion, they gonna join that underground church
Even the mole people got to get religion
They gonna join that underground church
