Ain’t no doubt Jesus sees us
Acting foolishly on American Band Stand
Agog with spastic baskets, the latest fashions
Here I am Here I am Here I am
But that chin music sound, oh how it drown
Gotta shake ‘em on down

Scaling up the heights of folly
Scaling up the heights of folly

Kill the lights and bring the music down. Everybody be quiet
Sudden movement on the Serengeti, get ready Freddy
Opportunity only knocks once
Never mind the fat ones, just go for the slow ones
See how they run see how they run see how they run

While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake
They shook you on down
When the rain start falling, boatman calling
Shake ‘em on down

The flood receding, the mountain appears
Send out the black bird, send out the dove.

You Babel rabble-rousers
In polyester trousers
Big bright cities
Ain’t no doubt Vishnu missed you, then Kali kissed you
Better get busy. Better get busy. Better get busy

Days get shorter, air gets colder
Tune on in to the N.O.A.A. radio
Scaling up the heights of folly
Scaling up the heights of folly

While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake
They shook you on down
When the rain start falling, boatman calling
Shake ‘em on down
While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake
They shook you on down
When the rain start falling, boatman calling
Shake ‘em on down

The flood receding, the mountain appears
Send out the black bird, send out the dove
