[Intro]
Please allow me to adjust my pants
So that I may dance the good time dance
And put the onlookers and innocent bystanders into a trance

[Verse One]
Give disease so the swine will marry and propagate lies
Tough luck for elected officials
The beast you see got fifty eyes
Bring it on home, spread the wealth
Play it cool, the hand’s been dealt
Now all the odds are in our favor
Save the victory speeches for later

[Hook]
Streets on fire, the mob goes wild

[Chorus]
21 guns
Box made of pine
Letter from the government sealed and signed
Delivered Federal Express on your mother’s doorstep
21 guns
Box made of pine
Letter from the government sealed and signed
Delivered Federal Express on your mother's doorstep

[Verse Two]
Condoleeza Rice is nice, but I prefer A-Roni
And that man on the T.V. who speaks to the dead, you know that man’s a phony
Everybody move to Canada and smoke lots of pot
Everybody move to Canada right now
Here’s how we do it:
Bum rush the border guard before he and his dog ever knew it

[Hook]
Streets on fire, the mob goes wild

[Chorus]
21 guns
Box made of pine
Letter from the government sealed and signed
Delivered Federal Express on your mother’s doorstep
