Waste away
I'm crawling blind
Followed by what I left inside
For you, just you
I'm caught in place
But I ignore
What I can't erase

I will run and hide until
Memories fade away
And I will leave behind a
Love so strong

Close my eyes
These voices stay
Haunting me, I can't escape
For you, just you
Time will always wait
While I throw away
What I can't replace

I will run and hide until
Memories fade away
And I will leave behind a
Love so strong

I will run and hide until
Memories fade away
And I will leave behind a
Love so strong

I will run and hide
And I will leave behind

I will run and hide until
Memories fade away
And I will leave behind a
Love so strong

I will never find
