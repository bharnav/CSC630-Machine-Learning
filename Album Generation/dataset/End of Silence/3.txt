Can I be dreaming once again?
I'm reaching helpless I descend
You lead me deeper through this maze
I'm not afraid, I'm

Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Everywhere I turn
I find something new
Lost in you
Something I can't fight
I can not escape
I could spend my life
Lost in you
Lost in you

Your whispers fill these empty halls
I'm searching for you as you call
I'm racing, chasing after you
I need you more, I'm

Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Everywhere I turn
I find something new
Lost in you
Something I can't fight
I can not escape
I could spend my life
Lost in you
Lost in you

I could never be the same
There's something that I
Never could erase
I could never look away
I've lost myself in you
It's all over now

Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Lost in you
Everywhere I run

Lost in you
Lost in you
