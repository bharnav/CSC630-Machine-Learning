You're here, trembling with fear
You made it clear
You turned your back and now you've gone astray
Nothing left to say
What's standing in your way?
You had the chance to never walk alone

But you gave it all away
When I needed you to stay
Just open up your arms I need you here
I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms I need you here!

Again, lying in your bed
Nightmares is in your head
Facing all that you just threw away
At the edge again
It's coming to an end
You had the chance to never walk alone

But you gave it all away
When I needed you to stay
Just open up your arms I need you here
I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms I need you
I need you, here!
Here!
I need you, here!
Here!

You gave it all away
I've needed you to stay
Just open up your arms
I need you here

I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms I need you here
But you gave it all away
When I needed you to stay
Just open up your arms I need you here
I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms I need you here!
Here!
