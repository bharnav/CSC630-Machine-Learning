I'm here again
A thousand miles away from you
A broken mess
Just scattered pieces of who I am

I tried so hard
Thought I could do this on my own
I've lost so much along the way

Then I see your face
I know I'm finally yours
I find everything
I thought I lost before

You call my name
I come to you in pieces
So you can make
Me whole

I've come undone
But you make sense of who I am
Like puzzle pieces in your eyes

Then I see your face
I know I'm finally yours
I find everything
I thought I lost before

You call my name
I come to you in pieces
So you can make
Me whole

I tried so hard
So hard
I tried so hard

Then I see your face
I know I'm finally yours
I find everything
I thought I lost before

You call my name
I come to you in pieces
So you can make
Me Whole

So you can make
Me whole
