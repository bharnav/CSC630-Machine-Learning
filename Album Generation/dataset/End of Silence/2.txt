[Verse 1]
You never go
Your always here (suffocating me)
Under my skin
I cannot run away
Fading slowly

[Hook]
I'd give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now
Nothing left to lose
Loving you again
I know it's already over, already over now

[Verse 2]
My best defense, running from you
I can't resist, take all you want from me
Breaking slowly

[Hook]
I'd give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now
Nothing left to lose
Loving you again
I know it's already over, already over now

[Verse 3]
You're all I'm reaching for
It's already over
All I'm reaching for!
It's already over now

I'd give it all to you
I offer up my soul
It's already over, already over now

[Hook]
Give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now
Nothing left to lose
Loving you again
I know it's already over now
It's already over now
I know it's already over, already over
