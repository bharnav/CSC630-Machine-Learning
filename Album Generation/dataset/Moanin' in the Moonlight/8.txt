They call me the Howlin' Wolf now
And you found me howlin' at your door
They call me the Howlin' Wolf now, baby
And you know you found me howlin' at your door
You know I love you, darlin'
Don't drive the wolf from your door
(Lord have mercy, darlin')
If God forgive me
I won't let you make me howl no more
If God forgive me
I won't let you make me howl no more
You want me to do like a wolf, baby
Drag my tracks out in the cold
Now Christmas eve is comin'
And you want me down on my bended knees
Now Christmas eve is comin' darlin'
And you want the wolf on his bended knees
You made me get your shoe, darlin'
You wanna drive poor me
