[Verse 1]
If you're a long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone
Somethin' just ain't right

[Chorus]
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

[Verse 2]
Well, long way from home and
Can't sleep at all
You know another mule
Is kickin' in your stall

[Chorus]
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

[Bridge]
You better catch him
'Cause somethin' wrong
In your home

[Verse 3]
Well, if you call her on the telephone
And she answers awful slow
Grab the first train smokin'
If you have to hobo

[Chorus]
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

[Verse 4]
If you make it to your house
Knock on the front door
Run 'round to the back
You'll catch him just before he go

[Chorus]
That's evil, evil is goin' on
I am warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home
