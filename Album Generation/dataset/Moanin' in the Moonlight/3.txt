When you left me this mornin'
You taken my heart away
When you left me this mornin'
You taken my heart away
That's allright baby
You will come back home someday
How long, baby, how long, how long
How long, baby, how long, how long
You know I love you
You started doin' me wrong
Well when you leave home
You can call me on your phone
Well when you leave home
You can call me on your phone
I'll sent you your money
Darlin' you come back home
Oh come back
How long, have you gone do me wrong
How long, have you gone do me wrong
Ain't nobody never lived that
Gettin' do somebody wrong
