How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life
How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life
Well the way you done, you gonna wreck my life
How many times, you gonna treat me like you do
How many more times, you gonna treat me like you do
You took all of my money, and all of my love too
Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go
Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go
You got yourself a young stud, and you can't stand me no more
I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes
I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes
For where I go nobody knows
