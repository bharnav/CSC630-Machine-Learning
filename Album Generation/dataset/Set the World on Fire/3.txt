One look and I am sold
You got me on my knees
You steal all my innocence
A love sick melody
Take me...

You always want the one that you can't have
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair
You are the best romance I've never had
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair

Your kiss a withered rose
Your lips have buried me
Hearts race the moments gone
We shared this fantasy
Take me....

You always want the one that you can't have
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair
You are the best romance I never had
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair

Kneel and pray for closure baby
This is the ride that we're on, oh
And I'm taking what you give me
Never want it to stop, I want it all
In this temporary love

You always want the one that you can't have
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair
You are the best romance I've never had
Cuz Love Isn't Always Fair
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh...
Love Isnt Always Fair
