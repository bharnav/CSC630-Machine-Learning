[Verse 1]
Saints born together
To fight against
The holy fables
The streets are
Where we pray
Hymns for the
Lonely
Wretched
And forgotten
The feeling in our hearts
Won't ever fade away

[Hook]
We stand tall
(United)
Watch them fall
(Divided)
Break the chains
And now we'll show them all
(Fight)

[Chorus]
Fight for all you know
When your back's
Against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life
Becomes a war
Set the world on fire

[Verse 2]
Sing out united
Against the ones
You left in hatred
Our message of today
Like children crying
When all they knew
Was dying
We will raise our flags up
It's time for them to pay

[Hook]
We stand tall
(United)
Watch them fall
(Divided)
Break the chains
And now we'll show them all
(Fight)

[Chorus]
Fight for all you know
When your back's
Against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life
Becomes a war
Set the world on fire

[Bridge]
So sing aloud
You hold the key
We're the rebels
And we're free
It's time to burn
All that you see
Now the world
Belongs to me

[Jake Pitts guitar solo]


[Chorus]
Fight for all you know
When your back's
Against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life
Becomes a war
Set the world on fire
Proud in all you are
Showing every scar
As your badge of honor
When you can't take anymore
Of what they're living for
Set the world on fire
