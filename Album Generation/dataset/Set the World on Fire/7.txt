Racing faster, escape disaster
Partners in crime will leave their mark
We make our own way
Not thoughts of yesterday
Black hearts of chrome and battle scars
(Chrome and battle scars)

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings
Rose from the streets
With our hand on destiny

We came from nothing
But promised one thing
We'll change the world with these guitars
So listen closely
And don't stop working
No one can tell you who you are
(Tell you who you are)

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings
Rose from the streets
With our hand on destiny

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings
Rose from the streets
With our hand on destiny

Go!
Run, (Run!) never look back
Run, (Run!) never look back
Run, run, run
Never look back

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings
Rose from the streets
With our hand on destiny
The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings
Rose from the streets
With our hand on destiny
