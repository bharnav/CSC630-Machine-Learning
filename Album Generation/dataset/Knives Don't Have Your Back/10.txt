To never open a book, always reading a magazine
Outspend betting, if it looks like winning
You haven't been

Knives don't have your back
I wait and I count
But knives don't have your back
I wait and I count to the last breath we take
What we made doesn't make sense
What's a wolf without a pack?
Open your chest and take the heart from it
Open your chest:
What's bad? We'll fix it
What's wrong? We'll make it all right
All right, it's gone, we'll find it
Takes so long, we've got time
All the time

Some part of you, too small to lose
Some part of you, too small to lose
All of us, all of you
All of us, all of you
Counting to the last breath we take
What we made doesn't make sense
What's a wolf without a pack?
Open your chest and take the heart from it
When you talk, can I tape you?
How'd you get what we don't know?
We don't know how to help
Only know how to hound
Nose to the grindstone
Grindstone to the ground

Don't even visit that place
They'll sharpen their teeth on your smile
I'm glad you didn't
All our songs will be lullabies in no time

What's bad? What's wrong? Make it all right
All right, it's gone, so long
We've got time, all the time
All the time
