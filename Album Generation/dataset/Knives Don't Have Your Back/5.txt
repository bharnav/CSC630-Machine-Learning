Bros before hoes
Disagree on the sidelines

Fight for a fee
The man needs a maid
The maid needs a maid

Bros before hoes
Is a rule, read the guidelines

You trouble me
Your breasts heave when you sing
Your mouth should be working for me
For free

Sewing up the fold
'Cause I've been laid up
Would you put on the fire for me
Draw the bath and remind me to eat?
You won't need a real job
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you
You could be a good wife to me

I would love to pay for you
You are the maid for me
