I only wanted what everyone wanted since bras started burning up ribs in the sixties
Favors are flying, faces are falling and all I desire is to never be waiting
If that's a crime, let's commit it
There's a new crime, sexual suicide

When our underwire radio tears into their international airwaves
Boredom will die, ears will bleed
And all they'll desire is to give, and to please...

There's a new crime, sexual suicide
There's a new crime, let's commit it
While we're waiting on the next day
To begin it in the best way
There's a new crime, sexual suicide
There's a new crime, let's commit it

Don't worry Heather, about forever
Don't worry about me;
It's the lottery, baby, everybody roll the dice
It's the lottery, baby, everybody roll the dice

Will we always be like little kids
Running group to group, asking
"Who loves me? Don't know who loves me."
It's pathetic, it's impossible
Like girls in stilettos
Like girls in stilettos
Like girls in stilettos trying to run
