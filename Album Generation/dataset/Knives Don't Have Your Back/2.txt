Cursed with a love that you can't express
It's not for a fuck or a kiss
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely
Everywhere and every way I see you with me

Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach

If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been

Are we breathing, are we breathing, are we wasting our breath?
It won't be enough to be rich

All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming
"The life that you thought through is gone."
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood
I wake up lonely

Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach

If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
When you phone me tell me everything I did
If I'm sorry you lost me you'd better make it quick
'Cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live
It's late where you live

Rather give the world away than wake up lonely
Everywhere and every way I see you with me

All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming
"The life that you thought through is gone."
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood
I wake up lonely
I wake up lonely
