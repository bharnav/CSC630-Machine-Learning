Young, thought as I was
Thought as I was
Thought as I was

Done, thought as I was
Thought as I was
Thought as I was

Get
Get the line down
Get the line down
Get the line down
Don't elaborate like that
You frighten off the frat boys
Use your baby talk
Frighten off, frighten on

This fall the blues are brown
So turn your horse around now
The blues are brown
Missing, mostly waving
Thought as I was
Done, thought as I was
Young, thought as I was
