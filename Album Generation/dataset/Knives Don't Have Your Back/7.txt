Who's in a bad mood?
Who's in a taxi?
Turning the clock back
Avoiding a fight with this man
He is meeting, stands in the lobby
Counting his questions in the neon light

Sinking under the river
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
Back to the beach where
A family is waiting
On rumors of summer
Lay out a blanket
Bring something to feed the birds

With all the luck you've had, why are your songs so sad?
Sing from a book you were reading in bed and took to heart
All of your lives unled, reading in bed
