First went wrong is hard to find
We're paralyzed, we apologize; our hell is a good life
Last went wrong but where's my prize, under the lights?
Can we call it in? We'll be on the road
Can we stop? When we stop
My back will turn your face towards the fence
What I thought it was it isn't now
What I thought it was it isn't now

All this weight is honest worse
We're moderate; we modernize 'til our hell is a good life
All we know is to forget how to do right
Colouring in the black hole. Can we stop?
When we stop my hands will shake
My eyes will burn, my throat will ache
Watching you turn from me towards your friends

What I thought it was it isn't now
What I thought it was it isn't
Punishment to stall what is done
What I thought was in this is missing out
What I thought it was it isn't now

There's a pattern in the system
There's a bullet in the gun
That's why I tried to save you, but it can't be done
It can't be done
