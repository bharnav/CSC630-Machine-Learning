Sketch of your faces I still don't know you aren't permanent, permanent
You want all of our moments stolen
Blind alleys and hallways to basements
How you gonna' hide 'till you disappear?
Because nothing and nowhere is golden

Apartments are cages, I still don't know what is permanent, permanent
Maybe all my possessions were precious
Truth is all my possessions I somehow lost them
Been traveling so light when we're floating by
Seems nothing and nowhere is golden

Some say we're lost in space
Some say we're falling off the page
Some say our life is insane
But it isn't insane on paper

Playgrounds are graveyards, and all of our scars are permanent, permanent
There's no replacement for places
I'll always love you, you're mine
Numb is the new high, old memories die out, 'till
Nothing and nowhere is golden

Some say we always only want to get off
Some say our hands are much too soft
Some say our life is insane
But it isn't insane on paper

Some say our hair is in our eyes
Some say we're out of our little minds
Some say our life is insane
But it isn't insane on paper to have to ask
