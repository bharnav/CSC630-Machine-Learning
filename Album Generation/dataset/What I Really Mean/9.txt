One day after twenty-five years
Head of service at the local Sears
Helen Walker put her pencil down and walked away
And all they found was a little note
'Adios' was all she wrote
But as she left, someone heard her say

"Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride"

Saturday night I was down at Joe's
He was moppin' up gettin' ready to close
He sat down and poured me one last brew
And he said to me with a sideways glance
"If I ever get the chance
I'm gonna sell this joint, and this is what I'll do"

"Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride"

I suppose I could stay
In this little town 'til my dying day
But in my heart I know I've gotta go
So I'm standin' at the station waitin' for the train
Don't know when I'll be back again
Mr. Engineer, won't you let your whistle blow

Got me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride

As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride
Gonna ride, ride, ride
