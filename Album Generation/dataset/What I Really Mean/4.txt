I'm looking for somebody who might have come this-a-way
Could have been an hour ago, or maybe yesterday
She's pretty as a flower and shining as a star
I never thought she'd ever come so far

I'm tryin' to find a woman, friendly as can be
She's never met a stranger, I'm sure you would agree
And if you got to talkin', she probably made you laugh
Here she is in this photograph

We were the wild ones
The young guns
Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

I went on the road alone and left her there behind
I was thinkin' of myself, she said she didn't mind
But love is like a songbird and every song she sings
You'll hear a sweet reminder of her wings

We were the wild ones
The young guns
Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

Maybe she's across the street or half a world away
I've got to find her if only just to say...

We were the wild ones
The young guns
Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

We're the wild ones
We're the wild ones
