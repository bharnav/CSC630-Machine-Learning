One night as I lay on my pillow
Moon shining bright as the dawn
I saw a man come-a-walkin'
He had a long chain on

I heard his chain a clankin'
It made a mournful sound
Welded around his body
Dragging along on the ground

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

He came up to my window
He looked at me and he said
"I am so tired and hungry
Give me a bite of your bread"

He did not look like a robber
He didn't look like a thief
His face was all covered in sadness
He had a voice full of sorrow and grief

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

I went into my kitchen
Got him a bowl full of meat
A drink and a pan of cold biscuits
That's all I had for him to eat

And though he was tired and hungry
A bright light came over his face
He bowed his head on his bosom
He made a beautiful grace

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

(Long chain, long chain, long chain)
(He had a long chain on)
(Long chain, long chain, long chain)
(He had a long chain on)

I fetched my chisel and hammer
Offered to set him free
He shook his head and said sadly
Guess we had best let it be

When he had finished his supper
He thanked me again and again
And though it's been years since I saw him
I still hear the rattle of his chain

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
