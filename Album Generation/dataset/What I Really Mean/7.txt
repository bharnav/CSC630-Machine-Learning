She said she never really loved you
Guess ya knew it all along
Still you're willing to take the blame
For everything that went wrong
Now there's an ugly little pistol on the table
And a letter in your hand
When the sun goes down this evening
It won't come up again

'Cause when you love somebody
Like you loved that girl
And she breaks your heart
She'll leave you on the dark side of the world
On the dark side of the world

She said she never really thought to
Tell you how the story ends
Come what may and any how
You can still be friends
Now your dogtags are laying on the window sill
And there's a cool breeze blowin' in
When the lights go out tonight
They won't come on again

'Cause when you love somebody
Like you loved that girl
And she breaks your heart
She'll leave you on the dark side of the world
On the dark side of the world

'Cause when you love somebody
Like you loved that girl
And she breaks your heart
She'll leave you on the dark side of the world
On the dark side of the world
On the dark side of the world
On... mmmmm
