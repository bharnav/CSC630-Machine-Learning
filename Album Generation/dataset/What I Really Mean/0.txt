When the sun goes down on the wild frontier
The stars come out so bright and clear
That big round moon shines down from above
The wind sings a tune on this night right for love

I hold you near as we lie in the dark
And all that I hear is the beat of your heart
Like the sound of the wind on the wings of a dove
There's no need to pretend on this night right for love

I've been a lonely rider on a road so dark and long
With no one to provide the kind of love to carry on
You set my soul on fire like no one else before
And I thank my lucky stars tonight I ride alone no more

And I know the wheels beneath us will roll
And time surely steals this moment we hold
But tonight is the night that dreams are made of
Beneath the moonlight on this night right for love
Underneath the moonlight on this night for love
