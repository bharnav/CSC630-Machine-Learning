Crow Jane, and Crow Jane, and Crow Jane
Don't you hold your head too high
Someday, baby you know you got to die

I'm gonna buy me a pistol
Long as I am tall
Shoot Crow Jane just to see her fall

There's a reason I told Crow Jane
Don't you hold your head so high
Someday, baby you know you got to die
You got to lay down, and die
Lay down

Yes, I dug her grave
With a silver spade
Ain't nobody gon' take Crow Jane's place

I wanna dig her grave
With a silver spade
I ain't gonna let nobody take her place

There's a reason I told Crow Jane
Don't you hold your head so high
Someday, baby you know you got to die
Crow Jane, Crow Jane

You never missed your water
'Til your well run dry
I didn't missed Crow Jane until the day she died

There's a reason I told Crow Jane
Don't you hold your head so high
Someday, baby you know you got to die

Gonna lay down and die
