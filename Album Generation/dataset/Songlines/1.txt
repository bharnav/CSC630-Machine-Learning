There comes a time
In each man's life
To find your way
Or fall behind
Who you are
Is the path you take
And I'll find my way
Through your mistake
Sometimes your tears
Are your bridge to the sky
But you can't trust souls
With no truth in their eyes

Time will heal
And all we know
If nothing's learned
Nothing grows
Time will heal
For all we know
Everything stays the same
Nothing changes

A man's not a man
When he takes the lower road
Dragging his tail
To cover his tracks
When you plant the seeds
Of doubt in my mind
You run the risk
Of being left behind
When I turn the mirror
On myself
I can see your way
Was a cry for help

Time will heal
And all we know
If nothing's learned
Nothing grows
Time will heal
For all we know
Everything stays the same
Nothing changes
