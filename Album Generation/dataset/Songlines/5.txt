Sailing on, sailing on
I can hear sweet voices singing
Hear sweet music playing
Sailing on, sailing on
I wish you were here with me while I'm sailing on

Well the spring, summer, autumn, and winter
All I know, you're gonna lay your head on my pillow
Morning, noon, and night; spring, summer, autumn, winter
All I know, you're gonna tell me what you prefer

Sailing on, Sailing on
I wish you were here with me while I'm sailing on

Everybody clap your hands

Sailing on, sailing on
I wish you could be with me when I...
Sailing on

Everybody clap your hands
