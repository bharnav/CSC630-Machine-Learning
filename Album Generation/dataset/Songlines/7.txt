I stepped out
Over and over again
Standing my ground
Even though I know I can't win
I'm tired
Of you messing up my time
You got yours
Let me, let me have mine
I'd rather be blind, crippled, and crazy
Somewhere, pushing up daisies
Than to let you break my heart
All over again
Break a man's heart
All you need is pain
You got me so messed up
About to go insane
You break a man's heart
Don't say nothing to him
I can't bask in myself
What you wanna do it, why you wanna do it
I'd rather be blind, crippled, and crazy
Somewhere, pushing up daisies
Than to let you break my heart
All over again
