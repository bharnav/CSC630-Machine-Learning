People, it's just a dream away
I see us walking to a better day
It'll be alright when tomorrow comes
I feel the heat of a revolution

One world forever
One world I see
One world forever and ever
It's alright with me

Daylight coming like a wonder drug
You've got to live for what you love
It'll be alright when tomorrow comes
I feel the beat of a revolution

One world forever
One world I see
One world forever and ever
It's alright with me
