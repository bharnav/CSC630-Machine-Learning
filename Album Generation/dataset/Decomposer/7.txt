You may, you may wake
Lazier than the furniture
Lazier than the furniture
Lazier than the furniture, Lazier than the furniture

You may, you may wake
You may, you may wake
You may, you may wake
To a change of heart, with the same old name
(same old name)

Lazier than the furniture
Lazier than the furniture
Lazier than the furniture, Lazier than the furniture

You may, you may wake
Cause e. von dahl and the twist of fate
To your candles and cake and the doors break

Lazier than the furniture, Lazier than the furniture

You may, you may wake
Lazier than the furniture
You may, you may wake
Lazier than the furniture
You may, you may wake
Lazier than the furniture
Lazier than the furniture, Lazier than the furniture
