Drive, drive, drive, d-d-drive, drive, drive

Driving fast
To impress
Or not
Words just slip
Or trip over
Over lips

Car drive west
(car drive west)
Sex drive thoughts
Sex (drive)

What we know about sex
Learned from alcohol
What we know about sex
Learned from bathroom walls
We know about love
What little we know about love
What we know 'bout love
What little we know about love
Stole from rock and roll

Driving past
Spots to slut
Or talk
Fingertips slip and
Trip over
Hems and zips

What we know about sex
Learned from alcohol
What we know about sex
Learned from bathroom walls
We know about love
What little we know about love
What we know 'bout love
What little we know about love
Stole from rock and roll

Nervous tic, nervous talk
A glance, a grope, a giggle, a cough, a breath, a bust, a touch
A pause a lust a

What we know about sex
Learned from alcohol
What we know about sex, yeah
Learned from bathroom walls
We know about love
(what we know about, what we know about it)
What little we know about love
(what we know about, what we know about it)
What we know 'bout love
(what we know about, what we know about it)
What little we know about love
Stole from rock and roll
