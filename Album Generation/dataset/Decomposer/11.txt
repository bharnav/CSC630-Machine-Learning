Come, come skinny
Come, come
Come bring a trend
And come nearly naked
Come hungry
Come shaking
Come faking
A perfect grin
Now that's a face
A face fit for breeding
Keep waist fit
No feeding
The Lens won't
Always be watching

So shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me in the smile
I'm going out of style
Oh shoot me, shoot me
Shoot me in the smile
I'm going out of style

Come, come fit in
Come, come, now I fit in
Yeah, I fit in the right size
Standard like white guys
And French fries
I bat these eyes
I bat them black
Nose bleeds like a hangnail
Desperate like a bake sale
Going stale, I am going stale

What can you compromise besides everything?
For fleeting form worth remembering
So skinny, so pretty, so hard to be
Just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot me

So work with me baby
Gimme a smile

Come, come skinny
Come, come
Come skinny
Come, come
Skinny
Come
