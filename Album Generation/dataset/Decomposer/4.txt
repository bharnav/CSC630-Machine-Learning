Little maggots, maggots whose parents, parents fed me full
Grown and living, inhabiting comfortably my skull
Dust to dust and justice is, is for us all and all's for null

May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you

Waving in the distance, waving (ha ha ha)
Waving in the minutes, waning (ha ha ha)
Waiting for this to make sense, waiting
Stop waving back, I'm drowning

May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you, you

Little maggots, maggots whose parents, parents fed me full
Grown and living, inhabiting comfortably my skull
Dust to dust and justice is, is for us all and all's for...
Nothing, fucking zero

May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you
May your organs fail before your dreams fail you

Waving in the distance, waving (hey, I'm drowning)
Waving in the minutes, waning (hey, I'm drowning)
Waiting for this to make sense, waiting
Stop waving back, I'm drowning
