We before there was we (x2)
She only she
Me merely me
Lonely

Walking, walk, walking away
Just to lift a leg to start is the hardest part
I turn and trip on my clumsy heart
I always trip on my clumsy heart

We before there was we
She only she
Me merely me
Lonely
Lonely only

We before there was we
She only she
Me merely me
Lonely
Lonely only in our diaries

We were in two halves
We didn't quite match
She ground down my corners
Kissed me for the foreigners
Spilling their drinks
Down the nicest clothes they packed

Walking, walk, walking away
Just to lift a leg to start is the hardest part
I turn and trip on my clumsy heart
I always trip on my clumsy heart
On my clumsy heart

She always just inches from me
Inches on a map, distance or destiny?
Will you will, will me away?
Goodbye is no good, time to say you should stay
I know a dive hiring nights near Japantown

We then there was we
Calls only cost cellular fees
We tragically reread entries
We then there was we
Calls only cost cellular fees
We tragically reread entries in our diaries

We were terminal at the terminal
We shed all our metal, kissed me for the federales
Scanning our bags for contraband and blades

Walking, walk, walking away
Walking is the hardest part

Walking, walk, walking away
Just to lift a leg to start is the hardest part
I turn and trip on my clumsy heart
I always trip on my clumsy heart

Walking, walk
I always trip
Walking, walk
On my clumsy heart
Walking, walk
I always trip
Goodbye is no good
Time to say you should stay
