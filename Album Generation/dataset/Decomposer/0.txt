Do you belong to a song?
Does it drag you along by the tongue at the top of your lungs?
Are you drunk? Have you been drinking?

Do you below the overpass go?
With the filth in your fist reminiscing the kiss of a love
That just didn't love as much as you did

But please don't give up dear walls
Don't let the ceiling fall
When you belong to a song, salty eyes
You belong

Shrill notes begin the grim violin
Then from the silence, a violence of sirens orchestrate the score
To which one more corpse is left quiet

How we've become the hollows of drums
The rest between notes and the hollers that never reach throats
Friends in quotes, they're not calling

But please don't give up dear you
I'll bet the sliver moon's sliding through
When you belong to a song, salty eyes
You belong

Do please believe however naive
They may drag you along by the tongue at the top of your lungs
And belong salty eyes

When you belong to a song, salty eyes
You belong
