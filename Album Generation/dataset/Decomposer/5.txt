[Verse 1]
Of a face full of words you'd think a few would be right (right)
And with a few tips of courage you'd think my lips less tight (right)
Shattered passenger window beside itself on the floor
They can take my stereo, but you can't take me for a kid anymore

[Chorus]
I'm going back to your house
Back from the dead
Why can't I forget what Katie said?
You've got standards, girl
What the hell are you doing with me?

[Verse 2]
STD payphone hanging off my face
The roomie's got me on hold
And damn, why am I such a disgrace?
With a fist full of change and absolutely no sense
What little I've learned about love is at my pride's expense

[Chorus]
I'm going back to your house
Back from the dead
Why can't I forget what Katie said?
You've got standards, girl
What the hell are you doing with me?

I'm going back to your house
Back from the dead
Why can't I forget what Katie said?
You've got standards, girl
What the hell are you doing with me?

[Bridge]
You always know the latest place to be
With your waved-at friends and your waved-at fees
Your neon eyes blinking vacancy, baby, baby
You've always been the latest thing to be
With your guest-list girls and their listless pleas
Hear hear, three cheers for your apathy

[Chorus]
I'm going back to your house
Back from the dead
Why can't I forget what Katie said?
You've got standards, girl
What the hell are you doing with me?

[Outro]
I'm going back to your house
Back from the dead
Maybe I'll forget what Katie said
You've got standards, girl
What the hell are you doing with me?
Yeah, what the hell are you doing with me?
What's a decent girl doing with me?
