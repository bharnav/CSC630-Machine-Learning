[Verse]
Oh I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crest is flowing
And run across the valley beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one knows the names of
And when it's time I'll go
And wait beside a legendary fountain
Till I see your form reflected
In it's clear and jewelled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another
I will want to die beneath the white cascading waters
She may beg, she may plead
She may argue with her logic
And then she'll know the things I learned
That really have no value
In the end she will surely know
I wasn't born to follow
