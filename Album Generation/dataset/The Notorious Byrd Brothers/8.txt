[Verse 1:]
She'll hand to you a stick of sandalwood
A little smile and then she'll disappear
Back into a crowd of happy people
Looking like they never came from here

[Chorus:]
Strange thing, gathering of tribes[x2]

[Verse 2:]
A Macedonian and a pilot comes
A' laughing at a German jest or joke
A friendly motorcycle angel comes
To sit and talk awhile and share a smoke

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Pretty little whirling butterfly
All the prettiest girls go dancing by
Caught up in the sound of talking drums
Lost herself out in the wheel of sound

[Chorus]
