They....heard the sound of the snow falling They
Left the house and, started running They
Ran past the street where they fluffed their lines Where
Chemistries slowly redesigned All
The way the, calender froze on even number Kat
Caught the tones of the cold corner All
The way they, could see it going All
The way ist, temprature fahrenheit, sanction A
Transparent sound mapping, distraction All
The way it, would be forever All
The way All

The way they, heard the sound of the snow falling They
Left the house and started running Im
Gonna let you know when it's time to be leaving Don't
Run the, same goes for company this evening You
Come here and, i disappear Some
How i see something i fear Maybe
We'll make someones souvenir All
The way they, heard the sound of the snow falling
