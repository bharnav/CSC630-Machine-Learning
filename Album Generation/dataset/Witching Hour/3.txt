[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Broken glass is luxury
Friendly fires or alchemy

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft power

[Chorus 1: Helen Marnie]
We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills for us

[Verse 3: Helen Marnie]
Close your eyes so you're not seeing
And valentine's daydream

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills (witching hour) for us (soft power)

[Verse 4: Helen Marnie & Mira Aroyo]
The hourglass of the forests
Setting fire to the tourists

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie & Mira Aroyo]
We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills (witching hour) for us (soft power)

[Interlude]

[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Broken glass is luxury
Friendly fires or alchemy

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft power
