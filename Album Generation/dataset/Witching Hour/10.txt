[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
Loneliness a guarantee

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me

[Verse 3: Helen Marnie]
Try to get out of the lease
And to move out of love
If only there was no consequence
I'd watch it all turn to dust

[Chorus 1: Helen Marnie]
Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2?
Hey can I go with you, when the rendezvous' over?
It's over

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2?
Hey can I go with you, when the rendezvous' over?

[Outro: Helen Marnie]
Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2
My beauty number 2, his beauty number...
Hey can I go with you, when this rendezvous'
When this rendezvous', when the rendevous'...
When the rendevous' over
It's not over, no, it's not over
