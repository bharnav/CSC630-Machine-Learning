[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Woke up in the evening
To the sound of screaming
Through the walls it was bleeding
All over me

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Helen Marnie]
Grown tired of the show coast
And the ones that we toast
There are already zeroes
Around here

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

[Refrain 1: Helen Marnie]
Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's end it here

[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Woke up in the evening
To the sound of screaming
Through the walls it was bleeding
All over me

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

[Refrain 2: Helen Marnie]
Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's leave it here
Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's leave it here
