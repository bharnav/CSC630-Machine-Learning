[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Black sun rising
New day dawning
Amplifying and destroying

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Tender talons
Chase new horizons
Masquerading
Black sun rising

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

[Verse 3: Helen Marnie]
Silent movers
Black medusa
Perfect timing
Hallow morning

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

[Verse 4: Helen Marnie]
Sickness fading
Darkness falling
New day dawning
Black sun rising

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise
