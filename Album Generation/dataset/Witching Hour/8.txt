[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Merging away like we did yesterday, wrong direction
The traffic we'll know the traffic is slow and thoughtless
The wheel that is still on the concrete and green, Away home
And it is alone, a division unknown, a split decision

[Interlude 1: Helen Marnie]
Climbing the floors and I'm not running
Through revolving doors and you're not driving
The barrier stands between your hands and me, sorry

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
You said I made, you said, you said I made, a bad decision
Said I made a mistake, fatal without the recognition
But how would I know, know of that consequence, had I foreseen
I kiss you in vain, our California hates, had I'd not been

[Interlude 2: Helen Marnie]
Closing the doors and I am running
Past video stores and you are driving
A barrier stands between your hands and me, sorry

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
