[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
When they come out to find you
And they cannot describe you
Someone somewhere has to buy you out of your weekend

[Pre-Chorus 1: Helen Marnie]
Friday is the fever
And Monday the destroyer
You are a permanent feature
Perpetual weekend

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
And on the wire in the morning, there's a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
When they come out to find you
And they can multiply you
Someone's been caught in the crossfire
Of your weekend

[Pre-Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
Friday is the teacher
And Monday the tormentor
You are a new kind of creature
Perpetual weekend

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
And on the wire in the morning, there's a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend

[Bridge: Helen Marnie]
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end out of the weekend

[Interlude: Helen Marnie]
You are a permanent feature
You are a new kind of creature

[Outro: Helen Marnie]
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
