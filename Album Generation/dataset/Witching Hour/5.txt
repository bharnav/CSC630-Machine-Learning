[Verse 1: Mira Aroyo]
Films will come and films will go
That kiss on your neck won't show

[Verse 2: Mira Aroyo]
Posing at the same place everytime
When you're still speaking in the sunshine

[Chorus 1: Mira Aroyo]
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go

[Verse 3: Mira Aroyo]
Posing at the same place to put things right
In your eyes, we're meeting in the morning light

[Verse 4: Mira Aroyo]
You've done it again, you've done it before
That kiss on your neck won't show

[Chorus 1: Mira Aroyo]
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go

[Chorus 2: Mira Aroyo]
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Loose change from your pocket on the floor
Please don't say you've got to go

[Verse 5: Mira Aroyo]
Cheap thrills that this time I clasp
Cheap thrills that you'll dream about

[Verse 4: Mira Aroyo]
You've done it again, you've done it before
That kiss on your neck won't show

[Chorus 1: Mira Aroyo]
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go

[Chorus 2: Mira Aroyo]
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Loose change from your pocket on the floor
Please don't say you've got to go
