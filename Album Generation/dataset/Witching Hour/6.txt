[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Post-Chorus 1: Helen Marnie]
We got the signal to leave you alone
I'm not trying to leave you, I'm not trying to find you

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Post-Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
We got the signal to leave you alone
And that's where we'll leave you, and that's where we'll find you

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

[Post-Chorus 3: Helen Marnie]
We got the signal to leave you alone
And that's where we'd leave you, and that's where we'd find you

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
If I'd give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?
