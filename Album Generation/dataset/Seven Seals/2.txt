The time has come, the end is near
A fire storm
The curse is done, my search is over
The altar of souls

Don't wanna be the one to live in fear
Seven angels getting near
Don't wanna be the one, get out of here
With moonlight's calling

The final day the sky will fall down
And we might all drown
And seven seals will break
The final day will end in sorrow
There's no tomorrow
The seven seals will break

From peace tough death, holy and true
The noise of thunder
The skies of Hell unfell to Earth
Another wonder

Don't wanna be the one to live in fear
Seven angels getting near
Don't wanna be the one, get out of here
With moonlight's calling

The final day the sky will fall down
And we might all drown
If seven seals will break
The final day will end in sorrow
As no tomorrow
If seven seals will break

The final day the sky will fall down
And we might all drown
If seven seals will break
The final day will end in sorrow
There's no tomorrow
If seven seals will break

The final day the sky will fall down
And we might all drown
If seven seals will break
The final day will end in sorrow
There's no tomorrow
If seven seals will break
