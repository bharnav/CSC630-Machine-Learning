The devil is dealing
With illusions and dreams
He takes no money that is sure

Gave in to temptation
The contract is done
Now I'm caught there's no cure

Haunted by demons from hell
A slave to the evil

I live under evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under evil spell

Once you've made the deal
You're a creature cold and blind
The room of damnation has no way out
No no

A cold hearted beast
I'm not dead nor alive
My soul is rotten to the core

Haunted by demons from hell
A slave to the evil

I live under evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under evil spell

I live under evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under evil spell

I live under evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under evil spell
