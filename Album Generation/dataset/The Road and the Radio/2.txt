[Verse 1]
Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

[Verse 2]
Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
An' I know it might sound crazy

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

[Break]
Today, today, today
Today, today, today

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
The only thing that gives me hope
Is I know I'll see you again someday

Someday, someday, someday
