[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while

[Chorus]
Clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio

[Verse 2]
Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme
Threw up a prayer just looking, just looking for a sign

[Chorus]
And some clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio

[Chorus]
In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
The road and the radio

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
Mmm-mmm-mmm
