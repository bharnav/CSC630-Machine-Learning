[Verse 1]
Same old bedroom floor
Same old empty sheets
I hate this haunted bed
So down here's where I sleep

Trying to find a place
To hide what you have left
Some things never change
My heart hasn't yet

[Chorus]
Well I don't want to go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home
Can't somebody take me home

[Verse 2]
The hope that we had left
Wrapped around your ring
That river just rolled on by
When I watched it sink

[Chorus]
Well I don't want to go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home
Can't somebody take me

[Verse 3]
Out of this bar
Out of this heartache
Out of this town
That just keeps breaking down
Keeps breaking down

[Chorus]
Well I don't want to go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home

[Chorus]
I don't want to go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home
Can't somebody take me home
Won't you take me home
