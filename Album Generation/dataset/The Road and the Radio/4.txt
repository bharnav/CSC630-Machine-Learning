[Verse 1]
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Verse 2]
Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Bridge]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

[Pre-Chorus]
Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime
