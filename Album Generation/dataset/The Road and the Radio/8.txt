[Verse 1]
South of the border. American dollars
Take you a long, long way
Beach side bungalows, sand between your toes
Nobody knows your name
There's a worm at the bottom of a bottle
That's well within my reach
And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke
As soon as he and I meet

[Chorus]
Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

[Verse 2]
Madam Tequila's a fine senoriata
All my compadres concur
She won't lie, she won't leave in your hour of need
So we're raising our glasses to her

They say "valmos hecharlo el traga"
It means "drink it all down 'til you see
The bottom of the glass and it's kicking your a**"
Boys, the next round's on me

[Chorus]
Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

[Outro]
Oh  oh  oh
