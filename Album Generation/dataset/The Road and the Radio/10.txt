[Verse 1]
Driving down the road again
A highway that never ends
Taking naps in my old car
Singing in guitar bars
Killing time with cafe queens
And truckers playing slot machines
I meet a lot of wannabes
Dreaming big and living free like me

Charlie runs the Produce Shack
Living in a van out back
Selling peas and homemade syrup
Cantaloupes and Elvis shirts
Bragging on future plans
With whiskey breath and shaky hands
I meet a lot of wannabes
Dreaming big and living free like me

[Chorus]
Wearing wrinkled traveling clothes
To another one-night show
'Cause that's where I was born to be
Have guitar, will travel light
Here today and gone tonight
Playing this lifetime lottery

[Verse 2]
Here's to faces I have seen
A carnival of those who dream
Rodeos seeking fame
Table dancers I can't name
Willie T. in Abilene
Karaoke's all-time king
And every six string wannabe
Dreaming big and living free like me

[Chorus]
Wearing wrinkled traveling clothes
To another one-night show
'Cause that's where I was born to be
Have guitar, will travel light
Here today and gone tonight
Playing this lifetime lottery

[Verse 3]
To every dreamer I have known
May Lady Luck take you home
I pray for every wannabe
Dreaming big and living free like me
I pray for every wannabe
Dreaming big and living free like me

[Outro]
Living free like me
Living free like me
Living free like me
