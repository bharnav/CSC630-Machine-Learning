Creeping into town with all these changes in my head
Funny how my old haunts all look new
Taxi from the airport to the Paris end of King
I'll drop my bag to see who's in

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Here I am
In your arms again

It's easy being famous in Sydney
Cos everyone's a star
But its gotta be deepest, darkest night
For you to see them all

There's beer, and women even for the thinking man
Join the circus, come on down
I've heard they'll even stop kicking you
Just before you hit the ground

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Yeah here I am
In your arms again
Get a shine on
All night and day
You rough me up
Til I gotta get away

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat, tat, a-tat-tat tat

Second row, with the earpiece
And a rumble in his eye
Making sure that I don't stumble
And wishes all the freaks would die

Over there, a plain clothes cop
Looking at his watch a lot
Wondering is it time to call in the dogs

Dirty streets
Fabulous friends
Here I am
In your arms again
Get a shine on
All night and day
You rough me up til
I gotta get away

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
Gotta hold your head up in the year of the rat, tat, a-tat-tat tat

You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me
You know I love you, but you're trying to kill me, yeah
