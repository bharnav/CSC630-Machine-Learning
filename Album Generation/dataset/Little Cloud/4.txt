We stumble into each other's lives
And we knock somethings over
Try not to make a sound

Each time you reach out
A new shout or shine on
We run in and fall out
Fumble around for the key

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

Your half-penny eyes
Smile like a fire sale
Everyone's a suspect
The horses won't move up the rail

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

Your sadness, thief
Waits in the hallway
With mail on the floor
And two birds in the chimney

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
You can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright

I'll always keep the light on for you
You try so hard to be alive
What else can you do
But close your eyes
And you can't see the beautiful way
When you're burning so bright
So bright
Burning so bright
