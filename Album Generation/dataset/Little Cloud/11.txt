Have you ever had a fancy lover?

Goin' crazy trying to keep up with her

It's like you're standing in the darkness

In the theater up the back, joining her ovation

When you wish you could distract her

And take her home

You had to try

Don't some great loves start

With someone aiming so high?

Have you ever had a fancy lover?

Thrown everything that you've got at her

She's the winter that's so bitter

You'll cut wood all summer long

She's two long years of thinking

Going into one old song

And that ain't good

You were doing fine

You knew your chances

And your place in the line

Fancy lovers, they need fancy lovers of their own

You'll camouflage your soul for them

Where do they get to meet their own kind of people

Is there a light on the steeple

That only fancy people see?

When you try and keep a fancy lover

You force her hand and then discover

She wouldn't look so perfect if it was just for you

Is there a guy behind your shoulder

That she may have noticed too?

You'll never know

You had to be in

You bet on hearts, boy

Even when you won't win

And then she'll take the field against you

Fighting above your weight and your height

100 ways to hit the canvas

1,000 days to beat the count

Fancy lovers, they need fancy lovers of their own

You'll camouflage your soul for them

Where do they get to meet their own kind of people

Is there a light on the steeple

That only fancy people see?
