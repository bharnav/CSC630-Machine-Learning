Cuttlerry, paintings, lots of feminine things
A frilly mat to put under the phone
Big old TV
A modular couch
And her curtains would look good in this house

Because she
She's moving
Yeah she
She's moving in

Big old trunk that she bought in Trieste
Poland's been invaded with less
Her little cat
His little friend
We'll get to the moon putting her clothes end to end

Because she
She's moving
Yeah she
She's moving in

She, she's in
She, she's in
She's in
She's in
She's in
She's in
(She's in)
