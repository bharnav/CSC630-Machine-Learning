You're watching the Sunday night movie
I'm looking at the gun-grey dawn way below me frozen quiet
The line goes dead before I've had my fill of words of reassurance
That my home is still my home
It's something to believe in

Stay with me
Won't you stay a bit longer and see
It's all I need, across the sea
To get on the phone and hear you say
You'll stay with me

I walk around Ludlow into a bar to not get drunk
For one sympathetic glance and touch the back wall
Straight back out the front

On your side in the night cicadas are the sound of the earth creaking
As it's slowing down to spin you into sleep in your home-town

Stay with me
Won't you stay a bit longer and see
It's all I need, across the sea
To get on the phone and hear you say
You'll stay with me

Back home a little feeling of enterprise
Make a little thread for you and I hope it shines

That is not the wind
This building it's flying through the darkness so I can get close to you

Stay with me
Why won't you stay a bit longer and see
It's all I need, across the sea
To get on the phone and hear you say
You'll stay with me
Why won't you stay a bit longer and see
It's all I need, across the sea
To get on the phone and hear you say
Stay with me
Why won't you stay a bit longer and see
It's all I need, across the sea
To get on the phone and hear you say
Stay with me
