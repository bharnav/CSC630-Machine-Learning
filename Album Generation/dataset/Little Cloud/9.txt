Travelling the world from side to side
From Pocket Mountain to the Apple's eye
Like a misanthrope on Halloween I'm hiding
Under a tapestry of stone hung from the sky

But in all the ocean's blur, the planes and taxis
And the places I have been and left behind

Nothing's to me as beautiful as you
And how we'd be, if I could say it too
Nothing's to me as beautiful, as beautiful, as beautiful as you

From a one horse town where we played over 50 songs
To an English rose and a Nova Scotian girl
And when the sun came up we all found the meaning
If I could read my writing I could tell you now

I'm looking down Manhattan to the lady
And casting streetlight shadows in a cloud of rising steam

I miss you girl like I miss the skyline of my own hometown
And I love you like I love the familiar feeling of being homeward bound

From an eagle hitching ice on down the Hudson
Through an early morning mist out on the bay

Nothing's to me as beautiful as you
Nothing's for free, I know they say that too
Nothing's to me as beautiful, as beautiful, as beautiful as you
