Spent 12 hours drinking, slept with Someone that
Looked like you
We got up early, in the afternoon
Her eyes were sweet
But how could she
Know that we had wandered
Down a dead-end street?

And I couldn't see
What it was that reminded you to me
So we walked up to King St for goodbye
We kissed on the corner and I hailed her a cab
And I thought of you reading across the town in the park

You don't care now
You never will
If they let me into heaven, they can close down hell

Some they drown their sorrows
Mine they like to swim
Pour another one barman
'Cause the rodent got back in
Pour another one barman
'Cause the rodent got back in
