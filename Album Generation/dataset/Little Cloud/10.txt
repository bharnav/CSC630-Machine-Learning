Movie stars and fancy cars delight you
Gala balls and opening nights excite you
I don't have my name in lights, I'm just a simple boy
Don't you hesitate to call me
When only second best will do

Cover girls wearing pearls inspire you
French champagne and designer clothes incite you
You're not in the magazines, you're just a simple girl
Don't you hesitate to call me
When only second best will do

Why do we want to live in a fantasy?
There's a better place for you and me right here in reality
â€˜Cause this love is what dreams are made of
I hope you never have to settle for even less

I'll work in a factory to support you
Give you 3 screaming kids to annoy you
Expect the worst and we won't be disappointed
So don't you hesitate to call me
When only second best will do
