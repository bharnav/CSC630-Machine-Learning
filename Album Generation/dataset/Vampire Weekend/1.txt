[Verse 1]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too
They're cruel

So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me
With me

[Bridge 1]
Why would you speak to me that way
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain

Through the pain, I always tell the truth...

[Verse 2]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too
I did

I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine
To me, to me

[Hook 1]
Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

[Bridge 2]
Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall

Lil Jon, he always tells the truth...

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]
Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

[Outro]
Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's through the wall

Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations

Lil Jon, he always tells the truth...
