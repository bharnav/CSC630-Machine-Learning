[Verse 1]
Occident out on the weekend
That's the way that we relax
English breakfast tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute to even ask

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Post-Chorus]
Nastiness will cause your doom
Turn and walk back to your room

[Verse 2]
The precedent's already set now
You spend a week in old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Post-Chorus]
Majesty's not overheard
Cryptographs can't stand the word

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Outro]
Oh your collegiate grief has left you dowdy in sweatshirts
Absolute horror!
