[Verse 1]
As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother, on the sandy lawn
As a sophomore, with reggaeton
And the linens you're sittin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck?
Like you know I do

Like you know I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

[Chorus]
This feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Verse 2]
Can you stay up to see the dawn?
In the colors of Benetton

[Pre-Chorus]
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do

Like you know I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

[Chorus]
It feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you wanna?
Like you know I do

Like you know I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
