[Verse 1]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Mystic Seaport is that way
Don't you know that your life could be lost out of Cape Cod tonight?

[Verse 2]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, the bottleneck is a shit show
Hyannisport is a ghetto, out of Cape Cod tonight

[Bridge]
The lobster's claw is sharp as knives
Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you

[Verse 3]
Walcott, all the way to New Jersey
All the way to the Garden State, out of Cape Cod tonight
Walcott, fuck the women from Wellfleet
Fuck the bears out in Provincetown
Heed my words and take flight
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?

[Outro]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
