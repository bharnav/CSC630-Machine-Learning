[Verse 1]
It's going to take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79

Wasted days you've come to pass...

[Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

[Verse 2]
You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor

Coronation rickshaw grab...

[Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

[Bridge]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber pass

Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber pass

Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass
