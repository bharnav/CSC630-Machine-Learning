[Verse 1]
Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland
A feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do

[Hook]
Oh Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

[Verse 2]
Nights by the ocean
A westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull
No Kansas born beetle
Could ever come close to that free

[Hook]
Oh Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me
