[Verse 1]
Have you been to the carnival
I would like to see you
There's a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you
With the white unicorn, across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might of been
Someone whose older, ahh yeahhh

[Hook 1]
And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

[Hook 2]
We could live together
We could live together

[Verse 2]
She lives on the borderline
That they call hazel
And the tent that she lives in has the name of her lover

[Hook 1]
And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

[Verse 3]
Sister can you tell me when the day turns to night
She left without a word and wondered inside
How many day's must I still wonder why
And see her face in every passer by

[Hook 2]
We could live together
We could live together

[Hook 1]
And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

[Hook 2]
We could live together
We could live together
We could live together
