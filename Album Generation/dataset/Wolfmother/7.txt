[Verse 1]
When the time is right and the night is bright
We will see the things we've come to find
I've been searching for just a little more
But the days girl just slip away
And the red sunset that we just met girl
I can see forever

[Chorus]
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
Come and see the Mind's Eye
Transfixed upon the why
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try

[Verse 2]
Well they say it's right if it feels alright
When your love burns up in the mire
So I burnt a fire for a lost desire
See it burning higher

[Chorus]
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
Come and see the Mind's Eye
Transfixed upon the why
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
Come and see the Mind's Eye
Transfixed upon the why

The Mind's Eye
Right Now

Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
