Oh my friend, don't get caught in yesterday
All the things, we've heard have left and made their way
Lower your guns even if love has turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
If you listen to the sound within your mind
You may find the answer flowing in the tide
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddler's call
Say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter
And I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know if I'll go
Can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddler's call
Say that love is here for all
Lower your guns even if love has turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
Oh my friend, I hope you're done with yesterday
All the things, we've heard have left and made their way
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddler's call
Say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter
And I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know if I'll go
Can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddler's call
Say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all
Say that love is here for all
Lower your guns even if love turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what you may deal
