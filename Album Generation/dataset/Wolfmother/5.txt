[Verse]
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night

He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in the sour

[Refrain]
So we are not goin' home

[Chorus]
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

[Verse]
What you see well you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night

All the people that he see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wild beast is searching for sight

[Refrain]
And we are not goin' home

[Chorus]
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

[Outro]
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand

Tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief
In the night
