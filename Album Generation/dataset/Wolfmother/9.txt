[Verse]
Wrote a letter to you and threw it away
Spirit tried to call me, I had no words to say
Oh sister can you tell me if it's gonna be okay

[Refrain]
The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

[Chorus]
And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craft

[Verse]
Her eyes are the opening to a soul
Spirits lie where secrets can be told
Make her an offer, your fortune can be sold

[Refrain]
The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

[Chorus]
And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craft

[Refrain]
The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

[Chorus]
And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craft
