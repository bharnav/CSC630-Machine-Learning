Surround the Earth with a billion suns
Spinning in daylight, darkness never comes
Bathe the world in revealing light
Erasing shadows, no place to hide
Open up everything for everyone to see
Making it impossible to be deceived

I wish a billion suns appeared yesterday
I wish last night never came
Making today endless, endless yesterday
If a billion suns covered every inch of space

Today would be endless, endless, endless yesterday
Under a billion suns, you'd still be mine

We'd never sleep, we'd always stay awake
Living out our lives in one long happy day
We'd never know about last night
It could never happen in a world of constant light
I wish a billion suns appeared yesterday
