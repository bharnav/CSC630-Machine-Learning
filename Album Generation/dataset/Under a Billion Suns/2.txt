[Verse 1]
You went down like a nuclear bomb
I saw a flash and bang you were gone
I saw the light
I saw the light
It devoured the sky, burned out my eyes
I saw the light

[Verse 2]
We leveled cities for miles around
Making love on the smoldering ground
I saw the light (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light
It devoured the sky, burned out my eyes
I saw the light

[Verse 3]
Like radiation, love lingers on
Long after the damage is done
I saw the light (oh, oh)
I saw the light
It devoured the sky, burned out my eyes
I saw the light
It devoured the sky, burned out my eyes
I saw the light
It devoured the sky, burned out my eyes
I saw the light
