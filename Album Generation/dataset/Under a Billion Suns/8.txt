[Verse 1]
All right, the time is now
That's right, the shit is going down
It's time to do what needs to be done
Yeah yeah, it's high time we make you run
Yeah

[Chorus]
On the move, we're on the move
On the move, we're on the move
There ain't nothing, nothing you can do
We're on the move, on the move
Aw

[Verse 2]
Do you think, you got us all pinned down?
Do you think, we can be found?
We'll get around anything that you got
Yeah yeah, we'll blast right through 'cause you're so... soft

[Chorus]
On the move, we're on the move
On the move, we're on the move
There ain't nothing, nothing you can do
We're on the move, on the move
Aw

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
We are outside
We are inside
We are so outside
We're on the inside
We are so far outside
We get deep inside
We are so far outside
We're all the way inside
We are so far outside
We're all the way inside
We're so deep underground
We're in the air
We're way out in the open
We don't need to hide
You don't notice us, 'coz
We are everywhere

[Chorus]
On the move, we're on the move
On the move, we're on the move
There ain't nothing, nothing you can do
We're on the move, on the move
Aw
