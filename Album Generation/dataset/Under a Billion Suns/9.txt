[Verse 1]
I live up high among the frozen jagged peaks
Where the air is too thin for mortal men to breathe
Cold and alone
Cold and alone
I roam these glaciers in search of something else like me

[Chorus]
Could you be mine tonight?
Could you be mine tonight?
You look so warm in the cold moonlight
Could you be mine, could you be mine

[Verse 2]
I dropped the moon and it shattered at your feet
I lost my grip when my hands began to bleed
My gift the moon
My gift to you
My gift just lays there like a pile of broken teeth

[Chorus]
Could you be mine tonight?
Could you be mine tonight?
You look so warm in the cold moonlight
Could you be mine, could you be mine
