[Verse 1]
I got holes in my vision
There are certain things I cannot see
I'm looking right at you baby
But that don't mean shit to me

Blindspots make it easier
For me to get through the day
Blindspots help me forge ahead
Through the troubles that keep coming my way

[Chorus]
Now you might think I'm ill-prepared
That I don't understand what I'm up against
In a cluttered world of ugliness
Blindness is the best defense

[Verse 2]
You tell me everything is beautiful
Beautiful in it's own way
You got such a lovely cancer darling
Eating right through your brain

I've got gaps in my hearing
Certain frequencies have disappeared
The more you keep on talking baby
The more I'm glad the less I hear

[Chorus]
Now you might think I'm ill-prepared
That I don't understand what I'm up against
In a cluttered world of too much noise
Deafness is the best defense

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My burden is my sense of smell
I smell bullshit from miles away
If I can't get upwind from you
I'll cut off my nose... to spite your face

[Chorus]
Now you might think I'm ill-prepared
That I don't understand what I'm up against
In a cluttered world of bullshit baby
Senselessness is the best defense

[Outro]
Senselessness is the best defense
Senselessness is the best defense
Senselessness is the best defense
Senselessness is the best defense
