[Verse 1]
Our souls took off and left us behind
That's when we lost our hearts and our minds
We have no use for them anyway
They don't fit in to our routine day

[Chorus]
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
Empty shells

[Verse 2]
You see us in groups, you see us on our own
Going to church and taking out loans
Following sports, working our jobs
Chances are you're already singing along

[Chorus]
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
Empty shells

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
We're the empty shells of our former selves
We're the empty shells
Empty shells
