Can't you hear the little girls asking
"Daddy, where have all the little boys gone?"
The little girls they ask me
"Daddy, where have all the little boys gone?"
They don't tease us in the classroom
And they don't feed us at the mall

The little boys are fighting, they have left us all behind
The little boys are dying to preserve our way of life
It's our patriotic duty to make sweet love tonight
C'mon, little girl

See, these lonely, lonesome ladies they don't ignore me any more
All these lonely, lonely ladies knock knocking on my door
I'm the only game in town and it's so easy to score
Now I know why dirty old men are always pushing for war
Now I know why dirty old men are always pushing for war
I've become a dirty old man with a hard on for war
