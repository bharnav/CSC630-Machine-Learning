[Verse 1]
I was born on an Air Force Base
Nineteen sixty two
A rocket launch into outer space
Knocked me out of the womb
I cried and cried and cried
Happy to be alive
Astronauts were orbiting Earth
The Space Age was in sight

[Chorus]
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future for everyone
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future of fun
Where is the future that was promised us
I'm sick to death of this one

[Verse 2]
I want to live in a floating city
I want to drive a bubble car
I want to fly with my personal jet pack
I want to visit my family on Mars
I want to live in an era of peace
Of Love and Justice, Wonder and Truth
I want a world run by giant brains
Instead of small-minded arrogant fools

[Chorus]
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future for everyone
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future of fun
Where is the future that was promised us
I'm sick to death of this one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future for everyone
Where is the future that was promised us
Where is the future of fun
Where is the future that was promised us
I'm sick to death of this one
