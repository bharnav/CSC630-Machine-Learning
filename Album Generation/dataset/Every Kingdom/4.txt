[Chorus 1]
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, only love

Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart...

[Refrain 1]
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep

A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep...

[Chorus 2]
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, oh, only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, ah, only love

Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart, mm...

[Refrain 2]
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep

A wind in the shadow, a whale song...

[Chorus]
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, oh, only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, ah, only love

Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

Watch me fall apart!

[Bridge]
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Girl, show me heart!

Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Watch me fall apart!

Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Girl, show me heart!

Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Watch me fall apart!

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Darling, I feel you under my body
Darling, you're with me, forever and always
Give me shelter or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
