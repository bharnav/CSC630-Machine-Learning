[Verse 1]
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know that memories were the best things you ever had
The summer shone, beat down on bony backs
So far from home, where the ocean stood down dust and pinecone tracks

We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us, the boom of summer time, yeah...

[Chorus 1]
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones

As the old pine fell, we sang
Just to bless the morning...

[Verse 2]
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know the friends around you are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, or the echoed stone
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly with weightless souls, now

[Chorus 2]
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted, and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones

As the old pine fell, we sang
Just to bless the morning...

[Refrain]
We grow, grow, steady as the morning
Yeah, we grow, grow, older still
Ah, we grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still

Ah, we grow, grow, steady as the flowers
Yeah, we grow, grow, older still
Ah, we grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still...
