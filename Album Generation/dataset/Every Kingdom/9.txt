[Verse 1]
And meet me there
Bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours of cold
Winter shall howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time
Shelter as we go

[Verse 2]
And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
Surface, far below these birds

[Bridge]
And maybe, just maybe, I'll come home

[Instrumental]

[Hook]
Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?
Going to tell you stories of mine
Who am I?

[Hook]
Oh, who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Could be a burden in time, lonely
Who am I, to you?

[Hook]
And who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Will be a burden
And who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?

[Outro]
I come alone here
I come alone here
