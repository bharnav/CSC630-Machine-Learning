[Verse 1]
And the birds still
Sing outside these
These windows
Where we sat together

Like nothing ever
Happened here, oh
Oh, the white house on the hill
Black clouds the weather

[Verse 2]
And the church spire
Over the river
She still sits there, warm
In the evening glow

But you don't care about
All these scenes I treasure
Well, these west winds
I know, I know

[Bridge 1]
Seems everything around here
Stays like stone
Seems it's about time, darling
About time we let this all go

[Chorus]
'Cause everything
Will start again anew
'Cause everything
Just goes that way, my friend

And every king
Knows it to be true
That every kingdom
Must one day come to an...

E-e-end
E-e-end, oh
E-e-end
E-e-end, mm, mm...

[Verse 3]
And the sun
She may be long gone
O lost, to these memories
We found

But she'll be here
When it's all done
When our bodies are lain
Beneath the ground

[Bridge 2]
Seems everything that goes around
Comes, comes around here
Seems everything that stays here
Somehow, gets me down again

[Chorus]
Mm, everything
Must start again anew
'Cause everything
Just goes that way, my friend

And every king
Knows it to be true
That every kingdom
Must one day come to an...

E-e-end, oh
E-e-end, oh-oh oh
E-e-end, oh
Mm-mm-mm, mm...
