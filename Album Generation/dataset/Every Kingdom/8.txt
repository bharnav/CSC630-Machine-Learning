How would you know?
When everything around you's
Changing like the weather
A big black storm
And where'd you turn to?
Hide a ghost, a shadow at the most
Would you let me know?

Cause I don't want to trouble your mind with
The childish design of how it all should go
But I love you so
When it all comes clear
When the wind is settled
I'll be here, you know

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sun upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here, no
And gracious goes the ghost of you, my dear

How would you know?
When everything around you's
Bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm
And where would you turn to?
Well, had I a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you tell me so?

Cause I, I adore you so
When it all comes clear
The wind is settled, I'll be here, you know

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sun upon that place
Darling, I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here
And gracious goes the ghost of you, my dear

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here
And gracious goes the ghost of you, my dear
