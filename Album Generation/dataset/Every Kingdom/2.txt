Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh

[Verse 1]
Falling from high places
Falling through low spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that there's nowhere to go

Watching from both sides, these
Clock towers burning up
I lost my time here, oh
I lost my patience with it all

Mm...
We lost faith, uh
In the arms of love

[Verse 2]
Oh, where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
(Oh, hiding lately
Hiding from the news)

Argh, 'cause we've been fighting lately
Ah, we've been fighting with the wolves
(Oh, fighting lately
Fighting with the wolves)

Ooh
With the wolves
Ooh
With the wolves

Red tongues and hands...

[Verse 3]
Oh, falling from high places
Falling through low spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that we're so far from home

Watching from both sides, these
Towers been tumbling down
I've lost my mind here, oh
I've lost my patience with the Lord

Oh, with the Lord

We lost faith, ah
In the arms of love!
Oh, love, love, love, no...

[Verse 4]
Oh, where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
(Oh, hiding lately
Hiding from the news)

Argh, 'cause we've been fighting lately
Oh, we've been fighting with the wolves
(Oh, fighting lately
Fighting with the wolves)

Oh...(Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh)
With the wolves, no (Oh-oh, oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh)

Ooh...(Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh)
With the wolves (Oh-oh, oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh)

Red tongues and hands
Red tongues and hands...

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh oh

[Outro]
We lost faith, uh
In the arms of love!

Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)

Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love (love, love)

Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
