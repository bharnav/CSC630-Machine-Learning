[Verse 1]
All I am is the bones you made for me
So garishly clean
White as the horses
That carry me away...

All my demons, you said, come and go with the days
A mind's will to play
I grow old in my way
Oh, just like you do...

[Chorus 1]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, just to be clear

So be clear, be clear...

[Verse 2]
All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses
That carry me away...

Mm, ah, that carry me away!

[Chorus 2]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
No, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, be clear

[Chorus 3]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh-oh-oh, no darkness that I fear
Oh-oh oh, no way to say I love you more, oh
So be clear, just to be clear

So be clear, be clear...

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, nah, oh-oh-oh, nah
Oh-oh-oh, nah, oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh-oh, nah, oh-oh-oh, nah
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 4]
Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
No, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more
So be clear, be clear...
