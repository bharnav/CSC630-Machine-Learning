[Verse 1]
I spent my time watchin' the spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on second best or the scars that come with the greenness
And I gave my eyes to the bottom, still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best to embrace the darkness in which I swim
I'm walkin' back down this mountain with the strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind's so soft on my skin, the sun so hard upon my side
Oh lookin' out at this happiness, I search for between the sheets
Oh feelin' blind and realize, all I was searchin' for was me
Oh oh-oh all I was searchin' for was me

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin' keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No no no no, keep your mind set in your ways, keep your heart strong

[Verse 2]
I saw a friend of mine the other day, and he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh I said I had been away, and he knew, Oh he knew the depths I was meanin'
And it felt so good to see his face, all the comfort invested in my soul
Oh to feel the warmth of a smile, when he said "I'm happy to have you home
Ooh I'm happy to have you home."

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin' keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No no no no, keep your mind set in your ways, keep your heart strong

[Bridge]
Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh eyes like wild flowers, Oh with your demons of change

[Bridge 2]
May you find happiness there
May all your hopes all turn out right

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin' keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No no no no, keep your mind set in your ways, keep your heart strong

[Bridge]
Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh eyes like wild flowers, Oh with your demons of change
