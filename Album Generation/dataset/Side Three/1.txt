They had a courtyard pool at the Hotel Delight
I decided to sun myself
There was no-one in sight
Just a small patch of sunlight left out there
That's where I placed my chair

Then a woman came out
And she placed her chair right smack in front of me
So close I coulda touched her hair
She had her back to me
I thought, "Man, This is weird, she's pretending I'm not here."
Then she lit up a cigarette and the secondary smoke poured over her shoulders
And right down my throat
But she didn't notice, she didn't even care
She had stolen my sunshine and cut off my air!

What kind of person would do you like that?

It's a mean old world when you have to live with incompetence and indifference
Like a bad cup of coffee that's filled to the brim with incompetence and indifference, Yeah!

Smile for me one time
Smile when you really wanna cry
Try for me one time, even though I know it's a lie

The electrician came by to fix my wires
And told me straight away I'd be charged by the hour
So he spent the whole day just pokin around, lookin for the ground
When he did start in, he rewired this and he undid that, and probably took a nap
Because a week went by before he said "it's fixed," and he left with my check
Now the microwave turns on the big screen tv which cuts off the bathroom light, intermittently, and I'd love to take a shower - but I'm afraid to try - I'm afraid I'll - FRY

So I thought I'd try a second electrician only this time I'd look under crook
Well what really got my goat was when I picked up the phone -
