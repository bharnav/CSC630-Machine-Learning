117 valley drive
Seemed like heaven when the band arrived
With a couple of drums and a couple guitars
We'd play our hearts out in my backyard
And the people came from everywhere
To put their plastic chairs in the summer air
Down on valley drive
People came with kids and dogs, sat out on the lawn
And they sang along with a hard hay's nhght
And a ticket to ride

We were barely in our teens
Yeah, laughin' like crazy, yeah, livin' our dreams
Well, the boys just cut up and the girls just talk
But when we'd start up, well, the world would stop
Though it was a different age
Nothing's gone and nothing's changed
In my mind
What it was was a way of life
But no one noticed we'd run out of time
