Faithless unrest, only the end we can see
Fading distress all innocence we conceive
Faithless martyrs now at the end we only pretend we can see
Fading darker now at the end the death you intended will be

Haze at sunset, on this surrendered frontier
Frayed and unblessed, only a yearning through tears
Fading numbers knowing the chance throws light on this endless ordeal
Taking from us now at the end a depth of repentance revealed

Faithless father now at the end pretend I can see
Faithless father now at the end pretend I can see
For the glory ascends, surrounds us
For the glory ascends, devours us
For the glorious end

Predatory intent devours us, pretend I can see
For the glory ascends, surrounds us
For the glory ascends, devours us
For the glorious end
