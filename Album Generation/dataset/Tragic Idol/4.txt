Erased by the words
Consuming desolate
In death in remorse
In this we celebrate

Theories from another world
From another failure
We don't adhere to fascination
Weary, fall on mother earth
Call your other saviour
We won't adhere to fascination

Drained by the voice
In which we tolerate
Rejection restores
Resistance provocates

Theories from another world
From another failure
We don't adhere to fascination
Weary, fall on mother earth
Call your other saviour
We won't adhere to fascination
