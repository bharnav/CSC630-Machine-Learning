We adapt to pain
In the hour we'll fight until the grave

As darkness sets on dead cells
Crawling rise, to which they fell
The dead sing out for my soul
Before they hide in their own hell

In this we dwell
In this we dwell

We are trapped in blame
In a tower of spite
Until the darkness strikes the death knell
Paralysed bewitch the spell
The dead sing out for my soul
A torment thrives this dismal shell

In this we dwell
In this we dwell

As darkness sets on dead cells
Crawling rise, to which they fell
The dead sing out for my soul
Before they hide in their own hell

In this we dwell
In this we dwell
