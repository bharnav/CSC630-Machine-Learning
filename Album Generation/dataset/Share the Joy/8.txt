I was walking down the street
And I saw her eye lying on the ground
And I thought to myself
"She didn't make it but I will
I'll stick around"

I wanna stay alive
I wanna die, not now
Ten years from now
I wanna live to be his bride

I wanna stay alive
I wanna stay alive
I wanna die

I wanna live to see his smile
When he meets me on the aisle
I wanna stay alive
I wanna stay alive
I wanna stay alive
I wanna stay alive
I wanna stay alive
