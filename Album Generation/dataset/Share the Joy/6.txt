- Should I call Johnny? What else to do? Alone on a Saturday night
- Well, let me tell you one rule, I always live by
- Cassie, you're always right

You've got to take it as it comes, you'll never get a guy, now
If you chase a guy down too
You'll never get a guy if your heart always tells you what to do
You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart
If you ever want a love so true
Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes

- But if I don’t call him now, what if he ends up in a date with another girl?
- Well, let me tell you to find true love, you gotta first look like yourself
- Johnny's not picking up, I gotta make him see. If I show up at his house he'll fall in love with me
- You gotta be strong girl, don’t bring yourself down
- But he's the only boy I want around

Yourself alone today
But girl, you can't go on this way
What happens if he never calls?
Now there's no looking back
I can't get myself off this track

You've got to take it as it comes, you'll never get a guy, now
If you chase a guy down too
You'll never get a guy if your heart always tells you what to do
You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart
If you ever want a love so true
Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes
You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart
If you ever wanna someone true
Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes
You're gonna take it as it comes, you're gonna take it as it comes
