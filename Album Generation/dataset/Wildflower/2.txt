[Verse 1]
Good is good and bad is bad
You don’t know which one you had
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they’re blowing ‘round
They won’t help you when you’re down

[Verse 2]
Love’s on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you
And if you think that everything’s unfair
Would you care if you’re the last one standing there

[Chorus]
And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

[Verse 3]
I don’t hold no mystery
But I can show you how to turn the key
Cause all I know is where I started
So downhearted, and that’s not where you want to be

[Chorus]
And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

[Bridge]
When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
When your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don’t belong
And you don’t know why

[Chorus]
And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

[Outro]
When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
When your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don’t belong
Neither do I
