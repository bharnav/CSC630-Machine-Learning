[Verse 1]
I was lost inside a daydream
Swimming through the saline
I looked at you and you breathed in
Well, that's the way it's always been

[Chorus]
It all comes down to creating time
You don't always have to make it right
We'll all drive by in our hybrid lives
Chances are we'll make it back

[Verse 2]
I was doing time in the L.A. jail
My karma was living inside a failure
No matter how it don't matter now
Rest assured the rest is blurred

[Chorus]
It all comes down to doing time
We don't always have to make it a crime
We'll all drive off in our hybrid lives
Chances are we'll make it back
We'll make it back
We'll make it back

[Verse 3]
Terence McKenna said
It is better to explore within
We were apes before we spoke of sin
The cosmo sits on the tip of a pin

[Chorus]
It all comes down to creating time
You don't always have to make it alright
We'll all drive by with our hybrid lives
Chances are, chances are
Chances are we'll make it back
We'll make it back
We'll make it back
We'll make it back
