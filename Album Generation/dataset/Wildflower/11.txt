[Verse 1]
My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away
But every now and then you come to mind
Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
But when your name was called, you found a place to hide
When you knew that I was always on your side

[Verse 2]
Well, everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
Your demons and your angels reappear
Leavin' only traces of the man you thought you'd be
Leavin' me with no place left to go from here
Leavin' me with so many questions all these years

[Verse 3]
But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally?
This isn't how it's really meant to be
No it isn't how it's really meant to be

[Verse 4]
Well they say that love is in the air, never is it clear
How to pull it close and make it stay
Butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away
And I'm left to carry on and wonder why
Even through it all, I'm always on your side

[Verse 5]
But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are we left to wonder, all alone, eternally?
This isn't how it's really meant to be
No it isn't how it's really meant to be

[Verse 6]
If they say that love is in the air, never is it clear
How to pull it close and make it stay
If butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away?
Leavin' me to carry on and wonder why
Was it you that kept me wondering through this life
When you know that I was always on your side?
