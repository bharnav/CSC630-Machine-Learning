[Verse 1]
Burn like a cigarette
All inside my head
Reminding me not to forget
Words, words I'd never say
Things along the way
Their telling me that I'm the best

[Chorus]
Because your face it doesn't look like it did
You give away everything now that you've hid
You, you want to be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and took me in
And this our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then

[Verse 2]
Help, help is on the way
That's what they all say
It's a thing that they don't know
Because I, I know everything
And maybe it's just a ring
But that won't make me let it go

[Chorus]
Because your face it doesn't look like it did
You give away everything now that you've hid
You, you want to be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and took me in
And this our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then
Because your face it doesn't look like it did
You give away everything now that you've hid
You, you want to be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and took me in
And this our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then
