[Verse 1]
You get high-jacked, waiting at the bus stop
By Jesus, who's working at the pawn shop
Escaped by, barely in the picture
But never far from the lens
You'd never risk it, inherently self-conscious
So twisted, resting on your haunches
So mystic, painting in a poncho
You better get ready
Everybody's out to have a good time

[Chorus]
Live it up, like there's no time left
Just like there's no tomorrow
Live it up, like there's no time left
And there's no time to kill
Live it up, like there's no time left
And no time left to borrow
Why don't you try to get it right this time
Get it right this time

[Verse 2]
You get worked up, jammed and overloaded
Your time's up, before you even know it
But you can't stop, working on the outcome
You're hawking your latest sins
Put on your backpack, take a trip to nowhere
You're sidetracked, on your way to somewhere
You wind up right back where you started
You better get ready
Everybody's out to have a good time

[Chorus]
Live it up, like there's no time left
Just like there's no tomorrow
Live it up, like there's no time left
And there's no time to kill
Live it up, like there's no time left
And no time left to borrow
Why don't you try to get it right this time
Get it right this time

[Bridge]
No reason to worry, even if it isn't going our way
Forget about tomorrow, because all we really have is today

[Chorus]
Live it up, like there's no time left
Just like there's no tomorrow
Live it up, like there's no time left
And there's no time to kill
Live it up, like there's no time left
And no time left to borrow
Why don't you try to get it right this time
Get it right this time
