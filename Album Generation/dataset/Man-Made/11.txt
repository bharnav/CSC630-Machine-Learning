Don't hide who you are
Don't hide who you are
Why dim your own star?

Your eye can see far
Your eye can see far
Why dim your own star?

Decide where you are
Decide where you are
Why dim your own star?

Your light can shine far
Your light can shine far
Why dim your own star?

I didn't know that my life was wrong
Until the right person came along

I didn't know that my life was wrong
Until the right person came along

I didn't know that my life was wrong
Until the right person came along
