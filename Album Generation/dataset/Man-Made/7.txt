Don't need nowhere to go
When my senses can peel
Through the floor to the fields
Below me

I feel what I know
And I know what I feel
Illuminate what is real
And show me

Life without you
Is so cold
And moving round you
Makes me old

Send me far from myself
And the things that I see
Give me new ways to be
Remove me

Put my past on the shelf
With illusions of me
Show me new ways to see
Improve me

Life without you
Is so cold
And moving round you
Makes me old

Life without you
Is so cold
And moving round you
Makes me old

Through the night times
Wrong and right times
Take the straight line
Feel the sunshine

Through the night times
Wrong and right times
Take the straight line
Feel the sunshine

Through the night times
Wrong and right times
Take the straight line
Feel the sunshine

Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
Feel the sunshine
