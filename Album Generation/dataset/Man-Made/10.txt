Born under a good sing
I was raised in the sunshine
I'm the first in a long time
Into love, the moon, the trees, the stars, the sun

Step on the right track
Love my folks and I call back

I read books and I don't lack
Into love, the moon, the trees, the stars, the sun

Rockin' a new way
I play fives on a sunday
Tt on a tuesday
Into love, the moon, the trees, the stars, the sun
