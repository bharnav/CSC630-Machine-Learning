Slow fade, pictures in my mind
Fragments of memory suspended in time
I've watched the colours fade
And the lines disappear
Slow fade, pictures in my mind

Decaying, pictures in my mind
The fleeting images recede and decline
The colours seep away
And the lines disappear
Slow fade, pictures in my mind

I've watched the colours fade
And the lines disappear
Slow fade, pictures in my mind
