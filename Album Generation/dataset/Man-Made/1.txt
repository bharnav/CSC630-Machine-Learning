A distant bell that won't stop ringing
The long night won't defeat my soul
Every day I hear sweet hearts singing
Hold on till I reach that goal

Are the percepts by which I stand
Set in stone, solid rock, or just sand?

There is more to learn than I aim for
So much under the sun I should play for
Before I'm taken in
Before they take me in

Time stops when you find that feeling
You're right back where it once begun
Watching the distances disappearing
Ice blocks in the midday sun
Need a new line
A different plan
Got the whole of the day in my hands

There is more to learn than I aim for
So much under the sun I should play for
There is more to learn than I've aimed for
So much under the sun I should claim for
Before I'm taken in
Before they take me in
Before I'm taken in
Before you take me in
