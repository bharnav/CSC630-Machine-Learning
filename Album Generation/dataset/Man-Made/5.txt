So much that I want to do
Only with you
Vistas that I want to view
Only with you

I found myself in time
Was nothing I knew about it
I travelled a straight line
While living without you
Experience made me climb
Was nothing to do about it
But you were on my mind
While living without you

Beauty and truth fill my view
Only with you
Naivety of youth sounds so true
Only with you

I found myself in time
Was nothing I knew about it
I travelled a straight line
While living without you
Experience made me climb
Was nothing to do about it
But you were on my mind
While living without you

I found myself in time
Was nothing I knew about it
I travelled a straight line
While living without you
Experience made me climb
Was nothing to do about it
But you were on my mind
While living without you

Only with you
Only with you
Only with you
