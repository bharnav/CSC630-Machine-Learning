Fallen leaves on the overground
Riding the blue train's empty line all around
On the evening run, I say you're the only one
All through the golden glow sinking bright of the sun

See a simple spark
Bleed a burning flame
And it feels so now
Everthing's so near
Oh, come on over
The future's here

So brighten up
There is more to become
Fasten down every day
Cos nothing's tied, nothing stays
And I need a driving life
Cos the static weight draws too much useless dust
It gathers up, it blocks the way

Watch the landing light
On a passing plane
And it feels so now
Everything's so near
Oh, come on over
The future's here
