To play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid

Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid

Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid
Everybody calls him wonder kid

Everybody calls him wonder kid
He gets kicks from guitar licks

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

When the lights go down in your town
And the band begins to play
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
