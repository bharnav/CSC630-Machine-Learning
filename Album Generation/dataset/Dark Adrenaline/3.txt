Andrea
I disappear into the night
The silence is cursing me one more time
I'm not alone in this decline
'Cause all my demons have come back to life

Cristina
I cannot wait for a savior
My angel is long gone
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna pray (Give me something)
I don't wanna pray

Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

Andrea
I crossed the line, the walk of shame
I hear the church bells through the acid rain
How can I trade the wrong for right
And pick up the pieces, come back inside?

I can't deny, don't ask me why
I feel the pressure everywhere
It starts inside, erupts in pain
It knocks me down, am I insane?

Cristina
Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes (Give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

Andrea
I can't deny, don't ask me why
I feel the pressure everywhere
I cannot stand, this life in vain
Give me a sign, am I insane?

Cristina
Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes (Give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice (Give me something)

Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes (Give me something to believe)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

I cannot wait for a savior
My angel is long gone
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna pray (Give me something)
I don't wanna pray

Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes (Give me something to believe)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice (Give me something)

Give me something more
Give me something more, don't shut my eyes (Give me something to believe)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice
