[Vocals: Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro]

[Intro:]
Lie
Lie

[Verse:]
Broken mirror
Seven years of stolen luck
I try to fix you one more time
But I must let it die
The dream that we'd survive
Cut my throat if I tell a lie

[Chorus:]
Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie

[Verse:]
Blind man's wisdom
Cross my heart but it's a lie
I kept us going the last time
You used one of your nine lives...
I gave up all of mine...
Cut my throat if I tell a lie

[Chorus:]
Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie

[Bridge:]
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated

[Chorus 2:]
Set it free, lost ambition
And now I won't look back
I've turned my back, I'm off the ground
Set it free, superstition
And now the air I breathe is poison-free
I'm freedom-bound

[Chorus:]
Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie

Lie
