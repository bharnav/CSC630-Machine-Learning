I don't understand
I don't know what to do
Once again I fail to even realize (realize)
The person that you think of me
Doesn't care and doesn't see
I don't listen anymore

Don't try to change your life with mine

I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

I don't understand
Why do you feel confused?
Once again you fail to even realize (realize)
The person that you think of me
Doesn't care what you believe
Doesn't listen anymore

Don't try to change your life with mine

I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

I don't understand
Why do you feel confused?
Once again you fail to even realize

I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

Upside down x8
Laughing at my disaster x6
