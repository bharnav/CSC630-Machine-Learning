(Cristina)
Hold me, teach me, tell me what to do
But I'm not looking for a guide
I can't stand the light of the day outside
Feeling so cold inside your shadow

(Andrea)
Watch me when I'm falling down
Step aside, don't ask why
Let me down, hit the ground
Bet you smile, deep inside

(Cristina)
When I'm lost and don't know what to do
You're running away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

Now or never, can you feel this loss?
Please let these memories just fade
Time will heal the rain, but sometimes it hurts
I want to shine outside your halo

(Andrea)
Watch me when I'm falling down
Step aside, don't ask why
Let me down, hit the ground
Bet you smile, deep inside

(Cristina)
When I'm lost and don't know what to do
You're running away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

I don't know what to do
When you're running away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

(Andrea)
I will feel the sun (How far away from me?)
Come back upon my face (How far away from me?)
The light outside the darkness (How far away from me?)
Is not too far away (How far away from me?)

Not far away from the nothing
I only want to escape
Cause you can't kill the light inside of me
Inside myself

(Cristina)
I don't know what to do
When you're running away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

I don't know what to do
When you're running away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me
