[Vocals: Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro]

You've built your life above the sin
You hold my hand before the end comes
Forgiving me for what I've done 'til the end of days

'Cause I belong to you
'Cause I am part of you
I am dying in your arms
It's time to go, I can't make it through

I've come to realise
Tonight my dear, the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I can feel you, and I think that
Ev'rything you wanted in me
Was the mirror of your dreams
But I couldn't believe what you'd say

As I belong to you
My flesh and blood in you
I am burning in this fire
It's time to go, I can't make it through

I've come to realise
Tonight my dear, the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I've come to realise
Tonight my friend, the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I'm coming home again
And now I know where I belong
Reeling from my instincts
'Cause I realise I'm not alone

I've come to realise
Tonight my dear, the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I've come to realise
(I've come to realise...)
Tonight my friend, the end of time
Is not so far away
(Is not so far away...)
We cannot pray to save our lives
(Oh, oh...)
