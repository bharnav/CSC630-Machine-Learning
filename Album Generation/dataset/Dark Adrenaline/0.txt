[Verse 1: Andrea Ferro]
What a day, I can barely keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna see straight
What a day, feels like my breath is heavy again
And I'm totally faded

[Chorus: Cristina Scabbia]
Come to me, come to me, I am waiting for you
Come to me, I can't wait
Follow me, follow me
As I trip the darkness, one more time
Follow me, follow me
I awake from madness, just in time

[Verse 2: Andrea Ferro]
What a day, seconds, minutes, and hours spill over
There's no time here in space
What a day, I see beauty in everything
But the world is still fading away

[Chorus: Cristina Scabbia]

[Verse 3: Andrea Ferro and Cristina Scabbia]
What a day, I can barely keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna see straight
What a day, seconds, minutes and hours spill over
There's no time here in space

[Bridge: Christina Scabbia]
Come to me, come to me
Come to me
Come to me, come to me
Come to me, come to me
I am waiting for you

[Chorus: Cristina Scabbia]
