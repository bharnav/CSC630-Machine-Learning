No more rain
And no more hate as I am sick of lies
And I have no respect
You have failed
You're underestimating my surprise
Of agony and pain

I'm no saint but

I can't live this way
I cannot relate
I retaliate
Against you

Once again
I am the revolution that you cannot feel
The prize you cannot win
You've stained my life
And painted everything in black and blood
I'm not your portrait anymore

I'm no saint but

I can't live this way
I cannot relate
I retaliate
Against you

I cannot relate
I retaliate
Against you

I can't live this way
I cannot relate
I retaliate
Against you

I can't live this way
I cannot relate
I retaliate

I can't live this way
