Cristina
The smile on my face is burning
I cannot keep it on long enough
I want to hide myself from something that's bigger than me
That I cannot control
I wanted you to help protect me
To keep me sane in my insanity
Confronting the evidence, you run away from it
Just when I needed you the most

Andrea
I want to say it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
The storm is raging now, 'cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now, 'cause I have no faith in you

Cristina
I will rise from the ashes again
You can call me out, but I'm still the same
So don't even try to figure me out, it's too late, oh
If I'm too complicated, leave now
'Cause I could easily be without you
I'll bury your remorse because I just feel I can't trust anymore

Andrea
I want to say it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
The storm is raging now, 'cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now, 'cause I have no faith in you

Cristina
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge you
I avenge
Andrea: You!

I want to say it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
The storm is raging now, 'cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now, 'cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now, 'cause I have no faith in you
