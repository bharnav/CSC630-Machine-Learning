[Intro:]
Now get ready for war
It's starting today

[Verse:]
I can feel the distance
Even if you're closing in
I cannot hide the scars
I still relive them every second
Shots ringing in my head
Bullets chasing me
I brush my fear away
The battle has begun

[Chorus:]
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
I am not afraid to lose
I'm not gonna hide
I'm leading the army inside

[Verse:]
I will crush you to the ground
With words you'll never forget
I'll hunt you down
It will become the end of your days
The rhythm of my breath
Calm and slow and deep
I take control today
The fight has just begun

[Chorus:]
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
I am not afraid to lose
I'm not gonna hide
I'm leading the army inside

[Drum/Guitar Instrumental]

[Bridge:]
Now get ready for war
Now get ready for war
It's starting today...

[Outro:]
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
Now get ready for war
It's starting today
I'm leading the army inside
