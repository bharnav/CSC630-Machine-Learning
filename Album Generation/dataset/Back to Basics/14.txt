[Intro]
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Candyman, Candyman)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)

[Verse 1]
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me workin' up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothin' more dangerous than a boy with charm

[Chorus]
He's a one-stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

[Verse 2]
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

[Chorus]
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Oh, yeah, shoop do ba di ba shu ba da
Shoop do ba di ba shu ba da
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

[Verse 3]
Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait

[Interlude]
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Candyman, Candyman)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Candyman, Candyman)

[Bridge]
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, gotcha hot, makin' all the panties drop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, got me hot, making my (uh) pop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop
(Sweet sugar)

[Chorus]
He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one-stop shop with a real big (uh)
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (say what?)
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (say)
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman

[Outro]
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
(Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell)
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
(Squared herself away as she let out a yell)
