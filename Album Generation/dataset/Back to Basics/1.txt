[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh
(Oh yeah)
Well, alright
Yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
What is this feelin' comin' over me?
I'm taken back in disbelief
Is this really me, ha! in the mirror I see?
Staring back at me, could it be?
A new reflection of a woman complete
All of a sudden I'm so care-free (well, alright)
Your love is doin' somethin' strange to me (well, alright)
Got a new flame, ha! haven't been the same
Something in me's changed, rearranged
And I feel that I've been saved
You got me feelin' like you're that somethin' I've been missin'
Everything's heaven cause life with you has been a blessing

[Chorus]
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way (oh yeah)
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place (oh yeah)
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've kept some company I shouldn't have (well, alright)
Made some mistakes, but that's in the past (well, alright)
I'm confessin' here to you, proof that I am through
I'm coming clean, and I can breathe
And I finally believe, yeah
You got me thinkin' I'll be alright, and you're the reason
Ooh I can feel it, we're movin' in a new direction

[Chorus]
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way (oh yeah)
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place (oh yeah)
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Yeah

[Bridge]
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you by my side
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you standing by
Makes me wanna (pray)
Makes me need to (pray)
When I'm feeling low and all alone
You're the light in my day, yeah

[Chorus]
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
(C'mon) Makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (pray, pray)
(pray, pray)

[Outro]
Woo! Thank you father!
Wanna lift my hands up and praise
Everytime I'm hearing your name
Wanna reach out and rejoice
At the mere sound of your voice, yeah
(pray, pray)
Hey, hey
(pray, pray)
Alright
That's it
Makes me wanna...
