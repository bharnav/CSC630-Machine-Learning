[Intro]
Woah, oh

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the greatest show
Greatest show on earth
You've never seen before
Hear the fairytale unfold

[Verse 2]
What's behind the smoke and glass?
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask
Are you selling them your soul?
Will you be left out in the cold?

[Verse 3]
Is it all blue skies?
Fun and games until you fall
Then you're left without anyone at all
You're ridin' on a shooting star
With a smile upon your face
But soon the shine fades

[Bridge]
And you're left out all alone
Wonderin' "where did they all go?"
Oh

[Verse 4]
Been jaded, hated
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?
Been shot down, pushed out
Made to smile when I wanted to frown

[Outro]
Always takin' a bow
Always workin' the crowd
Always makin' the
Always playin' the clown
Who'll be stickin' it out?
Who'll be stayin' around
When the lights go down?

[Whistles to fade]
