[Verse 1]
Embrace the silence
Cause there's nothing
That can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now there's nothing
That can change the way I feel

[Bridge]
Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

[Chorus]
Sick of it all
Sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all
Sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are
Sick we are
Of this bottomless
Pit of lies
Behind closed eyes

[Verse 2]
Oceans between us
And there's nothing
That can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison
Of every thought
Every breath I wasted here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Someday you'll know the pain
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth

[Chorus]
