[Verse 1]
Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away

[Chorus]
I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Aaa aaa aaa

[Bridge]
Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

[Verse 2]
Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

[Chorus]
I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Aaa aaa aaa

[Bridge]
Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

[Verse 3]
Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you?
You've changed!
And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

[Chorus]
I've been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Aaa aaa aaa

[Verse 4]
You've been dreaming
If you're thinking
That I still belong to you
And I've been dying
Because I'm lying to myself!
Aaa aaa aaa

[Bridge]
Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough
