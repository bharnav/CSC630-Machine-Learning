[Chorus]
Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement Day

[Verse 1]
You've got my ring, and everything
You know you are, so bad
Where can I go
Where can I turn
I'm walking in the rain

[Chorus]
Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement Day

[Verse 2]
My head is hung, way down low
It makes my poor heart yearn
It makes me sad
I feel so bad
The way that, it's all going

[Chorus]
Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement Day
