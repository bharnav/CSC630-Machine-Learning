[Verse 1]
I've put it all behind me
Nothing left to do or doubt
Some may say
But every silver lining always seems to have a cloud
That comes my way

[Verse 2]
Anticipated pleasure or unexpected pain
No choice I fear
And love is hard to measure hidden in the rain

[Hook 1]
That's why you'll find me here all alone and still wondering why
Waiting inside for the cold to get colder
And here where it's clear that I've wasted my time
Hoping to fly cause it's almost over now

[Verse 3]
People come together, people go their own way
Love conquers few
And I'll do whatever, I'll say what I need to say
Just not for you

[Hook 2]
How many days should I smile with a frown?
Cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders
And how many nights must I wake up alone?
And know in my soul that it's almost over now

[Verse 4]
Our love is like a paper airplane flying in the folded wind
Riding high, dipping low
And innocence is fair game, I'm hoping I can hold it in
Our love will die, I know
