My love stands before the open window
Staring so far away
He can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching my restless days

He turns from the window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still he spares me the word goodbye
He sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
He struggles to speak but in the end I only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The words that would help me speak my troubled mind
Heâ€™s offering these to me as if to be kind:
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawing is on the table
A woman's silk lying on the floor
And he would keep me here if I were able
And lock us safe behind this open door

But suddenly it's so clear to me
I've asked him to see what he may never see
Now his kind words find their way back to me
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
