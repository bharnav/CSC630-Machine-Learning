You've closed a door in front of me
I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away
I feel my anger rise

And who's the object of my rage?
And who's not being fair?
Is it you for your indifference?
Or me for just standing there?

'Cause in my mind the room beyond
Is bathed in golden light
Well I dream about you through the day
And I toss and turn at night

Sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?

Well I didn't make the grade today
And I'm not the only one
But my heart won't stop hurting
My feeling all alone

And maybe we'll trade places
In some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice a-calling out
And I'd cover up my ears

'Cause in my mind the room beyond
Is bathed in golden light
Well I dream about you through the day
And I toss and turn at night

Well sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
An' should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?

Well I could brag on the things I've done
Or the places I have been
But I've never found a cure
For on the outside looking in

Sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?
