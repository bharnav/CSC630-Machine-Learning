I want to run away, don't come out lookin' round
Too busy dealing with it on my own
He's right behind me, please God I can't be found
Don't cast another stone

Feel I can wait until the sun rise
The city tells me not to go till dawn
And if he wakes, that's when my heart breaks
And I'm as good as gone

How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on?
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong?

And in the end, will we make amends?
Just like we're face-to-face, another dawn
And in the night or when the moon shines
Will you take me on home?

How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on?
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong?

How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on?
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong?

How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on?
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong?
