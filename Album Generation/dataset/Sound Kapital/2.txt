When I feel like an animal
When I'm sitting staring at the wall
Will I wanna talk to you, my lover
When I'm coming in with the dawn
Coming back from a long time gone
Will I wanna sit with you, my brother

Gimme sound, gimme something real
Like a creature you can heal
Keep me up all night in the city of terror
Turning on/off, on/off, on/off, on/off, on/off
Let it go, never stop

I was dragging my feet back here for a day
Nothing will seem to say
Bury me, bury me standing
I was dragging my feet back here for a day
Nothing will seem to stay
You could bury me, bury me standing

Get me drunk when the sun comes up
Over situas terror block
With your cigarettes and your terrible weather
We can, we can have something new
Give me strength when I was close to you
Get me singing along, get me singing along
With the unpopular song

Get my friends at the barricades
Keep me waiting at the palace gates
Get me on when the whole world up in flames
When it goes on/off, on/off, on/off, on/off, on/off
Never stops, never stop

I was dragging my feet back here for a day
Nothing will seem to stay
Bury me, bury me standing
I was dragging my feet back here for a day
Nothing will seem to stay
Bury me, bury me standing

And I don't get around
I don't get around
I don't get around
I don't get around
Bury me, bury me standing

I don't get around
I don't get around
I don't get around
I don't get around
Bury me, bury me standing

And if I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
Bury me standing

And if I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
Bury me standing
Bury me
