Oh, up with the morning, half with a photo cup
I guess I'm leaving, I'm always leaving
Oh, plans before my heart, keep it there it is hell
Give me no no feeling
Feel no feeling
Keeps coming on, keeps coming on, keeps coming on
It keeps coming on, it keeps coming on, it keeps coming on, keeps coming on
Oh, everything's fucked, give me something to keep
Keep keep from breathing
Keep me from breathing

Oh, flying in the bed, you got the keys to my heart
And I got no feeling, I got no feeling
I hope it's over now, I hope I catch some pills to die
But we're succeeding, we're succeeding
I know, I know, I know, I know I know I know
I got no feeling, I got no feeling
It keeps coming on, it keeps coming on , it keeps coming on
It keeps coming on, it keeps coming on, it keeps coming on
I will leave, I will leave this place
In my heart, no darkness space
All my life, I've always found
The returns, returns to sound
