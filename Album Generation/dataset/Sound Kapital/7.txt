[Verse 1]
I was standing by the speaker
When my sound came and my heart would beat
When I heard it, when I heard it
I was waking up east [?] of North America
No nostalgia on the stereo
No hits cause there's no radio
No replacement, no replacement
A thousand lonely kids making noise in the basement

[Chorus]
And it was right on, right on
Cheap music
Right on, right on
Cheap music

[Verse 2]
Because it sounds light now that the money's gone
Because we need it just to get along
It's your heartbeat, ooh, your heartbeat
Play it once, man, and you'll never give it back again
Maybe Bucharest, maybe Belgrade
Maybe Bangkok, little Porcelain
Maybe Wuhan and Miyakubo
Maybe Beijing, sound sound kapital

[Chorus]Right on, right on
Cheap music
Right on, right on
Cheap music

[Bridge]
Oh, I know you been low
Tell 'em what it feels like
Oh, I know you been low
Tell 'em what it feels like
Right on!

[Chorus]
Right on, right on
Cheap music
Right on, right on
Cheap music

[Outro]
Sound kapital, sound kapital
Sound kapital, sound kapital
Sound kapital, cheap music
Sound kapital, sound kapital
Sound kapital, sound kapital
Sound kapital, cheap music
