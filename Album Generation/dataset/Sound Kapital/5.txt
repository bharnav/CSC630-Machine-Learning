[Verse 1]
Well, they're an army of thieves, they've got everything they need
But what about us? What about us?
There's lies and deceit, so hard to believe
But what about us? What about, what about us?
What about us? What about us?
What about us? What about us?

[Verse 2]
Because it's time after time we've stuck behind the line
What about us? What about us?
And they won't admit defeat when it pulls you to the street
So what about us? What about, what about us?
What about us? What about us?
What about us? What about us?

[Chorus]
Oh go on, go on, go on
Go on and break my heart
Oh go on, go on, go on
Go on and break my heart

[Verse 3]
When it's under control from forces impossibly remote
What about us? What about us?
And you're lying in your bed, you just couldn't get ahead
What about us? What about, what about us?
What about us? What about us?
What about us? What about us?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Refrain] (x3)
I've been living life so long
I know there's nothing wrong with this
Come on and break my heart
Break my heart

[Outro] (x2)
Well let's stay in this evil little world
Break my heart, break my heart
