Well I don't remember sleeping in the hall
And I don't remember anything at all
Nostalgia never meant much to me
Nostalgia never meant much to me

Well here come the future, it's violent and bright
Here come the future, where you pretend to be a child
Nostalgia never meant much to me
Nostalgia never meant much to me

Give me the keys to your heart, oh you'll never know
Give me neon night, get me new world oh ah ah ah ah ah ah
I threw my hands to the sky, I let my memories go
I threw my hands to the sky, I let my memories go
Let 'em go
I let them go
Let them go

I threw my hands to the sky, I let my memories go
I threw my hands to the sky, I let my memories go
And I feel alone, I feel alone
I feel alone, I feel alone

I feel alone but it feels alright
I feel alone but it feels alright
I feel alone but it feels alright
I feel alone but it feels alright

I feel alone, I feel alright
I feel alone, I feel alright
I feel alone, I feel alright
I feel alone, I feel alright
