When I get back, when I get back home
I won't be the same no more

Calling calling across the water
Calling calling from a long time gone I know
Oh my heart it was in trouble
But it will be changed
I won't feel it anymore

When I get back, when I get back
I don't feel the same, I don't feel the same
I don't feel it anymore
When I get back, when I get back
I don't feel the same, I don't feel the same
I don't feel it anymore

So no more howling at the weather
No more bad dreams kicking, kicking down the door
Ah let's stay, let's stay together
Staying up all night in this capital of snow

When I get back, when I get back
I don't feel the same, I don't feel the same
I don't feel it anymore
When I get back, when I get back
I don't feel the same, I don't feel the same
I don't feel it anymore

And what I saw, I saw lightning
I saw cities, planes, and stars I've never known
And I'll never be cool
It might sound simple, might sound strange
It comes, it comes, it comes, it comes
Comes straight from the heart
Comes straight from the heart
Comes straight from the heart
I will be changed

When I get back
When I get back

When I get back, when I get back home
I won't be the same no more
