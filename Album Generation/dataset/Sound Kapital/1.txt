All week it was raining in the capital
We had to move, move with the lights oh
And whaddaya know, whaddaya know, whaddaya know
Army's covering base men to show all pitiable
Damage for the rest of the world

Cross the globe there were guns in the street fair
On the west we can cover it big sign
And whaddaya know, whaddaya know, whaddaya know
Army's base men everything show all pitiable
Damage for the rest of the world

You try to do the right thing, do the right thing baby
You try to do the right thing, do the right thing baby

You try to do the right thing, do the right thing baby
Do the right thing
Damage

You gotta do the right thing, do the right thing baby
Do the right thing
Damage

Let's go all the time, go all the time
Go all the time, go all the time
It's damage

Let's go all the time, go all the time
Go all the time, go all the time
Damage
