[Verse 1]
Did you bite the hand that feeds you
Do you feel the need to talk about it
Now you're fighting for your corner
Saying that you oughta laugh about it
You should get a little braver
Do us all a favour, shout about it


[Chorus]
Sweet sour [x3]

[Verse 2]
Pick up your stitches
Better than your riches
Think about it
I know what you've been through
You don't really need to talk about it
It's just a little karma
Trying to disarm ya
Shout about it

[Chorus x6]
Sour by the minute, but you're sweeter by the hour

[Verse 3]
You were none the wiser
Even though you tried to understand it
Try another spoonful
Love is to be truthful
Dance around it
It's just a little karma
Trying to disarm ya
Shout about it

[Chorus x2]
Sour by the minute, but you're sweeter by the hour

[Chorus x10]
Sour by the minute, but you're sweeter by the hour
