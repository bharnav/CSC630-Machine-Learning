Everybody's back in town
Give me the armour and let me prepare
It can be easy or difficult, to steer
The heart and breath stops death, cheats death, it's clear

Time and tide wait for no man
Slowly realise as fast as you can
Thought I saw a glimpse of how you were at five
Ain't it strange how these things take you by, surprise

We are drifting on a deep sea
And I can't navigate the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
If we're scared it puts us under

The more you talk the less you mean
You told me that when I was just seventeen
When it sinks in you will not always be here
Funny how all your small worries disappear

We are drifting on a deep sea
And I can't navigate the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
If we're scared it puts us under

If you're thinking
What you know is
True then tell them
Let them notice

If your time comes
Ask the question
Were you tender
To those you hold dear

We are drifting on a deep sea
And I can't navigate the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea, into deep water
