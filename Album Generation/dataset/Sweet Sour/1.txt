Take this ride and this phone
Run and go
I wish that I could give you more
But I'm have to break the law

But I've got more to give
Than I first started to give
We'll have to make a pact
Or something like that

Something good
A little trouble in your neighbourhood
Or understanding that you're understood
Oh I kinda wish you would...

Give yourself to the world
Baby girl
Spread your wings and uncurl
To the world

You've got more to give
Than you first thought to give
We'll have to make a pact
Or something like that
Or something like that

Something good
A little trouble in your neighbourhood
Or understanding that you're understood
Oh I kind of wish you were...

Something real
Another feeling that you never feel
Another reason that you wanna be alive
Just to watch the bruises heal

Something good
A little trouble in your neighbourhood
Or understanding that you're understood
Oh I kind of wish you were...

Something real
Another feeling that you never feel
Another reason that you wanna be alive
Just to watch the bruises heal
