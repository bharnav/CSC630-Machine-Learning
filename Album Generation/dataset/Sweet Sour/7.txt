In hometowns, suburban and transient
Romances, just like yours, happen again
Till all your lovers, gather around you
To see what you have become

No idea, why you're here, all on your own
It's just kids having, more kids for
Fear of being alone
Till all your lovers, gather around you
To see what you have become

I was looking for the one
But i guess you'll do

No idea, why you're here, all on your own
It's just kids having, more kids for
Fear of being alone
Till all your lovers, gather around you
To see what you have become

I was looking for the one
But i guess you'll do

In hometowns, suburban and transient
Romances, just like yours happen again
