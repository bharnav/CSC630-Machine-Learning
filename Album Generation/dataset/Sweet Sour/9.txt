Though I long to
Though I try to
Figure it out I´m told
There´s no way of knowing
Still I long to
Long to know

Hold on through it
Pray I´ll fool it
Losing it all I´m told
At the rate I´m going
Never learning
Never close

I will prove it
Hold on to it
Give it my heart and soul
With a chance I´ll lose it
When I find you
I will know

Next to nothing
Far from over
Close to nowhere
