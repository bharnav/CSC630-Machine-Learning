Was i asleep did you save me from disaster
Wake up and tell me i'm just imagining
Thought i would brave it cause i don't wanna live in doubt

Dreamt of escape but i'm nowhere near the feeling
Fell from a high but i never hit the ground
Can't hold the weight of your words heavy on my mind

So i'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
Keep it away from my soul, i'm not holding it all
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
All that we know will get old, and with you i'll unfold
I'm gonna lay my head down

Open your hand i know your heart line's the deepest
You will replace it a new love you will find
Say all you like but i'll make it better on my own

So i'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
Keep it away from my soul, i'm not holding it all
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
All that we know will get old, and with you i'll unfold
I'm gonna lay my head down

So i'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
Keep it away from my soul, i'm not holding it all
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run
All that we know will get old, and with you i'll unfold
I'm gonna lay my head down
