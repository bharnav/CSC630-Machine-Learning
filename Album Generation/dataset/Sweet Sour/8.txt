All that you've started, people carry on - honey
You throw in a little to alight upon - if for me
You're givin' it up and you're movin' on
'Cause you wanna be - free
You're getting so easy to read

Lies, are the truth
That you tell, to yourself
Wise, are the fools
Who can take, what they're are dealt

You say it again just to rub it in - baby
How can you not have a little fun - we got this honey
You're givin' it up and you're movin' on
'Cause you wanna be - free
You getting so easy to read

Lies, are the truth
That you tell, to yourself
Lies, are the truth
That you tell, to yourself
Wise, are the fools
Who can take, what they're are dealt
Lies, are the truth
That you tell, to yourself

Lies, are the truth
That you tell, to yourself
Wise, are the fools
Who can take, what they're are dealt
