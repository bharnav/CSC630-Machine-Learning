You're tone deaf but you're singing a song
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
Your head swims in electric blues
If all fails, you can't lose

You lie low but your cover is blown
You turned down but there's nobody home
You think straight but your min is not your own
You feedback with a static shock
You ears ring, your knees knock

I got all that I wanted
I got all that I need
I've got a plan for the future
And that's what I believe
But my fingers are cold, she's so old
And I cannot believe that you wanna be here
On your own, in this cradle of love

You're tone deaf but you're singing a song
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
