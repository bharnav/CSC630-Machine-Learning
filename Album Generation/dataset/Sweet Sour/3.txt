[Verse 1]
If you flip the rug then you'll reveal an ugly scene
But the strength of ten thousand will never weaken me
Wit just like a razor blade; you carve me half and half
Oh, I'd better wait to kill the time

[Chorus]
Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle then you will fail
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you dance then you're a dancer

The Devil takes care of his own

[Verse 2]
Do you dare to speak his name? There's evil at the root
Cruel or kind, it's on your mind; go on and give the dice a roll
Never did believe in saying fortunes are foretold
Easy come and easy they will go

Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle then you will fail
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you dance then you're a dancer
The Devil takes care of his own
Didn't you read about it?
Ooh!

The Devil takes care of his own

Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle then you will fail
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you dance then you're a dancer
Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle then you will fail
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you dance then you're a dancer

The Devil takes care of his own
