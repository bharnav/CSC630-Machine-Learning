You've seen the world
And all the glory
Is what you want
Not what you need
And when you go
(ooo)
Uh, you're gonna find out
All that you were
Was left to me

Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah
Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah

What you forget
I still remember
But far away
Not long ago
When you return
(ooo)
I will be waiting
In spite of all
That's gone before

Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah
Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah

Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah
Wander
Luster
Wander
Yeah

Wander
Luster
(ooo ooo ooo)
Luster
