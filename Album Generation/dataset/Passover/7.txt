[Intro]
I feel so low

[Verse 1]
Try me out for the evening, living in a lie
Your figure is alarming, take me to that fire
I'm better off alone

[Verse 2]
Living with a lady, one who helps me to decide
Take me to that room girl, get me through this night
I'm better off with one

[Verse 3]
Punish yourself on the weekend, you sneak into that bar
Open up that box girl, all that whisky is gone
I'm better off alone
