I played a storm last night
I played with all my might
Where were you, where were you?
To great applause I took a bow
Then I stood and searched the crowd
Where were you, where were you?
I suppose, not everyone cares for
Slide trombones, but its all that Im good for
Last night I stole the show
But all the time this thought to and fro
Where were you, where were you?
