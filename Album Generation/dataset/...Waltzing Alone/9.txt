ItÂ’s not that I fear the fall or crushing my bones
I fear the desire to heed the call of that unknown
You see the higher I climb the more I present myself
To the possibility of falling down
One more drink barman, one more round
Let us fill our heads brimful of philosophical sound
Did you know I seek awareness and a Christ like mind?
I seek to covet nothing, no, not even time
But the higher I climb, the more I present myself
To the possibility of falling down
