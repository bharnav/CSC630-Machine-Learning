Who has more beauty, finch or black jackdaw?
Who is more precious, fleece or red tiger claw?
Does joy or sorrow lie closer to god?
Do angels and devils deal from one deck of cards?
You must sing more sad
You must sing more sad
You know the world wouldnÂ’t feel so bad if you would sing more sad
Does love lie in madness, madness in truth?
Is wisdom in knowing, knowing can never prove?
If being can be but being right now
How can tomorrow weigh anything more than cloud?

(chorus)
