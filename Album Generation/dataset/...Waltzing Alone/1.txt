(Liver on fire, singing kum-bye-ah)
Im missing you, swimming nude
Im frozen through, Portmarnock beach boy blue
Pretty drunk, Im pretty young
Pretty sea salt on my tongue
Ive got a black bag of wool in my head
Ive got a fist full of songs in my chest
You know the sky bleeds blue not red
It fills the sea like a vein from crest to crest
Pretty drunk, Im pretty young
Pretty sea salt on my tongue
Silver life boy, silver sun
Silver sea salt on my tongue
