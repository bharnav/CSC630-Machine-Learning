Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days, these days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to
And I had a lover
It's so hard to risk another of these days, these days
Now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
Well it's just that I've been losing for so long
Well I'll keep on moving, moving on
Things are bound to be improving these days, one of these days
These days I sit on corner stones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend
Don't confront me with my failures, I had not forgotten them
