Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot about the things that I forgot to do for you
And all the times I had the chance to
And I had a lover
It's so hard to risk another these days
These days
Now if I seem to be afraid to live the life that I have made in song
Well it's just that I've been losing
For so long

Well I'll keep on moving
Moving on
Things are bound to be improving
These days
One of these days
These days I'll sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten my friend
Don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them
