[Verse 1]
White Moon, White Moon
Breaks open the tune
Of a deserted cartoon that I wrote
Creature come, creature, creature
My own double-feature
As I'm warming the bleachers at home

[Chorus 1]
Well, my nose keeps on bleeding
Cause it's Rita I'm needing
I better call out a meeting of the boys
Of the boys

[Verse 2]
My friends are all dying
And death can't be lying
It's the truth and it don't make a noise
Oh Rita, oh Rita
If you lived in Mesita
I would move you with the beat of a drum
And this picture is proof
That although you're aloof
You had the shiniest tooth 'neath the sun

[Chorus 2]
Easy come, easy go
Be a star of the show
I'm giving up all I know to get more
To get more

[Verse 3]
Photograph the picture
Young grunt pin-up scripture
For the locker-tagged memories of war
A mirage, this garage
And a photo montage
And the finger massage from the host

[Chorus 3]
Good Lord, good Lord
The one I adored
That I cannot afford is a ghost
Is a ghost

[Chorus 4]
Proto-social is the word
And the word is the bird
That flew through the herd in the snow
In the snow

[Verse 4]
Lemonade me, then grade me
Then deliver my baby
And if my friends all persuade me, I'll go
Blink, blink at me Rita
Don't you know I'm a bleeder?
And I promised I wouldn't lead her on

[Outro]
But she read me, then led me
And I ate what was fed me
'Til I purged every word in this song
