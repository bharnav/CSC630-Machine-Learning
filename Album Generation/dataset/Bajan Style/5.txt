[Hook]
Happy to see you
Setting me off like sparks
You ignite all the colors inside my heart
On the doorstep , like we'd never been apart
Hope you know that I'm happy to see you

[Verse One]
Its just another night
The boys are getting hype
But baby in my head
I'm there with you instead
Its just another night
Under the strobe lights
Can't hear what I'm dancing to
Just wanna be with you
(Bridge)
Ooh chest tight and I'm ready to go
On my mind , I can't wait any more

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Them girls put on a show
But they will never know
What makes you beautiful
I watch them come and go
Them boys got all the talk
But they don't know a lot
You know my every thought
That's why I make 'em walk

[Bridge]
Ooh chest tight and I'm ready to go
On my mind, I can't wait any more

[Hook]

I'm happy to see you
Setting me off like sparks
You ignite all the colors inside my heart
On the doorstep , like we'd never been apart
Hope you know that I'm happy to see you
Happy to see you
Setting me off like sparks
You ignite all the colors inside my heart
On the doorstep , like we'd never been apart
Hope you know that I'm happy to see you
