Low light, chillin' at the beach yeah
No lie, i'm really glad to meet ya
I'm not sayin' i'm a fairytale princess
But you're the guy that ranks as my prince yeah
Confused, it might take some getting used to
But this struck me the moment that i met you
You're mine, gimme gimme your last name
Hold tight we gonna jump into the fast lane

Baby i'm not a lo-lolita
But i promise you there is nothing sweeter
A salty kiss like a margarita
I'll be your bonita, know how to treat ya

Boy i wanna put you on repeat
You'll be the bass in my heartbeat
Boom boom in my head, boy it's so loud, yeah
(got me feelin' like oh)
If you didn't get it let me repeat
You're banging in my body oh so sweet
Stuck stuck on my brain like a melody
Oh how you got me
And it feels like love
Coming through my headphones
And it feels like la la la la la la
Coming coming through my headphones
And it feels like love
Coming through my headphones
And it feels like la la la la la la
Coming coming through my headphones
Oh oh oh

Jump start it, i give you the keys cause
You steal my heart and you rev it up
Don't wanna dance alone
Let's turn the music on
Get to know me better, guarantee you gon' be mind blown

Baby i'm not a lo-lolita
But i promise you there is nothing sweeter
A salty kiss like a margarita
I'll be your bonita, know how to treat ya

Boy i wanna put you on repeat
You'll be the bass in my heartbeat
Boom boom in my head, boy it's so loud, yeah
(got me feelin' like oh)
