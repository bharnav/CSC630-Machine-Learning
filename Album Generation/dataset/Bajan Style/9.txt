Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (x2)

Lately i don't feel this enough
A stand still
Waiting for the wind to pick up
There's no thrill
Your love is like a clear blue sky
But i want thunder and lightning in my life

Put a smile on my face
Your time is running out
Listen up when i say

Love me like a hurricane
Baby take my breath away
Shake my world and make it sway
Love me like-la-like
Love me like a hurricane
Sweep me off my feet babe
Spin me into disarray
Love me like-la-like

Take me by storm (x2)

Take me for a run in the rain oh baby
Open your heart let it in
And maybe you'll see that love is so much more
And i don't need perfect no i'm getting bored

Put a smile on my face
Your time is running out
Listen up when i say

Love me like a hurricane
Baby take my breath away
Shake my world and make it sway
Love me like-la-like
Love me like a hurricane
Sweep me off my feet babe
Spin me into disarray
Love me like-la-like

Take me by storm (x2)

I wanna feel your heart beat with desire
Like a tornado i lift you up
Spin you around girl i'm taking you higher
Straight for the sky i will take you up
(oh oh)
Gal put your hands up
(oh oh)
Enjoy the ride
(oh oh)
I'll be your commander
(oh oh oh oh)

Love me like a hurricane
Baby take my breath away
Shake my world and make it sway
Love me like-la-like
Love me like a hurricane
Sweep me off my feet babe
Spin me into disarray
Love me like-la-like

Love me like a hurricane
Baby take my breath away
Shake my world and make it sway
Love me like-la-like
Love me like a hurricane
Sweep me off my feet babe
Spin me into disarray
Love me like-la-like

Take me by storm (x4)
