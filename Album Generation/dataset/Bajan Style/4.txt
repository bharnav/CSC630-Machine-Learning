You turn your head to me
I see there's more in your eyes
That you hide, you hide, you hide it boy
I've seen you every (?) swagging, your rude boy disgrace
And you tryn, you tryn, you tryn, but whoa
All the time you waste on acting up
I'm not asking you to stop but

When you're ready for a love (?)
Baby i can make your heart stop, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be good to you
When you're done with the tough talk
When you're ready for a real rush, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be that, that girl, that girl, that girl

Standing with all of your boys leaning low on your eyes
And you always got your eyes on me
I know you want to come over, but won't leave your pride
Baby i could be your remedy, whoa
All the time you waste on acting up
I'm not asking you to stop but

When you're ready for a love (?)
Baby i can make your heart stop, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be good to you
When you're done with the tough talk
When you're ready for a real rush, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be that, that girl, that girl, that girl

All the time you waste on acting up
I'm not asking you to stop

When you're ready for a love (?)
Baby i can make your heart stop, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be good to you
When you're done with the tough talk
When you're ready for a real rush, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i'll be that, that girl, that girl, that girl
