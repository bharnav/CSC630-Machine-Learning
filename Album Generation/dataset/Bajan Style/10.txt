Why you wanna leave me now?
Woooah woooah

What you thinking of?
Now you say you wanna leave when it's me you love
And the thing that we had ain't near enough
For you to forgive me what i've done
Well if it's all the same
When you want my different try again
I will just stop your love, turn around
And if you ask me i would do it hear and now

But don't so say nooo
I don't believe, that isn't fair
Nooo
No we can't get it back again

Wanna believe that you are willing to change oh and i
Wanna believe that you won't do me the same (oooo)
You always seem like you've got something to sell
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well
(ahhh, ahhh)
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well

I know why your giving up
So much history between us and i blow it up
All my lies but knife right through your trust
And i hope you forgive me what i've done
I'm the one to blame
I'm the one who put the posion in your veins
But i don't want to kill your love again
Hold on to the light and bring it back life

But don't so say nooo
I don't believe, that isn't fair
Nooo
No we can't get it back again

Wanna believe that you are willing to change oh and i
Wanna believe that you won't do me the same (oooo)
You always seem like you've got something to sell
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well

I don't i don't i don't now
You want me back right now
Boy if i let you
You'll just go back to
Lying lying i know now
Your not that hard to figure out
I'm not goin let you
I'm goin forget you

(ahhh, ahhh)
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well

Wanna believe that you are willing to change oh and i
Wanna believe that you won't do me the same (oooo)
You always seem like you've got something to sell
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well

Wanna believe that you are willing to change oh and i
Wanna believe that you won't do me the same (oooo)
You always seem like you've got something to sell
But boy i know you too well, oh boy i know you too well

Why you wanna leave me now?
Woooah woooah
