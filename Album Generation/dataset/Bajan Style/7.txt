Ah, ah, aw
Ah, ah, aw

Baby i been on the rocks since you left
I can feel that burn in my chest
Didn't realize that you're the best
'til you went and put my tings da left
Shoulda neva eva did you dirty
With them other girls acting flirty
I guess i liked the attention
Shoulda learned to count my blessings

Oh, woah, oh oh
One time for yesterdays, hey
Oh, woah, oh oh
Two times for the one that got away
Oh, woah, oh oh
Three times for never letting go, letting go, letting go
Oh no no no no
You crashed all we had
Looking at the wrongside, oh
We can't start again
Ya never gonna fix this, no
So, ooh oh, mistaken
Oh, ooh oh, you're shaken
When you had, when you had, when you had it
You, were looking at the wrongside, oh
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside

Did you get those flowers on your porch?
And the letter that i sent long ago?
Doesn't sorry ever mean a thing?
When i call you just let it ring
Girl saw you at the club last night
You were givin' me dem stink stink eyes
Got a grown boy begging
Promise you i learned my lesson

Oh, woah, oh oh
One time for yesterdays, hey
Oh, woah, oh oh
Two times for the one that got away
Oh, woah, oh oh
Three times for never letting go, letting go, letting go
Oh no no no no
You crashed all we had
Looking at the wrongside, oh
We can't start again
Ya never gonna fix this, no
So, ooh oh, mistaken
Oh, ooh oh, you're shaken
When you had, when you had, when you had it
You, were looking at the wrongside, oh
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside

I hope ya like the taste of ya dirt
You seem to like it when ya kissin' her
By the way, i gotcha letter
Tossed that thing in the shredder, yow
And the flowers that ya left on my porch?
Set them on fire with a blow torch
I ain't even gonna miss ya, no
I ain't even gonna miss ya, no, oh, oh oh

You crashed all we had
Looking at the wrongside, oh
We can't start again
Ya never gonna fix this, no
So, ooh oh, mistaken
Oh, ooh oh, you're shaken
When you had, when you had, when you had it
You, were looking at the wrongside, oh
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
Ay ay ay ow
You, were looking at the wrongside
