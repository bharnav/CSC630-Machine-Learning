You got ten steps 'til the door
Still not sure what you want
You got three right reasons to leave
But you're still staring right at me
Tell me, what are we fighting for?
Can't we get anything right anymore?
I'm here, giving you all of me
I don't wanna let you go

Can't live in a world, if i know i'm gonna be without you baby
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone
Can't live in a world, if i know i'm a be right here without you near me
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone

Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in it
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in a world

You got me by a string, i love the way that you know me
You're my everything, i need your love and so much more
Tell me, what are we fighting for?
Can't we get anything right anymore?
I'm here, giving you all of me
I don't wanna let you go

Can't live in a world, if i know i'm gonna be without you baby
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone
Can't live in a world, if i know i'm a be right here without you near me
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone

Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in it
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in a world

How can we go wrong when the feeling's so strong
How we let it get this far, i don't know
How we gonna give in, when we gonna give up
We can't let this go, no, no
How can we go wrong when the feeling's so strong
How we let it get this far, i don't know
How we gonna give in, when we gonna give up
We can't let this go

Can't live in a world, if i know i'm gonna be without you baby
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone
Can't live in a world, if i know i'm a be right here without you near me
I can't live in a world, if i'm standing here alone

Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in it
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh, pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Pa-ra-da-ra-da, oh
Can't live in a world
Can't live in a world
Can't live in a world
Can't live in a world without you baby, no
