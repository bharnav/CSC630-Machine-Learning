There is a shred of guilt in every one of us
And a pain we felt in watching you all suffer
Now the time has come to make amends to everyone
To pay the price for all that we could have done
But we wasted everything
Now we're done

I preyed on my own people
I took them for all that they had
I laughed at their helplessness
I left them for dead

Now I'm tugging on this line
But I can never gain any ground
And from the selfishness I displayed
There's a punishment that I found
