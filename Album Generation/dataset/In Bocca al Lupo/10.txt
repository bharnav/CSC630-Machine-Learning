There is steam rising
From the gravel on the road
There is black coal
Filling up our homes

It seeps through the window cracks
It slips through the floorboards

The mortar is turning black
The foundation starts to crack
Honey pack your bags and go

There is steam rising
From the belly of the beast
There is hell on earth
There are demons beneath the streets

They seep through the window cracks
They slip through the floorboards

The mortar is turning black
The foundation starts to crack
Honey pack your bags and go

There is steam rising
From the gravel on the road
There is black coal
Filling up our homes

It seeps through the cracks in the window pane
Slips through the floorboards and up through the drain
