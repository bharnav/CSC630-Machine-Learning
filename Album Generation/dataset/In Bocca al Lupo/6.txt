I've taken a hit or two
I've given quite a few
I swing my fists and the cities all fall

I've broken a law or two
Reckon I only missed a few
I watch these long days pass
Through the bars, I curse the brass

I've had a cracked rib or two
I guess I've busted more
I've laid a couple out on the coolin' board

Sometimes you walk the line
And sometimes it walks you
You get quick to anger
Quick to put a knife up
To another man's throat
I cannot still
The hell that's in these hands

When they came to take me in
Didn't try to fight, just let them win
Whoa, whoa, whoa

A man died in my cell
Damn, the guards sure gave me hell
Whoa, whoa

I'd love to see them horsemen ride
So law and order, stand aside
Oh, whoa, whoa

Oh, this woman and gin, woman and gin
Go together like the devil and sin
Her hair is like wheat
Her lips are like wine
Gonna meet her at the end
Of the county line
Jailbreak, jailbreak tonight
Bring on the floodlights

Boys!

(Yeah!)

Fetch the shovel! Boys!

(Yeah!)

Punch the lookout! [?] You'll never catch us!

(Let's run!)

Ladies, we're coming home tonight

'Cause in a few more yards we'll reach the line
And meet up with a friend of mine
The dogs are comin' swift and mean
But I'm hungrier than they have ever been

Jailbreak, jailbreak tonight
Bring on the floodlights
