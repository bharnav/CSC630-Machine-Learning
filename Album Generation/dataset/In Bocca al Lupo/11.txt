Lately, lately
We haven't been at our best
And maybe, maybe
We had it coming for a long time

Everybody knows
That life is like a dancer's pirouette
With grace we've dodged each conflict
And decision that we've met

Everybody tells themselves
That they must be justified
They do what they do because
They're trying to get by

Maybe, maybe
We all are selfish
But maybe, maybe
It isn't over yet

Everybody knows
That love is like a prairie fire
That sweeps across the field
Consuming it all

Everybody knows
That love will never fade or flicker
That it's pure as the air we breathe

We've made mistakes that we can't change
But there's still time to start again

There's still time to start again
