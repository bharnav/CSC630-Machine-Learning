[Verse 1]
"I'm here for you," she said
And we can stay for a while
My boyfriend's gone
We can just pretend
Lips that need no introduction
Now who's the greater sin
Your drab eyes seem to invite
(Tell me, darling) Where do we begin

[Chorus]
Was this over before
Before it ever began
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the devil's got your hand
This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the devil's in your hands

[Verse 2]
Everyone in this town
Is seeing somebody else
Everybody's tired of someone
Our eyes wander for help
Prayers that need no answer now
Cause I'm tired of who I am
You were my greatest mistake
I fell in love with your sin
Your littlest sin

[Chorus]
Was this over before
Before it ever began
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the devil's got your hand
This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the devil's in your hands

[Bridge]
Failure is your disease
You want my outline drawn
You were my greatest failure
Discourse your saving song

[Chorus]
Was this over before
Before it ever began
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the devil's got your hand
This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the devil's in your hands
Was this over before
Before it ever began
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the devil's got your hand
This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the devil's in your hands
