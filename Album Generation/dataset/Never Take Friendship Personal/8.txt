Maybe tonight we'll get back together
Sound the alarms and break all the levers
These streets are ours, our anthem rings
You'd know the truth if these walls could sing

Amateur youth, sling down those signs
Gather the masses, friends of mine
I've got your back if you've got my hand
This isn't over, it just began

If this isn't love, (If this isn't love)
This is the closest I've ever been
Do you think we have a chance?
Tonight at streetlights, sing on Audrey's song

Remind your parents, "We're tomorrow
Lead with morals and we'll follow."
When they wake up they'll see
That youth fades and glory days deceive

What are you waiting for? Let's move on this
Time is of essence like your kiss
So say you're in
With cards down and guns drawn; this is it!

If this isn't love, (If this isn't love)
This is the closest I've ever been
Do you think we have a chance?
Tonight at streetlights, sing on Audrey's song

But now it stops at this
We could take it all if only we were rich
You can be what you can conceive
Read letters, kill your disbelief

We all make mistakes sometimes
We all fail, but we stand tonight
Look past them and move on
We're all here; you're not the only one

If this isn't love, (If this isn't love)
This is the closest I've ever been
Do you think we have a chance?
Tonight at streetlights, sing on Audrey's song
