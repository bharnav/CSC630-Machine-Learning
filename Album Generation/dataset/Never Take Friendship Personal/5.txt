Come closer now
I know your desire is to be desired
Steal a kiss, yeah, and call us friends
Distance is a thief in which you conspire

Turn and time and time will tell
Time will tell or tear us apart
You're miles and miles and miles away
Silence reveals where we really are

You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
Runaway, runaway girl

It's clearer now
You're nowhere into giving
Giving into, giving into me
It's your fault
You're like a rare disease
I know you're in love
With love I believe

Turn and time and time will tell
Time will tell or tear us apart
You're miles and miles and miles away
Silence reveals where we really are

You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
Run away, runaway girl

Do you expect me to wait here?
(All alone in my thoughts and fears)
My whole life could flash before your eyes
(Hope one day that you realize)
This isn't the way it's supposed to be
(This is who I crown, now without me)
Your regrets from us built up inside
(Great space for you, love buried alive)
Buried alive

You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away
Runaway girl
Run away, runaway girl

I only stayed to break your heart
You can tell it by the way I walk away
Runaway girl
I only stayed to break your heart
You can tell it by the way I run away
Runaway girl
