[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
I'm getting older too

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too

[Verse 2 / Outro]
I took my love, I took it down
Oh if you climb a mountain and turned around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down
