[Verse 1]
"Good God! Don't jump!"
A boy sat on the ledge
An old man who had fainted was revived (he's alright)
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed
If the boy survived

[Chorus]
"Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother

[Verse 2]
The woman from the supermarket
Ran to call the cops
"He must be high on something," someone said
Though it never made The New York Times
In The Daily News, the caption read

[Chorus]
""Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother"

[Bridge]
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again

[Verse 3]
A patrol car passing by
Halted to a stop
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:
"The force can't do a decent job
Cause the kids got no respect
For the law today (and blah blah blah)."

[Chorus]
"Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother
"Oh, what's becoming of the children?"
People asking each other

[Verse 4]
When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd
And it made them wild
In the atmosphere of freaky holiday
When the spotlight hit the boy
And the crowd began to cheer
He flew away

[Outro]
"Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place."
