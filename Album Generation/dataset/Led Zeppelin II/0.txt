[Verse 1]
You need coolin' baby, I'm not foolin'
I'm going to send you back to schoolin'
Way down inside honey, you need it
I'm going to give you my love
I'm going to give you my love

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Verse 2]
You've been learning, baby, I've been yearning
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learning
Way, way down inside honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm going to give you my love

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Trip Sequence]

[Verse 3]
You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling
All the good times baby, I've been misusing
Way, way down inside, I'm going to give you my love
I'm going to give you every inch of my love
Going to give you my love

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Outro]
Way down inside, woman, you need love
Shake for me, girl. I want to be your backdoor man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
