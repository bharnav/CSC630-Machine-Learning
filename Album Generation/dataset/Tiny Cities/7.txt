You're standing by the grey ice water
Out in the wind above ground out in the weather
You had yourself a crazy lover
Becoming frozen trying hard to forget her
You got a job up in alaska
To save what the cannery pays
There ain't no way to spend it
On a boat, it's a fish trap
You took the path of least resistance
On the phone cutting out talking
Short to long distance
You're standing by the grey ice water

Out in the wind above ground out in the water
You had yourself a crazy lover
Become unfrozen trying hard to forget her

You got a job up in Alaska
To save what the cannery pays
There ain't no way to spend it
On the arctic blast
