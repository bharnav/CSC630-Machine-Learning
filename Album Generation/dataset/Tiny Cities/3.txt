Won herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time
Started hearing voices sometime in June
Knew she could go crazy but not that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try
Man shot to the moon
I read a paperback and I want to come home soon
I'm shot to the moon

Been there a half an hour and I want to come home soon
Soon, soon, soon

Man shot to the moon

I read a paperback and I want to come home soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been there a half an hour and I want to come home soon
I'm shot to the moon
(4x)

I read a paperback and I want to come home soon
