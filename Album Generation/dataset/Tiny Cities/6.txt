You're in the back seat and you say to yourself
"it doesn't matter anyway"
Weeds pulling weeds and your Blaming yourself
We're all indifferent in our own ways
You're in trouble now and you say to yourself
"My baby clean conscience anyways"
You're in the back seat and you say to yourself
"It doesn't matter anyway"
Four fingered fisher man alright
Finger four fisher man so uptight
Hello
You're getting on no one
You're both right
Four fingered fisher man alright
