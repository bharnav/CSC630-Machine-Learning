Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well I don't know. I don't know. I Don't think so

Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time, I had to think a spell
I had to think awhile

And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know. I don't know. I hope so

Well that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
When the earth folded on itself
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath."
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death? (x4)

And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And the more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well I don't mind. I don't mind. How could I mind?

Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me

Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
When the earth folded on itself
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath."
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death? (x4)
