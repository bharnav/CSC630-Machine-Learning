Jesus Christ was an only child
Went down to the river
And he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh-so-mad
Should have insured that planet
Before it crashed
Working hard to make internet cash
Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass
I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now

Penny found out as her hair was styled
You should hide you kids
While the dogs run wild
Jesus Christ was an only child
Went down to the river
And he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh-so-mad
Should have killed that boy
Before he even had
