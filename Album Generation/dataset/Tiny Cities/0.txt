Does not exist, take an exit
I hear voices insinuating
Feeds me words to this song that I am saying
Sunlight 7:20 PM, early September

Standing looking at a photograph you don't remember
You look out of breath, and me like I am faking
As a matter of fact, I don't recall this being taken
You don't actually exist so I start shaking

Does not exist, take an exit
