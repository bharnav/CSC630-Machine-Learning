[Verse 1]
Here's another day
Another girl left so confused
Trying to find a way
In the common likes of you
But you're so undecided
Stringing me along
And it hurts just thinkin' about one day your here and then you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to say
Won't hesitate
Can't walk away from you
You weren't there
When I was scared
Now all that I wanna do is forget about love

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care at all anymore (no, no)
I used to only care a little bit
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care...anymore

[Verse 2]
Tryna brace myself
For the fall 'cause you didn't catch me
Promised that you would hold me tight, be the one I need
But I stood waiting for you to come give me a ride
Back to what love's supposed to be; I guess that was a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
You were there now
I don't how
I could have fallen so deep
'Cause you weren't here to wipe all my tears
Erase you from my memories
I don't wanna care

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care at all anymore (no, no)
I used to only care a little bit
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care

[Verse 3]
Oh my precious time; now I can't get it back
So lost and alone
And I can't take feeling like that
Baby, I've had enough
I just wanna move on
Don't wanna look back
'Cause I know I've gotta be strong

[Bridge]
I don't want wanna care about love...anymore
I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care about love

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us (oh yeah)
I don't wanna care at all anymore (anymore, yeah, yeah)
I used to only care a little bit (oh yeah)
But now I care way too much (way too much)
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care
So, I don't wanna care about us (about us)
No, I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna at all anymore (no, no)
I used to only care a little bit (a little bit, a little bit)
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care...anymore
