[Intro]
Come and get it!
Woo!
Do ya hear that cow bell?
Cock-a, cock-a, cock-a-doodle-doo!
Come and get some grub

[Chorus]
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here
Take it to the floor now
We can get a come down
Round here
Cowgirls, cowboys
Make noise
Round here
This is honky tonk baby
Go on get crazy
Round here

[Verse 1]
(Party)
It's what us farm girls like to do
Sipping on cold lemonade
Eating up all on favorite food
Y'all grab a partner
And just say "howdy do" (well fine, thank you)
Let me show you somethin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
All these farm boys, you want to see something slick?
Girls twirl your hips like a joy stick
Gotta do the 'round house, but don't move it too quick
You want to impress a hick?
Then make it go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick

[Chorus]
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here
Take it to the floor now
We can get a throw down
Round here
Cowgirls, cowboys
Make noise
Round here
This is honky tonk baby
Go on get crazy
Round here

[Pre-Chorus]
All these farm boys, you want to see something slick?
Girls, twirl your hips like a joy stick
Gotta do the 'round house, but don't move it too quick
You want to impress a hick?
Then make it go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick

[Chorus]
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here
Take it to the floor now
We can get a throw down
Round here
Cowgirls, cowboys
Make noise
Round here
This is honkey tonkey, baby
Go on get crazy
Round here
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here
Take it to the floor now
We can get a throw down
Round here
Cowgirls, cowboys
Make noise
Round here
This is honkey tonkey, baby
Go on get crazy
Round here

[Bridge]
Hands on your hips, roll on your backside?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Then push your tush
Come on push your tush now
Gyratin', moving it clockwise
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Then push your tush
Come on push your tush now (push your tush)

[Verse 2]
Boonga, doonk, doonk, doonk  (push your tush)
Boonga, doonk, doonk, doonk, yeah
Hootenanny y'all!
Yeehaw!
Woo!
Take it to the barnyard
Fiddles
Banjos
Yeehaw!
C'mon!
Woo!
We've all gone wild!
Us country folk!
Hey you over there get your ass out the chair
And tick, tick, tick, with me
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here
Take it to the floor now
We can get a throw down
Round here
Cowgirls, cowboys
Make noise
Round here
This is honky tonk baby
Go on get crazy
Round here
Baby it's a hoedown
We can get low down
Round here (push your tush)
Take it to the floor now
We can get a throw down
Round here (push your tush)
Cowgirls, cowboys

This is honky tonk baby
Go on get crazy (crazy)
Round here (push your tush)

Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Then push your tush
Come on push your tush now
Gyratin', moving it clockwise
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Then push your tush
Come on push your tush now (push your tush)
Push your tush

Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Push your tush
Honky tonk!
Push your tush
