[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Impatient, waiting by the phone
When we going to start to do this?
('Cause tonight)
I don't want to be alone
Baby, I can't hold it in
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to be a superstar
Boy, I like you right where you are
I know this is no fly by night
I promise, if you were mine

[Chorus]
If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride
If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

[Verse 2]
If you come, I'll have to take the wheel
No more time to hurt today (I'm saying)
Just let me show you how I feel
Sit there, let's make a way

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to be a superstar
Boy, I like you right where you are
I know this is no fly by night
I promise, if you were mine

[Chorus]
If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride
If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

[Bridge]
What you waiting for?
Guess I'll have to get ready
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride
If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine
If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride
If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

[Outro]
If you were mine
If you were mine
Mmmm
I know you like me
