[Verse 1]
When I first saw you, I already knew
I was breaking my own heart when I fell for you
I meant to be moment of lovers taboo
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you

[Verse 2]
What a beautiful house with the city lights few
No white picket fence
No porch swing for two
But the lights they just sparkle like your eyes used to do
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you

[Verse 3]
I'll get away, here's my chance to be free
Ccause I can't feel tied down to something I don't see
But why do I stay married to all those memories?
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back
(Back to you, back to you)
Right back to you (back to you, back to you)

[Verse 4]
How will you find me through the thunder and the rain?
Cast away these clouds filled with so much pain
Everytime that I...
Everytime that I cry (I cry)
Everytime that I say goodbye
It's cause I'm missing you
I'm missing you, yeah

[Bridge]
When my mind wanders, baby
It brings me right back

[Verse 5]
I should find peace in the still of the night
I lie awake 'cause you're not by my side
These arms of mine left empty 'cause you're not in my life
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back there to you
Right back to you (back to you, back to you)
When I let my mind wander, it brings me right back...
Back there to you
Back there to you, baby
Back there to you
Back there to you
Back there to you
