[Intro]
I belong to me
Oh, yeah
Oh

[Verse 1]
It's not that I don't wanna share my life with yo,u baby
It's just that I'm the one I need to be true to, baby
And I won't give up me to be part of you
It's not that I don't wanna have you in my life, baby
It's just you got to know that it's got to be right, baby
Before I open up my heart to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need somebody to complete me
I complete myself
Nobody's got to belong to somebody else

[Chorus]
I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection
I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
I belong to me

[Verse 2]
I gotta let you know before I let you in, baby
That who I am is not about who I am with, baby
That don't mean I don't wanna be here with you
I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need somebody to complete me
I want you to know
I'll give up my love, but I'm not giving up my soul

[Chorus]
I belong to me (me)
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection (oh)
I belong to me (I belong to me)
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
I belong to me
Oh, yeah

[Verse 3]
Love don't mean changing who you are to be
Who somebody wants you to be
Nobody's got to belong to nobody

[Bridge]
I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection

[Chorus]
I belong to me (I belong to me)
I don't belong to you (don't belong to you)
My heart is my possession (oh)
I'll be my own reflection (baby)
I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two (one, not half of two)
And if you're gonna love me (if you're gonna love me)
You should know this, baby
I belong to me
