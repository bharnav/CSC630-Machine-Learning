[Intro]
Ya'll ain't ready for this
Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

[Verse 1]
Baby, let's start to swing
Skirt flying high while you're twisting me
Shuffle boy, to your knees
Work those hands, you start ruffling
Feel these legs moving, baby
Rub 'em up and down 'til they drive you crazy
Don't stop, just give it to me
Do the doo wah diddy, baby
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I...
Pull my hips, baby, bend me please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen
Turn ya on like an old Capri
Baby, rev me up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But baby tonight, just swing with me

[Chorus]
Swing with me baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and the side gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

[Verse 2]
It's like 100 degrees
Sweat draws you close like honey to bees
Your clothes are soakin' wet
And you ain't felt nothin' yet (oh damn)
Tension just starts to grow
As I spin I let my bloomers show
Baby, come on and give it to me
Do the doo wah diddy, baby
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I...
Pull my hips, baby, bend me please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen
Turn ya on like an old Capri
Baby, rev me up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But baby tonight, just swing with me

[Chorus]
Swing with me baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and the side gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

[Bridge]
Swing with me baby (swing with me baby)
Swing with me baby (swing with me baby)
Swing with me baby (swing with me baby)
Swing, swing, swing with me, swing with me

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I...
Pull my hips, baby, bend me please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen
Turn you on like an old Capri
Baby, rev me up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But baby tonight, just swing with me

[Chorus]
Swing with me baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and the side gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Swing with me baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and the side gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

[Outro]
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and the side gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
