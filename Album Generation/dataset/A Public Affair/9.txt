[Verse 1]
Between you and I
And the starlight of the sky
Nothing and no one would ever know
Galaxies high, you take me so fully
As we jive through tonight
Holding nothing from eyes

[Chorus]
All I ever need, is you to take this crown
Just lay me down
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love
Between you and I
(Just you and I, just you and I...)
Baby, just can't stop loving you
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darling
Nothing could get better baby
I just love when you call me lady
Oh you know that drives me crazy

[Verse 2]
Violets are blue
And every color, brings remnants of you
Reach up and touch what you can feel
Captivated, so surreal
Drowning inside
Of your soul that runs so deep
As I'm lying here beside you, Infatuated, I'm so weak

[Chorus]
All I ever need, is you to take this crown
Just lay me down
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love
Between you and I
(Just you and I, just you and I...)
Baby, Just can't stop loving you
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darling
Nothing could get better baby
I just love when you call me lady
Oh you know that drives me crazy

[Verse 3]
Baby, please
Say that you'll understand
That tonight, is a night, to love again
Sweet memories
Of kisses we've blown in the wind
And I'll cherish this quiet time we spend alone

[Chorus]
Between you and I
(Just you and I, just you and I...)
Baby, Just can't stop loving you
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darling
Nothing could get better baby
I just love when you call me lady
Oh ya know that drives me crazy
