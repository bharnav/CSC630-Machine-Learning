Chorus:
The bit that I don't get
It's how it changed so fast
How it changed from we will always be together
To it will never last
The writing on the wall
I hadn't seen it yet
When you told me you were tired of it all
That's the bit that I don't get
So call me a foll
I do!
But no longer the fool beside you
And I'm learning from the pain
Won't be doing that again!

Chorus:
The bit that I don't get
It's how it changed so fast
How it changed from we will always be together
To it will never last
The writing on the wall
I hadn't seen it yet
When you told me you were tired of it all
That's the bit that I don't get!
People break up everyday
But I never thought
I would wake up to hear you say
Forever now means never!

Chorus:
The bit that I don't get
It's how it changed so fast
How it changed from we will always be together
To it will never last
The writing on the wall
I hadn't seen it yet
When you told me you were tired of it all
That's the bit that I don't get!
