Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending all my money, I didn´t care
Taking my friends out for a magic time
Bought whiskey, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, I didn´t know where to go
If I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins
Cause no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In my pocket, not one penny
And my friends, I haven´t any
When I finally get back up on my feet again
Everybody wanna be my long-lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
Nobody... when you´re down and out
Nobody knows you
When you´re down and out
In my pocket, not one penny
And my friends, I haven´t any
When I get myself back on my feet again
Everybody wanna be my long-lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
...when you're down and out
...when you're down and out
