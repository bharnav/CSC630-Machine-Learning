I used to dream myself to somewhere else each night
I dreamed in colour
'cos I lived in black and white
Until I chanced upon this road that led to you
I couldn't see
How anything could be

Chorus:
.. Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation
It's better than a dream
Higher than the moon
Hazy like a beautiful illusion
Crazy and in confusion
And better than a dream
I used to wish I was beyond some distant door
I knew there must be more to life
And now I'm sure
No dreams of pirate caves
Or indian braves, or magic carpets could
Ever be this good
Chorus..
And better than a dream
