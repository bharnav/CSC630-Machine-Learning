You’re like a secret symphony that was created just for me
Some knowing mind some guiding hand
Must have designed, must have planned it
You’re like a garden in a land
Of barren rock and lonely sand
Where rain can fall
Where grass can grow
And through it all, I can love you so
Isn’t it strange but it’s only a feeling
Isn’t it weird it feels like I’m stealing your soul?
Isn’t it wild, this world we know now?
You’re like a prayer I was scared to say
The one who might have got away
Somebody worth all I‘ve had to face
No one on earth could replace you
You’re like a secret symphony that was created just for me
Some knowing mind some guiding hand
Must have designed, must have planned it
