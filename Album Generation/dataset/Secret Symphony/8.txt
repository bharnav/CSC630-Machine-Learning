Is it a game, or is it a show?
We don't really care, we don't really give a damn
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
For life or a day, for real or pretend
If I had my way, this feeling would never end
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
You're asking me not to leave you
And baby that makes me smile
Let's get our house with a sea-view
Forever or just for a little while
We'll drink some champagne, we'll look at the stars
And do it again cause baby the world is ours
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
Sometimes I think we're only
On a day trip to Disneyland
But remember that night you got lonely
And asked my daddy for my hand
Having a bite, having a ball
Talking all night and dancing until we fall
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
You don't call me for days, heaven forbid
The next thing you say you want me to have your kids
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
You're like an angel playing with my heartstrings
