You will never
Give the power
To the powerless
Your new ideal
Has Grown
Beyond your control
Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can't see through your eyes
Can you imagine
What is only
One step away?
The potential
Is waiting
Just beyond your grasp
Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can you keep fighting on and on?
This false me
Will burn
In effigy!
It's so easy
To relax and watch from afar
It's so easy you give in to inertia
Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can't see through your eyes
