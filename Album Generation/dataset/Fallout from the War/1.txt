Unleashed upon the shores, rain of terror
The latent power unveiled
A cruel reminder of our weakness
Of our vulnerability
We will rebuild
We will rise
We will rebuild
We will survive, survive
Inner strength will always never falter
Overpower your neglect
Turn your back on us, the abandoned
And we will rise alone
We will rebuild
We will rise
We will rebuild
We will survive, survive
Stranded and forgotten
A blind eye turns away
Another failure for the fool
Submerge the image
The spirit shines through deepest waters
