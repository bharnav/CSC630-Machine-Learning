Smashing always forward
Leave nothing in your path
Shortsighted and indifferent
To what lies ahead
Reckless abandon
Chasing your tail
Blinding ambition
You learn to fail
Winning a race
No one else began
No rest for the wicked
Winter calls again
Crawling, gagging
Chasing your tail
Battered, bleeding
You learn to fail
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
Confront the stranger
Staring back at you
Twisted reflection
In the looking glass
Reckless abandon
Chasing your tail
Blinding ambition
You learn to fail
Winning a race
No one else began
No rest for the wicked
Winter calls again
Crawling, gagging
Chasing your tail
Battered, bleeding
You learn to fail
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
Tear it out
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
Rip it up and tear it down
It weighs heavy on my soul
How could you let it fall?
The strain of the climb
Leaves you empty
