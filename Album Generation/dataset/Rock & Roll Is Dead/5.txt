C'mon and leave it be
Just try and you will see
If you leave it alone
Alone it will be

Don't try to make things right
You'll only end up in a fight
Just leave it alone
And it will be all right

Why don't you leave it alone
And go on home - just leave it alone

Hey girl, drop your guns
Give it a try just this once
And leave it alone
It feels good when it's done

Back off and turn your cheek
Give some substance to what you preach
You're wearing out the reasons
You know I've heard your speech

Why don't you leave it alone
