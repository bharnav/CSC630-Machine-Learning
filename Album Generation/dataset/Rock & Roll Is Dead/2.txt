Monkeyboy
I got an ape performing in my head
If he don't stop then I will soon be dead

This monkey's no friend of mine
I try to act straight but he's on cloud number nine
He's got a cup made of tin
And it's 'cause of him you won't let me in

He bangs a drum so I can't get no sleep
Well he's a monkey but he can't be beat

Head over heels on banana peel
I'm getting confused as to what I feel
And every time I try to speak
He always puts his monkeytongue in my cheek

Oh, my, my - I'd do anything to make him die
And oh then I'd see there's nothing I can do
The monkey's just a part of me

I got a monkey singing in my brain
I should have known already we're the same

Oh, my, my - I'd do anything to make him die
And oh then I'd see there's nothing I can do
The monkey's just a part of me

I got some monkey business to attend
I think I'll ask him if he'd hold my hand

And ask him to be a friend of mine
Together we'll fly up to cloud number nine
And share his cup made of tin
Maybe then you'd like to let us in

Oh, my, my - I did everything to make him die
But oh now I see there's nothing I can do
The monkey's just a part of me

I got some monkey business to attend
