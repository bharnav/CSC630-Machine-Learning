I'm out but it ain't too late
Like I want it to be, you know I just can't wait
For the darkness to tuck me in
So go turn off the lights and let it begin

Make it tonight and turn off the lights
Make it tonight
I'm so ready to make this day turn night

Got a roach crawling up my chin
Radiation burning holes in my skin
From a rusty can, I drink sand
The cold breeze of the night is what I want to land

Make it tonight and turn off the lights
Make it tonight
I'm so ready to make this day turn night

I'm out on the street today
But the bright lights are getting in the way
Of the darkness I hold so dear
If you can't turn 'em off, then get me out of here
