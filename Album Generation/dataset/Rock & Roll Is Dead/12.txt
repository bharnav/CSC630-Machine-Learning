MY INTENSION WAS TO STAND ON MY FEET
BUT I HAD TO LAY DOWN I WAS FEELING BEAT
FROM A RACE I REALLY THOUGHT I COULD WIN
I WAS BEAT BEFORE I EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO BEGIN
HOW COULD I EVRE BELIEVE I'D DO FINE
AGAINST MY INVINCIBLE OPPONENT AND NO FINISHING LINE

GOTTA SLOW DOWN GOTTA LEARN HOW TO DANCE
IF I CAN'T KEEP UP I HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE
IT'S FLYING BY WHILE I'M STUCK IN MY SEAT
I WOULD NEED A STARSHIP TO COMPETE
TO GET ME OFF OF MY KNEES
TIME GOT NO TIME TO WAIT FOR ME

I WAS LOOKING FOR THE TIMES THAT I SPENT
LOOKED AT YESTERDAY FOR WHERE THE HELL IT WENT
I EVEN CHECKED THE YEAR BEFORE THAT
YOU KNOW I CHECKED EVERYWHERE BUT WHERE IT WAS AT
RIGHT HERE AND NOW IS THE PLACE
WHERE I MIGHT CATCH A GLIMPSE BEFORE IT'S GONE WITHOUT A TRACE

GOTTA SLOW DOWN GOTTA LEARN HOW TO DANCE
IF I CAN'T KEEP UP I HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE
IT'S FLYING BY WHILE I'M STUCK IN MY SEAT
I WOULD NEED A STARSHIP TO COMPETE
TO GET ME OFF OF MY KNEES
TIME GOT NO TIME TO WAIT FOR ME
