Got this feeling - the feeling ain't good
You said it'd go away, I knew it never would
I may not be clever, I may not be wise
But a deaf, dumb and blind man would see through the lies

They say hang on tight - the future brings hope
But we're all hanging at the very same end of the rope
They keep preaching the gospel - the do's and the don't's
Man says he will but man you know he won't

It's nothin' new - n.o.t.h.i.n. n.e.w
It's getting us good like it always do
It's nothin' new

Well I've heard all about it - just what they say
Nothing terribly new here to save the day
We can dream all we want but it's the nature of the beast
Keep on casting stones and spread the disease

We can worry 'bout the end but we've already seen it
We can say we're sorry but we'll never mean it
We can bury the hatchet and lower our guns
But when the war is over, another has begun

It's nothin' new - n.o.t.h.i.n. n.e.w
It's getting us good like it always do
It won't get any better - the changes are too few
It's nothin' new
