[Verse 1]
Watch as we start again, a different chapter now
So welcome to our fight, there will be blood
No one can take this from us
I taste the end it's so close, there will be blood
There will be blood on our hands

[Verse 2]
No one can take this from us
I taste the end it's so close, there will be blood
There will be blood on our hands

[Chorus]
We are the promised ones and nothing's in our way
They can try but they'll never stop us
Tell all our enemies we're ready for the war
We've been here and we'll never die
Now they have nowhere to go

[Verse 3]
And now we've come too far to give it all away
So welcome to our lives, there will be blood
We'll brave this storm together
I taste the end it's so close, there will be blood
There will be blood on our hands (you are nothing, you are nothing like us)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We'll meet you on the front lines, we have nothing to lose
We'll meet you on the front lines, we have nothing to lose

[Breakdown]
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus/Outro]
Don't you know
We are the promised ones
And nothing's in our way
They can try
But they'll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
We're ready for the war
We've been here and we'll never die
We'll never die
