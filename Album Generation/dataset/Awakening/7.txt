[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you lost hope
And faith in this world?
This world
When will it change?

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye
Say goodbye cause I know you can try to
Open your eyes, it's all inside
You will wake from this nightmare
And I know you'll find a better way

[Verse 2]
Now it seems like you're bleeding just to feel alive
Your arms always tell the story
And it looks like you're living just to pass the time
Digging deeper are you trying to find
Find the strength to carry on, there is salvation
Keep holding on, keep holding

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
A better way
A better way
A better way

[Outro:]
You've gone too far even though I know you're dying to let go
You've gone too far, you've given up
Now you have to tell yourself "where did you go wrong? "
And stop yourself from falling down
I can see you running, so far away, so far away
I can see you running, so far away, away
Don't you give up, don't give up
