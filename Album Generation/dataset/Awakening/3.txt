[Verse 1: Beau Bokan & (Jared Warth)]
(Tell me)
What did you think when you found me lost
And my hope was fading
(Tell me)
And what did you say to make me feel again
Your voice could take me

[Pre-Chorus: Jared Warth]
Don't let the darkness surround me
Lift me up, I'll let you in
Don't let the darkness surround me
Lift me up, I'll let you in

[Chorus: Beau Bokan]
I said I'm sorry and I won't forget the past regrets
And now that's over
I said I'm sorry you're my only one, the past is gone
And all that's over, not losing you
And all that's over, I'm not losing you

[Bridge]
Please take me home, please take me home
Please take me home, stay with me tonight
Please take me home, please take me home
Please take me home, I'm not losing you
Please take me home, I'm not losing you
I said that you are the one for me, for me

[Chorus: Beau Bokan]
I said I'm sorry and I won't forget the past regrets
And now that's over
I said I'm sorry you're my only one, the past is gone
And all that's over, not losing you
And all that's over, I'm not losing you
