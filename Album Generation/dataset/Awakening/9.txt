[Intro]
Save me, I'm looking in from the outside
Save me, as water fills my lungs
Save me, I'm reaching up for the surface
Save me before I choke

Take me on, I'm here, I'm ready

[Chorus]
I don't want to live forever
I just want to live for you
If this world falls down around us
We'll be here shining through

[Verse 1]
And I know sometimes we move too fast
And leave our ghosts behind us
But now they're in front of me
Don't give up on me just yet
I know that you won't, I'm too hard to forget

[Verse 2]
Is this really what you want for me?
Now I need to believe
Is this really where you want me to be
This is our struggle, we need to believe

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge] x2
When I'm gone don't cry for me
My spirit will live on
If you put your faith in me I could be the one
I'll live on

[Outro] x4
I still believe
