[Intro]
We won't fall when we're under the gun
When all your heroes have failed you
When all your heroes have failed you

[Verse 1]
You'll never show your face, you are a coward
We'll never let you win ever again, never again

[Pre-Chorus]
Preach your "gospel"
Choke on your fortune and glory

[Chorus]
No matter what they say, we're not the ones who lost our way
We're fighting for our lives, we're fighting for our lives
It's not enough to say that we were the ones who lost our way
We're fighting for our lives, we're fighting for our lives

[Bridge]
All you built is in ruins
All you loved has been destroyed

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And now's the time you'll be forgotten
And now's the time, your time to be
Forgotten under when walls crash down around you
