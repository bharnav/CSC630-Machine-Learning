[Verse 1]
Breathe in softly, take my hand
We're saying goodbye but this is not the end
Your body's sinking, oh my soul
I'll see you on the other side when it is my turn

[Chorus]
The sky will open up
I've waited long to feel your touch
So meet me at the gates
And wash these tears away
And wash these tears away

[Verse 2]
On this morning the music ends
I'm down on my knees by your hospital bed
So how can I live when I'm watching you die?
And I'll see you on the other side when it is my turn

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Every breath I take like I can't escape
And I'm too afraid of letting go of you

[Bridge 2]
I found the secret to wash away all this sadness
I found the secret to wash away, to wash away

[Bridge 3]
Every breath I take like I can't escape
And I'm too afraid of letting go of you
So meet me at the gates
Every breath I take like I can't escape
And I'm too afraid of letting go of you
So meet me at the gates

[Outro]
And wash these tears away
And wash these tears away
And wash these tears away
And wash these tears away
Wash these tears away

I found the secret to wash away all this sadness
I found the secret to wash away all this sadness
I found the secret to wash away all this sadness
I found the secret to wash away all this sadness
Sadness, sadness
