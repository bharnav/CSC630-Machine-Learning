[Verse 1]
This August came and went, turned me upside down
Now I'm getting out of this town
And I told all my friends
"I'm never coming back again, I'm going far away"

[Chorus]
Ten thousand miles from here
All the things that could have been, but now
Ten thousand miles from you
All the things I should have said, somehow
It's all that I could do

[Verse 2]
It's been a year since I've looked at your face
And I'm starting to get over, over you
Everything's changed
I'm never coming back again, I'm going far away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause finding home is not easy
And nothing's ever what I planned it to be
And if I told you that I missed you
You know I never tried to lie to you I meant it all along
Now I have only ten thousand miles

[Chorus] x2
