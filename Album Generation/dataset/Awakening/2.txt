[Verse 1]
Keep moving down the line, what's sitting here is mine
You've taken far too long, go back where you belong
This place is not for the weak, this place is not for the weak
They've all been begging for the truth, it's over now (it's over now)

[Chorus 1]
We gave our lives for this
It's all we have, it's all we'll ever know
We sacrificed for this
When it's said and done, we'll have our scars to show
We'll have the scars to show

[Verse 2]
I am destruction, you'll never be the death of me
You are deception, I am the one that you betray

[Chorus 2]
We gave our lives for this, it's all we have, it's all we'll ever know
We sacrificed for this, when it's said and done we'll have our scars to show
Our scars to show
We'll have our scars to show
From now 'till the end
From now until the end

[Verse 3]
It's set in stone now there's no turning back
We'll stand our ground, we are unbroken

[Outro]
We are unbroken!
We are unbroken!
We are unbroken!
