[Verse 1]
Let's start at one
And count the days
Let's hope to God
That time flies like they say
Cause this instance
Can't distance
My heart from yours tonight
But I'm lying awake now
And I'm holding your picture

[Bridge]
It's so cold here without you
Without you

[Chorus]
And I need you now, cause it's killing me
And I wish somehow, you were here with me
When I fall asleep, I feel you with me
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me

[Verse 2]
Could this be more
I've been up all night riding subway lines
Now we're sleeping on your floor
Can we make this a lifetime
You're all I want right now
Life keeps telling me, I need to go
But what if I want to stay

[Bridge 2]
Cause I'm lost here without you
Without you

[Chorus]
And I need you now, cause it's killing me
And I wish somehow, you were here with me
When I fall asleep, I feel you with me
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me

[Hook]
I found a love I never have before
You changed me
And I will wait however long it takes
You changed me
You say the words that I've been thinking
I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
And I need you now, cause it's killing me
And I wish somehow, you were here with me
When I fall asleep, I feel you with me
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me

[End]
You changed me
You changed me
