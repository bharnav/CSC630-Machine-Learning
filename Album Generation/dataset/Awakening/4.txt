[Verse 1: Jared Warth]
I swear that this time it's real
I promise that I will keep true
My heart belongs to you
My heart belongs to you

[Chorus: Beau Bokan]
So let your love reign in my hallow land
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again
Just try and save me, just hold me in your hands
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again

[Verse 3: Beau Bokan]
All the time we spent just breaking out of this
We made it out
We are the ones with hearts of gold
I'm still the kid you used to know
And I've got a lot to say

[Bridge: Jared Warth]
Make me the light for the rest of the world
Make me the light for the rest of the world

[Chorus: Beau Bokan]
So let your love reign in my hallow land
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again
Just try and save me just hold me in your hands
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again

[Breakdown: Jared Warth]
You pulled me from my hell
You saved me from myself
And now this is who I am
At the end of the road
This is who I am at the end of the road

[Chorus: Beau Bokan]
So let your love reign  in my hallow land
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again
Just try and save me  just hold me in your hands
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again
Just make me whole again
