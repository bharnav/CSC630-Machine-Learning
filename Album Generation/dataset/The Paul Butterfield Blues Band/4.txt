Got my mojo working, just don't work on you
Got my mojo working, just don't work on you
I wanna love you so bad, don't know what to do
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women right here at my command
I got a gypsy woman, given me advice
I got a gypsy woman, given me advice
I've gotta whole lots of tricks, keep here on ice
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, just don't work on you
