You call me now I'm inside
Come back again another time
You call me now I'm inside
Come back again

You're like a light
I'm going to keep you on
Never turn you down
And then we ask ourselves
Was this move right
Was the corner tight
Where we alone
You're never going to go home

You call me now I'm inside
Come back again another time
You call me now I'm inside
Come back again

You're my number nine
Phantom daddy spice
What a man what a mind
And your lovely long hair
Time to be a light
Yes the corner's tight
While we're alone
We never want to go home

You're like a light
I'm going to keep you on
Never turn you down
And then we ask ourselves
Was this move right
Was the corner tight
Where we alone
You're never going to go home

You're a light
Phantom daddy spice
I'm going to keep you on
And your lovely long hair

You're my number nine
What a man what a mind
And then we ask ourselves
Yes the corner tight
Well we're alone
I'm going to keep you on
We never want to go home
