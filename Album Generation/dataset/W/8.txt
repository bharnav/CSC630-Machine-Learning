I am your jammy
I am a grown up man
Big hungry body
My heart is a hungry hand
Don't give the power
My heart hates all romance
I am your jammy
I am what I am
Jammy's a diva
He's got funny taste
It's real confusing
Jam has a taste for waste
Turning the timing
Passion for what I do
Is all that concerns me
I'm passionate how about you
I'm your jammy
Big hungry body
I am a grown up man
Jammy
