Don't be surprised if I'm ripping out my eyes
I'm on fire
I said don't be surprised I'm ripping out my eyes
I'm on fire

We break
We break too easily
You put on the brakes
You brake too easily

Don't be seduced until you know the truth
I'm on fire
Don't be seduced until you know my truths
I'm on fire

We break
We break too easily
You put on the brakes
You brake too easily
Break

I break too easily
I break too easily
I brake too easily
I break too easily
I brake too easily
We break too easily
We brake too easily
You break too easily
We brake too easily

We break too easily
You put on the brakes
You break to easily
I put on the brakes
I put on the brakes too easily
I put on the brakes
I put on the brakes too easily
