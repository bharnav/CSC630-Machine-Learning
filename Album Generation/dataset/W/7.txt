I wait now
In a turn of events it's Milky Blau
Stop right there
To the end into the fall
Like a freight train running my brain
Go outside I'll turn it away
I look up to you
Now
I look up to you
You ask me
In a blind attempt to break me free
You know
To the end into the fall
Like a freight train running my brain
Go outside I'll turn it away
I look up to you
Now
I look up to you
Do you ask me
Go
Do you ask me
Go
Go Go
