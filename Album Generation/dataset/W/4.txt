You know I am your man
Come on, my new friend
Now don't you be afraid
Come closer, I don't mind
I don't need a microphone to tell me what I'm really feeling for you
That deep down feeling you know, I let things out so I can put them back in
All it is I'm really trying to say is that I'll always be here for you
I am your man, my friend, and I'm just the right man for you
I'll watch you let your hair down
I'll pour you a cup of tea
We'll share our love for music
While I lick you clean
I don't need a microphone to tell me what I'm really feeling for you
I am your man my friend, and Im just the right man
I don't need a microphone to tell me what I'm really feeling for you
That deep down feeling you know, I let things out so I can put them back in
All it is I'm really trying to say is that I'm always going to be here for you
I am your man my friend, and I'm just the right man for you
Hey me, I'm the right man for you
Hey, hey me, I'm the right man for you
Hey me, I'm the right man for you
Hey me, I'm the right man for you
Hey, hey me, I'm the right man for you
