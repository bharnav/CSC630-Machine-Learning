I've got the clouds on a string
That I pull with my little finger elegantly
What is this oh what's the feeling on the breeze
It feels like all my holidays when my father used to say:
"Let's go down to the beach"
And we'd go down to the beach
My little sisters and me
Sometimes a man can feel like he is just a puppet
And the wind blows him here and blows him there
But when I kiss you my dear
I feel like a buccaneer
And water makes its music everywhere

[Chorus]
Saltwater
Oh how I miss your misty kisses
Saltwater
Oh what expressionless bliss
Is this?
Is this?
Is this?
Is this?

I've got the sky in my eyes
As I lie on my back in the deep blue sea
What is this oh what could this strange feeling be?
It feels like:
It feels like:
It feels like:
I don't know what it feels like
But it feels right
Sometimes a man is like an ice cream in a desert
And he wonders what is it we seek?
Like water runs through your fingers
Memories rise up from the deep

[Chorus]
Saltwater
Oh how I miss your misty kisses
Saltwater
Oh what expressionless bliss
Is this?
Is this?
Is this?
Is this?
