[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of a short story, oh
I feel, I feel so low
Let me start at the end, the part I haven't figured out yet
Yes, I am, I'm moving slow

You are playing the lead, the headache that my actions feed
Oh I've only got myself to blame
This is another test which I would fail when at my best
Oh, always ending the same

[Pre-Chorus]
If I were an honest guy
I'd give this role another try

[Chorus]
What do I do when I am so in love with you?
I forgot what I wanted to say
What do I do when you won't change your ways?
It's time, it's time

If I just saved you, you could save me too
If I just saved you, then you could save me too

[Verse 2]
I woke up the next morning and I didn't see it coming
Oh, your bags were packed and gone
Called all your friends, they said they hadnâ€™t seen you yet
Oh, my head's going to explode

[Pre-Chorus]
If I were an honest guy
I'd give this role another try

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I believe in the finer things, and you don't believe in me
I said, I believe in the finer things, and you don't believe in me
I said, I believe in the finer things, and you don't

[Chorus]
If I just saved you, you could save me too
If I just saved you, then you could save, you could save me too

What do I do when I am so in love with you?
I forgot what I wanted to say
What do I do when I am so in love with you?
I forgot what I wanted to say

[Outro]
If I just saved you
(No one does it better, no one does it better
No one does it, no one does it better)
If I just saved you
(No one does it, no one does it better
No one does it, no one does it)

I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of a short story
Which now I have told you all
