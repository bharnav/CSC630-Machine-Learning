Let me tell you a story bout' a boy and a girl
A very different version than you've ever heard
OK so I'm lying but all I'm trying to say
This isn't about the one that got away

Watch it from your ivory tower
Paint the sky grey, like a coward
How long've you got?
I can go on for hours
A sweet little tale that ended sour
My words will ring in your ears

Take my advice and leave right now
You're gonna find a way to sell yourself
To someone who cares
To someone desperate

First you came along my friends were dubious
She cared for the stage, not who she was with
I brushed it off and hit the road
Only to hear she's in the other's clothes

The end of summer in 2009
I wasn't really looking but what did I find?
A golden girl with golden hair
When I was with her everybody stared
And I couldn't believe my luck had changed
And I asked so nice if she wouldn't stay

Take my advice and leave right now
You're gonna find a way to sell yourself
To someone who cares
To someone desperate

If I was just to choose
I wouldn't choose you
I've got better things to do with my time
I will bear in mind
What was in this light

(Na na na na na na na na na na)

She said who do you?, she said who do you?
She said who do you?, she said who, do you?
Who, do you? Who, do you?
I said who do you?, I said who do you?

Who do you, who do you, think you are?
Who do you, who do you, think you are?
Who do you, who do you, think you are?
Who do you, who do you, think, you, are?
