[Verse 1]
When I was younger, I always thought
I could be someone if I tried enough
When I was younger, my father said
Wear a smile, show respect
When I was younger, you never said
When I was older, I'd feel helpless
When I was younger, you shone the light
And now that I'm older, it doesn't shine bright
When I was younger, you always said
That as I got older, you'd always be there

[Chorus]
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I used to care
About everything that my father said
When I was younger, you even told me
To show evil, the utmost respect
When I was younger, I never thought
That when I was older, I'd see you give up
Now that I'm older, I carry the torch
Just promise you'll stand and you'll be strong

[Chorus]
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' oooooh

[Bridge]
When I was younger, I never thought
When I was younger, I never thought
That when I was older I'd fight your wars
That when I was older I'd fight your wars
I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you
I'll do it for you, I'll do it for

[Outro]
When I was younger, I only dreamed
That when I got older, you'd be proud of me
When I was younger, I promised you both
That when I was older, you'd be proud of me
