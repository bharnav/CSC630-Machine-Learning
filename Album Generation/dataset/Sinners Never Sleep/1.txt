Let me suggest you do what you do
And I will do what I do best
You know I've always been resenting
Resenting every word you've ever said
I load my words with care
And aim them at the desperate
Just to check they can still hear
As my innocence disappears

I must be blind
To not have seen the signs
Such a pretty little thing
So much prettier without me

Life's a bitch, but I'm friends with her sister
We talked it over and it's our little secret
It's your world, I'm just trying to live in it
When you're done maybe try a little listening

I smile at all my enemies
I lead a life of positivity
I deflect curses thrown my way
I regret not saying...

I must be blind
To not have seen the signs
Such a pretty little thing
So much prettier without me

Oh when you decide to cut the strings
When you decide to ruin, my summertime...

We can be anything, we can be anything, we can be what you like
We can be anything, we can be anything, we can be what you like
Oh we can be what you like...

I must be blind
To not have seen the signs
Such a pretty little thing
So much prettier without me

(I must be blind)
Oh when you decide to cut the strings
When you decide to ruin, my summertime
