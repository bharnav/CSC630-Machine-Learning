[Verse 1]
Wait, where you say you've been?
Who you been with?
Where you say you're goin'?
Who you goin' with?
Keep me on my toes, keep me in the know
Wait, keep me in your skin, keep me in your chest
I'll wait for it to start, I'll wait for it to end
Keep me on my toes, keep me in the know

[Chorus]
But when I looked at her I thought of only you
If only there was proof I could use to show it's true

[Verse 2]
We were young, we were in our teens
It wasn't real love
Spent behind bars
Oh, it's sad to think we just let it be
Prisoners of love
It's so easy for it to be something second guessed, easy to read
Don't let it become a meaningless routine
It's meaningless to me

[Chorus]
But when I looked at her I thought of only you
If only there was proof I could use to show it's true

[Chorus 2]
Just crash, fall down
I'll wrap my arms around you now
Just crash, it's our time now
To make this work second time around

[Verse 3]
We grew up, we worked and changed our ways
Just like wildfire, been burning now for days
Tearing down those walls, nothing's in our way
I said, nothing's in our way
And I know I've said this all before
But opposites attract
We try and run away but end up running back
And all I want to do
All I want to do is lie down and

[Chorus 2]
Crash, fall down
I'll wrap my arms around you now
Just crash, it's our time now
To make this work second time around

[Outro]
Oh, crash, fall down
Just crash, fall down
Just crash, fall down
Just crash, fall down
