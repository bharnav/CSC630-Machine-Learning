I feel lonely when you disown me, my friends
You say used to know me then, now my body's under

We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
We are just sinners
We're condemned to death
We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
Fuck what you believe in
Cause this is the end

You can't find nothing at all
When there's nothing there all along
I'm everything that you're not
Which is what makes you
What makes you, want me so

We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
We are just sinners
We're condemned to death
We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
Fuck what you believe in
Cause this is the end

Take me home, please take me home
Take me somewhere I want to go
Take me home, please take me home
Take me somewhere I want to go

We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
We are just sinners
We're condemned to death
We are not your lovers
We are not your friends
Fuck what you believe in
It's the end
