I've gotta get this off my chest
I'm startin' to feel a little unrest
Oh every time I check my shoulder
I see you there with a clueless-look on your face
I’ve gotta question your intentions
You’re playing this one by the book
Whichever version you're preaching from?
I've sung it once before

I know, I know you well enough
(And if I looked hard, if I looked hard enough)
And I know, and I know you well enough
(And if I looked hard, if I looked hard enough)

If you were so honest
Why do you break every promise?
With everything that you say
I take a picture of what happens around me
You don’t like the size of us now
We've grown a lot since Hold Me Down
I can't help but think
You're the only thing in front of me

I know, I know you well enough
(Give us a little time, just a little time)
And I know, and I know you well enough
(Give us a little time, just a little time)

[Winston McCall]
You put a price on everything
You even tried to put one on me
I give my all for your benefit
I'm sick of this shit

It's not your fault you always claim
You always cease to take the blame
I love you all for everything that you do
But I'm sick and tired of the fucking abuse
I'm sick of this shit
I'm sick of this shit
