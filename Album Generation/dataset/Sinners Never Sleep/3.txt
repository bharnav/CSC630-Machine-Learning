Come a little closer
As the night gets older
Of you I grow fonder
Just let my hands wander

This is the first thing I thought
This is the last thing that I want
You were the first one I loved
You were the first love I lost

Oh, oh...

You left it too late
To change the way I think
I'll never say never again
Those words will never ever pass my lips

This is the first thing I thought
This is the last thing that I want
You were the first one I loved
You were the first love I lost

This is the first thing I thought
This is the last thing that I want
You were the first one I loved
You were the first love I lost

Oh, oh...

This is the first thing I thought

Oh, oh...

This is the first thing I thought
This is the last thing that I want
You were the first one I loved
You were the first love I lost

Never say never say never again
I'll never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
I'll never say never say never again
