[Verse 1]
Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey, must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door, whore in my bed
But hey
Where have you
Been?
If you go, I will surely die

[Chorus]
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained

[Verse 2]
"Uh!"
Said the man to the lady
"Uh!" Said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir
Go "Uh!" all night
And Mary, ain't you tired of this?
"Uh!"
Is
The
Sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks

[Chorus]
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained (chained)
We're chained
