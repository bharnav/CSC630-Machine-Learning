[Verse 1]
Outside there's a box car waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Verse 2]
Big shake on the box car moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Bridge]
Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Outro]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
