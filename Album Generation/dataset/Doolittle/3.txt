[Verse 1]
As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed

[Hook]
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

[Verse 2]
Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes

[Hook]
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

[Verse 3]
There's a place in the buried west
In a cave with a house in it
In the clay, the holes of hands
You can place a hand in hand

[Hook]
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
