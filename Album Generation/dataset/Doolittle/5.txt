[Intro]
"Whatchu think of nothing?"
"I'd like to do a nursery rhyme."

[Verse 1]
You crazy babe Bathsheba, I wancha
You're suffocating, you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, shebe, so gimme

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!

[Verse 2]
We're apin' rapin' tapin' catharsis
You get torn down and I get erected
My blood is working but my, my heart is...

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
Dead!

[Bridge]
Hey, whaddaya know?
Your lovely tan belly
Is starting to grow

[Verse 3]
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
