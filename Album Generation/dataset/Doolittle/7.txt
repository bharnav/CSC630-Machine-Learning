[Intro]
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright

[Verse 1]
What's that floating in the water?
Ol' Neptuna's only daughter
I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe
In Mr. Grieves

[Chorus]
Do you have another opinion? (Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?

[Bridge]
(La la la la, la la la la)
(La la la la, la la la la)

[Verse 2]
Got bombed, got frozen
Got finally off to finally dozing
I believe
In Mr. Grieves

[Chorus]
Do you have another opinion? (Yup! Opinion!)
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?

[Bridge]
You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope?
Oh, I believe
In Mr. Grieves

[Outro]
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
