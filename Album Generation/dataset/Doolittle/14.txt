[Chorus]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to

[Verse 1]
Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions
You stroke my locks
Some marijuana
If you got some

[Chorus]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to

[Verse 2]
Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers

[Chorus]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to

[Verse 3]
Chained to the pillars
A 3-day party
I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers

[Chorus]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
