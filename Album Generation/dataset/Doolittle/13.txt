[Verse 1]
In this land of strangers
There are dangers
There are sorrows
I can't see this lady
It is shady
I am leaving tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Even there's a reason
It's silver
It's gone
In this land of strangers
There are dangers
There are sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
