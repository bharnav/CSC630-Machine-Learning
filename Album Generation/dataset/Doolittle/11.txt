Yoo hoo

[Chorus]
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun

[Verse 2]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

[Chorus]
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun

[Verse 3]
Frienda foe
Frienda foe
Frienda foe
Frienda foe

[Chorus]
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun
There goes my gun (Goes my gun)
There goes my gun
