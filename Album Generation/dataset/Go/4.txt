Everyone will die
And everyone will lose
So what you going to do with
The moments you have before it's you

It doesn't mean goodbye
It's just a simple truth
The shedding of a lifetime of layers
That once embodied you

Like winter into spring
And summer into fall
The cycle of intense introspection
Before the curtain call

Cause everyone must die
And everyone must lose
So who you gonna love in meantime
Before it catches you

Everyone will die (Everyone will die)
Everyone will lose (Everyone will lose)
It doesn't mean goodbye (It doesn't mean goodbye)
It's just a simple truth

Every single smile
And every single tear
Reminders of the moments we shared
In the instant we were here

If everyone will die
And everyone will lose
Then who you going to love in the meantime
Before it catches you
