I'm still alive
The liquid that runs through these veins
Is not tarnished by chemical blitz
The jagged edge of this brand new bright decade
Is outlined in lip gloss and terrible lies
Her alcohol eyes proclaim me both handsome and wise

We get along, we're so fucked for each other
All idiosyncratic sacred routines
Bring me a shot glass, a pistol and patience
A William Tell vaudeville is not a disguise
Her alcohol eyes once distant now full of surprise
And after awhile

I get excited when she draws near
Despite my growing fear
I'll be tightly bound at the wrist
But if she insists, then I insist
Yeah, I insist

She is in love with the fourth of July
Jonathan Safran Foer and Captain Picard
Them I don't mind and I eat what she tells me
But try not to listen to music she buys
Her alcohol eyes upset with that last line of mine
But after awhile

I get excited when she draws near
Despite my growing fear
I'll be tightly bound at the wrist
But if she insists, then I insist
If she insists, then I insist
If she wants the wrist, then she'll get my wrist
Yeah, If she insists, I will not resist
If she insists, then I insist
