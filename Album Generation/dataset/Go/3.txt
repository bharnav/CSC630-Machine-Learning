[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sifting through the broken glass
The echoes of my ancient past
Keep flooding into every pore
Like scattered seeds of sycamore
Suddenly I started wondering how I got here
Was it a matter of time?

[Verse 2]
Catholic school my private hell
I stuttered 'til the age of twelve
Discovered sex at seventeen
And soon thereafter, self-esteem
The days did not matter
And years were a lifetime away

[Verse 3]
Drowning in a heavy stock
Of teenage girls and indie rock
I flunked out of each college course
And set my sails for no remorse
The nights were for nowhere
And that's where I wanted to be

[Chorus]
Someone said
"It's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of timing"
Do you ever wonder how you got to here?
It's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of timing
Do you ever wonder how you got to here?

[Verse 4]
Branded, marked, and paper thin
This angry saint went marching in
To war with scores of ninety proof
Found nothing but the ugly truth
A decade of wastage
An instant and everything's changed

[Verse 5]
Woke up feeling thirty-five
Though grateful that I'm still alive
Another chance at normalcy
To chase the dream, but now it seems
That days run away like wild horses over the hills

[Chorus]
Someone said
"It's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of timing"
Do you ever wonder how you got to here? (It's just a matter of time)
It's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of timing
Do you ever wonder how you got to here?

[Bridge]
Take it in and hold on while you can
All the destruction will one day end
And you'll finally know exactly who you are

[Chorus]
It's just a matter of timing
Do you ever wonder how you got to here? (It's just a matter of time)
It's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of timing
Do you ever wonder how you got to here? (It’s just a matter of time)
It’s not a matter of time, it’s just a matter of timing
Do you ever wonder how you got to here?
Do you ever wonder how you got to here?
