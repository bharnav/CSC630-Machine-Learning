[Verse 1]
There is no safer place than in between cold embraces
Say it again
I like how you work my name
Embroidering the pain on every speck of skin
The distance has been not so kind
I curse this caveat
And the temperatures are wearing paper thin
I am sick of listening

[Chorus]
The worst is yet to come, my dear
I've been fighting back for what feels like nearly several hundred years
If you just let me make my own mistakes
I promise I'll behave, only in the worst way

[Verse 2]
Too heavy to hold my own evaporating soul
Sweltered and sandwiched in the middle
Of this melting heart of major compromise
I have one foot out and one foot almost in
I am sick of listening

[Chorus]
The worst is yet to come, my dear
I've been fighting back for what feels like nearly several hundred years
If you just let me make my own mistakes
I promise I'll behave, only in the worst way
Only in the worst way

[Bridge]
I won't say I'm sorry
This hasn't been a waste of time
Tell me, do you think we'll be fine after all?
I'm all nerve, an anxious, sort of complicated fear
The worst is yet to come, my dear

[Chorus]
The worst is yet to come, my dear
I've been fighting back for what feels like nearly several hundred years
If you just let me make my own mistakes
I promise I'll behave, only in the worst way

The worst is yet to come, my dear
I've been fighting back for what feels like nearly several hundred years
If you just let me make my own mistakes
I promise I'll behave, only in the worst way
Only in the worst way
Only in the worst way
