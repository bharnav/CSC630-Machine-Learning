Have you had enough?
Are you tough? Are you broken?
Hit me where it hurts
Don't just curtsy and sulk
I know I deserve every elegant word
That you're hurling at me

When I listen to your voice
Squawking noise, I am thinking
How to count on back
With some knots and some stink
I'll seal it, two raindrops of love forming under your eyelids
As I push you too far

[Hook]
I know I'm a son of a gun
Pissing you off just for fun
You're overdramatic, I'm aerodynamic, it's oh so romantic
That's why I'm a son of a gun

When we started out
There was doubt, there was caution
But I wore you down
With my slapstick and passion
Tricks of the trade
I'm a lovable knave, I'm a handful, it's true

All the itty bitty quirks
Used to work in my favor
Now they tend to rot
And affect your behavior
I'm still the same freak and I may cause pain
But I love ya and that will never change

[Hook]

Ooh, yeah, turn it up

You're overdramatic, I'm aerodynamic
It's oh so romantic
Your heart's filled with panic, if you're the Titanic
I'll swim the Atlantic
Incantations I can kick to movies you don't think I hate
Those romance flicks
That's why I'm a son of a gun
