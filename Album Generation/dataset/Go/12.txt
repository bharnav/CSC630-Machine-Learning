[Intro]
I couldn't move, I was more than confused
I was experiencing desperation
I had been cursed, and it only got worse
When I got caught up in that situation

[Verse #1]
I couldn't breath, I was never at ease
I was a wrecking ball of aggravation
I had my doubts that I'd find a way out
With all the agony and trepidation

[Refrain]
The words I never said out loud
And the things I never did at all
Are coming back to haunt me
Now that I'm alive

[Chorus]
I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender
I'm afraid, I'm afraid of it all
It's a monster I can't ignore
I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender

[Verse #2]
Yeah, I was born on the carpeted floor
Watching the headlights ignite my ceiling
I couldn't sleep, couldn't get up to eat
And I was hungry for a different feeling

[Refrain]
The words I never said out loud
And the things I never did at all
Are coming back to haunt me
Now that I'm alive

[Chorus]
I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender
I'm afraid, I'm afraid of it all
It's a monster I can't ignore
I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender

[Intro]
I couldn't move, I was more than confused
I was experiencing desperation
I had been cursed, and it only got worse
When I got caught up in that situation

[Bridge]
Terrorize, too busy playing dead to be alive
Terrorize, too busy playing dead to be alive
Terrorize, too busy playing dead to be alive
Terrorize, too busy playing dead to be alive

[Chorus]
I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender
I'm afraid, I'm afraid of it all
It's a monster I can't ignore

I don't care, I don't care anymore
I give up, I give in, I surrender

[Outro]
I'm afraid, I'm afraid of it all
It's a monster I just can't ignore
