I knew right from the start
One day panic and everything falls apart
And absolute dark

Then came in for the kill
Like some language
Emotions are not refilled
So hauntingly still

If I had to tell the truth
I would rather be a liar
Feeding off of the abuse
Because I need something more than you

I crave spasms and spark
Tight rope victim embracing my battle scars
A laboring heart

One less message to send
My debt branches
They break, they refuse to bend
All static again

If I had to tell the truth
I would rather be a liar
Feeding off of the abuse
Because I need something more than you

The severing of ties
The parting of our lives
The bitter blue
And there's not room enough for you

Humiliating cold
The pieces that I sold
The deepest black
The love I lost and can't get back

If I had to tell the truth
I would rather be a liar
Feeding off of the abuse
Because I need something more than you

If I had to tell the truth
I would rather be a liar
Feeding off of the abuse
Because I need something more than you

I need something more than you
