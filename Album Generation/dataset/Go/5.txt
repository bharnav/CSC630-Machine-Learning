[Hook]
Ooh, I need time to get it right

Always trying to illuminate the past
Questions answered, but the insight never lasts
So I won't look back, I won't look down
I'll focus on the comfort of the cold, cold ground
Comatose and singing

[Hook x2]

Always trying to decipher what it means
Hours wasted in the land of hopes and dreams
But I won't look back, I won't look down
I'll focus on the planet spinning 'round and 'round
Comatose and singing

[Hook x4]

No I won't look back this time
I'm gonna welter in this lie
Dizzy as this coma kid
With all the things I never said and never did
With all the things I never said and never did

[Hook]

I won't look back
I won't look down again (I need time to get it right)
I won't look back
I won't look down again (I need time to get it right)
I won't look back
I won't look down again (I need time to get it right)
I won't look back
I won't look down again (I need time to get it right)
I won't look back
I won't look down
I'll focus on the tension building pound for pound
Comatose and singing

[Hook x4]
