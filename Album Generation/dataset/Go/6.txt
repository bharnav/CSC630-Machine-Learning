Hey boxelder, where'd you go?
Hey boxelder, take me with you

Loneliness, I don't exist, that's fine, okay
A slickened wrist and all of this will end, okay
Hey boxelder, I'm terrified of everything at night
Hey boxelder, I'm terrified of what I lack inside me

[Hook]
Caught me talkin' to myself again
One by one, we all go marchin' in
I hate myself and no one else
But I lie so well, that you'd never tell
If I let you in, it would end us both
I care too much to leave this hole

Loneliness, I don't exist, that's fine, okay
December's gift, a constant fist to spine, okay
I'm terrified of everything at night (Hey boxelder)
A dying wish to care if I exist (Hey boxelder)

[Hook]

When loneliness comes crashing in
I will always sink, I will never swim
It's the game I play, it's the course not curse
The constant captive at my worst
When I'm at my worst, when I'm at my worst
When I'm at my worst

Hey boxelder, take me with you
Hey boxelder, take me with you
