I have a few things to say
I'll just say what I need to
I have a few years to go before I'm floating down the river again

So it appears I'm alive
Hey, it's been quite a long time
I've spent a handful of years negotiating terms in hospital gowns
If you believe what you read, you'll be dead before nightfall
That's why I'm starting again without the pages in my hand
Do you feel the same?
Caught beneath the weight of it all

I am attempting to change after years of destruction
Don't be alarmed
I'm still stupid, awkward, anxious, and a terrible bore
But I'm excited these days
It's the strangest sensation
I only wish I were younger, so I would have more time to explore
Do you feel the same?
Do you understand
All the pieces of the scale are caught beneath the weight of it all?
Caught beneath the weight of it all

I have a few things to say
I'll just say what I need to
I have a few years to go before I'm floating down the river again
Do you feel the same?
Do you understand every letter in your name
Is caught beneath the weight of it all
Caught beneath the weight of it all
Caught beneath the weight of it all
Of it all
All
