I can feel it in my bones tonight
Drain me slowly of the will to fight
Glowing yellow in the bedroom light
I can feel it in my bones tonight
There is a terror in your eyes tonight
Something awful has you wrapped in white
Take me in your arms and hold me tight

Cause I won't be here for long, my dear
Settle our accounts
Happy anniversary
Show me how to calm your fears
I'll do what I can
Happy anniversary

I can feel it in my bones tonight
Swallowing whatever's in its sight
Struggling to breathe with all my might

Cause I won't be here to dry your tears
Send the kids my love
Happy anniversary
Promise me you'll laugh, my dear, after I am gone
Happy anniversary
Happy anniversary

Cause I won't be waking up, my dear
Time has run its course
Happy anniversary
Now I'll say goodbye, my dear
This will be our last
Happy anniversary

I can feel it in my bones tonight
