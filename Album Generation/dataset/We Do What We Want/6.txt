You got me falling in love with what's next
The personalities a casualty but I'm impressed
With the way you control the verbs
I'm moving in and out with words
So slow down. We don't have to rush
How profound is the secret perception to the touch
Is it just me or does this routine ever get inside your head?
And tell you all the little things you wish had been said?
That you wish had been said?

When, when will I be old enough to do as I please?
These late nights are getting old
There are better ways to your knees
He reminded me to always button up
We were daddy's little peach
When will I be old enough?
When will I be old enough, to do as I please?

You got me here. But you got me wrong. (Got me wrong)
I'm not a cannibal but I cannot say I won't eat one of my own
But with words slurred, I confess: This smile isn't based on
Your subtle wit but the cut of your dress
That makes that ugly morning seem so far away
And if it ever comes at all, I'll know just what to say

When, when will I be old enough to do as I please?
These late nights are getting old
There are better ways to your knees
He reminded me to always button up
We were daddy's little peach
When will I be old enough?

When will I be old enough, to do as I please?
To do as I please?
To do as I please?

So wake up. Wake up its the morning
Another eight hours and the day's left you wanting reprieve
Or at least religion
But just relax, 'cause everyone's sinning
Last night. The drinks. The words
The kiss. The car. The apartment
The cab fare. Fake digits
Your hand. Your make up
Your high heels, impeccable
And all of it just to sit
With some bottle thieves and counterfeits
How respectable. How respectable

Let's turn the lights on
Let's turn the lights on
Let's turn the lights on
Let's turn the lights on, now

When will I be old enough to do as I please?
When will I be old enough to do as I please? (Daddy's little peach)
When will I be old enough? (When will I be)
When will I be?
When will I be?
