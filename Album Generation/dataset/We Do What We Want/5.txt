Your self destruction has become mine
Your reflection contains nothing but vacant eyes
Those vacant eyes tell the stories, tell the stories
You forsake all loyalties for lies

You're too late to decide
This can't go right
Cause I got this tonight
I got this tonight

I wondered how hurt you'd be (the words we've become)
After you read this (were they yours or mine)
Did it even speed your heart beat (is that what you thought)
Or make you nervous? (thought that you would find)
I need to say this (what you waited for)
The best parts were hush, hush (tonight)
The best parts were pure luck (tonight)
But I swore that this time
I was more than your hook up

Those vacant eyes looking back
To see your words under my skin
And I am more than a moment
But I had to give in
A person gets just one chance
To say what they really mean
You said yours, I'll say mine
It's all wasted, so fake it, at 19

The best years have passed you by
The best years have already passed
You forsake all loyalties for lies
You forsake all loyalties for lies

Your penny thoughts of leaving (I can still hear the sound)
Together from this town (we can work this out)
Convinced the boy inside me (with the last of my strength)
To let his guard down (I said everything)
You played me so well (enjoy your time left)
I didn't notice when the floor fell (without the blame)
From underneath my feet
I thought we were floating

Those vacant eyes looking back
To see your words under my skin
And I am more than a moment
But I had to give in
A person gets just one chance
To say what they really mean
You said yours, I'll say mine
It's all wasted, so fake it, at 19

The best years have passed you by
The best years have already passed you by

Is this the world passing by?
Or is it turning, turning?
This is the first time that I have ever looked inside myself
It was the first time that I ever looked inside myself
Now the world beneath my feet is turning, turning
Oh, this silly world keeps turning, turning away
All this time the world I knew was turning, turning
All this time that I loved you
You were turning, turning away
