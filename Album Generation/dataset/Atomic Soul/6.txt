She was born in a sea of rage
A star we call the sun forged her body
In an ancient age

She fought hard to raise us
But still we look to the stars
Seeking life in the great beyond
Life beyond this life of ours

She reigns on and on
Spinning into oblivion

Silver string
She pulls me back
Within her sentinel moon
Shielding me from the lifeless black

When all her children leave
I will stay behind
To guard the queen
And hold the line

She reigns on and on
Spinning into oblivion
Oh, she's divine
The envy of all around her
Oh, a beautiful aura of blue surrounds her
She reigns on and on
Spinning into oblivion

She reigns on and on
Spinning into oblivion
Oh, she's divine
The envy of all around her
Oh, the mystical aura of life
Surrounds her

After all is dead and gone
Her spirit lives on forever
