So long
Since I've seen you it's been a while
Searching
I'm still searching for a smile

The distance there is between us
Doesn't ease the pain
No matter how far away you are
In my mind your eyes remain

[Chorus:]
Every night
I see you in my dreams
And there you'll stay
Tearing myself to pieces
Knowing things will never be the same

Your love
Is all I ever wanted to know
Moving on
It's hard to do when you can't seem to find the road

I'm so lost
Lost in the memories of yesterday
So here I am talking to your stone
All alone, running out of things to say

[Chorus]
Every night
I see you in my dreams
And there you'll stay
Knowing inside I must believe
In heaven we'll meet again someday
