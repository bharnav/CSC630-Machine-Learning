Late one night I was fixin' to fight
A dirty hustler tryin' to cop my $$$
When from behind a whiskey bottle
Cracked me then I hit the floor
Barely alive I could feel him drive
A black needle in to draw my blood
With an evil grin he sang a mojo hymn
And left me face down in the mud
Dark angel gonna get me
Lord, set me free

I've been cursed by a voodoo hand
Black magic all around
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
Cursed by a voodoo hand
Death's needle pushing down
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground

Well, I headed south by word of mouth
To a shack down Louisiana way
I meet another man with voodoo hands
And this is what he had to say
I feel it in my bones
That your restless soul's
Tormented by an evil curse
But if this mojo man
Got your blood in his hands
No way the spell can be reversed
Dark angel ain't gonna let me be

I've been cursed by a voodoo hand
Black magic all around
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
Cursed by a voodoo hand
Death's needle pushing, pushing
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
Oh Lord, I'm dying

Cursed by a voodoo hand
Black magic all around
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
Cursed by a voodoo hand
Death's needle pushing down
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
