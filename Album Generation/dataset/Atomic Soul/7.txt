Well, it's all over now
You see I'm leaving you for good
Ya just don't pay me no mind
And ya don't treat me like you should
You know you don't
You know you don't
Girl, I'm tired of begging
You got me down on my knees
There ain't no two ways about it, baby
You got to love me or let me be
That's what I...that's what I said

I've heard your lies a thousand times
Like a fool I believed you
Damn, I must be blind
Not this time I'm walking out that door
Way beyond forgiveness I can't take it no more

Yeah, people been talkin'
They say ya been sleeping around
Oh no, oh no
Now that I'm walkin', baby
So tell me who you doin' now
Yeah, like I really wanna know

I've heard those lies so many times
Like a fool I believed you
God, I must be blind
Not this time I'm walking out that door
Way beyond forgiveness I can't take it no more

God knows I've tried
Done all I can do
Still I can't seem to get through to you
I need a woman who understands
How to love
How to love
How to love a man

You just don't understand
Ya think love is a late night booty call
Well, if I didn't hit it, baby
You wouldn't come around here at all
Oh, you know it's true

These cryin' eyes are seein' clear
Don't you even dare
Don't you even dare to try and tell me what I wanna hear
Not this time I'm walking out that door
We're way beyond forgiveness
I can't take it no more

God knows I've tried
Done all I can do
Still I can't seem to get through to you
I need a woman who understands
How to love
How to love
How to love a man
