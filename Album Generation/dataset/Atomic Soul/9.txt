Well, here we are
It's the world against us again
Again and again
Heartbreak after heartbreak
We force the wings of love into the wind
Again and again
All our lives we struggled
I've come to realize
I've always found the strength to fight
When I see your eyes
In your eyes

[Chorus:]
We will fly, you and I
Wherever we go
Whatever road we choose
We can't lose
There'll be days when the going is hard
But it's just another bend
Just another little bend in the road
Oh yes, it is
Just a little bend
A little bend in the road

Where do they go?
Youthful years, they slip away
Far, far away
Been gone too long
Home is where I want to stay
Always, always
For so long we struggled just to get by
I've always found the strength to fight
When I see your eyes
In your eyes

[Chorus]
So here we are
Playing the same old game again
Again and again
Against the odds
We seem to find a way to win
Again and again
All of life's a struggle
You've come to realize
In faith you find the strength to climb
To reach the skies

[Chorus]
