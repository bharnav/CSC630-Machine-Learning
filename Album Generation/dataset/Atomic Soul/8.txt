Friday night
I'm on the prowl
With Saucey Jack and Captain Coke
Rollin' cannons and I'm fanning the greens
Feelin' mean
Feelin' rock and roll

[Chorus:]
I need a kick in the ass
Need a blast
I want a fast girl or two
Oh Lord, dirty livin' gonna kill me
But oh I love it so
Ya know I do

Old vices got me down
Damn dope callin' my name
Everyday I play a losing hand
But I refuse to quit the game
Lord, have mercy

[Chorus]
Blowin' lights all over town
I got to move, I got to go
Livin' life on a razor's edge
Kiss the bones and let 'em roll
Roll, baby, roll

[Chorus]
I need a kick in the ass
Need a blast
I want a fast girl or two
Oh Lord, I know it's gonna kill me
But I gotta do
What I got to do
Alright
