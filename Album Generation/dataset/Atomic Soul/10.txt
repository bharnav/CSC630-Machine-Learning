Rockin' down the road and rollin' with the band
Livin' for the music playin' all across the land
Come on we're live tonight, to shakin' but livin' ?
Come on if ya want to fly baby got to spread your wings

Let the sound surround you
Let it get under your skin
Feel the rhythm move you
Open up your heart
I'm coming in

Yeah, it's alright
We're gonna let it burn tonight
Get ready for a rocket ride
I'm on fire, fire

Yeah, you ready to go
Man, you're gonna lose control
You're feelin' that atomic soul
You're on fire, fire
You're on fire now

Flyin' way beyond the speed of sound
I'm feelin' so high I never wanna come back down
Come on feel the rush
Jump, jump, jump right in
Come on raise your hands
Let the fun begin

Let the sound surround you
Let it get under your skin
Feel the rhythm move you
Open up your heart
I'm comin'
I'm comin' in

Yeah, it's alright
We're gonna let it burn tonight
Get ready for a rocket ride
I'm on fire, fire

Yeah, you ready to go
Man, you're gonna lose control
You're feelin' that atomic soul
You're on fire, fire
We're on fire, fire now

Yeah, it's alright
We're gonna let it burn tonight
Get ready for a rocket ride
I'm on fire, fire

Yeah, you ready to go
Man, you're gonna lose control
You're feelin' that atomic soul
You're on fire, fire
Fire, fire
We're on fire, fire
Lord we're fire now
Yeah
