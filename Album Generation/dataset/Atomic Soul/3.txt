Feeling heavy, got this stone on my back
It's driving me insane
Like a levee that's beginning to crack
Holding back this river of pain

Desperation has captured my soul
My mind stricken with fear
Don't see why I should try to go on
The voice of reason's calling me
It's calling me, but I can't hear it
Oh, my hands are shaking
Rattled nerves on the verge of breaking
That blade is turning on me
Turning, turning

(Guardian)
Angel, where are you now?
No one can save me, only you know how
(Guardian)
Angel, out on a ledge
Pull me away and save me from the bleeding edge

Lonely days and lonelier nights
No love come around my door
Oh, then demons they just screamin' away
Lord, I can't take it
I can't take enough to make it go away

I'm feeling jaded
Tired eyes on the verge of fading
Oh no, oh here they come again
Trying to tell me death is my friend

(Guardian)
Angel, where are you now?
No one can save me, only you can save me now
(Guardian)
Angel, out on a ledge
Pull me away and save me from the bleeding edge
