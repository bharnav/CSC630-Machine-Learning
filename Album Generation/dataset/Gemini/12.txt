In the garden spoke to His Father for the last time (Yeah)
And Satan tried to trick Him
Said He didn't have to die
Jesus said Father not My will but Your will be done
The Messiah Jehovah He knew he was the one

So it pleased them all to bruise Him
They beat Him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Him and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them, Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you

To the disciples he said whom say ye that I am
Elijah the prophet from on high or am I the Son of man
Surely thou art The Christ
The Son of God who reigns supreme
He had to die thats why he came he came to set men free

So it pleased them all to bruise Him
They beat Him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Him and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them, Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you

So it pleased them all to bruise him
They beat him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Hhim and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them, Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you

My Jesus paid the ultimate sacrifice
It was the reason why He came
The Lord said that He had to die
But He would surely rise again

So it pleased them all to bruise him
They beat him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Hhim and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them, Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you
