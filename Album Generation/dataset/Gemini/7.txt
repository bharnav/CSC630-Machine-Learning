Blessed be the day
She's the finest I've ever seen
Cut from the finest cloth of human being
An' bein' in her presence is like the first day of spring
N' whenever I'm in her arms I hear the angles sing

She moves, She's so graceful
She commands respect
An' ooh she's so well put together
Like she's drawn by an architect
And all of the mistakes that I made before in my life
All fall by the wayside now that she's mine

I know she's more woman than I've ever seen
She says that she wants me
She says that she needs me
I know she's more woman than I'll ever need
She says that she love's me
She'll never leave me

Blessed by the way she handles herself
That's why I'm givin' my heart to her and no one else
She knows how to please me
She knows how when and where
She knows the right things to say
Let's me know she cares

She moves, She's so graceful
She commands respect
An' ooh she's so well put together
Like she's drawn by an architect
And all of the mistakes that I made before in my life
All fall by the wayside now that she's mine

I know she's more woman than I've ever seen
She says that she wants me
She says that she needs me
I know she's more woman than I'll ever need
She says that she love's me
She'll never leave me

This women make my heart beat twice
When we makin' love in the car late night
Let my soul take flight
Apple of my eye, let me take a bite
I wanna know what you taste like
I ran through all of them
From the Marcia Brady type to Ben Stiller married
To a hood rat chick, rockin' fatigues like the military
From the streets of killa-cali to the shores of tripoli
Dr. Jays on the coture from Italy, yo
I sip a kiss like a glass of wine
I take control in the bedroom 'cause that ass is mine
I'll count the freckles on ya face just to pass the time
You're serenaded by an ill rhyme, mastermind
'Cause you're more than a lover, there's more to
I had to get myself in order just in order to love ya
From head to toe, I had to get you know
I usually don't get down like this but you special though

I know she's more woman than I've ever seen
She says that she wants me
She says that she needs me
I know she's more woman than I'll ever need
She says that she love's me
She'll never leave me
