The nite is over
The DJ's bout to play a slow jam
I'm waitin bout an hour
For this momement to dance with you
Do you wanna dance with me with me too

We're hand in hand
We're cheek to cheek
Shoulder to shoulder
I reach around and grab a little booty
And it feels so good

I just wanna tell you
There's no place
I'd rather be
Than here with you

I just wanna tell you
There's no place
I'd rather be
Than here with you

No need to worry
Just let the music take you over
Its startin to feel like we're in a movie
Cause it feels so right
Can I drive you home tonight

And I think that this could be
The begining of a good thing
I look into your eyes
And they tell me
That you feel like I do

I just wanna tell you
There's no place
I'd rather be
Than here with you

I just wanna tell you
There's no place
I'd rather be
Than here with you

Now that you and I are here together
Let's make the moment last forever
Ain't no way I might be foolin around
(ain't nobody foolin around )
And OH
I know I might see you next to never
I'm glad I had this time with you tonight
Chorus
