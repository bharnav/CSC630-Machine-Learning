It's been too long
Since last I saw your face
You been keepin' it tight
And everything appears to be in it's proper place
We laughed about back in '94
Reminiscin', I'm hoping for a little old times sake
Can you stay, can you stay

Do you, want me
Anything like I want you
Your body's callin'
Tell me you can hear it too
I'm still crazy for you
What are we gonna do
Can you stay, stay

The night is young
And a familiar mood fills the air
I pour the wine
And run my fingers through your hair
The mojos workin', can you feel it
It's almost time to reveal it
Let's fly away
What do ya say

Do you, want me
Anything like I want you
Your body's callin'
Tell me you can hear it too
I'm still crazy for you
What are we gonna do
Can you stay, stay

Don't you worry 'bout a thing girl
Everything's alright, it's alright
See the smile upon my face
'Cause we're together, together
Let's forget about the past
That was yesterday, yesterday
But today is today
Stay

Do you, want me
Anything like I want you
Your body's callin'
Tell me you can hear it too
I'm still crazy for you
What are we gonna do
Can you stay, stay
