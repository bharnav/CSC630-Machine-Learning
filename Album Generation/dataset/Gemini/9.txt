Thought about it
No doubt about it
When you seek you find
Since I left you
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I paid the cost
Now it appears I lost the melody
Got monumental making up to do with you baby

Made some mistakes
Caused some heartbreak
You must be fed up
I didn't mean it when I was screamin'
That I'd had enough
An' all the time that's passed from then to now
I Can't get it right
Baby girl I need to see you tonight

'Cause I miss you
Want you
Need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days
When you were mine
Ill do whatever I gotta do
To make you see
I can't live without you girl
Come back to me

Told you so many lies
Just to feed my selfishness and greed
Through all the fanfare
What was out there wasn't what I need
Found an old photograph
Brought back all the old memories
Wasted so much time without you
My baby I beep you
Try to reach you
Head over to your place
I get over
Someone elses Rover
Is parked up in my space
What have I done
I might have lost the one
I might be too late
Every time I get the machine I say

'Cause I miss you
Want you
Need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days
When you were mine
Ill do whatever I gotta do
To make you see
I can't live without you girl
Come back to me

Oh I know there's still a place for me in your heart
And oh every moment I spend without you girl
Is tearing me apart
I know that this ain't the way that it was meant to be
Baby please forgive me girl
Come on back

'Cause I miss you
Want you
Need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days
When you were mine
Ill do whatever I gotta do
To make you see
I can't live without you girl
Come back to me
