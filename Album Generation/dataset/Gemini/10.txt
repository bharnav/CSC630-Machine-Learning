Tell me no if you don't like it
I know what that means
But it's different from when I touch you
Ain't tryin' to fight it
Got a playa all excited, wonder if you can ride it
Straight out the Maseratti
On the back of the Dukati
I just wanna bubble, I'm not trying to trouble nobody
I just love to have me a stallion standing beside me
You tryin' to hide your feelings, and that's aight with me
I only want a minute, you ain't gotta spend the night with me

Born the 5th of June by the afternoon
In Mississippi I was walking and
Fifteen got my first Benz, been rollin' ever since
Baby girl, sho lookin' good to me
Ya body's crisp and clean with out the caffeine
In my head, it seemed logical
There's somethin' in ya eyes, it got me hypnotized
Let me know if somethings possible
Got me rubbin' up on you
You don't tell me you don't want me to
Got me playin' in your hair
You know I want to take you there

I kick my game
You feel the same
But you got your peeps
But tonight, we're playin' for keeps

You know you wanna be with me
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
I'll wait another 5 minutes to see
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Go tell your girls you're gonna be all right
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Come on and roll with me tonight
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do

Shortie, jus' in case you ain't know
Me and Brian McK got a spot on the low
We hittin' hard like the cops at the door

Wouldn't it be nice to bang a young entrepreneur
I see you peepin' all in my grill
And I can tell you got a hole that you want me to fill
You got something that I want to kill
And they can sentence me to life, I wouldn't want an appeal
Ooh
I run the city like a taxi cab
And all the meters miss pretty with an ass to grab
Ooh
Take a seat up in the passenger side
Akon got the wheels just enjoy the ride

I kick my game
You feel the same
But you got your peeps
But tonight we're playin' for keeps

You know you wanna be with me
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
I'll wait another 5 minutes to see
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Go tell your girls you're gonna be all right
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Come on and roll with me tonight
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do

They say the apple don't fall far from the tree
So you should chill when your daughters in waters with p
I'm here to comfort your nerves
Wanna massage you with herb

All you gotta do is pay attention and envision the words
Get them thoughts out of ya head 'bout what you done
Heard in the wind
About me being a dog, that hearsay is played out
We keep on going through these obstacles
You can take a ride with the great, it ain't impossible

What's ya name Kianya, short for Yolanda
Well, what's that behind ya, you got it from ya mama
Well, where can I find ya, I like that type
And I ain't tryin' hold you down for just one night
So what the deal then, what's up
You comin' with me, what we gonna do
We gonna cut and get something to eat
Who you came with ya girls throw them the keys
Look, get in the car, she gonna call you around three

You know you wanna be with me
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
I'll wait another 5 minutes to see
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Go tell your girls you're gonna be all right
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Come on and roll with me tonight
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
