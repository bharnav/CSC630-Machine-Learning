Every mornin' runnin' late
Your boss is trying not to hate
You find it hard to concentrate
Thinkin' 'bout this good thing

I try my best to be your man
Use me girl if that's your plan
In the end you'll understand
Happiness is what I bring

Baby tell me who
Can someone do it better (oh yeah)
Tell me who
Whenever we're together it's like ooh (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now

I keep you in the mood
It's easy girl 'cause I know what to do (oh yeah)
When the phone is ringin' don't disturb the grove (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now

For your touch
Inside I yearn
To love you more
I want to learn
Your body is my first concern
Only when I'm breathin'

I'll get it 'till I hit it right
When it comes to makin' love I'm nice
You won't have to tell me twice
There's no way that you're leavin'

Baby tell me who
Can someone do it better (oh yeah)
Tell me who
Whenever we're together it's like ooh (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now

Ooh baby when the lights go down
I only wait to hear the sound of you
No holdin' back, let it out
That there's no place you'd rather be right now
Ooh baby is ya feelin' good
Is it better than you thought it would
Are you comin' back I think you should
Over and over again

Baby tell me who
Can someone do it better (oh yeah)
Tell me who
Whenever we're together it's like ooh (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now
