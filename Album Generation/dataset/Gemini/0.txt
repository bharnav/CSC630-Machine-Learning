When we started
Down this crooked path
It was a point in time
Wasn't meant to be
I told you not
Not to fall
In love with me

I hate
I hate to leave you
Out there on that limb
I think you might
Might as well, stay with him

They say the grass
The grass is greener over yonder
On the other side
I never told you, that I loved you
And if I did, baby I lied
You wanna tell
That its over
Well I think, you might wanna think again
Maybe you might as well
Might as well, stay with him
Cause' you don't know
You don't know
How much he loves you
And needs you so
You don't really wanna be
Be with me
Cause' I'd leave you all alone
I hate to leave you
Out there on that limb
I think you might as well
Stay with him
