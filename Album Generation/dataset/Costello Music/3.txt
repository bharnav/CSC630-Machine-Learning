[Verse 1]
Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that
She said, "You know me well"
I seen you and little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel, oh yeah
Someone said you was asking after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said, "Tell me your name, is it sweet?"
She said, "My boy, it's Dagger, oh yeah"

[Bridge]
I was good, she was hot
Stealin' everything she got
I was bold, she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear; thank you, dear
Bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

[Verse 2]
Well, you must be a boy with bones like that
She said, "You got me wrong"
I would've sold them to you if I could've
Just to have kept the last of my clothes on
Call me up, take me down with you when you go
I could be your regular belle
And I'll dance for little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel", oh yeah

[Bridge]
I was good, she was hot
Stealin' everything she got
I was bold, she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear; thank you, dear
Bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

[Chorus]
Chelsea, Chelsea, I believe
That when you're dancing slowly, sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger
And another for the one you believe
Chelsea, I believe
That when you're dancing slowly, sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger
And another for the one you believe
