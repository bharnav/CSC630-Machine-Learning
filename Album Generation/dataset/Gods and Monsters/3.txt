From an ordinary house, in an ordinary road
From an ordinary town there came an ordinary girl
A face that looked surprised, a book of dog earred loans?

Never made a sound, never said a word
Nothing was ever seen, nothing was ever heard
In an ordinary town, and an ordinary girl

She's feeling, outrageous, so daft and courageous
She's laughing, flirtacious, we're falling, unconscious
She's selfish, and needy, she's wanton and greedy
She's mugging, her lovers, she's bleeding her brothers from the level?

In an ordinary house, in an ordinary town
Upon an ordinary street, nothing was ever found
By an ordinary girl who never made a sound

She's up in, the attic, she's bristling, with static
???
She's wanton, and needy, she's selfish and greedy
She's mugging, her lovers, she's bleeding her brothers from the level?

The ones she's, been kissing, are strangely, gone missing
The day when you wed her, you saw me unteather
This feeling, no never, they all went together
