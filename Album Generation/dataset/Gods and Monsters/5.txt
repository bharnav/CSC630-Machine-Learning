You know the faces, you know the places
You know places where the faces fit

You always wanted, to never say it
And now you wonder, well is this it?

I'm always screaming, dreaming
Strange without you, without you

You know the numbers, you dream in slumber
You've got the faces and the photographs

You always want it, but never say it
And now you wonder, well what do I have?

I'm always screaming, dreaming
Strange without, without you

Without you
Strange without you
Strange without you
Without you
Without you

Strange without you
Strange without you
Strange without you
Strange without you
