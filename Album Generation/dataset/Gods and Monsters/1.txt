Yearning, keep them burning, kepp them earning
Someones got to pay for all these televisions
There's children singing, and church bells ringing
And people skipping merrily to work and dreaming
And dreaming

For maybe, you'll wind up crazy, and when you're drinking
You may start thinking that you're stupid and you're lazy
Well just keep earning, keep on yearning
And you will believe there are no gods and monsters
Gods and monsters

So free of contradictions, no dereliction
There are no gods and monsters
So useless and so pretty and so good
So pretty and so good, gods and monsters

Now have I got you watching, for all the gods and monsters
A sitting, reclining in the back row of your mind
I think thats what you'll find
Yes there are gods and monsters
Yes there are gods and monsters
