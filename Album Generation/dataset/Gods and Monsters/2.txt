Shut your mouth, and watch my lips
Can you feel her healing finger tips
Coming down, on you like rain
So tell me now where do we remain

Over my shoulder it goes
And where it lands, you don't want to know

I used to work, night and day
Nobody listened to a word I'd say
I didn't care who knew me then
And someone stupid asked if we were friends, well

Over my shoulder it goes
Back to a bar, we both used to know

Shut your mouth, and watch my lips
Can you feel her healing finger tips
Coming down, on you like rain
Tell me now where do we remain

Over my shoulder it goes
And where it lands, you don't want to know

Over my shoulder it goes
And where it lands, you don't want to know
