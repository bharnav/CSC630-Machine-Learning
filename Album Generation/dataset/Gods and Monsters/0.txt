Crawl upon the earth, scour the universe you know
Set my compass north, circumscribe the earth and go - no direction home

Whats my part in this, whats this dream I can't let go
Whats your weight of this, what d'ya want to see and who d'ya want to know
You've no direction home, no direction home, no direction

Feels like all is lost, there's nowhere left to go
Through the seasoned sands, cross the sky to the morning snow
