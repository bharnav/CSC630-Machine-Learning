I believe
In the hallelujah chorus of the shopping malls
We say we can't, we know we shant, well of course we shall
Cause I've seen, I believe

That we are forever something which is incomplete
We trade ourselves for nothings and words are our conceits
I have seen, now I believe

That the ceaseless, seamless strain of your heart
One day you'll cause itself to make a start
With me,we believe

I Never thought I'd string along
I never thought we'd last this long
But we've seen, so we believe
In the hallelujah chorus of the shopping malls
We say we can't, we know we shant, of course we shall
Cause we've seen, now we believe

I Never thought I'd string along
I never thought we'd last this long
I have seen, I Believe
That we are forever something which is incomplete
We trade ourselves for nothings and words are our conceits
