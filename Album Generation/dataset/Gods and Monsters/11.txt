Love, may have just come to bury me
But I'm not afraid of what I see
I'm not afraid of the world

Time, has gathered us here by coincidence
Thats why what I say doesn't make any sense

Life, may have just come to bury me
But I'm not afraid of what I see
I'm not afraid of the world

We, we're all gathered us here by coincidence
Thats why what we say doesn't make any sense

You, may have just come to carry me
Beyond the things I've ever seen
Love, may have just come to bury me
