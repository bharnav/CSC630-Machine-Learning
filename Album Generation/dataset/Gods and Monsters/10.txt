Woke up this morning
For someone to set you free
Turned round here today
To find that someone was me

And we smoke, dead men's cigarettes
And we choke, on the bitter black regrets
Of ourselves - we've found no-one else

Woke up this morning
For someone to set me free
Turned round here today
To find that someone was me

And we smoke, dead men's cigarettes
And we choke, on the bitter black regrets
Of ourselves - we've found no-one else

And we smoke, dead men's cigarettes
And we choke, on the bitter black regrets
And we smoke, dead men's cigarettes
And we choke, on the bitter black regrets
