I've dreamed of the stars so much
That they seem familiar
Like once what was your lovers touch
Just reached back to kill you
And if you ever go astray
I'll say that I knew you
Tomorrows same as yesterday
So what good will that do you?
To fall upon ourselves each night
And crawl like vampires from the light
Later on will they all say
They never cared much anyway

I've dreamed of myself so much
I must seem familiar
Like once what was my thrill you
And if we ever go astray
I'll say that I knew ya
Tomorrows the same as yesterday
What good will that do you?
You're on your marks and off your face
Hung out in some exotic place
And in your hand but out of reach
Once more you go into the breach

We fall upon ourselves each night
And crawl like vampires from the light
And later on well they all say
They never made much anyway

And I've dreamed of the stars so much
They seem familiar
Like once what was your lovers touch
Just reached back to kill you
But if you ever went astray
I'd say that I knew you
Tomorrows same as yesterday
So what good will that do you?
You're on your marks and off your face
Hung out in some exotic place
But out of reach within your hand
The same for you don't undesrstand
