Making it stick, drip upon drip, is that what you do, with sand and glue
Dont put out the light, let me see you tonight, cuz thats what I'll do, with you
Making it stick, drip upon drip, is that what you do, with sand and glue
Dont put out the light, let me see you tonight, cuz thats what I do, with you

What good is god or laughter, if you dont know what you're after whoo
Makes up the things that you do
You're gutless and over-reaching, blessed and always preaching whoo
Makes up the things that you do

Making it stick, drip upon drip, is that what you do, with sand and glue
Dont put out the light, let me see you tonight, cuz thats what I'll do, to you

I'll tell you what I thinks funny, you've got the looks and money you
Make up the things that you do
Godless and without meaning, nothing left to believe in whoo
Makes up the things that you do

Making it stick, drip upon drip, is that what you do, with sand and glue
