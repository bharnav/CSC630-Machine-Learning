I'm the first to confess I get used to being unhappy
I get caught in a loop like a scratched CD
I'm the first to confess I do it because it's easy

And you'll know if you're anything like me
But I've looked right into your eyes
And you know exactly what I mean
You know sometimes everything opens out
Into widescreen

So do you ever feel you've been smoked right down to the filter?
And it changes the way that you can see
It's the first day of spring but it might just as well be the winter
And you'll know if you're anything like me
If we could only realize
We're making it all up
You know sometimes everything opens up
Into widescreen

If we could only realize
We're making it all up
You know sometimes everything opens up
Into widescreen
