I'll say what I want
'Cause nobody's listening
I'll say what I want
I'll tell you another thing

You don't understand
I know that I can

(Finally free)
Finally free to say what you see
And get what you mean and know who to be
(Finally free)
I guarantee that you can't deceive the (?)
When we get to be
(Finally free)

(Repeat 1st verse)

You don't understand
I know that I can

(Chorus x4)
