You’ve taken the time to see
The lights in the street come on
You know it occurs to me
That maybe it’s been too long

I thought by now it might have gone away
I think about it every single day

We’ll just have to wait and see
How things are supposed to go
Hut so far it seems to me
We’re taking the long way home

(Chorus x2)

I think about you every single day
