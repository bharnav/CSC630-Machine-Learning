I know, I know I can't complain
And it doesn't help when you've only got yourself to blame
I don't know what got into me
But I don't expect that I'll get any sympathy

I hate it that I got what I wanted 'cause I don't want it anymore
And I hate to say you told me, but you told me once before
(x2)

You know it's never quite enough
And I don't know what it was that I was thinking of
You know, no matter what I try
It just doesn't ever really seem to satisfy

(Chorus x2)

You told me once before
You told me once before
You told me once before
