Is there anyone out there
Must be someone somewhere
Who knows, who knows, who knows
What it feels like

Go in any direction
Try to make a connection
Still you find yourself on the outside

So much lie
I don't know why
I still feel so far away
Away
Away
Away

(?) always around me
I know when someone's around me
I know (?) there in the background

(?)
I know, I know it's supposed to be easy

(Chorus)

Maybe it won't be like this all the time
We may be together in another life

So close by, I don't know why
I still feel so far away
So close by, I don't know why
I still feel so far away
Away
Away
Away
Away
