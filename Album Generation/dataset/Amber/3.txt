Good clean fun, we don't hurt no one
And I like to know where I can get mine
I'd like to know where I can get mine

Good clean fun, never hurt no one
And I'd like to know where I can get mine
Like to know where I can get mine

Good clean fun
Good clean fun

Good clean fun
Good clean fun

So don't say I have a one track mind
It's over that I know what I like
It's over that I know what I like

(Chorus x2)
