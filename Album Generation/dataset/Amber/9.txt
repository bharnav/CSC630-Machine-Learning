If you ever want to feel truly alone
Well I can't think of a better place to go
There's petrol and there's oil
Making rainbows in the rain
A gentle breeze is setting off
A car alarm again

If you ask me, you'll be fine
Underneath a neon sign

I've heard these songs so many times before
But none of them affect me anymore
And Christ knows where we are
'Cause all the high streets look the same
That'll be the cost of living
Kicking in again

But you look so good in this light
Underneath a neon sign

Been disappointed for so long
Things should be different from now on

Tonight for once you could be staying in
But something always drags you out again
It's the overwhelming feeling
That you must be missing out
That somewhere something wonderful
Is happening tonight

So come with me and stand in line
Underneath a neon sign
Underneath a neon sign
Underneath a neon sign

(Bridge)

If you ask me, you'll be fine
Underneath a neon sign
So come with me and stand in line
Underneath a neon sign
Underneath a neon sign
Underneath a neon sign
Underneath a neon sign
