I dreamt that you died
I woke and I cried
It scared me to think you were gone

So vivid, so real
And it made me feel
There wasn't much point to go on

It happened oh so fast
It took me by surprise
Couldn't quite believe
What I'd seen with my own eyes
I didn't get the chance
To even say goodbye
When I dreamt that you died

I dreamt you were dead
And I'd never said
Exactly what you made me

It took you to die
That much so that I
Could wake up and finally see

(Chorus)

When I dreamt that you died
