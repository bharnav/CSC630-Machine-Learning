You can't have me
You can't keep me for yourself
Not you and no one else

You can't have me
So don't get any bright ideas
Let's just get one thing clear

You can't have me
You can't have me

You just don't get me
You just don't seem to understand
It won't work out how you planned

You can't have me
You know full well you'll just get bored
I've seen it all before

(Chorus)

Passions decay I know
You needn't tell me
I'm sorry to say that's so

I'll push you away before you get too decent to me
So you can't have me

(Repeat 1st & 4th verses)

(Chorus x2)
