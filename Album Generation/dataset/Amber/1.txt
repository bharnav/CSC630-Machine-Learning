It good to see you, it's been a while
You had your life, and I've had mine
It's good to notice all the ways we change
But even better how we stay the same

I'd like to know, tell me everything
I want to know exactly how you've been
Before you know we'll forget the time
And turn around and find we've talked all night

It's getting light outside

Even though I could talk all day
I've still run out of things to say
I feel fine in your company
Even when we sit silently

Suddenly we'll turn around and find we've talked all night

It's getting light outside

Conversation flows so easily
An' that's exactly how it needs to be
I know when I speak I'm listened to
And in return I do the same for you

I don't feel the need to reminisce
Don't want to think about the things I miss
Before you know we'll forget the time
And turn around and find we've talked all night

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

Suddenly we'll turn around and find we've talked all night

(Chorus x4)
