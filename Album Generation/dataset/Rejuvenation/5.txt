Ain't no use, to cut you loose
I wouldn't last a day
It ain't no use, to turn you loose
Guess I'm here to stay
I could think of a thousand reasons
Why I should walk right out that door
But if I do I know that I'll turn around again
And come right back for more
It ain't no use

You've got me where you want me
Shackled to your love
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
You've got me where you want me
Shackled to your love

Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free...

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't know what I wanna do now

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't know what I wanna do now

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't know what I wanna do now

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I don't know what I wanna do now
