Hand out of the window
Floatin’ on air
Just a flip of the wrist
And I'm wavin’ you goodbye

Drive past the lifeguard stand
Where I'd sit around
Waiting for you to remember

As I drive

How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying

And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps
And pace with you a while
For so long, so long, so long, so long

The speaker in this door is blown
So nothing sounds quite right
Taking my time, taking this drive
Waving this town, goodbye

And I drive this ocean road and remember
The small of your back, nape of your neck
I remember everything as I drive
Waving this town, goodbye

How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying

And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps
And pace with you a while

So long, so long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, so long

Taking my time, taking this drive
(So long, so long)
Waving this town, goodbye
(So long, so long)
So long, so long, so long, so long

And I will leave under the cover
Of summer’s kiss upon the sky
Like the stone face of your lover
Just before she says goodbye

And I was certain that the season
Could be held between my arms
But just as summer’s hold is fleeting

I was here but now I’m gone
(So long, so long)
And I’m gone
(So long, so long)

I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)

I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)

I'm gone, I'm gone
( So long, so long)
