Stand down, son
And start resting easy
You’ve done your service
I am proud to have you home and see you safe

It’s so good
You looked so strong
In that picture on the mantle
You sent your mom when you were gone

But you looked scared now
Hollow eyed, when are you coming?
When are you coming?

Back where you belong
I swear that it’s safe here
There’s nothing to fear at all

Come on back
Where you belong
The pressure releases
If you just let down your guard

Everything rests on you
You know that feelin' well
The ball is fallin', fallin', fallin'
So far from a close call

Your injuries aren’t mortal wounds
The only thing that’s killin' you
Is what you saw
And what you couldn’t stop

Well, you’re not the one I blame
It wasn’t your mistake
But you're safe now so come home

Back where you belong
I swear that it’s safe here
There’s nothing to fear at all

Come on back
Where you belong
The pressure releases
If you just let down your guard

It’s simple things, dad
I’m not hurt, I’m not dead
I just should be
Where my friends are lying

And I didn’t hate
Those that I killed
But they’re all dead now

And I’m here alive with satellites
And Friday nights and no one to judge me
Or the things that I’ve done at all
So how can I live with that?

Back where I belong
Back where I belong
Back where I belong
Back where I belong

Take me back where I belong
You swear that it’s safe here
There is nothing to fear at all

Take me back where I belong
The pressure releases
If I just let down my guard
