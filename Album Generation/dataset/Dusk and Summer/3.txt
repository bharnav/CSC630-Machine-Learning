[Verse 1]
We watch the season pull up its own stage
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 2]
Invitation only grant farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
Too early to say goodnight

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 3]
And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we all, we sleep well
Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep well

[Chorus 2]
You have stolen, you have stolen
You have stolen my heart

[Bridge]
I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
And we all look like we feel

[Chorus 2]
You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart
