We are the only ones who feel it
Tonight we drink, tonight we dance
We are the last ones who can hear it

We’re calling in whispers, we’re tired of waiting
We’ll take what we want
And we’ll leave what we know behind

We are still dreamers in our dead sleep
Naked and tangled, twisted in love
And tonight we are the only ones who feel it

So let it last all night
So let it last all night

Let the fire surround us, let it all cave in
Let it all burn wild, we are leaving it all behind
We are leaving it all behind

Heaven is here, heaven is here
Heaven is here

We're tangled and brave
We're naked and saved

Well, Heaven’s not waitin'
It’s spillin' its secrets, it's right here between us
And we’ve no other choice but belief
We’ve no other choice but belief
We’ve no other choice but belief

So let it last all night
So let it last all night
So let it last all night

So let it last all night
Naked and tangled, and twisted in love
And tonight we are the only ones who feel it

Heaven is here, Heaven is here
And tonight we are the only ones who feel it
