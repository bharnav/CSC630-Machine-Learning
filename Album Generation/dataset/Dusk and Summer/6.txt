The air is visible around you, rising up
And off your lips in slow currents, and I watch
As your face is framed in its slow currents, drifting curls
A trailin' path, a long draft becomes a tress of blue ash

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it’s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down

The air is visceral around us
Turning in its simple steps on slow currents
And I watch as it pirouettes and spins in slow motion
A long drag becomes a slow dance in a halo of ember

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it’s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down

All the way down

And if this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, we burned our hands

If this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it's got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn
(Let it burn)

If it’s got to end
(Let it burn)
If it’s got to end
(Let it burn)

It ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands
