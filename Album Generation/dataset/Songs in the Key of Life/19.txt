[Intro]
Come on up you say
Because you can feel your love coming down
I find myself rushing over to
Do something for your love

[Verse 1]
I knock on the door
You answer asking what am I there for
I say I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

[Chorus]
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love

[Verse 2]
You call me up to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And could I come over today
Do something for your love
One knuck gets me in
But then you say how very nice it's been
That lets me know that I will once again
Get nothing from your love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

[Chorus] [x2]
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love

[Verse 3]
You drop by to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And if I had some time later in the day to
Do something for your love
Anyone else would say
"No, that's okay"
But maybe by now she'll see things my way
And ask me to say to
Do something for her love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

[Chorus]
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
To get none of your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
Being stingy with your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
I'm an all day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
Givin' none of your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
I'm an all day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
To get none of your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker cup for your love
