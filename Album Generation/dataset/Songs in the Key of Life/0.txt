[Verse 1]
Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter
To tears and pain
It's that

[Chorus]
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay
Send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round
Breaking many hearts
Stop it please
Before it's gone too far

[Verse 2]
The force of evil plans
To make you its possession
And it will if we let it
Destroy everybody
We all must take
Precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say oh that

[Chorus]
Love's in need of love today (Love's in need of love today)
Don't delay (Don't delay)
Send yours in right away (Right away)
Hate's goin' round (Hate's goin' round)
Breaking many hearts (Breaking hearts)
Stop it please (Stop it please)
Before it's gone too far (Gone too far)

People you know that
Love's in need of love today (Love's in need of love today)
Don't delay (Don't delay)
Send yours in right away (Right away)
You know that hate's goin' round (Hate's goin' round)
