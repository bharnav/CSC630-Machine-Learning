[Verse 1]
I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know

[Chorus]
And baby that's you - you - you
Made life's his*to*ry
Because you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

[Verse 2]
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start livin' for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

[Chorus]
Baby, baby it's you - you - you
Made life's his*to*ry
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears[x3]

[Chorus]
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be
He - y, you brought some joy inside my tears

[Chorus]
Got to tell you
You - you - you made life's his*to*ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
- you brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears

[Bridge]
You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his*to*ry
- you you you made life's his*to*ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
- No-body ever thought it would be
You have done what no one thought could be
You you you made life's his*to*ry
- Got to shout about it baby
You brought some joy inside my tears

[Outro]
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You you you made life's his*to*ry
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my
Tears
