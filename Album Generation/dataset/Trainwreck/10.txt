Baby, maybe you've got something
I think that maybe we're on to something big
Bigger than i could have ever imagined

Tonight, it's worse
Tonight the screaming hurts
Tonight, it's worse
Tonight the screaming hurts

Baby, let me collect some things
I think that maybe we're coming to the end
I'll call the doctor
This song finishes with him

Tonight, it's worse
Tonight the screaming hurts
Tonight, it's worse
Tonight the screaming hurts

Music this magnificent
And medicine are one and the same
They make life worth living;
Hearts worth healing

Come and get it
Now I've got it
Come and get it
The ending to my song
Oh doctor, thanks for everything, i'm healing

But i feel like i forgot something
I'm thinking maybe i'm missing something big
Bigger than i could have ever imagined

Forget it, let me collect my things
I think that finally we're coming to the end
The doctor's here, now it's over
I hear the door knob turn...

Music this magnificent
And medicine are one and the same
They make life worth living
Hearts worth healing
(tonight it's worse)
