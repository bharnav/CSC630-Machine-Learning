[Doctor:]
Test, check. Well, he's been released again today, and I'm back where I started
Looking over old notes, listening to tapes, wondering how bad I potentially messed up this time
The wounds seem to be healing, and he seems to be getting along
Without his appendages
And I know he seems fine, but 'seems' can be a very dangerous word, especially in this business... it can be fatal

Initial Diagnosis: Catatonic. And I know he's back there somewhere
But there's just no response whatsoever, to any kind of stimulus
We'll start him with medication tomorrow, for sure

This man's tragedy has made him a prisoner in his own body
And it's not just tragedy, it's dementia, despair;
It's this hole I can see in each of his eyes
Where all the events that happen in this real world kind of just fall through
It's loneliness in it's most crippling form, the kind that no amount of love
Or human contact, could ever mend

The patient was plagued by violent nightmares, terrible, deeply troubling dreams
Which one night overflowed in to reality, and he murdered his wife, in his sleep
These people were in love, deeply in love
And it was that love filling those holes that I can now see behind his eyes
And it's my job to try and fill those holes with something else
But with what? Hope? I can try to fill those holes with drugs, soothing words, but that's all
I hope his wounds will heal with time, but right now, things aren't looking good

[Boys Night Out:]
The lines I wear around my wrist are there to prove that I exist
The lines I wear around my wrist are there to prove that I exist
The lines I wear around my wrist are there to prove that I exist
The lines I wear around my wrist are there to prove that I exist
The lines I wear around my wrist are there to prove that I exist

[Patient:]
The lines around my wrists, the infection seems to be getting better
It's in the center of my torso, behind my eyes and in the back of my head
Something is eating me alive from the inside out

[Doctor:]
Well that's grief of your loss

[Patient:]
Don't tell me what it is
