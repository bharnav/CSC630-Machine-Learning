I dialed 911 a long time ago
Now I see how late they're reacting
Here shakes a former lover/husband And there lies the wife
Of a train wreck just waiting to happen

Chorus
My God, make this a dream because i really can't believe that she's gone
I'm not here and this isn't happening
Make this a dream because I really can't believe that she's gone
We'll wake up and she'll be next to me
I can't believe that she's gone

Marvel at this madman as this make-shift monster rips through the room
Watch in in fear as he comes completely unglued
Gaze in horror and amazement for a frightening instant
As he christens the walls with broken bottles of perfume
Her few, final moments must have been a nightmare in waking
Victim lies, violently shaking

Chorus

I can't breathe...
I dont deserve to take these breaths
All I need is to sit and rest my head on my knees
The ambulance and police will be here soon

I can't see. I can't feel
I'm numb to everything
Except my body shutting down as they enter my home
