[Instrumental Intro]

The kids have gone wild in the streets
I'm backing the havoc they wreak
Time for the fall, so say we all
Starter of it, the ender of everything
Coming to kick you to sleep
The damage inflicted is gonna be deep
Cheering for your own demise
Starting tonight, people will die
People will die!

Time bomb, ticking away, ticking away
Scare the Hell out of you
Earth is on Hell
Earth is on Hell...

Welcome to your Earth on Hell
The worse that it gets, the better it sells
Time for the fall, so say we all
Starter of it, the ender of everything
You made this sick Hell on Earth
Spitting your poison, infected at birth
Taking the streets, occupied
Starting tonight, people will die
People will die!

Time bomb, ticking away, ticking away
Scare the Hell out of you
Earth is on Hell
Earth is on Hell...

[Short Instrumental Break]

I'm getting outta line
It's like I lost my mind
Earth is now on Hell
I'm getting outta line
I fuckin' lost my mind
Earth is now on Hell

[Instrumental Break]

The kids have gone wild in the streets
No longer the stepchild you beat
They're taking it hard, kill the old guard
Starter of it, the ender of everything
Coming to kick you to sleep
It's reap what you sow
Not sow what you reap
Cheering for your own demise
Starting tonight, people will die
People will die!

Time bomb, ticking away, ticking away
Scare the Hell out of you
Earth is on Hell
Earth is on Hell...
