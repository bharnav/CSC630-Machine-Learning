[Instrumental Intro]

In a time or place and do you know my face
And how it is I know you?
Something so familiar, can't recognise
And I slip and I slip
As I slip unstuck in time
Gotta find my constant or my mind is lost

Stronger than any stretch of imagination
Spanning my world, my all
Am I here now in between undivided?
I'm whole now, so hear me

Scream as my heart pounds, moving so fast now
I am here, I am here
Lost in the moment, caught in the current
I am here, I am here
Scream as my heart pounds, burn the past down
I am here, I am here

Now close my eyes
Take the past and
Burn it, burn it, burn it
Burn it down

I'm here, I'm there - slipstream, I scream
Tell me you hear me
My time is here, my place is now
And I slip and I slip
As I slip through space, I'm tethered
A lifeline to cross time back at you

Stronger than any stretch of imagination
Spanning my world, my all
Am I here now in between undivided?
I'm whole now, so hear me

Scream as my heart pounds, moving so fast now
I am here, I am here
Lost in the moment, caught in the current
I am here, I am here
Scream as my heart pounds, burn the past down
I am here, I am here

Now close my eyes
Take the past and
Burn it, burn it, burn it
Burn it down

[Short Instrumental Break]

Yeah, if I could change one thing I'd
Take back all of the lost time
I spent away from your side
Go back and make it right

[Instrumental Break]

Am I here now in between undivided?
Am I here now in between undivided?
Am I here now in between undivided?
I'm whole now, so hear me

Scream as my heart pounds, moving so fast now
I am here, I am here
Lost in the moment, caught in the current
I am here, I am here
Scream as my heart pounds, burn the past down
I am here, I am here

Now close my eyes
Take the past and
Burn it, burn it, burn it
Burn it down
