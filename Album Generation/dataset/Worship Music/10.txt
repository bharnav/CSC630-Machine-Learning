[Instrumental Intro]

Sometimes I forget to see
And now that I've found you
What is and what will never be
Now that I've found you
When my time has gone away, the words I say
Their lies will help you through
And I feel like it's gonna rain, a real rain
To wash this from you too

So addicted to the pain
It's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in on a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane

If you crawl - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

[Short Instrumental Break]

I think of things that just got lost
Now that you found me
As if I just had shuffled off
Now that you found me
When my time had gone away, the actions played
They broke your world in two
And I feel like it's gonna rain, a real rain
To wash this from me too

So addicted to the pain
It's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in on a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane

If you crawl - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
What is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy

[Instrumental Break]

If you crawl - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

If you crawl - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall - I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away

Crawling...
What is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy

[Instrumental Outro]
