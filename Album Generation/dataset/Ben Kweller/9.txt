[Verse 1]
I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid
It's something in my head that I can't avoid
And I want to be with you
And always will until I die

[Chorus]
Until I die
Whoa oh, until I die

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that I've been like this
You're the one thing in this world I don't want to miss
And I want to be with you
And always will until I die

[Chorus]
Until I die
Whoa oh, until I die

[Bridge]
Frost on the window
I'm in for the night
You've got a phone
Keep me in mind
Just give me a try

[Verse 3]
I'm so sorry that I've been so sad
But you are the best friend that I've ever had
And I love you
And always will until I die

[Bridge 2]
Frost on the window
I'm in for the night
You've got a phone
Give me a try
It's still on my mind, oh

[Ending]
I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid
(I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid)
I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid
(I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid)
And I want to be with you
And always will until I die
Whoa oh, until I die
