Check me out
I'm losing control
I wanna rock and roll
But everything i planned just slipped right through my hand
I don't know why

I'm a nice guy
I wanna take it easy baby
But every time i start, my world falls apart
I don't know why

The world is feelin' like it's passin' me by
I'm fixin' to lose it
But i don't know why

Check me in
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your lover, baby
But everything i say comes out the wrong way
I don't know why

So i guess i'll let it slide by
I wanna take it slowly, honey
I'm feelin' like a fake, every move i make
I don't know why

The world is feelin' like it's passin' me by
I'm fixin' to lose it
But i don't know why

Again and again and again and again i try
I'm fixin' to lose it
But i don't know why

The world is feelin' like it's passin' me by
I'm fixin' to lose it
But i don't know why
