Over hill
Over dales
I run with you
If it works
If it fails
I run with you

Since fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere
You can run
But together is much better
So let's run let's run let's run

Empty hands
Tired feet
I run with you
On the sand
Over concrete
I run with you

Since fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere you can run
But with you
It's much more fun
So let's run let's run let's run

It doesn't matter that they say we'll never make it
It's so strong that nothing can ever break it
You and I can tackle anything of any size
All anyone can ever want is a co-pilot
Someone to leave this town and
Up and start a secret
And when you sneak out at night
I'll kiss you right between your eyes

Over hills, over dams
I run with you
Down the mountain
Through the trails
I run with you

Since I was fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere you can run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run
