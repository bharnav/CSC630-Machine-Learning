Lights on through the night
Just to get it right
A battleground at my feet
An unwinnable fight
The words we say won't matter anyhow
Let's focus on tomorrow
Instead of right now

Nothing happening
It's all illusion
It's all illusion
Nothing happening
It's all confusion
It's all confusion

Flames are flyin' all around this room tonight
Now there's nothing we can do
To make each other feel alright
Instead of trying to tell me how to be
Just focus on tomorrow instead of on me

Nothing happening
It's all illusion
It's all confusion

If we want to keep this love we found
We've got to focus on tomorrow
Instead of right now

Nothing happening
It's all illusion
It's all illusion
Nothing happening
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
Nothing is happening
It's all illusion
It's all illusion
Nothing is happening
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
It's all confusion
