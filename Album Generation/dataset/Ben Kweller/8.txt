I'm losing speed
Trying to keep up with you
I'm losing speed
Worrying about you

How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break?
Red eye
I'm asking you

Your beautiful fear
Is the Holy Ghost town
Let's close in the road
We used to drive down

How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break?
Red eye
I'm asking you

You know I hate the way
Your love don't stay
Red eye
I'm asking you

Your eyelids don't shut
But you don't see me here
When I need to be saved
The queen disappears

How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break?
Red eye
I'm asking you

You know I hate the way
Your love don't stay
Red eye
Do you have to have to fly all night
Just to feel all right?
Red eye
I'm asking you
I'm asking you
