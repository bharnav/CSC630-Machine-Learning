I'm a soldier on a battlefield
Got an army on the battlefield
Outnumbered like the Alamo
I don't even want to go

This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war

Always stuck in a daydream
Can't focus on the other team
Hunted you all day and night
Now I'm ready for a fight

This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war
I can't be your friend
'cause I got to knock you out

Are you ready for a surprise?
I don't even think you even realize
They say that you're the best
You gotta follow all the rest

This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war

I can't be your friend
'cause I gotta knock you out
So I can win
