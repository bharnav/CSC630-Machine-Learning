Half moon
Crossed eyes
Fear is disguised
She carries sadness in her lungs
I can hear her
I can run

She'll never be in second place
She'll never be in second place

I see it in her
I hear it in
I feel it in her
I know it's in her
She's magic

Always
Trusting
Everyone
In what they say
Walk down
Every road
I'm never sick
Of growing old

She'll never be in second place
She'll never be in second place

I see it in her
I hear it in her
I feel it in her
I know it's in her
She's magic
Magic

Always alright

She'll never be in second place
She'll never be in second place

I see it in her
I hear it in her
I feel it in her
I know it's in her
I see it in her
I hear it in her
I feel it in her
I know it's in her
I know it's in her
I know it's in her
I know it's in her
I know it's in her
She's magic
She's magic
