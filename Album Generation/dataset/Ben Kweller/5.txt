I'm just a penny on the train track
Waiting for my judgment day
Come on baby girl, let see me those legs
Before I get flattened away
I wait, yeah I wait
For something good, for something great

Stopping in somebody's old hometown
Gotta get that midnight meal
If you can't get behind your own life
Get behind the driving wheel
And go, just go
Find a place that you don't know

Ran into a friend just the other night
Got a badge, he's a local cop
Haven't seen that boy in over seven years
Since outta high school I dropped
I see, I see
All the things that I should be

Even lucky man has a bad day
And pretty girl has a scar
After that train comes and takes me away
Pick up that guitar
And play, just play
Play that rock and roll for me

He's in the yard just washin' his car
Thinking about his pretty wife
Makin' lemonade with the kitchen aid
Makin' him a perfect life
And it's grim, so dim
When you wish that you were just like him

I'm just a penny on the train track
Waiting for my judgment day
Come on baby girl, let me see those legs
Before I get flattened away

I wait, yeah I wait
For something good, for something great

And I try, oh I try
I can't stop, I don't know why
