I gotta move
While the streets ahead are sunny
Fall in love with some honey
Oohh mama, I gotta move

I just can't sit still
In this small town
There's nothin more here I hit the ceiling
So in the morning I'll hit the highway
Ooohh, I just can't stay

I gotta move
While the streets ahead are sunny
Fall in love with some honey
Oohh mama, I gotta move

It's time I broke out into the open
You know I'll settle down again some day
I need some new land, and form a rock band
Oohh, I just can't stay

I gotta move
While the streets ahead are sunny
Fall in love with some honey
Oohh mama, I gotta move

And when you wake up and I'm not around you
My eyes will be racing into the sun, I run, yeah I run
And all the people start to bring me down yeah
I need new atmosphere to pick me up
Roxxane, understand?, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oohh, I'm on my way

I gotta move
While the streets ahead are sunny
Fall in love with some honey
Oohh mama, I gotta move

Whoa, I gotta move
While my future's bright and sunny
Make some noise and make some money
Oohh mama, I gotta move

Whoa, I gotta move
Whoa, I gotta move
Whoa, I gotta move
Oohh mama
I gotta move
