[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, more beautiful than me
You're honorable, more honorable than me
Loyal to the Bank of America

[Hook]
It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times

[Chorus]
You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

[Verse 2]
Vested interest, united ties
Landed gentry, rationalize
Look who bought the myth
By Jingo, buy America

[Hook]
It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times

[Chorus]
You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

[Verse 3]
Enemy sighted, enemy met
I'm addressing the realpolitik
Look who bought the myth
By Jingo, buy America

[Bridge]
"Let us not assassinate this man further
Senator, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

[Hook]
(It's a sign of the times)
(It's a sign of the times)

[Chorus]
You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

[Verse 4]
Enemy sighted, enemy met
I'm addressing the realpolitik
You've seen start and you've seen quit (I'm addressing the table of content)
I always thought of you as quick

[Outro]
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
(Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
(Meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy (Meet me at the book burning)
