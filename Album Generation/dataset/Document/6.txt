[Verse 1]
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times

[Chorus 1]
Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Shake the rug into the fireplace

[Verse 1]
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times

[Chorus 2]
Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Sweep the floor into the fireplace

[Chorus 3]
Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Throw the chairs into the fireplace

[Chorus 3]
Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Throw the walls into the fireplace
