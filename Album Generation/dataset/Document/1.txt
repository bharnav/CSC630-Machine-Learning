[Verse 1]
Hang your collar up inside
Hang your dollar on me
Listen to the water still
Listen to the cause where you are

[Chorus 1]
Fed and educated
Primitive and wild
Welcome to the occupation

[Verse 2]
Here we stand and here we fight
All your fallen heroes
Held and dyed and skinned alive
Listen to the Congress fire

[Chorus 2]
Offering the educated
Primitive and loyal
Welcome to the occupation

[Verse 3]
Hang your collar up inside
Hang your freedom higher
Listen to the buyer still
Listen to the Congress

[Chorus 3]
Where we propagate confusion
Primitive and wild
Fire on the hemisphere below

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 4]
Sugar cane and coffee cup
Copper, steel and cattle
An annotated history
The forest for the fire

[Chorus 4]
Where we open up the floodgates
Freedom reigns supreme
Fire on the hemisphere below

[Outro]
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
