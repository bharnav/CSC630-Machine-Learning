[Hook]
Ohhh, oh ooh oh

[Verse 1]
When I lay myself to sleep
Pray that I don't go too deep
Lightning won, lightning won
Because it's cold down, gold down there, crow

[Verse 2]
Flat lands low lands on the track
Shows the water, pan the track
Lightning won, lightning won
Close up hands to silhouette, crow

[Hook]
Ohhh, oh ooh oh
Ohhh, oh ooh oh

[Bridge]
Lightning won, lightning won

[Hook]
Ohhh, oh ooh oh
Ohhh, oh ooh oh

[Verse 3]
Hound bark on the track
Hound crow hold onto your hat
Lightning won, lightning won
The lowlands, timberlands, badlands, birdlands

[Hook]
Ohhh, oh ooh oh
Ohhh, oh ooh oh

[Outro]
Ohhh, oh ooh oh
Ohhh, oh ooh oh
