[Verse 1]
A thumbnail sketch, a jeweler's stone
A mean idea to call my own
Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations

[Chorus]
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

[Verse 2]
Singer sing me a given
Singer sing me a song
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Everybody's looking on

[Chorus]
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

[Bridge]
Away
Away

[Verse 3]
I am king of all I see
My kingdom for a voice
Old man don't lay so still, you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations

[Chorus]
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

[Bridge]
Away
Away

[Outro]
Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground
