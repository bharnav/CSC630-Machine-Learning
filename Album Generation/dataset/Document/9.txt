[Verse 1]
Oddfellows Local 151 behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits to prove a sage, to teach
Peewee gathered up his proof, reached up to scratch his head
Fell down and hit the ground again

[Chorus]
Firehouse
Firehouse

[Verse 2]
Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach?
This boy and girl that gather pearls of wisdom
Falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the rum

[Chorus]
Firehouse
Firehouse

[Verse 3]
Oddfellows Local 151 behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach
This boy and girl that gather pearls of wisdom
Falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the 151

[Chorus]
Firehouse
Firehouse
Firehouse
Firehouse

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Firehouse
