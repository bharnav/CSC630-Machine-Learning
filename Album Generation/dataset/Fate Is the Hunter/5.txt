What is meant to be will be
You can't escape your destiny
So kiss the girl and let her see
That you would do anything
You would do
Anything
Anything

What is meant to be will be
It happens over time, you'll see
So kiss the boy and set him free
Cause he would do anything
He would do
Anything
Anything

When you never take that chance
Then there's nothing worth dying
Or even living for
But everybody knows
The saying that goes
"All you need is love
All you need is love"
But you've got to be willing
To give anything
Anything

All of this suddenly happened
It was nothing before you go
From being alone and empty
To belonging and being with you
I possess the honest pleasure
Knowing what it means to be loved

I would do anything
I would do anything
Anything
Anything
