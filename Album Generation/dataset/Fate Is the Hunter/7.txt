This pale mucha postcard brings back orange carpet
We called roaches butterflies and ate our pies at Birchwood Saloon
Off the only road that leaves the state, I would sing and pass the plate
They all knew me by my face and my father's name

Heavy letter underneath my door, stark reminder when I had before
It's hard to believe I've come this far
Heavy letter in the dresser drawer tore it open like a candy bar
It's hard to believe I've come this far

Bright red hot rod hardtop off to town for Moose's Tooth
You comin' with? To the parkin' lot?
If not, you know my window's never locked
Drew leaned in and said it but his heart wouldn't let it
That's all right, I'll be my husband's wife

Heavy letter makes a perfect mark on the page and in the heart
It's hard to believe I've come this far
Heavy letter in the dresser drawer tore it open like a candy bar
It's hard to believe I've come this far

Nervous tearing through the sky, grieving every inch I gain
Counting pools and freeways, I will sing and pass the plate
They will know me by my face and my father's name

Heavy letter in the dresser drawer tore it open like a candy bar
It's hard to believe I've come this far
Heavy letter headed for your shore, a premonition of what's in store
It's hard to believe we've come this far
