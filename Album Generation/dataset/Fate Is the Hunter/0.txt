You're a porcelain doll that sits in a window
You hold your breath when people walk by
Safely kept behind rose-colored glass
Neatly tucked beneath the spotlight

Waiting for someone to love...

You're a Cheshire cat
You think a smile hides the rest
Ambiguity will always cover the facts
Where do you come from, where do you go
Must be lonely to be all alone

Waiting for someone to love...

And when they come, they'll accept you just the way you are
You'll swear under a moonlit sky about rocks in the sky
Trees backed up by the sea
Thin wild mercury

Until then, you're waiting for someone to love...
