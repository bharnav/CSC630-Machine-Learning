Alicia stands behind me
Ties black ribbon in my hair
The sound of heavy boots
Slowly pounding up the stairs
The organ pours out slow and soothing
Old and rugged hymns
I long to find some comfort
But my sorrow won't give in
This is the coldest winter
In a thousand freezing years
And if I started crying
I could never stop the tears

You don't know what you've done
Not here to see the repercussions of your love
You don't know what you've done
You're not my hero anymore

Time is slowing down
Like a river clogged with mud
People gather round me
Some friends and others blood
The trumpeter starts playing taps
The soldiers fire their guns
The folding of the flag
Makes the tears come in a flood

You don't know what you've done
Not here to see the repercussions of your love
You don't know what you've done
You're not my hero anymore

No one would say you were an easy man
No, you are hard and stubborn and vain
And I'm tired of being held back at arms length
Tired, tired
And something's gotta change

You don't know what you've done
I didn't break, no, I've grown strong
You don't know what you've done
You're not my hero
You're not my hero anymore
Anymore
Anymore

You're not my hero anymore
Not here to face the consequences of your love
You're not my hero anymore
Anymore
Anymore
