Your hands, they remind me of the days that can't be taken back

Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen

Cool river waters dancing beneath our feet off to sea
Meet me at midnight down by the tree

Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen

Love me forever, but if you have to go say you'll write
Don't send me pictures, I've got you memorized

Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen...
Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen
