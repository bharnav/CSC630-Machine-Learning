Fall back into the snow
Sink deep
Bury all the troubles that you keep
Follow close to the places your heart needs
Just for a little while, just for a little while
You'll be free
You'll be free

Child i can tell by the look on your face
You dont think you belong
You dont think you belong in this place
Promise to come back
Promise to come back...where it's safe
Just for a little while, just for a little while
You'll be free
You'll be free

Just for a little while
Just for a little while
Just for a little while
You'll be free

You'll be free
You'll be free
Oh ohhoohh
You'll be free yeaheaheaheah
