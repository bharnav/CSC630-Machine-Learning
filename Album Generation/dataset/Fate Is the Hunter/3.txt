I know it's there
-- burnin' to shine out
I know it's there
Itchin', scratchin'
Just a shout
Buried treasure safe
Waiting for perfect reason
Perfect ways
When were you there to wipe that furrow from your brow
Can't get no where half way
So I'll be here till you break
Till you say that you love me
That you love me
Cause' I left -- before everything i gained
You've shown too many other ways for me to call in vain
This is just a stupid secret shared too many times
It's kinda like this thing that I would let go if I'm wise
Sorda like a warfield that sometimes makes me cry
You look just like someone i know but can not tell a lie
Can not say
Can not say
That you love me
That you love
...
I'm better off --
Silence
Silence
