Red-eyes fly away from here every night
My intentions aren't unfair or unkind
How else could I purge my heart of this pillowed dream?

Arctic wind will be washed from my hair
Trading the forest for the city
Things will be different for you
Things will be different for you

When you're older, you'll look back
As you grow you'll understand
Why I left

All I talk about is you since that day
Remember when I cry into my soup
And you would say that it's okay

So many things used to break my heart
I'd fall so easily
But you're younger and smarter and harder than me

Things will be different for you
Things will be different for you

When you're older, you'll look back
As you grow you'll understand
Why I left

I'm not comfortable in my own skin
Haven't found my finest hour
I can't dance, let alone sing
Before a crowd
Or write effortlessly what I can't come out and say
When I do, I'll be just like you

Trading the forest for the city
Finding my way down the mountain
Finding my way to the sea

When you're older, you'll look back
As you grow you'll understand
You'll understand
