My baby, he says he loves me
My baby, he says he needs me so
Covers me with sunshine, tucks me in with songs
Every now and then, troubles come my way
Asks me what to do and to him, I simply say

I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right
I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right
I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right

My baby brings me flowers
Takes me out to see the shows
He don't need complainin', I couldn't ask for more
Every now and then, troubles come my way
Asks me what to do and to him, I simply say

I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right
I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right
I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right

Now I'd like to thank you for everything you do
Whenever I'm around you, you turn my gray skies blue
And if the world should crumble, it's all right

I gotta cry sometimes but it's all right
I gotta cry sometimes, it's all right
