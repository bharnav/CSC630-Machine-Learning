I just wanted to be
So much better than me
But I lost the talisman
So I could not be free

And the ladies, they watch
As I slip from my scarves
And I smirk mischievously
And imagine they had the hearts

Then I got up and left
And I turned the corner right
But I could not keep my breath
There were shadows in my sights

As I shuffle through the dark
I was a heading to the park
But I did not become afraid
When I heard the dogs start to bark

It might have been cold or warm
But I did not seem to care
I was just waving my arms
In the aromatic air

And I fell to the ground
But I heard a million sounds
There were whistles, there were bells
There were screams and exploding shells

I found teeth marks in my thigh
And I started to cry
No longer wanted to try
But I did not ask why

Then your hollow, hollow face
Was emerging from the willow trees
Though I could not see your eyes
I continued to gaze with ease

Then away my silent lover
You're just changing with the grass
Oh, so slowly you float
Oh, so so gracefully you pass

And I do not see you smile
You don't talk and you don't laugh
You're the shepherd of my sheep
The keeper of my golden calf

And your love is truly true
Mysterious, handsome too
In the wind and in the rain
Never has to be pursued

When I'm cold and in the gutter
I simply close my eyes so tight
Sitting warm it makes me shudder
And I soon feel alright

And away my silent lover
One day we shall be together
There will remain no contemplation
No more schemes or endeavors

When my heart disintegrates
And my voice is no more
We'll eternally be mates
From the horizon to the shore

But for now it's all nostalgia
You're a cinematic spector
Cast your image from the blind
By the glow from the old projector

And away my silent lover
And away my silent lover
