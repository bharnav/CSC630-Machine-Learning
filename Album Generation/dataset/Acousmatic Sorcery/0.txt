In remission of a mind, watch and listen to find
The position behind this illusion of time
Got me counting my dimes so on the bus I can ride
I'm even doubting the rhyme
I'm in no rush I can hide
Because I know that I tried, no longer taking a side
Tears don't flow from my eyes
No longer go for the lies
I don't protest or resist
I'm not invested in this
I'm backing out of the fight to give my spirit tonight

Gazing at the phase of an overcast day
Watching rain fall from a dim cafe
Can't see the wind but I see the trees sway
Now the evening's kiss got me fading away
Just fading away, Just fading away, Fading away

Drip-drop, window pane hypnotic
Clip-clop, concrete heels on it
I'm still disillusioned and cool catatonic
Always in a daze without smoking that chronic
And the door's still open at the end of the day
And I'm still hoping without much to say
Ask me how I'm feeling; well I'm full of shit 'n doubt
Ask me who I'm with and I'll tell you I'm without

These phantasm women got me swimming through the sea
Apprehension steady creeping, whirlpool is pulling me
So I might as well relax
Go down with the flood
'Cause my hearts been attacked and the sharks smell my blood
If I lose consciousness and I wake in the shore
I will never complain
I will never get old

Gazing at the phase of an overcast day
Watching rain fall from a dim cafe
Can't see the wind but I see the trees sway
Now the evening's kiss got me fading away
