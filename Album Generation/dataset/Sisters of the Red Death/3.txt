Fear in a frame? or the picture of a girl?
With a gorgonesque stare her scale covered hair
Has got a snake in every curl
With her forked tongue and those ash colored eyes get you down on the floor naked and sore
First you shiver then you die
Cut your fingers on the page where those old wounds run deep
But the taste of the sand, rosary in her hand still haunt you in your sleep
Shiver, yeah you'll shiver through the night
I'm delivered, vapid vulture to the light
Gonna shiver and shiver and shiver and shiver
You'll shiver through the night
Deceived by the sound the pitter patter of little feet
Was the rhythmless rave of your cloven hooved babe calling to you from the street
She taunts you as she dances your genitals in the dirt
Your eternal heart aches, your bones bend and break but the beating barely hurts
So desperate to love but you just can't pretend that her hands weren't claws
Your madonna was medusa in the end
It's too late to keep your tongue from sliding round the scales of the snake
Ride the snake
