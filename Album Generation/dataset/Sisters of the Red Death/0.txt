When you're broken from the breakup and those cold tears smear your makeup
And you made sure you were dead when you left
See those swishes on your throat dear
From your left ear to your right ear
Goes to show you, you're not good at breaking it off

Oh holy grace, they make love to your face
With a boxcutter now you'll crew through the cavities
Ropes burn your wrist, taste staining your lips 'til your crying out
Those phantoms they claw at your door

Tied with bared wired and guitar string to a junkie sort of boxspring
You were thankful from those gym socks stuffed in your mouth
'Cause the blood soaked through the tissue
When your teeth broke, when he hit you
You denied him the pleasure he gets when you scream

Oh holy grace, they make love to your face
With a boxcutter now you'll crew through the cavities
Ropes burn your wrist, taste staining your lips 'til your crying out
Those phantoms they claw at your door

Oh holy grace, they make love to your face
With a boxcutter you'll crew through the cavities
Ropes burn your wrist, taste staining your lips 'til your crying out
Those phantoms they claw at your door

Say the words to the Gods
These bastards pay with their lives
