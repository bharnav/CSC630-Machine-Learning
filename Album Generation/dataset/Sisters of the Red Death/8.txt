Shoot to kill, she wrapped her legs around my face
Stripped down when she went down and that's all
And where is art?
It's in the tears of the retarded children
When you tell them there's no God

You'll fall asleep forever
But never close your eyes
'Cause every day you're wishing
You could hold her through the night
She'd have you sing the chorus
Then watch the years go by
But I don't mind

The meat talks back, divorce my head off of my neck
To dine on hot organs, and that's all
And where is love?
It's on the blade of this old knife
Your lover took your life and took off

"Lay them on the lawn like dead virgins
Goddess of the grove."
