Shame rests in hollow circles under all of our eyes
You stole the living air from me
And payback is a bitter banshee

At the site of my grave
Performed their bitter biopsy
Diva and deviant dichotomy

Sleep came in a vision of beauty
She hovered over my bed
She had her holy way with me
And made me cum like the clergy
She led me through a cluttered gallery
Took me by the hand and she said
"Come here boy, stick your head between my legs
And start praying."

At the site of my grave
She had her holy way with me
For my benevolent biography

The earth stood still, and the air fell ill
And the sky bled acid rain for days
Suckled, sincere, and crystal clear
Like the sound of falling dirt upon
The lid of my coffin

At the site of my grave
She had her holy way with me
And hung a halo on a hard harpy
