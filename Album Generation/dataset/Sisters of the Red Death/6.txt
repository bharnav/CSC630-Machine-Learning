He drew a question from a curtain of flies
"Are there colors in the dreams of the blind?"
He knew the answer when you tore out his eyes
"Does black count?"
Flaccid the severed member you clench
Exalted walking carrion stench
Your scorned lover was a street working wench
And she whored you

Rejoice and join the great castration
Sharpen your knives

They swarm down a manicured talon flood
Like frenzied harpies in a rapture of blood
How comical we used to call you a stud
Now you're stumpy
Fervent disciple my unholy desire
Shriek harmonies in our immaculate choir
And set these androgynous corpes afire
Those sexless seraphim are memories

She won't pick your bones after all
Your skull took its place upon the wall
Where her spirit scarred you
Those maggots are married to you

RAPE
They found her swinging from a pipe
In the basement of the church of Jesus Christ
We sang RAPE
We know whose hands are stained red
