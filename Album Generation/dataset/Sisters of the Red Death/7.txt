Took half your face and both your eyes
It left you nothing but paralyzed
And mushroom clouds it left behind
Our city's crumbling but i don't mind
The ether tastes like nausea
A permanent distraction
From the waking world outside

Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria

Like scared teens on ecstasy
An epileptic dance party
So shut your mouth
And don't you scream
Just hold my hand girl and dance with me
To the sound of severed hands clapping
And our untimely funeral
Bombs wrap children round sweet scents

Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria

And mans new nuclear paint brush
Which drew you on earth's canvas
A skull where you face should be

In the soundful rain
In the flames in the fallout
I hear the echoes of an empire calling out your name
What goes to show me what your to serenade
And through the smoke i heare them singing
I hear them singing gloria

Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
Rain down, gloria
