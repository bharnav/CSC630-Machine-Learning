I've got a secret. A terrible secret
And if I told you would you promise to keep it secret?
I just put my head down every time they call my name
'Cause they never understand me anyway

Every time you call my name
In the shape of a palm on the side of her face
Every time you call my name

He was our teacher. Our Sunday school preacher
And he made her stay after school one day while I waited
And I watched him take her
Beat her and rape her, then he said
"If you tell anyone, I'll have God kill your mommy."

So I just put my head down
Every time they called my name
'Cause they never understand me anyway

Every time you call my name
In the shape of a palm on the side of her face
Every time you call my name

I've got a secret. A terrible secret
But you never understand it anyway
Every time you call my name
In the shape of a palm on the side of her face
Every time you call my name

Anyway every time you call my name
In the shape of a palm on the side of her face
Every time you call my name
