Sister insomnia
My eyes weep worms for you
Angel anathema
I'll drink your blood

The blood you shed for me
Was all you gave to me
My bold bulimic belly dancer
Narcissistic necromancer
Run just run from me

As day consumes the night
The earth shall cover me
Medusa madonna
Murder me marry me

The blood you shed for me
Was all you gave to me
My bold bulimic belly dancer
Narcissistic necromancer
Run just run from me

Under your vapid vultures wings
I'll suckle your black milk
And let it trickle down my tongue
Your womb mouth kiss could kill

As day consumes the night
I'll drink your blood

The blood you shed for me
Was all you gave to me
My cold kinetic claws and cancer
Narcissistic necromancer
Run just run from me

This time all riots I'm ready
This time all riots I'm ready to go
This time all riots I'm ready
This time all riots I'm ready to go
