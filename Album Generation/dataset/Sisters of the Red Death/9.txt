Hey miscarriage
I was hoping you'd catch my white knuckled wave
But the umbilical bars of your seraphant cell
They're all

"Hey now what's that sound?"
Machine guns fire in a shantytown
"The American mask of a terrorist clown?"
The stealth jet bombers and mushroom clouds coming down

Congregation; behold our daughter
The perversion of the age
With these forceps, I waved hello
And tried to pluck you from the womb

Hang your head in shame;
Ye dare accuse our mother
A curse upon your name and all your future sons
The hour is at hand, and she will be the herald
For the reign of womankind
Let the blood rain down forever and ever
