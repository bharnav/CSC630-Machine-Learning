[Verse ]
One step forward and two steps back
The crowd will roar and bones will crack
And you'll be Samba to me
And by the calm of the sea
You gave your promise to me
We go hand in hand
Backing up the band
Put things on the sand
Understand I love you

[Chorus]
It's a rock 'n tumble
Never give up
You've got the stuff
We've got enough
We are in love

Take two steps forward and
Two steps back [2x]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's a rock 'n tumble
Never give up [2x]

[Chorus 2x]
