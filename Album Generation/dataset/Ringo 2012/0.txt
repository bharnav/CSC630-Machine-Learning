[Verse 1]
This is anthem, for peace and love
We've got to keep trying
We can't give up
This is the day, no turning away
This is an anthem
You think you've got it covered, you say you know the score
But people are dying, there's no denying
But do we do we know what for

[Chorus 1]
We know we [3x]
It's true
We know we [3x]
What we've got to do

[Chorus 2]
This is anthem, of peace and love
We've got to keep trying, we can't try enough
This is the day, no turning away
This is an anthem

[Verse 3]
It's not all mines and bullets it's from hunger too
But never say never
Lets get it together
Cause we know we know what to do

[Chorus 1][2x]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
No man ever made it on his own
No man ever made it all alone
We've got to help out
This is anthem, of peace and love [3x]
