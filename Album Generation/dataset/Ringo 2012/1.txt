[Verse 1]
If i had the wings of an eagle
Over these broken dreams i will fly
If i could be shot like an arrow
Straight to you, in your arms i will lie

[Chorus]
Don't you know i love you?
Don't you know i love you so?

[Verse 2]
If i had the strength of a lion
There'd be no one to keep us apart
And if i was to crack just like thunder
I would shout what i feel in my heart

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Need you so much
The melody's coming in clear. (so clear
And with your touch
The music keeps going around and around in my ears
All right

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
If i had to live life without you
I'd be lost like a ship in the night
Your love never gave me no warning
Like a bird i was shot down in flight

[Chorus][x6]
