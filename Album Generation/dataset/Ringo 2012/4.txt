[Chorus]
The Rock Island Line is a mighty good road
The Rock Island Line is the road to ride, yeah
The Rock Island Line is a mighty good road
You go to ride it, like I find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 1]
Jesus came for save our sins
I hope I go to Heaven
And going to meet Him again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A B C, W X Y Z
The cat's in the cupboard
But it don't see me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I may be right
I may be wrong
I know you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone

[Chorus][2x]
