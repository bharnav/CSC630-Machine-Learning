[Verse 1]
When I was a kid in Liverpool
The rain never stopped but the sun always shone in my mind, in Liverpool
The streets were long and wide
There were places we could hide in our mind
Walking to Sefton Park, and Its a beautiful day
But we should be going to school, but anyway

[Chorus]
Me and boys, me and the gang
Living our fantasies
Breaking the rules, acting like fools
Thats how it was for me
How was it for you?

[Verse 2]
At H. Hunt & son
In Liverpool
An apprentice engineer but
I had something very clear in my mind
Music was my goal in my heart and in my soul and in my mind
Walking to the Iron Door on a beautiful night
Well, I knew I wanted more
It felt so right

[Chorus]
Me and the girl, me and the band
Living our fantasies
Breaking the rules, acting like fools
Thats how it was for me
How was it for you? (x6)

[Chorus][2x]
