[Verse 1]
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days we need, to leave it alone
But when we look back, at how far we've come
We know we're in it, for the long run

[Chorus]
The worst that ever was wonderful
Better than I ever dreamed
The worst that ever was wonderful
Cause it's always been you and me
And we made it through, the way we always do
Cause for me and you
The worst that ever was wonderful

[Verse 2]
Each time I see you
I feel the same
It always gets better, the more we can change
No expectations, no room for doubt
There's never been troubles, we can't work out

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Each time I see you
I feel the same
It always gets better
The more we can change

[Chorus]
