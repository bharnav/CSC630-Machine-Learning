[Verse 1]
Step lightly
You're moving too fast
Take your time, boy
Soon the pain will pass
In the meantime
You gotta find yourself a love
That's going to last
Step lightly
Things will work out fine
Nice and easy
All it takes is time
Please, believe me
I wish this song was yours instead of mine

[Bridge]
Now don't be angry at what I'm telling you
I'd be happy if you would see it too
But in the meantime
Find yourself a love that's true to you

[Chorus]
But in the meantime, (meantime)
Find yourself a love that's going to last

[Verse 2]
Now I told you
Things don't work out fast
Gotta go now
Let's forget the past

[Chorus]
But in the meantime, (in the meantime)
You gotta find yourself a love that's going to last[x3]

[Outro]
You gotta find a love that last[x2]
