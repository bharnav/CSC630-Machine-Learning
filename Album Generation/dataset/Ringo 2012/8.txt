Face to thew wind
My feet on the floor
Heading down the highway on the 104
Gotta get the lid out can't be late

In and out of traffic got no time to waste

Slow down, slow down, slow down!, slow down

Calm is good
When your mind is busy with woulda coulda should
You betta slow down

Check is in the mail but someone forgot the stamp
Trying to find some peace of mind and put it in the bank

Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down

Is good
When your mind is busy with woulda coulda should
You betta slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
