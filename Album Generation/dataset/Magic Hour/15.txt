F*** Yeah
Let me turn that so you know who I am
Got a rack like a boobie got ass like a Ken
Have a thrusted, lusted, blusted, 'cause I must get
Sharper than a fine white line to the blusted
Give it to my daddy got a big hit get my dick wet
Keep dragging on the ground when I fly with the jet set
Backwards discotech I earned it fine line buy wine I learn
How to work it like Gary in a coal mine
Rough trade with the papa man tough
When I shake that ass crack take that didn't want me
But an O.K. back, cuz its in the parquet
Gotta take a Gatorade, protein shake
Got my six in the automatic go snap snap
Turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
Think you gotta turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
My wheels turning like a river but I suck like a Hoover
They call em pussy, Up-The-Butt Vancouver
I got ass like man so I don't feel like dancing
For the Blue Man Group I give a moment chance
I suck a mother lode because I'm strong
If you got a sequin Ill put it on
Walking with a flat bush
Nothing but a thong
This is not a love song; my theme song
True line in my pussy but he lick at the curves
Like I got vitamin C cause baby you have the scurvy, curvy you heard me
Gotta sit like a queen
Then I hurdy-gurdy
Let me take off my shirt-y
Baby say, Fuck yeah (Thats what Im gonna do)
Baby say, Fuck yeah (Baby said so too)
Baby say, Fuck yeah (What you waiting for?)
I'm tired of waiting on you
Baby say, Fuck yeah (Thats what Im gonna do)
Baby say, Fuck yeah (Baby said so too)
Baby say, Fuck yeah (What you waiting for?)
I'm tired of waiting on you
Turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
Think you gotta turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
{Ana Matronic:}
Don't you be surprised
While I fetishize
Let me describe
I moisturize
No Levis
Just fruit flies
Touch my up-do
I cut you
My Miu-Miu shoe
Dodge doo-doo
Like Miuccia
I suit ya, fresh like baja
Raw like XuXa
Soy una pinche bruja
Why take it to the backs unload that
What you find when the cops unload that
Nothing but a compact disc and a Kodak
Know that throwback dont fool Kojack
(2x)
Suck up on the loving cause I'm strong
If you got a sequin Ill put it on
Walking with a flat bush
Nothing but a thong
This is not a love song; my theme song
[No get into your love thats what I plan
At your man]
Turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
Think you gotta turn it to feel my lovin
Think you better work it to feel my lovin
Why take it to the backs unload that
What you find when the cops unload that
Nothing but a compact disc and a Kodak
Know that throwback dont fool Kojack
(2x)
