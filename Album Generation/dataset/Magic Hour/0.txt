[Verse 1]
I don't mind if you're runnin' around
Giving someone the time
It's alright 'cause I know that you love me
I'm layin' in bed with a whole lot of wonder
Goin' through my head
This dog with a bone gets a little bit lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too cool to lose my control
You're too cool to call
Baby I just don't wanna know
You're out there havin' it at all

[Chorus]
Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm not that kind of guy
But you're 'bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home

[Verse 2]
Baby one more pill will help me close my eyes
To the pain I feel
I can't sleep 'less you're layin' beside me
I got no doubt that you'd be just fine
If you were livin' without me
I just can't let you start it tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Nine, ten, eleven, now midnight strikes
I don't know where you been
But I still want to make love tonight
When you come stumbling in

[Chorus]
Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm not that kind of guy
But you're 'bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home

[Bridge]
Baby, what do we do? (What do we do?)
Just to keep from tearing to two
Baby, what could you say? (What could you say?)
To drive my fears away
Maybe one red letter day
No more chips to play
Will you come home
Baby come home

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me

[Chorus]
Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm not that kind of guy
But you're 'bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home
