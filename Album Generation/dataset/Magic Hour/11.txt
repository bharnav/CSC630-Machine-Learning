All the jagged lines
All the dotted I’s
Tiny like a white lie
It takes someone to know one
It takes someone to care
Cause that’s the way I believe
Like a neon prayer
Straight line to heaven
Are you there

Extraordinary lives
Keep crashing and tumbling by
Somewhere there’s a sky for only me
Diamonds in disguise
Hiding like forgotten days
All these tears of mine will fly away

I can see for miles
I can sleep for days
Everything you saved me
Only someone to hold you
Only someone to share
To see the things that you miss
Remember when you’re scared
Straight like a Christian
I’ll be there

Extraordinary lives
Keep crashing and tumbling by
Somewhere there’s a sky for only me
Diamonds in disguise
Hiding like forgotten days
All these tears of mine will fly away

We’re only turning around
Turning ourselves around
We’re only turning around
Turning our love around
We’re only turning around
Turning ourselves around
We’re only turning around
Turning our love around

Extraordinary lives
Keep crashing and tumbling by
Somewhere there’s a sky for only me
Diamonds in disguise
Hiding like forgotten days
All these tears of mine will fly away
