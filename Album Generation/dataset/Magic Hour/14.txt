What's up it's Pickles

Hey, I'm calling you back
Ooh she's been a bitch tonight
And by bitch, I mean this rain
No cabs, no where
So I had to put on the wigs and the lashes
And the heels and the eairh
And take the train to the club
And we all know
That the MTA should stand for Motherfuckers Touching my Ass

So then I get to the club
Looking like a drowned, harassed rat
And I'm greeted, not by  Miss Rose at the door
But our friend, Johnny Five-Oh

Yes honey, the NYPD shut down the party
So no fee for me
I don't even know what's the tea

So I hope you're up girl
Cause we are all coming over
Lock the doors, lower the blinds
Fire up the smoke machine
And put on your heels
Cause I know exactly what we need

Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have kiki
(Motherfucker)

I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
And work and turn and h-h-honey

A kiki is a party
For calming all your nerves
We're spilling tea and dishing just desserts one may deserve
And though the sun is rising
Few may choose to leave
So shade that lid
And we'll all bid
Adieu to your ennui

Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have kiki
(Motherfucker)

I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki

We're gonna serve
And work and turn and h-h-honey

Oh what a wonderful kiki
This kiki is marvelous
(Work it girl)

(ewww, you know girl we were
Sitting back here just having our own kiki)

Kiki, So-So, Oui Oui
Non Non
Kiki, So-So, Oui Oui, Non Non
Kiki, So-So, Oui Oui, Non Non
Kiki, So-So, Oui Oui, Non Non

Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki
(Motherfucker)
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
And work and turn and h-h-honey
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki
(Hunty drop her)
I'm gonna let you have it

Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Boots, ten, queen
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
And work and turn and h-h-honey
