What's up? It's Pickles. Leave a message

Now that's what I call a kiki honey
I wanna flip that over and grill it up again, okay?
I'm so glad you liked the songs I played you and
You know I didn't get to play you everything I've got in my magic bag
So I'm gonna hold the phone up to the speaker right now
Stay tuned honey
