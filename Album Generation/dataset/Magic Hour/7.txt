Well she left me here halfway
Between the bright lights of Los Angeles
And the tawdry nights of San Jose

With Ecstasy and Ivory wave
And a backpack full of captain jack
To take me to an early grave

And I've never been to paradise
Standing on this corner by myself
You don't have to tell me twice

And the world's not gonna end
If I could just pretend
And here's a place to go
San Luis Obispo
And the streets they may look the same
Of any town by any name
Gonna find my afterglow
San Luis Obispo

The difference between delight
And loneliness could be a one way flight
In these San Luis Obispo nights

It's where no one seems to mind
If you string words together with
Kool cigarettes and sparkling wine

Keep the conversation light
Wait until the girls get underdressed
Then the talk gets less polite

And I could stay here for all my days
But will I spend my life deciding if
Happiness is just a phase

And I hope that I'm not wrong
Maybe here's where I belong
Every winter free of snow
San Luis Obispo

But if she's coming back again
I would flee but until then
Every day my love it grows
San Luis Obispo

The difference between delight
And loneliness is never black or white
In these San Luis Obispo nights

Sorry you misunderstood
This kid with his intentions good
When all I had was two feet left to stand

And if you're coming back through town
Put your ear down to the ground
Cause' this boy's voice has changed into a man's

And I hope that I'm not wrong
Baby here's where I belong
A winter free of snow
San Luis Obispo

But if she's coming back again
I would flee but until then
Every day my love it grows
San Luis Obispo

The difference between delight
And loneliness could be a one way flight
In these San Luis Obispo nights
