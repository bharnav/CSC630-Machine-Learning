[Verse 1]
Eighty dollars 'round trip, anywhere you fly
Well, that sounds like a winner, but before I book the flight
Hey, talk me out of Tampa

[Verse 2]
Well, tell me 'bout New Orleans, just when is that Mardi Gras?
Well then how about Chicago?
Is it still cold there now or not?
Talk me out of Tampa

[Chorus]
I mean surely there's a hurricane due to hit there any day
Won't that close the beaches and the airport?
Or maybe it's still way to hot or did I hear
Somewhere you stopped flyin' into that part of the country?
You can think of somethin' can't ya?
Just talk me out of Tampa

[Verse 3]
Between that first ride at Busch Gardens
And room eight, Bayside Motel
There's no way around the memories
Don't let me do this to myself
Talk me out of Tampa

[Verse 4]
I'd just wind up at her front door
She's still living there, I bet
Oh, but what if she's not there alone
There goes what pride that I've got left
Talk me out of Tampa, please

[Chorus]
I mean surely there's a hurricane due to hit there any day
Won't that close the beaches and the airport?
Or maybe it's still way to hot or did I hear
Somewhere you stopped flyin' into that part of the country?
You can think of somethin' can't ya?
Just talk me out of Tampa

[Verse 5]
Put me somewhere, nowhere even close
To where I feel when my heart broke
Exactly six months ago this weekend
I just need to get away
Without your help, ma'am, I'm afraid
It wouldn't be a getaway at all
You can make up somethin', can't ya?
Just talk me out of Tampa
