[Verse 1]
The snow in Montana was three feet high
The lady at the counter said: There ain't no flights
And so he called her on the telephone
He said: I'll rent a car and I'll drive home

[First Chorus]
And she said: I'll wait for you
Like I did last year
At Christmas time with your family here
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Now he's on his cell phone is a Coupe DeVille
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home

[Second Chorus]
She says: I'll wait for you like in '68
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
Remember, dear, our son's first cry
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you

[Verse 3]
He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said, she's in a better place
She said to give you this note just in case

[Third Chorus]
And it said, I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you

[Tag]
P.S. I love you, too
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
