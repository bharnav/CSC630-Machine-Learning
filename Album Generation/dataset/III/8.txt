[Verse 1]
She hates goin' anywhere in my old truck
She says: it's always muddy and it rides so rough
And there ain't no graceful way to climb up in a dress
Yeah, I'm about as country as she gets

[Verse 2]
I might get her on the lake to fish with me
If the water's smooth and the sky is blue with a nice, cool breeze
But anything we catch, I'll have to clean myself
'Cause I'm about as country as she gets

[Chorus]
She'll slip off a pair of heels
Walk barefoot across the field
Climb up on a fence just to be near me
Sometimes I think that horse still scares her half-to-death
Yeah, I'm about as country as she gets

[Verse 4]
She likes being within spendin' distance of a mall
Havin' enough bars to make a cell phone call
Put her in a crowd and she's right in her element
Yeah, I'm about as country as she gets

[Chorus]
But she'll slip out on the porch sometimes
When that sun's low in the sky
Pull up a rockin' chair just to be with me
Until that first big June bug buzzes by her head
See I'm about as country as she gets
Yeah, I'm about as country as she gets
