[Verse 1]
Just when every ray of hope was gone
I should have known that you would come along
I can't believe I ever doubted you
My old friend the blues

[Verse 2]
Another lonely night, a nameless town
If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around
I know I can always count on you
My old friend the blues

[Chorus]
Lovers leave and friends will let you down
But you're the only sure thing that I've found
No matter what I do I'll never lose
My old friend the blues

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Lovers leave and friends will let you down
But you're the only sure thing that I've found
No matter what I do I'll never lose
My old friend the blues

[Tag]
Just let me hide my weary heart in you
My old friend the blues
