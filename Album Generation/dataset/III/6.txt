I wonder if you've had the time it takes to think it over
And sort out all the feelings in your mind
Sometimes I think you've found someone
To do your thinkin' for ya
'Cause lately you've been showin' all the signs

Should I come home or should I go crazy
I'm beggin' you, please make up your mind
If you love me, then think it all over
So, make up your mind or I'll lose mine

Last night when I came by
I rang the bell and no one answered
But I heard voices whisper through the door
Now I'm not sure if anyone was home to do the talkin'
'Cause lately I hear voices more and more

Should I come home or should I go crazy
I'm beggin' you, please make up your mind
If you love me, then think it all over
So, make up your mind or I'll lose mine

Should I come home or should I go crazy
I'm beggin' you, please make up your mind
If you love me, then think it all over
So, make up your mind or I'll lose mine

Should I come home or should I go crazy
I'm begging you please...
