[Verse 1]
I'm a solitary man
Nothing means more than my freedom
A few days ago I swear
I walked out of there believin'
I could let you go

[Chorus]
I know how freedom feels
I've heard that sound beneath my wheels
Nothin' or no one to slow me down
But since I told you goodbye
Somethin' just ain't right
Freedom feels like lonely tonight

[Verse 2]
Out on this open road
Anywhere I wanna go is waitin'
All I can think about
Is turnin' this ol' truck around and takin'
That road back to you

[Chorus]
I know how freedom feels
I've heard that sound beneath my wheels
Nothin' or no one to slow me down
But since I told you goodbye
Somethin' just ain't right
Freedom feels like lonely tonight

[Verse 3]
Yeah, since I told you goodbye
I miss you all the time
Freedom feels like lonely tonight

[Tag]
Yeah, freedom feels like lonely tonight
