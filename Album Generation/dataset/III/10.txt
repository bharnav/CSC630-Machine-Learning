Sittin' at a poker table holdin' kings and threes
So far lady luck, hmm, sure has been good to me
I should quit while I'm ahead, but I'll hang around instead
And the dealer asked: What would you settle for?
And I said: Just a little more

I need just a little more
A little more than I've got
And I've got all that I can spend and I can't spend it fast enough
But if the truth be known, I can't quit on my own
And I spent all my life waitin' for just a little more

Havin' a drink here on my favorite stool
I know that a couple has turned into a few
And the bartender says to me: Son, I think it's time you leave
If you don't mind headin' for the door
But I ask: For just a little more

I need just a little more, a little more than I've had
And I've had all that a man should and I should leave and not come back
But if the truth be known I can't quit on my own
And I spent all my life waitin' for just a little more

Too many late nights and all of the above
You've tried to help me for so long
But you finally had enough
And you tell me that you're gonna leave
As you're holding on to me
But before you let me go, hold me just a little more

I need just a little more
A little more time
Time for me to end all these hurtin' ways of mine
And Lord, I know you give me all the strength that I need
But I'm down here on my knees prayin' for
Just a little more
Just a little more...
