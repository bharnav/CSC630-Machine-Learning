[Chorus]
Everyone seems so far away
Glittering jewels that you never had
You'll never own anything
Seems so far behind
See yourself in the places you've been
Some other time

[Verse]
In endless blue
Reflections look so good
You're never certain of anything
Unless you go in
Endless blue
Seems so far away
A glittering jewel that you never had
Nor will you again
At high tide, high tide

[Chorus]

[Outro]
At high tide, high
As far as you can say
At high tide, high tide
Endless, endless, endless
It's endless
