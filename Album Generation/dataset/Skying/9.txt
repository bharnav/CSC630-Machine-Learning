[Verse 1]
In the orchard we see you once again
Listening only with the sunlight on your arms
It's a change to see you in my world again
Only visiting but happy anyway

[Chorus]
It's a joy
To see you waiting there
Lit up, left glowing in the air
It's a joy
To know you're waiting there
Writing letters, left burning in the air

[Verse 2]
In the picture we see you once again
Still leaning with the sunlight on your arms
Then the life sent itself into the air
Until someone came upon the frozen stare

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bringing all wonders to light
Bringing all wonders to light [x2]
Like an ocean
Life that overcomes
Like an ocean
Likely follows right behind
The only one
On a lonely ship, we are
Waking like an ocean which is sighing oh
Even when i told you were wrong
Turns out you were right all along
Hold me open when i am with you
Hold me open when i am with you
You know it's gone
You see me run
As if to hide
There on a lonely ship, filled full
Of an ocean which is burning oh
Melt together when i am with you
Held together when i am with you
We had it there
We had it there
I could have sworn

[Outro]
Turns out you were right all along [x3]
