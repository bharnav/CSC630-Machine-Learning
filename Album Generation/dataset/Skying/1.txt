[Verse 1]
You said I had what I came for
And the whispers had washed you away
Held yourself at the window
But the rivers were turning your head
You said I had what I came for
And the whispers had washed you away
Held yourself at the window
But the rivers were turning your head

[Pre-Chorus]
After the crash
After the crash come the waves
And leave you with nothing
At least next to nothing

[Chorus]
You've got to give me love
You've got to give me more [x2]

[Verse 2]
Now the echoes are endless
Whenever you say it aloud
All the whispers are heavy
And the whispers they wear you down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Stretching far into another night
A landscape with no heart
And no one sees her above
Oh there's nothing more to it now
Put aside and forgotten
Barely left alive
And forgotten too far gone to see you
And her eyes are too far gone to know
And her eyes are too far gone to know

[Chorus][x2]
