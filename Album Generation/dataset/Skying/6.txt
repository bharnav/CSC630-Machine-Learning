[Verse 1]
Make me silver promises
Take away my life
I'd give it up if you would only listen
I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
The water's cool if you choose the right time

[Chorus]
Float away again
Float, float away again

[Verse 2]
I know all your lies
Fragile as they are
The water's cool if that's what you came for
Your eyes are running
Through a bitter snow
The sky is cold
Colder than the ocean

[Chorus]
