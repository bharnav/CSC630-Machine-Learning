[Chorus]
Everybody moving further away [x4]

[Verse 1]
See you where the light ends
I'll be shooting across the silver
Through the breaking sky
And back before you know
Wheeling in formation
And i know what you're thinking
So turn your eyes away
And let me be alone

[Chorus]
Everybody moving further away [x2]

[VE\erse 2]
See you where the lie turns
I'll be shooting caps of silver
But it's different now
I'm the only one who flies
Wheeling in formation
And i know what you're thinking
But they're all strangers now
And the silver doesn't shine

[Chorus]
Everybody moving further away [x2]

[Outro]
There with all the people
There with all the people
Oh, i surrender, this is
Oh, i surrender, this is it [x4]
