[Chorus]
Did you see her
She's out of sight
Did you see
She's always cool and bright

[Verse 1]
Waiting for her, oh
You know you're wasting your time
With Monica Gems, oh
No matter how hard you try
People say, oh
She keeps them cool and bright
People say, oh
You're wasting all your time
With Monica Gems, Monica Gems
Monica Gems, Monica

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Waiting for she, oh
You'll be waiting all your life
Monica Gems, oh
You know I think of her sometimes
Monica Gems
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Monica Gems, oh

[Outro]
And we've all been there for Monica, Monica
For Monica, Monica [x3]
Oh, oh, oh, oh [x4]
