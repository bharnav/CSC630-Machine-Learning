I'll make believe
That the sight of her in my head's seldom seen
And then insist
That I can't still taste the inside of her kiss
With luck and time
I might even fool myself about those lies
'Till there's no need
I'll make believe

I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long
Swear right up and down 'round here there's nothin' wrong
With work, my mind
Could cause the truth to get lost or hard to find
But until then
I'll just pretend

Oh, how I wish you could have seen her
Come crawlin' back a beggin' me
'Cause if you had, I wouldn't need her
Like I do so desperately

I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long, swear right up and down, 'round here, there's nothin' wrong
With work my mind could cause the truth to get lost or hard to find
But until then
I'll just pretend
