Take her away
But don't let me see
Who the last heart in line
Turns out to be

I'll never know
There won't be any sign
Of how close it came
For the last heart in line

And though for a while
I'll still be
Waiting around
For my chance patiently
Fact that she's gone
Is bound to finally dawn
On me eventually

Though for a while
I'll still be
Just waiting around
For my chance patiently
The fact that she's gone
Is bound to finally dawn
On me eventually

I guess for her
It'll all work out fine
But who's gonna tell
The last heart in line
