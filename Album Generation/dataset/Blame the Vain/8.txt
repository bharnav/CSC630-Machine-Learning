I wanna love again
Feel young again
The way we did when it was true
Go back before I cried
Or ever tried
To understand life without you
I wanna hold your hand, and us pretend
We're starting out brand new
I wanna love again
Feel young again
The way we did when it was true

I wanna love again
And softly mend
Any ache we ever knew
Then kiss 'till there's no place
Not one small space
That our lips leave unused
I wanna have what
Takes my breath away
Be just the slightest touch from you
I wanna love again
Feel young again
The way we did when it was true

Baby there are countless reasons why
This is something only fools would try
But life sure gets lonely with just pride
So if you'll risk yours, I'll risk mine

I wanna love again
Feel young again
The way we did when it was true
Aw, go back before I cried
Or ever tried
To understand life without you
I wanna hold your hand, and us pretend
We're starting out brand new
I wanna love again
Feel young again
The way we did when it was true
