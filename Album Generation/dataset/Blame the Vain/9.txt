When I first came here
I was empty, lost and weak
When I first came here
In your arms I found relief
When I first came here
Well, I was empty, lost and weak
When I first came here
In your arms I found relief

When I first came here
I was searching for a friend
When I first came here
It was your heart that took me in
When I first came here
I was searching for a friend
When I first came here
It was your heart that took me in

Though I wasn't wrong to long for your beauty
And my eyes were not blind to trust your smile
What they once never showed
Were the endless moments alone
That you'd leave behind

No, they once never showed
These ceaseless moments alone
Are what you'd leave behind

When I first came here
Your lips were where each thought began
When I first came here
My craving for you knew no end
When I first came here
Your lips were where each thought began
When I first came here
My craving for you wouldn't end

When I first came here
Each morning we woke spent and weak
When I first came here
We seldom used our bed for sleep
When I first came here
We woke each morning spent and weak
When I first came here
Our bed was seldom used for sleep

When I first came here
I fell victim to your touch
When I first came here
I sought and craved its constant clutch
When I first came here
I fell victim to your touch
When I first came here
I sought and craved its constant clutch

When I first came here
If my memory serves me right
When I first came here
You shared each breath I drew all night
When I first came here
If my memory serves me right
When I first came here
We shared each breath through every night
