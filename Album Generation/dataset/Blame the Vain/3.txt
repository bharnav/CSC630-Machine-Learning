Does it show
As I watch her walking by
Does it show
That I'm trying not to cry
Does it show
That he's the reason why
Does it show
That every smile is a lie

Does it show
Even when I am discreet
Does it show
I'd fall right down at her feet
All on its own
My heart lets me know I'm
Love's biggest clown
Do you think that shows
Even when no-one is around
Please tell me honestly
Am I fooling anyone
Or is the truth kinda hard not to see

In ways that I'll never know
Does it show

Please, say its not too late
So I can stop while
There's still time
And avoid at least
Some small bit of ache

Does it show
With each flickering memory's final glow
As night's cold shadows wrap
Around where hope let go
And I sit there in the dark
Does it show
