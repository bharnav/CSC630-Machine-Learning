Well, I'll give you three good reasons for leavin'
Number one is that I've forgotten number two
Number three is in a place that's been kept hidden
For so long I can't remember but its true

Then I'll give you three more reasons for leavin'
With the first no worse or better than the next two
But rest assured that the third will leave you grievin'
From a tale that's as sad as it is true

Every night
All night long
I sit and count alone
But every day
Nothin's new
I can't find one to use

Every night
All night long
I sit right there and count alone
But every day
Nothin's new
I can't find one to use

But I'll give you three good reasons for leavin'
Number one is that I've forgotten number two

Yeah, number one is that I've forgotten number two

Number one is that I've forgotten number two
