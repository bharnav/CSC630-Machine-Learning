I blame the vain
For what we wear
And I'll blame the blind
When we can't see
I'll blame it all
On someone else
'Til there's nobody left
Then I'll just blame me

I'll blame her mind
For the thoughts we share
Whoa, and I'll blame her heart
For the time we cared
I'll blame it all
On how we used to be
'Til she's finally gone
Then I'll just blame me

(So go ahead and) Blame...
Anything that you want
'Cause it all ends up the same
When everything that you've
Been claiming is wrong

(Oh and don't you know that) Blame...
Is always never enough
It just keeps you in the game
Until you've only got
Yourself left to bluff

So I'll blame the vain
For what we wear
Yeah, and I'll blame the blind
When we can't see
I'll blame it all
On someone else
'Til there's nobody left
Then I'll just blame me
Till she's finally gone
Then I just blame me
