I'm just passin' time
With everyone I meet
I'm just passin' time
As I wander through the streets
I'm just passin' time
Wrestlin' with thoughts that fight my sleep
She left behind
I'm just passin' time

I'm just passin' time
Inside these empty rooms
I'm just passin' time
Where small, lost hopes still loom
Just passin' time
Appears unlikely to heal any wounds
Of this kind
I'm just passin' time

And time hangs around more every day
Why keep searchin' for a place
That old thoughts might stay
And not just end up
Right back in my heart's way

Time don't ever answer nothin' new
Least not here lately
In any way that I could use
For figurin' out
What's left to lose

I'm just passin' time
With everyone I meet
I'm just passin' time
As I wander through the streets
I'm just passin' time
Wrestlin' with thoughts that fight my sleep
She left behind
I'm just passin' time
