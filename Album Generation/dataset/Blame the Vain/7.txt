She came in and she told me
She said: "I'm leaving you."
I said: "Oh, you are?"
Well let me tell you something:
If you leave, I suggest you stay gone
And I mean stay gone forever, you hear me?
Ever!"

So she left, and then I missed her
I'm not gonna go into why mister
But there's one particular thing that she used to do late at night
I miss that especially
I can count off, I suppose a thousand things I missed
But I don't wanna go into it right now
No, I don't want to count

One, two. One, two, three, four

Another day
I spend alone
Here lately
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Early mornin's
I just suffer through
Since feelin' empty's
What I'm bound to do
But she'll remember
Yea, ah she'll remember

When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember

Late afternoon
I curl up tight
To fight back tears
I shed all night
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Be no debatin' right or wrong
It's just a matter of how long
Those lies defend her
Then she'll remember

She'll try she'll try
But there won't be
No more escape
From her own lonely memories

Mine may be
The only scars that show
From every break
One heart could know
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Once all that's left is what's been used
And any chance to hide from the truth
Keeps gettin' slimmer
Then she'll remember

So one more day
I'll spend alone
Like every other
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea, oh she'll remember

The early mornin's
Late afternoons
Each empty night
I'm still sufferin' through
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember

She'll remember
She'll remember
Yeah yeah, remember
Whoa, she'll remember
She'll remember
She'll remember
She'll remember
Then she'll remember
Then she'll remember

When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember
