[Verse 1]
You prayed to have your name scattered on the lips of the young
Now, you claim that it's you on the tips of their tongue
And if you're proud of what you had to kill to get your thrill, well
I bet it stings to give up everything and realize that they don't want you

[Chorus]
It's a lonely road where the forgotten go where your misery finds its company
(whoa-oh-oh-ow)
It's a long way down to the sacred ground where the reaper's playing for keeps
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x2

[Verse 2]
The hollow sound is ringing where your heart used to be
Have you found that your admiration will never set you free?
Get your lies prepared, you're next in line for judgement day, now Aren't you praying, aren't you begging that you're anyone else?

[Chorus]
It's a lonely road where the forgotten go where your misery finds its company
(whoa-oh-oh-ow)
It's a long way down to the sacred ground where the reaper's playing for keeps
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x4

[Bridge]
Well, I bet you're sorry now
You did this to yourself
Well, I bet you're sorry now
Well, aren't you sorry now?

[Chorus]
It's a lonely road where the forgotten go where your misery finds its company
(whoa-oh-oh-ow)
It's a long way down to the sacred ground where the reaper's playing for keeps
It's a lonely road where the forgotten go where your misery finds its company
(whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x2)
It's a long way down to the sacred ground where the reaper's playing for keeps
(whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x2)

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x2

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow x2
(you prayed to have your name scattered on the lips of the young
Now, you claim that it's you on the tips of their tongue)
