[Verse 1]
Don’t try to say sorry
Don’t try to say anything
I gave you my everything
And you threw it all away, away

[Chorus]
And I try to build you up
But you just fall, you just fall
And I can’t save you now
No, no one can save you from yourself
No one can save you
No one can save you from yourself

[Verse 2]
I call for you but you never come
You wrote me up and just left me undone
You showed me who I can’t be
So you enjoy your life of lonely misery

[Chorus]
And I try to build you up
But you just fall, you just fall
And I can’t save you no more
No one can save you from yourself
No one can save you
No one can save you from yourself
No one can save you
No one can save you from yourself
