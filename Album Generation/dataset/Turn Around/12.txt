We will meet at the river
We will be delivered of every chain
Down into the water - children, mothers, and fathers in His sweet name
To drown all our sins and come up again forever changed
Never to return to the people we were before that great day
We will patiently wait til we see His face
And when he appears to wipe all our tears forever away
Then we will be together in Heaven foever on that great day
On that great day
We will patiently wait til we see His face
And when He appears to wipe all our tears forever away
Then we will be together in Heaven forever on that great day
On that great day
On that great day
On that great day
