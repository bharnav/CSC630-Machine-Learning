The grass always looks greener
On the other side of the fence, yeah, yeah
But the dog over there might be meaner
On the other side of the fence, yeah, yeah
The car in the driveway looks longer on the other side of the streat, yeah, yeah
Does anything ever go wrong there
On the other side of the fence, yeah, yeah
Stay in your own yard
Play in your own chard
Cause everything (that) glitters realy ain't gold
The future always looks brighter
On the other side of the tracks, yeah, yeah
Everybody wants to go over
But they don't want to come back, no, no
They live like Kings and Queens
On the other side of the town, yeah, yeah
They're gonna have to make room for me there
On the other side of the town, sho nuff
Jealousy's a cold thing
It's ice wather in your veins
All it brings a bitterness an pain
Everything (that) glitters really ain't gold
Instead of worrying bout what you are not
Gotta make the most what you got
Instead of keeping up with Mr. Jones
Betta look out for your own
Stay in your own yard
Play in your own yard
Be happy in your own yard
Cause everything (that) glitters realy ain't gold
