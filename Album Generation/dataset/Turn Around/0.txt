You sing a song, While sitting at a red light
You think of home, while sitting at a red light

Too slow to roll
Put your life on hold
An open path
With nowhere to go
You start to wonder, while sitting at a red light

You can run a red light, Give up at a red light
You break the molds, when running through the tolls
Speeding through your whole life

A chance to breathe while sittin' at a red light
You look around, reflecting on your life

A chance to think
Am I drinking too much
Should I keep going
Lose the life that I love
A second glance
When coming to a red light

You can run a red light, Give up at a red light
You break the molds, when running through the tolls
Speeding through your whole life

You can run a red light, Give up on your whole life
You break the molds, when running through the tolls
Speeding through your whole life

When things look low
You've gotta keep strong
Feet to the grass
You've gotta walk it off
The bows been tied
Too tight to laugh
Feet to the ground
You've gotta walk it off

You can run a red light
You can run a red light

Start to think
Am I drinking too much
Should I keep going
Lose the life that I love

You can run a red light, Give up at a red light
You break the molds, when running through the tolls
Speeding through your whole life

You can run a red light, Give up on you whole life
You break the molds, when running through the tolls
Speeding through your whole life

You can run a red light
You can run a red light

You sing a song, while sitting at a red light
