Let me tell you

I remember in the days of old
Doesn't seem that long ago
It was...
" Johnny you won't be nothing unless you do what you're told"
Study medicine or study law
And please put away the guitar
The best you'll ever be is a local star at the local bar

But I went and did it anyway
Family helping all the way
Now I'm here today
5 records later
So you can hear me say

Don't, let em tell you can't be
Anything you wanna be
Don't be deceived
Anything's possible
If, you will just believe
Then you can succeed
It might not be easy
But anything's possible

What if old Ben Franklin
Would of been frightened by lightning
If he would of stayed inside then
We'd still be in the dark

Martin Luther King
Did some beautiful things
All because he had a dream
Just like you and me

Don't, let em tell you can't be
Anything you wanna be
Don't be deceived
Anything's possible
If, you will just believe
Then you can succeed
It might not be easy

Don't you know, it's gonna be sweat
And some tears
And some hard years
Best believe they'll be hurt
And some pain
Expect some rain

You're gonna make it if you try
Keep your eye, on the prize
You can take it
You might have to work it, but it's gonna be worth it
Don't let em tell you that you dont deserve it

Don't, let em tell you can't be
Anything you wanna be
Don't be deceived
Anything's possible
If, you will just believe
Then you can succeed
It might not be easy
Anything's possible

Sisters and brothers, anything's possible

I know you can...
