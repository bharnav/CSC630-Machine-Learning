Breaker, breaker, breaker 1 9
Is there anybody out there?
I'm running this road for the first time
I d sure like to know whats ahead

I been on the wrong track with the wrong map
And I'm trying to find my way home
So, come back if you're on the line
Let me know I'm not alone

With this heavy load to tow behind
Its all I can do to stay between the lines
And whatever may come my way I

Can't slow down not for the weather
Won't back down - I know it gets better
(Come) too far now if I can keep it together
Won't turn around not now for just a bump in the road

Breaker, breaker, stay on the line
I'm about to fall asleep at the wheel
Ive been pushing all night to meet the deadline
And Im waiting for my second wind

I can't make it alone I won't survive
Its all I can do to make it out alive
To the other side

Can't slow down not for the weather
Won't back down - I know it gets better
(Come) too far now if I can keep it together
Won't turn around not now for just a bump in the road

Got nothing to prove but so much to lose
And Id gladly give it up just to hold
Onto you cause youre all that Ive got, all I want, all I need

Can't slow down not for the weather
Won't back down - I know it gets better
(Come) too far now if I can keep it together
Won't turn around not now for just a bump in the road
