Heart is heavy
Soul is thirsty
Body's achin
I am desperately in need of restoration
I am ready for you to take me higher
The only thing that I can do is keep on praying
On my own I just can't get it right
It doesn't matter how hard I try
But with you I've become a much stronger man
Getting on my knees puts me back on my feet again
Load is heavy
Too much accumulation
These possessions that I have amount to nothing at all
I am willing to hand over every one of them
Cause they won't profit me anything in the end
Never again: will I wander without you alone in the wilderness
Never again: Never again Now that I understand
