Standing on the edge of a bridge
One step away from ending it all
All the while you are wondering
Does anyone love me at all?
Listening to all the wrong voices
Got you feeling broken and worhless
I just thought you should know this
Until you fulfill your purpose
It's not over - for you and I
It's not over - there is still time
This one is for the prostitute
The drug abused, homeless and destitute
And anybody wanting to be rescued there is still time
This is for the orphan who is all alone
All he wants is to have a home
Your earthly father may have left you
But your Heavenly Father told me to tell you
It's not over - for you and I
It's not over - there is still time
Someone loves you
Someone hears you
Someone feels you
Someone can heal you
Someone wants to see you through
It's not over - for you and I
It's not over - there's still time
