[Intro]
You've worn the soles off both your shoes
Walking on me like you do
This isn't what forever's for
And I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore

[Verse 1]
I've cried and begged and cursed and prayed
But nothing's worked, nothing's changed
No way I win when you keep score
And I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna crawl out from this stone that I've been under
To see the light and breathe the air
And you'll have a million reasons why I shouldn't leave you
But for the first time in a long time, I don't care

[Verse 2]
I guess on one hand, you should laugh
'Cause I've said the same things in the past
But this time, one hand's on the door
And I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna crawl out from this stone that I've been under
To see the light and breathe the air
And you'll have a million reasons why I shouldn't leave you
But for the first time in a long time, I don't care

[Verse 3]
Now I can't help but think of you
Looking back in my rear view
But I've been down that road before
And I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore
I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore
