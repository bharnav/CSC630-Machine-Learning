[Verse 1]
So hot outside, all I can wear Is these cut off overalls
The sandals on my feet
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
So I could sit there on a broken seat
I got no place I should go, I got no worries you know
Second or seventh street, it doesn't matter to me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

[Verse 2]
Well, I pulled back down to my up street apartment
And the air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven and I thought I'd be further along
Than just this rented space
I got no papers to read, I got no cable TV
And I got no places to be, I got no people to meet

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
Yeah, I'm a lucky one

[Bridge]
I'm on a roll
When I'm with you
Don't stop me now
I just can't lose

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night
Yeah, I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
Yeah, I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
