[Intro]
Alright
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Good morning, dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To watch two people we know make a big mistake
They'll stand up at the alter
And solemnly swear "I do"
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new

[Verse 2]
Her daddy's in the front row
Muttering "Oh no, here we go again"
They had a couple dates
Now she's three months late
And it's twenty bucks a plate I spent, oh

[Verse 3]
Good morning, dearly beloved
I'd like to welcome ya'll
To see the side effects of sex and alcohol
Please bow your heads and join me
In a prayer for these two
Who'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new
Alright!

[Verse 4]
The bride is a flirt and the groom is worse
As he's putting the ring on her
He's checking out the bridesmaids
Thinking that he might take
The maid of honor's honor, oh

[Verse 5]
Welcome, dearly beloved
We are here this afternoon
To throw rice as these two
Drive down the road to ruin
With cans tied to the bumper
And a draggin' muffler too
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new

[Outro]
So raise your glass and join me
Here's to the bride and groom
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new
Ya'll come back, ya hear now?
Thanks Dad
Hahaha
