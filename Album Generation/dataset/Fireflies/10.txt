[Verse 1]
What if no one would kill for their religion?
What if no one ever had to go to war?
What if the children of the world made world decisions?
Paint-by-number hatred wasn't hanging around anymore

[Chorus]
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?

[Verse 2]
It's like everything and nothing leads to wisdom
It's like no one really means what they say
While we fight for peace and die for our freedom
I guess we'll leave it to our children to find a better way

[Chorus]
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?

[Verse 3]
I know that I, I'm just a dreamer
A common man, schemer
Looking for light
Out of the dark night of my soul

[Bridge]
I hear the drums of war, they are a changing
And everybody's getting in the groove
We're laughing and dancing and talking and jamming and singing
Oh, we've got nothing but love to prove, so how about you?

[Chorus]
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?
Is everything a-ok in the USA?
In the good ol' USA?

[Outro]
Is everything, everything, is everything, a-ok?
Is everything everything, is everything , a-ok?
