[Verse 1]
Well, I've come to know the look on your face
When you're lyin' about where you've been
Or how much you spent
I know when you will raise your fingers
To your mouth as if to wipe away the shame
It's not a game, I know you feel bad

[Chorus]
If you ask for my forgiveness
If you call my name, I will come
If you ask for my love, I will give you some

[Verse 2]
Someday I know you will understand
Someday you'll finally realize
What you're doin' to yourself

[Chorus]
If you ask for my forgiveness
If you call my name, I will come
If you ask for my love, I will give you some

[Bridge]
We've been dancing to that same old song over and over again
I wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be your policeman
So tonight when you finally make
Your way back to our door
I'll let you sleep it off like I did the night before

[Chorus]
When you ask for my forgiveness
When you call my name, I will come
When you ask for my love, I will give you some

[Outro]
In the morning I will get you up
And I will smile just when you want me to
'Cause I'm, I'm all you have
