[Verse 1: Faith Hill]
You never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

[Verse 2: Faith Hill & (Tim McGraw), Both]
You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as I can tell
Time (time) is leaving us behind (leaving us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Ooh, like we never loved at all

[Bridge: Faith Hill & (Tim McGraw), Both]
Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion? (Passion)
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me?
Oh, oh baby, baby (Oh, baby)

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all
