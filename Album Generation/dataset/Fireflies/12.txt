[Verse 1]
A setting sun that paints a tie-dyed sky
A feather bed, an ancient lullaby
A kiss good night from one whose love is true

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you

[Verse 2]
A field of flowers dancing in the spring
A little creek, a tree, an old rope swing
Cotton candy clouds against the blue
That's the kind of day I wish for you
First love with all its storm
Raging like fire within
Tossing your heart to chance
You swear the dance will never end

[Verse 3]
But then it does and someone says goodbye
And after all those empty nights you cried
The morning that you wake up good as new

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you

[Verse 3]
The faith of knowing deep inside your heart
That heaven holds more than just some stars
Someone's up there watching over you

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you
