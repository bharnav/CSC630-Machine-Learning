Rockers all over the world, re-unite
In love with the feeling that comes with the night
As we talk
Lay off the pills that are left on the shelf
We'll be warped when we stop

I never said I want to be the one who said
I told you so
But you're all a lowly bunch of parasites
And I told my girl that it would be alright
Let me go
On a hilltop in the bustley nights
With a legendary lord I used to like
And there will be tears in our eyes

Make love in our own little van
I am giving you all that I can and I am
Buckle my belt and I roll up the sleeves of my shirt
And I flirt

I never said I want to be the one who said
I told you so
But you're all a lowly bunch of parasites
And I told my girl that it would be alright
Let me go
On a hilltop in the bustley nights
With a legendary lord I used to like
And there will be tears in our eyes

I never said I want to be the one who said
I told you so
But you're all a lowly bunch of parasites
And I told my girl that it would be alright
Let me go
On a hilltop in the bustley nights
With the legendary lords I never liked
And there will be tears in our eyes

Last night you know
An architect saved my life
I knew in my heart
I wouldn't die tonight
Thank you all
I thank you all so very much
You know I never really wanted to be touched
To be touched
To be touched
