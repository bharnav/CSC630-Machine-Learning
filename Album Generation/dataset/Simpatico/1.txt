New York city 7 o'clock
Giving it up for the vintage look
Listening to the radio asking
What's the deal boys
We're into the wild unknown
A freak show
A place we call home

We don't need to educate
We only want to stay up late
Looking for these broken joints
Take in a peepshow?
We need to be told the reason
We're all being sold

New York say what!
I love you, I tell you
There's no need to stop!
There's no need to stop!

Underground counter culture
Eat you up like a hungry vulture
Look at you half alive
Like Dr Jeckal and Mr Hyde
You'll never see what I seen
You do last night

New York say what!
I love you, I tell you
There's no need to stop!
There's no need to stop!
There's no need to

New York City 7 o'clock
Giving it up for the vintage look underground
I love this raps
It's now or never
A reason to live
A reason to die

New York say what!
I love you, I tell you
There's no need to stop
There's no need to stop
There's no need to

We all need to be told
We all need to be told (why)
We all need to be told

James Brown-git down
