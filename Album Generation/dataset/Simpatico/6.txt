For all of us the world is a hound
For all others there's never a frown
To the leaders who try as they might
Dabble dabble here as high as the night

When the lights go out in London
The crowds will disappear
I'll be there for your tomorrows tonight

I look into the eyes of a man in this barren land
I look to my sweet and say quietly
'Hold my hand'

In our hearts we
We know what we like in this battle scene
Please be sweet and be bright

When the lights go out in London
The crown will disappear
I'll be there for your tomorrows tonight

I look into the eyes of a man in this barren land
I look to my sweet and say quietly
'Hold my hand'

For all of us the world is a hound
For all others there's never a frown
To the leaders who try as they might
Hug me to sleep as I die in the night

When the lights go out in London
The crown will disappear
I'll be there for your tomorrows tonight

I look into the eyes of a man in this barren land
I look to my sweet and say quietly
'Hold my hand'

Take my hand now
Take my hand now
Take my hand now
In this barren land
