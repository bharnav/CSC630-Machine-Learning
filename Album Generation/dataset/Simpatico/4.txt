Lovers in the city
There is no need to fight
I don't offer a solution
Just call it paradise

Oh! It's burning burning love
In the city of the dead

Always a bed out west in Cali
But I need to survive
On the path to find the glory
In dangerous times

Oh! It's burning burning up
In the city of the dead

There's a fortune in this city
Jealousy and lies
Keep searching for the loved ones
No question what I like

Oh! It's burning burning love
In the city of the dead
