A Charlatan I
Noble and wild
Hustlin' for tricks to help you feel loved
And we all need a shoulder to cry on.... once in a while
And there won't be a dry eye
In the house tonight

Blackened blue eyes
I don't care too much for your
Circumstances or you
Situation wise

A Charlatan I
Will blossom and die
One day you'll find a real need for love
Or you live with the fear for
The rest of your life
And there won't be a dry eye
In the house tonight

Blackened blue eyes
I don't care too much for your
Circumstances or you
Situation wise

The one thing I hate
The numb and the fake
The gutless who rape
The jaws of a snake
We all need a best friend
We can trust with our lives till the end
And there won't be a dry eye
In the house tonight

Blackened blue eyes
I don't care too much for second chances
Blackened blue eyes
I don't care too much for final chances
Ride out into a world of random prostitutes
I'll show you some fantastic scenes
And it will be alright

Blackened blue eyes
Blackened blue eyes
Blackened blue eyes
