I sit on the muddy ground, the muddy ground
Waiting for you
I sit on the muddy ground, the muddy ground
Waiting for you
I sit on the muddy ground, the muddy ground
Waiting for you
You say look what you found on the muddy ground
Was waiting for you

I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for
I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for

I watch the money burn, and in return
I'm left here with you
You say look what I found on the money ground
Was left here by you
I sit on the muddy ground, the muddy ground
You sit on the money ground, the money ground

I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for
I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for

All the luckless fellas, who deserve a medal
Look into life through the bottom of a glass

I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for
I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for
I'm still waiting for you, still waiting for
I'm still waiting for you
