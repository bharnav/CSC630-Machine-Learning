You, you love to use the word love all the time
And it scares me
Im not sure why
Through a phone is no way to love you
You dont seem to mind
I wish my eyes and my mind will decide that im alive
So i could hear my heart tell me how i feel
You, you love to use the word love all the time
And it scares me
Im not sure why
Through a phone is no way to love you
You dont seem to mind
