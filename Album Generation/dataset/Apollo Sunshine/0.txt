Now I am on the other side of the world now
Don't know how I got here and I don't know my way
Home..but something flipped...and now I'm on the
Other side of the world now, it's so much HOTTER
And BRIGHTER and the sun seems so much
YOUNGER. Maybe the ice caps are melting
I think I can feel that as much
As the earth that's sinking below
Me. Everything will carry on
Without me, whatever the hell
That means...
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
I'm scared now, so I go up and sit on
A mountains edge, and ask the stars and
The sky and the sand what I should do...
And they'll say, "keep breathing"
And you already know how to do that
KEEP BREATHING KEEP BREATHING
KEEP BREATHING it's all you can do! cause
Something FLIPPED, and now we're on the
Other side of the world now. I don't where I
Am, I don't know what to do, I don't know
What is going on...but deep in my heart
I do believe, that home is where the heart is...
