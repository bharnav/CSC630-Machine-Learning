When you come on wasted wheels
You don't know which way is home
When you've lost your place to be
You can feel it in your BONES
When I feel the breeze through me
I don't know if I'm a GHOST
So I try to sing something
Like I'm feeling in my BONES
Is it just me or is it everybody else?
It must be everyone to some degree
Yes, I see myself in everybody else
And maybe they can
See themselves in me
