Don't leave me, Lord, if you're really in there
They built you up, built you so big
So big I can't tell what's imagined just a good idea, gone bad
But I LOVE YOU, LORD, for all this
And it's a shame the way they've made you out how they made you
They made you some pissed off man
A whole lot of pissed off men made YOU
Don't leave me, Lord, if you're really in there
