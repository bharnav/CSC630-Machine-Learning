Magnolia, magnolia
Your white flowers glow
Those cones filled with red seeds
They come and they go

Oh, moss tree, oh, moss tree
Filled my wagon so
Made wigs and beards
Like someday I'd grow...
And Ohhhh

Oh, rosebush, oh, rosebush

My grandaddy's work
Been dug up...thrown out
Just weeds on the dirt

BACK HERE AFTER YEARS

Once brought home a WOMAN
Now she's sent me back
Just here for a visit
Won't even unpack

Til Dad says, oh, Dad says
"let's throw 'round the ball."
I'd love just to chat, Dad
This glove is too small...and ohh

So each time, oh, each time
That I come back home
Feels more like my folks' house
And I'm more alone

BACK HERE AFTER YEARS
