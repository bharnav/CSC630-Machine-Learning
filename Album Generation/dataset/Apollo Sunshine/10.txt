Go to bed, you've thought too much for one day, gotten mostly
Nowhere. Go to bed, the world is too much for one day, so start

It over. Start your car, go wherever you're going to go, but know
That it is nowhere. Fall in love, you've wanted to for so long
It's time to get that over with. Go to bed with someone you'd like
To go to bed with, and see what happens. Thank you for this
Beautiful new day, it's forever. Today is our day to go nowhere.....
