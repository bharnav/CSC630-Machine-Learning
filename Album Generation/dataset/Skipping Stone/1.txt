Can't stay with you, but I'll miss you
Soles on fire, I can't see through
All the smokey, smoking higher
And I don't know what to do

See the shadow, it stays beside me
In my dreams, it never likes me
Oh, it's a long road that I've created
I've got it under control

So why am I walking?
And this I don't know
Why I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere to go

Sand pulls quicker, sinks me deeper
I like the feeling, I let it linger
Where's my education? What was I thinking
Been lying to myself all along
And I knew I was wrong
I could tell in your eyes the love is gone
And I know I can't fix what I have done
So I keep walking until I'm done

And why am I walking?
And this I don't know
Why I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere to go

But I'll do this alone, and every tear I know is mine
And I will feel it in my bones, I'll be okay, just let me hide
Patterns change, just like the tide

And why am I walking?
And this I don't know
And I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere, got nowhere, to go

And why am I talking? When I have nothing to say
My head is a mess, and I'm not finding my way

But I can't stay with you, but I'll miss you
Soles on fire, I can't see through
All the smokey, smoking higher
My feet won't bring me to you
