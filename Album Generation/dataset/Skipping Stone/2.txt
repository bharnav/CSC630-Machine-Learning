Night life got my arms real good
Holding me the way you should
I'm praying this can start real soon
To wake beside you in the afternoon

Moonlight, lighting my way
But gone before you thought I'd stay
Right beneath your ray of warm
You stay beside me til the frozen morn

Angels guide my step
You keep my eyelids from getting wet
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
Strangers blocking my view
You haven't seen what this girl can do
I'm pleased to meet you, I can see your sweat
I see you shiver and my heart is set

But hold on, it isn't over here
The sun isn't awake my dear
We're feeling higher than a rocket ship
I push it over when I dip my hip

Homey, I wanna hit your drum
Gimme some of that sweet, just some
You got me still with a sigh and high
Another night I'd like for getting by

Angels guide my step
You keep my eyelids from getting wet
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
Strangers blocking my view
You haven't seen what this girl can do
I'm pleased to meet you, I can see your sweat
I see you shiver and my heart is set

Angels guide my step
You keep my eyelids from getting wet
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
I'm pleased to meet you, I could swear we've met
Strangers blocking my view
You haven't seen what this girl can do
I'm pleased to meet you, I can see your sweat
I see you shiver and my heart is set
