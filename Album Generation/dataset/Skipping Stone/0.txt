Champagne
I'm breaking every single chain
Insane
I'm watching all my colors change

I wait for your call
I can feel it in my bra
You're burning down my walls
Not scared to lose it all
When I kiss your lips
We're touching fingertips
My stomach starts to flip
I'm ignited, this is it

Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out
Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out

Too late, to even try to walk away
Goodness sake
I walk the line
Won't hesitate

And I hope I've got
My panties in a knot
Yeah I'm into what you've got
I can't fight it, it's too hot
When it gets too much
I'm melting in your touch
I'll be welcoming the rush
Can't deny it this is love

Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out
Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out

Just like Johnny and June
They wrote their name on the moon
Not a moment too soon but yet they step out in bloom
Just like Johnny and June
They wrote their name on the moon
Not a moment too soon but yet they step out in bloom
Just like Johnny and June
They wrote their name on the moon
Not a moment too soon but yet they step out in bloom

Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out
Give me fire, give me fire
Coming out, it's coming out
