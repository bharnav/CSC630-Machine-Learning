I took in the most that I could
I never imagined that I would be feeling so misunderstood
I'm just following lines
You race in my mind like a car
You've beaten my heart so damn farther
And now I've been pacing the wall
You're under my hood

Never thought I could love you no never
Never thought that I would
Ever try to be anything better

My heart's beating better alone
And if it is broke why let you know?
This heart's not your skipping stone
If I'm sinking water than why even bother
Just leave it alone
This heart's not your skipping stone

So maybe I should settle down
Find a new man let him throw my whole world around
All his blueberry lies
I know there isn't a rule
Was left in the dust never was taught in school
I'm a lovesick fool
Never knew that you could just hold me hostage
I'm losing my cool
Through the pain somehow don't want you to stop it

My heart's beating better alone
And if it is broke why let you know?
This heart's not your skipping stone
If I'm sinking water than why even bother
Leave it alone
This hearts not your skipping stone

All the time
I never let you in
Was a lie
I wasn't letting you win
And all the days
You let me cry
Was a lie

My heart's beating better alone
And if it is broke why let you know?
This heart's not your skipping stone
If I'm sinking water why even bother
Just leave it alone
And if it is broke why let you know?
This heart's not your skipping stone
If I'm sinking water why even bother?
Just leave me alone
This heart's not your skipping stone
