Broke in my heart and took my gold
And after all that I've been told
The horror stories that I read
While mom was putting me to bed

I put a lock on every door
He wants to get inside I'm sure
He's only there to mess around
And be the talking of the town

[Chorus:]
A thief, tearing my whole world down
A thief, turning my whole world around

I know I've failed every test
He knew which button he could press
Now my heart it beats out of my chest
It's never getting any rest

I didn't want him to see me cry
But every word became a lie
Ooh and only he can read my mind
His every touch is like a crime

[Chorus:]
A thief, tearing my whole world down
A thief, turning my whole world around

So tell me what am I to do (you better watch out)
And tell me who to talk too (better keep it on the down-low)
'Cause I really wanna quit loving you (it won't matter)
So why am I taking you in to letting you still break in

[Chorus:]
A thief, tearing my whole world down
A thief, turning my whole world around

A thief (hey)
A thief turning my whole world around
