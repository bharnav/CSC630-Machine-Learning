As I look over this beautiful land, I can't help but realize that I am alone
Why am I able to waste my energy to notice life being so beautiful?
Maybe partying will help...

And what of the people who don't have what I ain't got?
Are they victims of my leisure?
To fail is to be a victim, to be a victim of my choice
Maybe partying will help...
