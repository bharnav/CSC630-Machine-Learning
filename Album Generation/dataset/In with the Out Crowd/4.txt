[Verse 1]
Rescue me from boring times
It's a story I know line by line
Different deep on the inside
Isn't different if you have to try

[Chorus]
I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again

[Verse 2]
The measurements of my success
Are always measured in not making sense
My motivation's taking bets
It's apologies or arguments
With a head full of cans and can'ts
(Head full of cans and can'ts)

[Pre-Chorus]
I try and try and try to remember
Why I think it's now or it's never

[Chorus]
I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again
Knocked off my feet again

[Pre-Chorus]
I try and try and try to remember
Why I think it's now or it's never

[Chorus]
I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again

I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again
Knocked to my knees again
