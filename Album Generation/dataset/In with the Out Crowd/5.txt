[Verse 1]
I could hear all the plans we had when the wind hits me just right
I'm so sick of wanting all the things I'm haunted by
My sympathy goes to the oldest joke that's survived another year
I wonder where I'm going from, where I'm at, and I wonder why I'm still here

[Pre-Chorus]
The writing on the subway wall
Reminds me that your words don't console me anymore
While I'm lying wide awake on this bedroom floor

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime

[Verse 2]
Local papers always opened up to obituaries and engagements
'Cause I keep track of all the fresh starts and the dying famous
There's a halo of second-hand smoke underneath the summer stars
Along with conversations we had on the subway car

[Pre-Chorus]
The writing on the subway wall
Reminds me that your words don't console me anymore
While I'm lying wide awake on this bedroom floor

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime

[Bridge]
Remember when
When you said
You said take these words, do what you want with them

[Pre-Chorus]
The writing on the subway wall
Reminds me that your words don't console me anymore
While I'm lying wide awake on this bedroom floor

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one, I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime
