[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm jaded and bored
Always looking for more
Wait around for the next big fix
I know I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
But I couldn't care less
Don't know what it would take to change me

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's so afraid to be different
Please excuse me now if I don't get it

[Chorus]
I think sex is overrated
So is always getting wasted
Designer drugs and dead end jobs
And classic rock is so outdated
I'm so sick of therapy
And all the things it's done to me
How can I be satisfied?
When everything is overrated

[Verse 2]
Maybe the problem is me
But I won't make believe
And I can't take this mediocrity
What if this is a test?
And I deserve what I get?
Will I wake up with all the answers?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's too afraid to be different
Please excuse me now if I don't listen

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
When everything is overrated
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
When everything is overrated

[Verse 3]
Can't stand the normal
Can't stand the ordinary
Find me anything that's extraordinary
Show me something
Show me anything
Am I the only one?
Am I the only one?

[Chorus]
I think sex is overrated
So is always getting wasted
All my friends and family
They make my life so complicated
I'm so sick of apathy and TV show reality
How can I be satisfied?
When everything is overrated

[Bridge]
