[Verse]
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves

[Chorus]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, In waves)
Do I take everybody else down? (everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?

[Verse]
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves

[Chorus]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, In waves)
Do I take everybody else down? (everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
(In waves, In waves)
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(what's the purpose?!)
Pulling everyone down with me

[Verse 2]
Perpetually
Perpetually we're igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
Incessantly
Incessantly we're sinking in flames (flames)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Perpetually
Perpetually we're igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
Incessantly
Incessantly we're sinking in flames (flames)

[Verse]
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves
In Waves

[Bridge]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
Do I take everybody else down? (down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?!)
Pulling everyone down with me (me)

[Chorus]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down? (everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
(In waves, in waves)
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?!)
Pulling everyone down with me

[Outro]
Pulling everyone down with me
(In waves)
Pulling everyone down with me
