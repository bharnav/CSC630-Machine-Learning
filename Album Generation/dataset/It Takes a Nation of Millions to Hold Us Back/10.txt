[Intro]
Have you forgotten that once we were brought here, we were robbed of our name, robbed of our language. We lost our religion, our culture, our god...and many of us, by the way we act, we even lost our minds

[Verse 1 - Chuck D]
Here it is, BAM!
And you say "Goddamn, this is the dope jam"
But let's define the term called dope
And you think it mean funky now, no
Here is a true tale
Of the ones that deal, are the ones that fail
Yeah, you can move if you wanna move
What it prove? It's here like the groove
The problem is this, we gotta' fix it
Check out the justice, and how they run it
Selling, smelling, sniffing, riffing
And brothers try to get swift and
Sell their own, rob a home
While some shrivel to bone
Like comatose walking around
Please don't confuse this with the sound
I'm talking about

[Scratching]
"Base!"
"One, two, three, four, five, six"
"Kick it!"
"Years ago"

[Verse 2]
I put this together to rock the bells of those that boost the dose
Of lack a lack, and those that sell to Black
Shame on a brother when he dealing
The same block where my 98 be wheeling
And everybody know another kilo
From a corner from a brother to keep another below
Stop illing and killing, stop grilling
Yo, black, yo (we are willing)
4, 5 o'clock in the morning
Wait a minute y'all, the fiends are fiending
Day to day they say no other way
This stuff... is really bad
I'm talking 'bout...BASE

[Verse 3]
Yo, listen
I see it on their faces
(First come, first serve basis)
Standing in line, checking the time
Homeboys playing the curb, the same ones that used to do herb
Now they're gone, passing it on
Poison attack - the Black word bond
My man Daddy-O once said to me
He knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep
And at night he went to sleep
And in the morning all he had was the sneakers on his feet
The culprit used to jam and rock the mike, yo
He stripped the Jeep to fill his pipe
And wander around to find a place
Where they rocked to a different kind of...BASE

[Professor Griff]
Succotash is a means for kids to make cash
Selling drugs to the brother man instead of the other man

[Chuck D]
I'm talking 'bout...BASE
