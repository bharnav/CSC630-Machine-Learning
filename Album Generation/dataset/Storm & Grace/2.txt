[Verse 1:]
So uneasy, lay your head
On those weary shoulders
I wanted to unburden them
But you wouldn’t let go

Too dirty to clean your hands
Too weary for sober
I was your prescription then
But the bottle ran out

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me now
While you sort it out
Don’t get hung up here
Let’s forgive each other
You can move on, dear
You can move on, dear

[Verse 2:]
Too toxic for a cleanse
Too many sins for confession
I would've been your Priestess
But I tripped on my robe

Now all the honey’s in a hornet’s nest
And all the spiders, they spin their webs
Of all the colors that you knew they had
But you wanted to ignore

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me now
While you sort it out
Don’t get hung up here
I will always love you
You can move on, dear

You can move on, dear
You can move on, dear
You can move on, dear
