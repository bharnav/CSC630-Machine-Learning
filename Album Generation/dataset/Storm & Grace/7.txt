[Verse 1:]
It's been a long highway
Where do I get off
And drive away

I'm looking for a sign that should say
When you've had enough
Exit this way

If only I were a gopher now
I'd dig a hole
And not come out

[Chorus:]
And on the forecast for today
A storm of nails headed your way
Man, it’s gonna rain, rain, rain

And on my forehead does it say
Unleash all hounds of hell this way
Bite until she’s lame, lame, lame

[Verse 2:]
Too much on my plate
How much will it take
Before it breaks

I’m looking for a sign that should say
When you get fed up
Throw it this way

If only I were a cat
Right now, meow
I‘d lick a claw
And go lay back down

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
What is it now, oh you don’t say
Better get the hammer out today
What is it now, oh you don’t say

[Repeat Chorus:]
