[Verse 1:]
I have to wonder
What the hell I ever did to deserve this
Is it just me or most people a drag
And dishonest

[Chorus:]
I own up
I try
What am I not doing right
But shit it keeps on coming

I’ve got run over by my own parade
I’ve suffocated
In the beds I’ve made

I’ve cut my feet
On all the glass that I break
Still trying to find a way
To get what’s broken
To un-break

[Verse 2:]
Somewhere along the line
I must have been a backstabbing liar
Maybe in another life
I was a snake or vampire

[Chorus:]
I own up
I try
What am I not doing right

But shit
It keeps on coming
Maybe I should change my plumbing

I’ve got run over by my own parade
I’ve suffocated in the beds
I’ve made

I’ve cut my feet
On all the glass that I break
Still trying to find a way
To get what’s broken
To un-break

I own up
I try
What am I not doing right

But shit it keeps on coming
Maybe I'm just missing something
I’ve got run over by my own parade

I’ve suffocated in the beds I’ve made
I’ve cut my feet
On all the glass that I break
Still trying to find a way
To get what’s broken
To un-break
