[Verse 1:]
You are the most beautiful man
That I’ve ever known
Too much to offer
And too much held close to the bone

Just step on the breaks there
You got what it takes

[Chorus:]
You blow me away, yeah
Your storm and your grace
My heart can’t seem to take it
Your storm and your grace

[Verse 2:]
You have the most beautiful heart
That I’ve ever known
It kills me you can’t ever show it
And a shell has been grown

Stop moving so fast there
And then
Take your foot off the gas

[Repeat Chorus:]
You blow me away
Your storm and your grace
My heart can’t seem to take it
Your storm and your grace

You blow me away
Your storm and your grace
