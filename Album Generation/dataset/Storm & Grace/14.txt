[Verse 1:]
So crucified
And a self inflicted mess
And for the life of me
I couldn't remember
When you weren't a regret

[Chorus:]
Were you here last night
We fell in love again
Was it just a dream
I've never been that high
As when we fell in love
That was not a dream

[Verse 2:]
Un-crucified
You came to visit
And for the life of me
I, I could remember
That you were not a regret

{Chorus:]
Were you here last night
We fell in love again
Was it just a dream
I've never been that high
As when we fell in love
That was not dream

[Outro:]
Donâ€™t want to open my eyes
When we fall in love
If it's just a dream
