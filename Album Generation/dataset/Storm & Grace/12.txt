That girl I’ve seen her
I don’t care for her at all
She got a silver spoon
And attitude
She got a wall
Why does she do this
Why is she doing that
She never smiles
It’s all her fault
That everything went bad

[Chorus]
You can take my place
You’d do it better anyway
But you better hide your bones
From all the sticks and stones
So they don’t break
Too bad
She ain’t just like her daddy
Oh what a shame
She’s got no talent of her own
It’s just her name
She looks bad
She looks mad
Why is she saying that
Why is she so angry and so mean
I just don’t understand

[Chorus]
