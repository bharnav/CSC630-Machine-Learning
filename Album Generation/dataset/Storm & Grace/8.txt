[Verse 1:]
There should be an answer
For all of this, my friend
All your doubts and questions are so appropriate

Like can you live
Can you feel
Should you stay

I strain, for words
I just can’t say
For words
I just can’t say

[Chorus:]
If I could write a letter with
The perfect thing to say
I’d give a damn good reason
I’d assure you it’s okay

And that you can live
That you can feel
That you can stay
I wouldn’t strain for words
I just can’t say
For words
I just can’t say

How do you fly this plane
How do you fly this plane

[Verse 2:]
Can it be it will get better
And weigh less on your mind
Will you be okay

Will you one day find
That you can live
That you can stay
Words I just can’t say
Words I just can’t say

[Chorus:]
If words could make it better
I’d say them everyday
I’d flash bright lights upon them
And neon lights that say

You can live
You will be okay
That you should stay
I wouldn’t strain for words
I just can’t say
For words I just can’t say

You can fly this plane
You can fly this plane
You can fly this plane
