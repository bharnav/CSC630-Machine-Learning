[Verse 1:]
I watch you in the morning
But you would never know
I watch you like a satellite
But I let you go
I will be watching you
I know you’re watching too

A whisper in the hallway
Corners of my mind
I hear you out there whispering
But you can’t hear the signs
I hear you whispering
I hope your listening

[Chorus:]
I’m heartless
I’m heartless
I’m heartless again

[Verse 2:]
I wish I’d been a runner
So I could run from you
I made a million wishes
But none of them came true
I keep on wishing you
Keep on wishing too

I wait for a resolution
But it will never come
I want to wake up free of you
Not knowing where you have gone
But I won’t let you through

[Repeat Chorus:]

I’m heartless

[Bridge:]
Oh, nail it to your heartbeat
Nail it to your soul
Oh, blame it on the surface
You don’t need to know

[Repeat Chorus:]

I’m heartless
I’m heartless
I’m heartless again
