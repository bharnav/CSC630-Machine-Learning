[Verse 1:]
There was once a light inside of me
But lately I see
It’s dimmed out slowly

And I fight, I kick
I yell, I scream
That what is happening
Well, it can’t be really
And as I go along

I’m finding the ground below
You can get ripped out
From under your feet
The light around you
Turned out blinding
The darkness is a more honest place to be

[Chorus:]
And I want to find in me
That I can still believe
And be forgiving
Yes, I want to be like you
Can you teach me how to be forgiving?

[Verse 2:]
There was once a friend inside of me
But lately I see
There is an enemy

I fight, I kick
I yell, I scream
What is happening
But no one hears me
And I go along finding

The friends I thought I had
They weren’t good friends at all
No, I don’t really need reminding
I’m much too jaded and much to cynical

[Chorus:]
Yes, I want to find in me
That I can still believe
And be forgiving
And I want to be like you
Can you teach me how to be forgiving?
