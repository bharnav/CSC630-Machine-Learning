[Verse 1:]
I’ve seen her face
It's okay, it ain’t nothing great
Yeah, she’s cool in a
Gap-toothed hippy chick way

I’ve seen the way you and she
You put on a play
And how she plays the
Part much better than I played

[Chorus:]
Can it be you're over me
She took my place, she saved the day
Hard to see you're over me
When she took my place she
Saved the day

[Verse 2:]
I’ve seen that she
She likes to eat whatever you make
And how well she can
Bake that cake I wouldn’t bake
What a breath of fresh air she is in my wake

[Chorus:]
Can it be you're over me
She took my place, she saved the day
Hard to see you're over me
When she took my place she
Saved the day

[Bridge:]
You hope there’s no bad blood
You want to be my friend
To say hi now and then

You know there’s very bad blood
And I was never your friend
To say hi

[Chorus:]
Can it be you're over me
She took my place, she saved the day
It's hard to see you're over me
When she took my place she
Saved the day
