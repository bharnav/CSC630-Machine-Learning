[Verse 1:]
There there
Hey now
What’s this I’m hearing about

The butterfly flew into the ground
One too many nets around
And you go to him like a mosquito to skin

[Chorus:]
I see you wanna be so close to the edge
And you’re running
You’re running
You’re running without your feet

You believe there’s a ground
If you step over
And you fall down
But there may not be

[Verse 2:]
There there
Hey, now
What’s that you're talking about

Your cup runneth over and out
One too many cups around
And you’re a mess
You wanna confess

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I wish there was something
So profound that I could say
You know it’s bad for you
But you still want to do it anyway
And you go to him like a mosquito to skin

[Repeat Chorus:]
