[Verse 1:]
When the well has no water to hold
And the wheels start to run off the road
Where do we go?

When we bury the embers that glow
And the seeds that we planted won’t grow
Like we were told

[Chorus:]
Hey man
What in the hell do we know
We strike out
And then we strike gold

Whoever is running the show
There’s one thing
That I need to know
Could you soften the blows

[Verse 2:]
When a bold man’s afraid to be bold
And a fish finds the water too cold
Where does he go?

When the liar finds truth must be told
And the loner hates being alone
Who does he hold

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Never turn your back on the ocean
And never talk back
Don’t make those funny faces
Your face could stick like that

[Repeat Chorus:]
