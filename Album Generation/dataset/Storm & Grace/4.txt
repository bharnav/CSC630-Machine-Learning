[Verse 1:]
This here is a city without lies
Those are all the people without eyes
Churches they don't have a soul
Soup for sale without a bowl
Religion so corrupt and running lives

[Chorus:]
Farewell, fair weathered friends
I can't say I'll miss you in the end
So long
Seems that I was so wrong
Seems I wasn't that strong

Dead wrong
And now I'm long gone
Wrong side
I've been sleepin' on the wrong side

Stains all over my soul
I can't hide
Nothing's more clearer than goodbye

[Verse 2:]
These roads they don't lead to anything
These people they talk
They say nothing

Actors they don't have a part
Heartfelt people with no heart
I'll find a new crowd, make a new start

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen
Say nothing at all
If you've nothing nice to say

[Repeat Chorus:]
