[Verse 1:]
Lay down the law
Don't make a sound
Just critical
Just going down

I don't belong
I've lost the plot
Not gullible
Can't be what I'm not

[Chorus:]
You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet
If I don't get with your system, then I'm sure to fail
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Verse 2:]
Lay down the truth
Don't make a sound
Just a piece of fruit
Who's hit the ground

I don't respond
I've lost the plot
Unethical
Not what I thought

[Chorus:]
You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet
I'm a bit transgressive and suppressive as well
You ain't seen nothin' yet

[Bridge:]
Am I a disruption to your corruption?
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Chorus:]
You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet
If I don't get with your system, then I'm sure to fail
You ain't seen nothin' yet

[Bridge:]
No longer elated and you're frustrated
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Chorus:]
You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet
If I don't get with your system, then I'm sure to fail
You ain't seen nothin' yet

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet
I'm a bit transgressive and suppressive as well
You ain't seen nothin' yet
