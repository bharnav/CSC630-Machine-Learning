[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige (Beyoncé)]
A woman, she needs more than material things
And a woman needs so much more that what a man can say
(A woman, needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
A real woman needs a real man that don't talk about it
Be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance)

[Hook]

Well, I think it's still some things you need to know

[Verse 2: Beyoncé (Mary J. Blige)]
A woman, she likes to talk and work it out
And a woman likes for you to watch her back
Protect her crown
(A woman don't only want your make-up sex
She wants your respect
And a real woman never wanna walk into a room
See another woman knowing information
She don't even know about her man)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (Mary J. Blige)]
Make your way home at a decent hour every night
(Pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her that she's still beautiful in your eyes
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries, ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize)

[Bridge: Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige]
Gotta swallow your pride
Got some making up to do, gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take you time
I said kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, say it one more time
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
Don't want a minute man
We wanna have fun until she finish man
If that's asking to much
You'll never know how to really
Love a woman

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh
You think you know how to love a woman?
Ohh no...no
