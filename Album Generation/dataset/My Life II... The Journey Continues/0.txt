Eh yo Mary, I need you to vibe wit me on this one, uh
Uh

[Missy Elliot]
Check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God I'm hot as the water like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall im too hard to brake
OK I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah baby girl I've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher I gotta, like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a preist with a back slider
I've sinned ut I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again

[Mary J. Blige]
What you hear is not a test, I'm rocking to the beat [Repeat: x2]
See me and my crew, and my friends were gonna try to move our feet
See I am Mary Blige and I'll like to say hello
To the black to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
First you gotta
First you gotta
