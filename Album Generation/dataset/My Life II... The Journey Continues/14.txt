[Instrument break]
[Verse 1]
It's gonna be a long long journey
It's gonna be an uphill climb
It's gonna be a tough fight
There's gonna be some lonely nights
But I'm ready to carry on
I’m so glad the worst is over
(Cuz it almost took me out)
I can start living now
Ooh, I feel like I can do anything
And finally I'm not afraid to breathe
[Chorus]
Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can’t deny the truth
Cuz I’m the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, oh
I’m the living proof
Oh, yes I am
[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout life's been painful
(Yes it was)
Took awhile to learn how to smile
So now I’m gonna talk to my people, oh oh
About the storm, oh
About the storm, oh
So glad the worst is over
(Cuz it's all beneath me now)
I can start flying now, oh ho
My best days are right in front of me
Yet I’m almost there
Cuz now I’m free, oh
[Chorus]
Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can’t deny the truth
Cuz I’m the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, oh
I’m the living proof
[Verse 3]
I know where I’m going, oh
Cuz I know where I’ve been, oh oh
I got a few stars that's showin'
(Hey)
I’mma stay strong keep going
That’s the way that I’ll win
[Chorus]
Anything you say to me
And everything you do
(Everything you do)
You can’t deny the truth
Cuz I'm the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, yeah
I’m the living proof
[Verse 4]
Nothing ‘bout my life’s been easy
But nothing’s gonna keep me down, no, down, no
Cuz I know a lot more today
And I know yesterday
So I’m ready to carry on
