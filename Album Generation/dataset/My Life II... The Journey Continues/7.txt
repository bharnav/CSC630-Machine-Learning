Hey
Woah
Hey
Woah

Can't even hide it, its written on my face
And I don't have any more time or energy to waste
So I'm waving my white flag
Sad it has to be like that
It ain't working out baby in another life or space

Oh I, baby, I gave you, ooh
Everything that I could give you
So I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission

Now I'm in no condition
To love you (no more)
Now I'm in no condition
Hey, woah
Hey (said I'm waving my white flag)
Woah sad it has to be like that

Barely any happy days
We always seem to have drama (too much drama)
And it's really weighing heavy on me baby
Both of us acting crazy I hate it when we fight

Middle of the night
Always seems to remind me
Love, how much it hurts
To know it's getting worse
My faith in us is slowly dying

Oh I, baby, I gave you, ooh
Everything that I could give you
So I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission

Now I'm in no condition
To love you (no more)
I'm in no condition

Hey (hey)
Woah
Hey
Woah

Hey (I'm in no condition to love)
Woah (I'm in no condition to love)
Hey (I'm in no condition to love)
Woah (no condition), damn

How did you go from being my best friend
To me barely even wanting your affection
I never would've thought (hey)
That I would be (inaudible)
Oh, oh

Hold me down (hey)
Hold me down (oh)
Yeah you hold me down
Even though it's sad to say it's over now
I can't love you under these conditions

Oh I, baby, I gave you, ooh
Everything that I could give you
So I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission

So I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission

Now I'm in no condition
To love you (no more)
I'm in no condition
Hey (I'm in no condition to love, no)

Woah (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Hey (I'm in no condition to love you)
Woah (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Hey (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Woah (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Hey (I'm in no condition to love, you)
Woah (I'm in no condition to love, no)

I'm in no condition to love (no condition baby)
I'm in no condition to love, no
I'm in no condition to love you (hey), no
