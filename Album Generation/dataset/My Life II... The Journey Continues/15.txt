I heard them all
All them lies
Lost count round and round a thousand times but here it comes another lie... Whoa oh whoa ohhh..
U lost ur phone
It slipped ur mind
Promise the last time was the last time
Already know what u are for say so say this... Don't wish ur breathe

Miss me with that
The only part of u I wanna see is ur back
Miss me with that
Save it for the last one...
I just got over one
You better ask somebody about me...I know just what u'll ask for say so
Saaaay this
Miss me with that

Are u hearing me??
Look in my eyes
I ain't gat any energy anymore... To fight no
I'm over this
This waste of time

Whoa oh whoa ohhh
Ur car broke down
U are working late
Or Maybe today is just ..... day
Already know wat u'll for say so.. say this
Don't wish ur breathe

Miss me with that
The only part of u I wanna see is ur back
Miss me with that
Save it for the last one...
I just got over one
You better ask somebody about me...I know just what u'll ask for say so
Saaaay this
Miss me with that

I bet
But I'm shaking my hand like this
Don't know why but I still love u
Wanna trust u
But I can't
So I'll be what u are about to say.. Boy

Miss me with that
The only part of u I wanna see is ur back
Miss me with that
Save it for the last one...
I just got over one
You better ask somebody about me...I know just what u'll ask for say so
Saaaay this
Miss me with that
