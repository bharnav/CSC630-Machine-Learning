[Verse 1]
From where you stand
There's no way to change it
No way to make it make sense
And it's lonely there
There in the spotlight
Well, honey, don't I understand?

[Chorus]
But you
You need someone to love you
You need someone to hold you...tonight
Someone to love you, someone to love you
Someone to love you, someone to love you

[Verse 2]
When you look at me
Try hard to hide it
Try hard to keep it all in
Well I found you out
Discovered your secrets
Well, honey, it ain't a sin

[Chorus]
But you
You need someone to love you
You need someone to hold you...tonight
Someone to love you, someone to love you
Someone to love you, someone to love you

[Bridge]
Ohh, yeah
It doesn't have to be me
Who

[Chorus]
But you
You need some one to love you
You need someone to tell you
That everything is alright
Someone to love you
Someone to love you
Someone to love you
