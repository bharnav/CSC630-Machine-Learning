Yeah, on the path to find out whose true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you, feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge
And critics people that wanna see you fail
And tell you what you can do, shouldn't do, must do
And when you got that glow
Nobody's else words can really budge you
Haha
Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win
Sometimes it sound like (gun shot), It's what it coulda been
And when you get to the gates of heaven they probably wouldn't let you in
Haha
But to change that meaning of it success is what it is in the end
And instead of worrying about what it should of, could of, or would it been
You turn you head towards the future and keep it moviiin, knowwhatI'm sayin?
(Well say it again)
Keep it moviiiin, knowwhatI'm sayin?
Screw it then
KnooowwhatI'm sayiiiin?


If you waitiiiiin for me to faiiiil
Your time is running out on that clooooock (on the cloooock)
I'm runniiiiiiin to the finish yeeeeeaaahh
When I get there I ain't gonna stooooooop (gonna stoooop)
Success iiiiiiisssss what I couldn't haaaavve
But now I tell them look what I goooooott
