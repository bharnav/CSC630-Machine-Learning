[Verse 1]
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

[Chorus 1]
When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart

[Verse 2]
Though heavily we bled
Still, on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck, I heard her call
And she sang

[Chorus 2]
When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still, you never hit the mark, oh-oh
And even in your rains and shadows
Still, we're never gonna part, oh-oh
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart

[Hook]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don’t let it break your heart
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don’t let it break your heart

[Outro]
Don't let it break your heart
