[Verse 1]
So it's over
This time, I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

[Verse 2]
So it's over
This time, you're flying on
This time, I know no song
Can't stop its lonely burn
Can't stop it slowly going

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

[Outro]
Can we pour some water on?
