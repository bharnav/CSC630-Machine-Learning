[Verse 1]
The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again, I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

[Chorus 1]
The sky is blue
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then, I'm up with the birds

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

[Chorus 2]
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
