[Verse 1]
Somewhere inside
It's still obscured
Darkness reflects
Stronger than fear

[Pre-Chorus]
I seize control to inhale this final day
I shut my mind but I'm falling anyway

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no
And I think that I'm all alone
I can feel the rain pull me down again
No, no, no, no
And I know that I have no home
I can feel the pain take a hold again

[Verse 2]
Tied to the ground
In mounting shade
My soul is bound
And so it fades

[Pre-Chorus]
I seize control to inhale this final day
I shut my mind but I'm falling anyway

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no
And I think that I'm all alone
I can feel the rain pull me down again
No, no, no, no
And I know that I have no home
I can feel the pain take a hold again

[Verse 2]
Tied to the ground
In mounting shade
My soul is bound
And so it fades (x2)

[Bridge]
And I know that I won't escape
My remaining faith is draped
Like my hurt and my fleeting grace
In this numbing empty space

[Chorus] [x3]
No, no, no, no
And I think that I'm all alone
I can feel the rain pull me down again
No, no, no, no
And I know that I have no home
I can feel the pain take a hold again
