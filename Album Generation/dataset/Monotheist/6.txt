Within these darkest walls
As I write these lines
In this domain of decay
Words fall on the soil beneath
Enfold, embrace, besiege, swathe
My domain
My domain
My domain
My domain

Within these darkest walls
How can I be human?
They say they are blind
Smearing ashes across glass
Enfold, embrace, besiege, swathe
My domain
My domain
My domain
My domain

In this forest of harbored thoughts
There's demons in my mind
And I entrust myself to the lure
Of leaving this existence behind

Enfold my domain
Besiege my domain
Enfold my domain
Besiege my domain
