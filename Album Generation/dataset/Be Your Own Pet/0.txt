Still cornfields roasting yellow in the sun
I've never had this much fun
I've never had my own gun
Bring in the choir, give the kids a Goddamn sign

Look us in the centre of our eyes
And tell me when I'm going to die

Put on your snowboots
Meet us behind the biggest tree
Fix our broken limbs
And you'll make us be better people

Today we'll harvest corn
And every three seconds, when a baby is born
We'll imagine their faces
And the faces that they have worn

Still cornfields roasting yellow in the sun
I've never had this much fun
I've never had my own gun
Bring in the choir, give the kids a Goddamn sign

Look us in the centre of our eyes
And tell me when I'm going to die
