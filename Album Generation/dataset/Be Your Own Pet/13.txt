Get out of my skin, get out of my skin
Get out of my skin, get out of my skin
Get out of my skin, get out of my skin

And now you're embarassed get out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough

And your bad's living out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough

(get out of my skin, get out of my skin)

Get out of my skin, get out of my skin
Get out of my skin, get out of my skin
Get out of my skin, get out of my skin

And you're so embarassed get out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough

And your bad's living out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough

And you're so embarassed get out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough

And your bad's living out of my skin
I try to fight you but you always win
It turns out the medication only makes you tough
You were so damn mean but I've had enough
