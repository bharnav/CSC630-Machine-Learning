A stairway to heaven...

Lean on my shoulder, lean on my shoulder
I want another year older
Lean on my shoulder, lean on my shoulder
And share a bed with me
Lean on my shoulder, lean on my shoulder
I want another year older
Lean on my shoulder, lean on my shoulder
And share a bed with me

Get this something out of my head
There's too much shit going on my brain
Hurry hurry hurry hurry
Cos I think I'm gonna go insane

Whatever whatever whatever whatever
I know I know you know you're clever
So seduce me, introduce me
On the list you've had forever

My brain is on fire, my brain is on fire
So whisper in my ear
When it's all over, when it's all over
You can come and kiss me right here

My brain is on fire, my brain is on fire
So whisper in my ear
When it's all over, when it's all over
You can call me, kiss me right here
