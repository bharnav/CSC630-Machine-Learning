Right up the wall to the darkest place
It gets so dark when we're below the waist
We are the knowing oh yes we know it all
We will vacation, you will be my parasol

Vacation says, vacation says
We have to be good to each other
We have to be so good to each other
We have to lend our support

Right up the wall to the darkest place
It gets so dark when we're below the waist
We are the knowing oh yes we know it all
We will vacation, you will be my parasol

Play my piano I will lend you a hand
What aggravates you will be my demand
It's not impossible to burn this place down
Without your wings we can burn this place down

Right up the wall to the darkest place
It gets so dark when we're below the waist
We are the knowing oh yes we know it all
We will vacation, you will be my parasol
Right up the wall to the darkest place
It gets so dark when we're below the waist
Right up the wall to the darkest hole
We will vacation, you will be my parasol
