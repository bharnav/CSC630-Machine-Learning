You know I love you like the sludge from my cow house city
Oh I love you like the sludge from my cow house city

I am wildcat
You are a worm
And we are chasing each other and taking turns
We aren't giving up, we aren't safe
And we are chasing each other all over the place

You know I love you like the sludge from my cow house city
Oh I love you like the sludge from my cow house city

I am wildcat
You are a worm
And we are chasing each other and taking turns
We aren't giving up, we aren't safe
And we are chasing each other all over the place
