We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

We will come to your town
Burn your house down
Turn the sky brown
All because, all because

We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

Change the eye colour
Of every lady
We're fast, we're fast
We're fast we're having a blast
All because

We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

Change the colour of your make up
All the sleepyheads will wake up
All because all because all because
Because because because because...

No gears no breaks no reals no fakes

Have fun, and be safe with it
Just kidding, FUCK SHIT UP
We ride bikes, cars are for idiots
All because, all because
We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby
