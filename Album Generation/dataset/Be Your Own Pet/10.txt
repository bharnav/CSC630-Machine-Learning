I didn't want it to blow up like a problem
A tiny tiny little problem
Recovering in spruced up bathrooms
Well they aren't really a problem
We all have holes in our socks
And fabrics totally rocks
Went to the park and they wouldn't let us in
Went to the film and they wouldn't let us in
Went to the news and they wouldn't let us in
Burn them all down so that we can get in
Went to the new and they wouldn't let us in
Went to the film and they wouldn't let us in
Went to the park and they wouldn't let us in
Burn them all down so that we can get in
You can take a twelve year old
And break his arms twice
We can guarantee you that we won't be very nice
