They haunt the streets with their eyes full of hunger
Spreading disease and death to one another
There's no stopping till it gets too late
Zombie apocalypse will change us all now

They haunt the streets with their eyes full of hunger
Spreading disease and death to one another
There's no stopping till it gets too late
Zombie apocalypse will change us all now

When there's no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
Feeding up the night when we're together
When they're trying to get us in the end

When there's no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
Feeding up the night when we're together
When they're trying to get us in the end

They haunt the streets with their eyes full of hunger
Spreading disease and death to one another
There's no stopping till it gets too late
Zombie apocalypse will change us all now

They haunt the streets with their eyes full of hunger
Spreading disease and death to one another
There's no stopping till it gets too late
Zombie apocalypse will change us all now

When there's no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
Feeding up the night when we're together
When they're trying to get us in the end

They aren't your mothers, they aren't your brothers
They got no feeling but the pain in their stomachs
Have you seen their faces the way they stare?
We know for sure there can't be anything in there

When there's no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
Feeding up the night when we're together
When they're trying to get us in the end

When there's no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
Feeding up the night when we're together
When they're trying to get us in the end
