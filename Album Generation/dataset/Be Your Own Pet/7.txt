Sparks by a rotten flame
I'm smart not to play this game
Sinning, take me to the moon
Backyard, I'm gonna see you soon
Shivers going up my spine
Kitty, it's only a matter of time
Born in the neighbours pool
I'm guilty by a rotten rule
Wanna get a cat my boyfriend wants a dog
We got into a fight I drowned him in the bog
I'm sorry
I'm not sorry!
I'm sorry
I'm not sorry!

I'm guilty, oh put me down
I'm on repeats and I'm going in jail
I'm guilty I'm going down
I'm on repeats and I'm going in jail

Sparks by a rotten flame
I'm smart not to play this game
Sinning, take me to the moon
Backyard, I'm gonna see you soon
Shivers going up my spine
Kitty, it's only a matter of time
Born in the neighbours pool
I'm guilty by a rotten rule
