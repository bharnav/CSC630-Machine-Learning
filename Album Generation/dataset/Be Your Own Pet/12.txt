Thought you were the only fish in the sea

Thought you were the only fish in the sea
Thought you were the only leaf on my tree
Thought that you would miss me when we took that walk
Thought you were the only paint on my wall

But I was wrong, so wrong
Been thinking about this for far too long
And I'm tired, so tired
I'm tired of this Soho riot

And I was wrong, so wrong
Been thinking about this for far too long
And I'm tired, so tired
I'm tired of this Goddamn love riot

Thought you were the only lead in my pocket
Although you shot up like a damn rocket
Oh, please fall and break your eye sockets
I want your shotgun but you never got to cock it

And I was wrong, damn me
Been thinking about this far too long
And I hate it, this riot
All I wanted was the room at the Hyatt

And I was wrong, damn me
Been thinking about this far too long
And I hate it, this riot
All I wanted was the room at the Hyatt

Thought you were the only fish in the sea
Thought you were the only leaf on my tree
Thought that you would miss me when we took that walk
Thought you were the only paint on my wall

But I was wrong, so wrong
Been thinking about this far too long
And I hate it, this riot
All I wanted was the room at the Hyatt

Thought you were the only lead in my pocket
Although you shot up like a damn rocket
Oh please fall and break your eye sockets
I want your shotgun but you never got to cock it
