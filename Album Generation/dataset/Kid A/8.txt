[Verse 1]
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around, around

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
