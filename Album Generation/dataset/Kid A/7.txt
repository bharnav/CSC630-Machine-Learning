I'll swallow until I burst
Until I burst, until I
Who's in the bunker? Who's in the bunker?
I have seen too much
I haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first, and children

[Chorus]
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

[Verse 2]

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

[Outro]
And first, and the children, and first, and the children
And first, and the children, and first, and the children
And first, and first, and the children
And first, and the children
And first, and the children, and first, and the children
And first, and first, and the children
And first, and the children, and first, and the children
And first, and the children, and first, and the children
