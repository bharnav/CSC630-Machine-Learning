[Verse 1]
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

[Verse 2]
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

[Verse 3]
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Lying in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

[Bridge]
The rats and children follow me out of town
The rats and children follow me out of their homes
Come on, kids
