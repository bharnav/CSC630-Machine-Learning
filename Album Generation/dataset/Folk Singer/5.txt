Well I'm goin' down south child
This weather here's too cold

You know I'm goin' down South child
This weather here's too cold

I gotta lay around Chicago I ain't got change in cold

When I woke up this morning and found my baby gone
You know I woke up this morning found my baby gone

I couldn't do nothing but bury my head in home
Well I was in jail with my back turned to the wall
Well I was in jail with my back turned to the wall

Now McKinley is in a free world having herself a home

When I leave you this morning I'm glad to shake your hand
You know I'm leaving this morning I got to shake your hand

And I'm going back to my woman you back to your man
