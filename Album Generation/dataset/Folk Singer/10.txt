[Verse]
Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy isn't that bad
Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy isn't that bad
You can't spend what you haven't got
You can't lose some little girl you haven't never had
Had money in the bank, I got busted, people aren't that bad
Had money in the bank, I got busted, people aren't that bad
You can't spend what you haven't got
You can't lose some little girl you not never had
Isn't that the truth boys
Had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people aren't that bad
My own fault, people aren't that bad
Well you know you can't spend what you aren't got
You can't lose some blues you aren't never had
Have mercy!
Sweet little home, got burned down, people aren't that bad
Yeah you know I had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people aren't that bad
Whoa you know you can't spend what you haven't got
You can't lose some little girl you haven't never had
