[Verse]
Good morning little school girl[x2]
Can I go home with
Can I go home with you
Tell your mother and your father
I once was a schoolboy too
Sometime I don't know what[x2]
Woman what in this world to
Woman what in this world to do
I don't want to hurt your feelings
Or even get mad with you
I'm going to buy me an airplane[x2]
I'm going to fly all over Chevy, man
I'm going tofly over Chevy man town
If I don't find my baby
I'm not going to let my airplane down
Now who's that coming, yonder[x2]
She all dressed up and pretty
She all dressed up and pretty to me
If she don't be my baby
I'd soon to see her dead
