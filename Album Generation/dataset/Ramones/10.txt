[Verse 1]
If you think you can, well, come on man
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
I said, no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries

[Chorus]
53rd and 3rd, standing on the street
53rd and 3rd, I'm trying to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick?

[Verse 2]
If you think you can, well, come on man
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
I said, no more of your fairy stories
Because I got my other worries

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Then I took out my razor blade
Then I did what God forbade
Now the cops are after me
But I proved that I'm no sissy

[Chorus]
53rd and 3rd, standing on the street
53rd and 3rd, I'm trying to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick?

[Outro]
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd
