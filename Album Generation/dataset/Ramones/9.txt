[Chorus 1][x2]
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart

[Chorus 2]
That girl could still be mine
But I'm tired of the hurt
Tired of trying
I'm tired of the pain
Tired of trying
I'm tired of crying

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]
