[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh
Sitting here with nothing to do
Sitting here thinking only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But she'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
I don't care, wohoho

[Verse 2]
When I saw her on the corner
She told me told me told me told me
She wouldn't go far
Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love
Because she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of
