Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance?
Well let's dance; let's dance
We'll do the Twist, the stomp, the Mashed Potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance; let's dance
Hey baby yeah you thrill the soul, hold me close, don't you let me go
Well let's dance
Hey baby if you're all alone, baby you'll let me walk you home
Let's dance
Hey baby yeah you swing it right, yes I know that tonight's the night
Let's dance
