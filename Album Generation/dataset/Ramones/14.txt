[Intro]
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

[Verse]
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

[Chorus]
Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

[Verse]
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

[Chorus]
Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

[Verse]
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

[Intro]
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
