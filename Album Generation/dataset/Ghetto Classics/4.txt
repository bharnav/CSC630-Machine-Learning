Hey my baby
Well, it's crazy how you played me
Oh, how you played me, how you played me
Why, why'd you do it baby

When I was hitting I was in rotation off the charts (off the chart)
Like number two wit a bullet I was shooting straight for your heart
But it's like I'm slipping
From that key position
Dropped down on your list from
Top ten to not even being on your countdown

And so I wait (I wait)
For you to come digging in the crates
Blow off the dust so I could finally get some attention
Cause once you put the needle on wax
You can't just put me back
(You can't just put me back)
Just cut it up, and scratch and bring it back
Cause your only gonna play me again

You fade me out
And you blend him in
I can't get some spin unless I'm requested
She's something like a Dj
We use to move the crowd
Now the groove is all worn out
I can't get no play she's something like a Dj
I'm so in love with the way you work the one and twos
But I can't help but be jealous the way you work them other dudes
You get caught up skipping
Girl just let me flip it
(Just let me flip it)
I'll show you the remix, baby
Bringing records out the top for the number one spot

And so I wait
For you to come diggin in the crates
Blow off the dust so I could finally get some attention
Cause once you put the needle on wax
You can't just put me back
(You just csn't put me back)
Just cut it up, and scratch and bring it back
Cause your only gonna play me again

You fade me out
And you blend him in
I can't get no spin unless I'm requested
She's something like a Dj
We use to move the crowds
Now the groove is all worn out
I can't get no play she's something like a Dj

Baby girl lets slow it down
Like it's the last song of the night
And we'll be dancing to the lights go off
And no need to switch it up
Until the time is right
See you got me feel'in like
I'm your favorite song

You fade me out
And you blend him in
I can't get no spin unless I'm requested
She's something like a Dj
We use the crowd
Now the groove is all worn out
I can't get no play she's something like a Dj

You fade me out
And you blend him in
I can't get no spin unless I'm requested
She's something like a Dj
We use the crowd
Now the groove is all worn out
I can't get no play she's something like a Dj

And just for the record baby
My head is spinning
My heart is turning
And I'm yarning for your love
Oh
