We pushed up in the club
Ladies showin love
Doin' things you know that playas do
I peeped luv at the door
She bounced across the floor
Couldn't ignore the way ber body moved
I post up at the bar
She looking like a star
Like she just stepped out a magazine
And then I recognized
Bow legs and chinky eyes
Head to toe you know this shorty was mean soooo

[Chorus:]
Lets have some conversation
(can I get that number)
I really wanna learn about ya (oh)
Really wanna get to know you

Lets have some conversation

Really wanna get to know you
(give ya a call some time yeah)

She came up out the mink
Luv what you tryna drink

Then luv pulled out that purple sack
