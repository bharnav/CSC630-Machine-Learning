Verse I
She walked past the corner store I said hello
What's your name?
She said Tracy Donatello
Long Hair, Tight Jeans and Stilettos
Conversation so good didn't want to let it go
But shorty you a perfect 10, classical like violin
I just couldn't settle for the rap
I need to know you more

Chorus
You're a masterpiece from your head to your feet
Well educated plus you so complete
Them other girls be hatin'
Cause your so unique
I love you cause your from the streets

How can I be down with you?
Shoot a couple rounds with you
Drop the Math and I'll come through
Love we can do what you wanna do

Verse II
I know I saw that ass before
Bouncin' up my block
I saw you twice shoppin' in the mall
Still lookin sweet and tender
You got that smile that I'll always remember
I only want to get together
Love I'm tryna know you better
We can make it last forever
I can't get you outta my mind

Chorus

You're a masterpiece from your head to your feet
Well educated plus you so complete
Them other girls be hatin'
Cause your so unique
I love you cause your from the streets

How can I be down with you?
Shoot a couple rounds with you
Drop the Math and I'll come through
Love we can do what you wanna do

Verse III
Tell me why you tryna play a nigga out ( Love Stop)
Can a brotha take you out somewhere ( take you out somewhere)
I gotta lot of quality time to share
Girl, just say the word and I'm there
All I wanna do is maybe hit the clubs
Have a few drinks, grab a bite to eat
And head to the crib
So I can do my thing (I can do my thing)
Wanna have you up under my wings

Chorus 2X
You're a masterpiece from your head to your feet
Well educated plus you so complete
Them other girls be hatin'
Cause your so unique
I love you cause your from the streets

How can I be down with you?
Shoot a couple rounds with you
Drop the Math and I'll come through
Love we can do what you wanna do
