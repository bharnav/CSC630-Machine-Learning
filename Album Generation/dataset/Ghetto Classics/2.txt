Who did the daddy thing?
When her father wasn't there
Who did the daddy thing?
Now usually, it was a car seat up in the back seat
A tiny shoe swingin' from the rear view
A ring on her hand I could never be her man
But we got so close
Blew all my dough on the Baby Gap school clothes
Pretty little angel in barrettes and bows
And a button nose
After a while started calling me daddy
I should have known that it couldn't last
Should have know that you'd take him right back
I should have took off running when I first saw her comin'
Would have never gotten so attached

[Chorus]
When her father wasn't there to participate he got hit wit a bit up state
When she needed diapers, wipes food and baby food
Won't you tell me who
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody, nobody but me

Now normally, I would just hit and run
But Can't u see
I'm about you and your little one
I took the jokes form all my folks
How I got caught up playing step daddy
I got my income tax n said f**k it
And traded in your bucket
Cus that coop wasn't big enough
I wasn't trying to replace him
Now that he's back around
Guess that you don't need me now
You don't need me anymore

I should have known that it couldn't last
Should have known that you'd take him right back
I should have took off runnin' when I first saw her comin
Would have never gotten so attached

[Chorus]
When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit wit a bit upstate
When she needed diapers wipes food and baby shoes
Won't u tell me who (who did it)
Who did the daddy thing?
(I did, I gave her every thing)
Who did the daddy thing?
(Nobody but me)
On the first day of school, holidays
From the very first step she made
When she needed love trust patience and truth
I want you to tell me who
Who did the daddy thing?
( I gave her everything)
Who did the daddy thing?
(Nobody but me)

Long walks with piggy backs and baby cribs and light blue Timbs
I gave it all out of love
(All in the name of love)
Every Christmas, X-Boxes, little dresses, tennis placements
I did it all, all just because
When there was no one, no one
When nobody else was there

[Chorus]
When her father wasn't there to participate he got his wit a bit upstate
When she needed diapers wipes food and baby shoes won't you tell me who
Who did the daddy thing?
(And you know I was the man)
Who did the daddy thing?
(A shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to)
On the first day of school holidays from the very first step she made
When she needed love trust patience and truth I want you to tell me who
Who did the daddy thing?
(Nobody)
When her father wasn't there
Who did the daddy thing?
