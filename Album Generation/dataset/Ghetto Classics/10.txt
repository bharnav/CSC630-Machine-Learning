Stepped up in the club
Where them chicks be at
You were standing at the bar
Saw you from the back
Legs straight bangin and that ass is phat
[something] on your body girl, i f**ks with that
I'm the type of cat
I know what i like
See you the type of lady i'll take home and wife
So won't you go grab your coat get your bag
I'll be in the parking lot chilling with the roof back

[Hook]
Come over...If ever in need love
Come over...If you ever need love
Come over...if you need someone to trust
Come over...baby come over
Come over...if you ever need a friend
Come over...i'll be there through thick and thin
Come over..baby come over
Come over

My nigga hit me on my ?hip? with a tax

He caught your man slipped in
Now tell me what he gon pull next?
He trickin ya out at the mall
Whatsup wit y'all baby we need to talk
I can tell a nigga been thuggin you out
I see its where you need to be
See love won't hurt for nothing
Ain't no sense in frontin
Gotta keep that ?...?

Come over...If ever in need love
Come over...If you ever need love
Come over...if you need someguy to love
Come over...baby come over
Come over...if you ever need a friend
Come over...i'll be there through thick and thin
Come over..baby come over
Come over
