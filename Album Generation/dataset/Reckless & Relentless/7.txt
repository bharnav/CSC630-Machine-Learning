[Intro]
Get the fuck away from me!

[Verse 1]
I know that I
Have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
I know that I
Am on a fast track to the grave and I'm headed there alone
I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that isn't me

[Chorus]
I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way
To get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find
A way back inside my mind

[Bridge]
I want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way
To get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I need to find
A way back inside my mind

[Bridge]
A way back inside my mind
This is not the end
This is the end of
This is not the end
This is the end of
This is not the end
This is the end
Oh!

[Verse 2]
Every mistake I've made
Leaves a scar that burns every day
Yet still I carry on
Without regret
Without remorse
I'm gone
You're better off to walk away
I am corruption
I am sin

[Outro]
Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Forget my face
