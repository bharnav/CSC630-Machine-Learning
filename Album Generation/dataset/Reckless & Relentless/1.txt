[Verse 1]
Oh, Sweet Insanity!
You take my hand and walk me out into the dark
We walk this road
For hours and hours
To the white hills and the oceans
On a collision course, to hell we march
We're doomed to this now
Oh the irony
If I'm going down I won't go down alone
You're doomed to this one
You're doomed to
You're doomed to this now
You're doomed to

[Chorus]
Hold your breath, my dear
We're going under (We're going under)
Hold your breath, my dear
We're going under (We're going under)

[Verse 2]
I've walked this road for hours
To the white hills, and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in (Just let me in)
Don't wake me up their songs are soothing
Their wine subdues me

[Chorus]
Hold your breath, my dear
We're going under (We're going under)
Hold your breath, my dear
We're going under (We're going under)

[Breakdown]
Dreams
My mind won't lift me from my dreams
And though I try I can't escape my mind
Dreams
My mind won't lift me from my dreams
And though you try you can't escape me

[Bridge]
Now, you've seen what I've become
Now, you've seen what I can do
Now, you've seen what I'm capable of

[Verse 2]
I've walked this road for hours
To the white hills and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in (Just let me in)
Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing
Their wine subdues me

[Outro]
Welcome to the diary of a man that lost his mind so long ago
Welcome to the shell of a man with a heart so black and cold
Over and over in my head
