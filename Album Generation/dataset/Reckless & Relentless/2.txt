[Intro]
One last time!

[Verse]
We're back again
You know we're not fucking around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands
You trying to keep up kid?
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks
We've done the drugs
Clearly we don't remember
We've come so far
We've shown them all
Without us you'd fall and fade away

[Bridge]
They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine

[Breakdown]
Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit
You can't help but love this shit
Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit
You can't help but love this shit
You can't help but love this shit

[Electronic Bridge]

[Bridge]
I'm everything we need to make this scene
What it should have been
Remember platinum albums, sold out stadiums
Leave it to me
Let's tell the truth, not to be rude
But we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in its head
Let's wake it up
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Outro]
It's so insane, I'm so insane
Going insane, I'm so insane
Leave it to me from here
Leave it to me from here
