[Verse]
You'll never really find those perfect words
Something more than just
Goodbye
It's hard to remember the good times when there's just so much heartache
But they deserve more than that
They deserve more than just one single moment of sadness
So just remember
That when there's enough love in our hearts to burst
Like a fucking supernova
Then there sure as hell's enough love in our heart
To spark that famous smile
We all lose someone at some point in our lives
But don't ever let go of that smile
Hold on forever
Because that's our final dedication
