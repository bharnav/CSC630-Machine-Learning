[Verse 1]
I'm so done with it
I won't go back again and
I'm okay with this
That I'll be in my own
Until the day I die
Which shouldn't be that long
So I'll just do what I do and make the most of it

[Chorus]
I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive
I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

[Verse 2]
Oh, fuck, this is fun I just can't believe I didn't find this before
To just indulge even if it kills me
Who gives a fuck if we die
Another bottle down
You should really try it sometime
Because it feels so good
Without a care if a heart gets broken
You'll all learn in the end that there's a better way
Baby move in closer, you couldn't hurt me if you tried

[Chorus]
I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive
I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

[Outro]
Take a seat, my dear
Make yourself comfortable this could take a while
Crack another, dear
I can see now and I wouldn't change a thing
Life should burn with such a fucking flame
If not you've only got yourself to blame
