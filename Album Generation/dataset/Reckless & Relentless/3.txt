[Verse 1]
Please, you have to help me
This is not my true face
If you could see my soul
As I have seen my soul
I could show it to you
It's rotten, it's poison
Help me please
Please!
Give me a fucking excuse!
I beg for just one reason!
To give you!
Regret!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side
So choose your side
Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side
So choose your fucking side

[Chorus]
Could be the end of the world
I'd still be laid here on my own
Wasting my life away!
Could be the end of the world
I'd still be laid here on my own
Wasting my life away!

[Verse 2]
Hear me now
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a God you'll ever know
Get off your knees
Open your eyes

[Breakdown]
I'll regret
Never again
And I stand above you
I'll regret
Never again
And I stand above you

[Bridge]
And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

[Chorus]
Could be the end of the world (Woah-oh-oh)
I'd still be laid here on my own
Wasting my life away!
Could be the end of the world (Woah-oh-oh)
I'd still be laid here on my own
Wasting my life away!

[Outro]
Over and over!
Over and over!
Fucking hell
Fuck!
