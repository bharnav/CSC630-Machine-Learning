[Verse 1]
Gather round my friends
I need a match
And only one match
I need a match
I think it's time I make my own way
I'm turning my back on this
City and I'm not looking back
You'll never hear my name
Without your chest in flames

[Chorus]
I'll make my own mistakes
Even though I never learn
I'm running from myself
If only you could see behind my eyes

[Bridge]
Run!
Get up, get up
Get up, your fucking sin!
Run!
Get up, get up
Get up, your fucking sin!
Get up, get up

[Chorus]
I'll make my own mistakes
Even though I never learn
I'm running from myself
If only you could see behind my eyes

[Verse 2]
Follow me now
I could use some company
Bring your friends
And we'll burn the city to the ground
Follow me now
I could use some company
Bring your friends
And we'll burn the city to the fucking ground
Burn their temples
Burn their temples

[Outro]
The fires fill the skies
As the smoke fills my lungs
What a beautiful notion
A single action brings this city to motion
You all deserve to die!
