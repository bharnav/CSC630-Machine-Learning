[Verse 1]
Can
You
Feel their haunting presence?
Can
You
Feel their haunting presence?

[Chorus]
Liar! Killer! Demon!
Back to the River Aras
Someone's blank stare deemed it warfare
Liar! Killer! Demon!
Back to the River Aras
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free

[Verse 2]
Can
You
Hear the Holy Mountains?

[Chorus]
Liar! Killer! Demon!
Back to the River Aras
Someone's mouth said "paint them all red"
Liar! Killer! Demon!
Back to the River Aras
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free

[Bridge]
They have all returned
Resting on the mountain side
We have learned
That you have no
They have returned
Resting on the mountain side
We have learned
That you have no–

[Chorus]
Honor! Murderer! Sodomizer!
Back to the River Aras

[Bridge]
They have returned
Resting on the mountain side
We have learned
That you have no–

[Chorus]
Honor! Murderer! Sodomizer!
Back to the River Aras
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free
