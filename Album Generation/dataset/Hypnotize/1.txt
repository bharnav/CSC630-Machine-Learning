[Verse: Serj Tankian]
For today
We will take their body parts
And put them on the wall
For treated indigenuously, digenously
Human right is private blue chip, pry
For treated indigenously, digenously (We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)

[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
You, you went beyond
And you lost it all
Why did you go there
From beyond
You saw it all
Why did you go there

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
For treated indigenously, digenously (We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage)
For treated indigenously, digenously (We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)

[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
You, you went beyond
And you lost it all
Why did you go there
From beyond
You saw it all
Why did you go there

[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
She lost her mind
Someone kicked her into the back of the line
She lost her head
When they called and said that they thought he was dead

[Refrain: Daron Malakian]
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deâ€“

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
For treated indigenously, digenously (We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage)
For treated indigenously, digenously (We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)

[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
You, you went beyond
And you lost it all
Why did you go there
From beyond
You saw it all
Why did you
Nananananana, nanananananana

[Refrain: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny

[Outro: Serj Tankian]
You will take the body parts and put them on the wall
And bring the dark disaster
