[Intro: Daron Malakian]
Yeah!
Alright!
Yeah, alright!

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Two skies watching it all, fading
Two skies living it all, fading
Two skies watching it all, fading
Two skies fading, one's abating
Two suns living it all, dying
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two suns watching them both, fighting
Two suns seeing them both, dying
Two suns watching them both, fighting
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two skies seeing them both, dying
Two skies fading, one's abating

[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
Crack pipes, needles, PCP and fast cars
Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star
When I feel like talking, I'll never be wrong
If I feel like walking, you best come along
I close my windows, crank the heat up high
'Til my palms are wet and my tongue is dry

[Chorus: Daron Malakian]
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
I'm a
Midnight fist fight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
I'm a
Midnight fist fight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
Alright!
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
Alright!
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
'Cause I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
Yeah, I am looking for a mother that will get me high
I'm a stupid motherfucker
If I die, I die
Alright!

[Outro: Daron Malakian]
Yeah!
Alright!
Yeah, alright!
