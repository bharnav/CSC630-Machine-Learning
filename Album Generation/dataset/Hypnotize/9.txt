[Verse 1: Daron Malakian]
She's like heroin
Sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help
I need someone to save her ass
Chinese tricks in rooms
With ghosts of hooker girly dudes
Me and heroin
Maybe we can make some cash selling

[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin

[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
She wants nothing more
But to be a little whore
He wants nothing less
But to wear a little dress
She's like heroin
Sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help
I need someone to make some cash selling

[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin
Ass! Selling ass for heroin

[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
She's like heroin
Sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help
I need someone to save her ass
She wants nothing more
But to be a little whore
He wants nothing less
But to wear a little dress
She's like heroin
Sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help
I need someone to save her ass
Chinese tricks in rooms
With ghosts of hooker girly dudes
Me and heroin
Maybe we can make some cash

[Outro: Daron Malakian]
She's like heroin
Sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help
I need someone to save my ass
