[Verse 1]
One question, what can't be done?
You tear me down with the same thing
There's nothing, the end, it's begun
What can you do when it all drains

[Chorus]
Down there you go, always
See if I care fading
Down, don't you know where I'll be?
'Cause I'm here, on my own

Waiting, when I'm waiting
Don't you know? I've been here before
And I don't care where I'm going

So I'll stay

[Verse 2]
When you walk, don't leave a note
Just put your hands on the back door
When you talk, it's just a joke
Just know, I can't take it anymore

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
So I'll be, waiting, when I'm waiting
Don't you know? I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone
Then I'll stay

[Bridge]
Outside, there's no place I can hide
And you're dead of time, is anything alright?
When the wind tries, the storm won't subside
You'll be outside, and I'm in here and I'll call

[Chorus]
Waiting, when I'm waiting
Don't you know? I've been here before
And I don't care where I'm going

So I'll be, waiting, when I'm waiting
Don't you know? I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone

Then I'll stay, then I'll stay
I missed it
And you'll go
Then I'll stay, stay
