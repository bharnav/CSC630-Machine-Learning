[Verse 1:]
I know you
So better than the city in the rear view
I drive to
Eliminate the ball that I'm chained to

[Pre-Chorus:]
Take me, break me
Every mile further, there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees, you couldn't make me stay

[Chorus:]
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight, fight, fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night

[Verse 2:]
I'll stay strong
I'm pushing on the pedal until I break dawn
So I'm gone
Go find another shoulder you can cry on

[Pre-Chorus:]
Take me, break me
Every mile further, there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees, you couldn't make me stay

[Chorus:]
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight, fight, fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night

You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night

[Bridge:]
All of the things that you knew that I'd try
All of the things that I held inside
All I gotta do is drive

[Chorus:]
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight, fight, fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night

You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
