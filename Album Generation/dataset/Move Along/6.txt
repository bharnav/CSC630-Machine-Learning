[Verse 1]
You don't have to move
You don't have to speak
Lips for biting

You're staring me down
A glance makes me weak
Eyes for striking

Now I'm twisted up
When I'm twisted with you
Brush so lightly

And time trickles down
And I'm breathing for two
Squeeze so tightly

[Chorus]
I'll be fine, you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste now, precious time
We'll dance inside the song

What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

[Verse 2]
She sinks in my mind
As she sheds through her skin
Touch sight taste like fire

Hands do now
What eyes no longer defend
Hands to fuel desire

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
And I'll be fine, you'll be fine
Is this fine? I'm not fine
Give me pieces
Give me things to stay awake

What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

Move down to me, slip into you
