[Verse 1]
You speak to me
I know this will be temporary
You ask to leave
But I can tell you that I've had enough

[Chorus]
I can't take it, this welcome is gone
And I've waited long enough to make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone and I'll watch you go

[Verse 2]
Step up to me
I know that you've got something buried
I'll set you free
You set conditions but I've had enough

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Come back home, won't you come back home?
You step in line, you've got a lot to prove
It comes and goes, ya, it comes and goes
A step in time, ya, it's a lot to move

[Outro]
I know this will be temporary
I know this will be temporary
I know this will be
But I've had enough

[Chorus] [x2]
