[Verse 1]
Now we're broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn't been this way before
She just wants me to dare her

[Chorus]
The phone rings and she screams
"Stab my back, it's better
When I bleed for you
Walk on me, it never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It hasn't done a lot for you

[Verse 2]
And every time he held you close
Yeah, were you thinking of me?
When I needed you the most
Well, I hope that you're happy

[Chorus]
The phone rings and she screams
"Stab my back, it's better
When I bleed for you
Walk on me, it never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It's better when I bleed for you

[Bridge]
I hope that love he gave you
Was just enough to save you
You nearly broke my heart
Just look at what you're tearing apart

[Chorus]
Stab my back
"It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It hasn't done a lot for you

[Outro]
It's better when I bleed for you
It never was enough to do
It hasn't done a lot for you
