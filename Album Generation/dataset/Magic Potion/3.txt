[Verse 1]
Just a little heat
Now on this cold day
You know it would take my
Worry away, worry away

[Chorus]
It's in my head
I can't let go
No matter what you said
'Cause I already know
Leaving this place
'Cause you, you've got it written
All over your face

[Break]
Oh oh

[Verse 2]
Why can't trouble
Find a new friend?
'Cause this can't be the way
The story ends
Oh, no

[Chorus]
It's in my head now
I can't let go
No matter what you said
'Cause I already know
Leaving this place
'Cause you, you've got it written
All over your face

[Outro]
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
