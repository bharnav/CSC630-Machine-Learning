[Verse 1]
Out of all the things you've ever done
This time I can't go back
When a heart gets broke this many times
It's easy to lose track

[Chorus]
Taking all this pain
And you know I can't regain
The flame
Oh, the flame

[Verse 2]
Like a dream to me time with you
So unreal
Maybe another life love for me
Is what you feel

[Chorus]
Taking all this pain
And you know I can't regain
The flame, oh

[Verse 3]
Greater men made it here
Only to turn back
So cut me loose, if you want
Or tighten up the slack

[Chorus]
Taking all this pain
And you know we can't regain
The flame
Oh, the flame
Yeah oh
