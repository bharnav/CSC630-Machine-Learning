[Verse 1]
When it come to pride
And other sinful matters
You're gonna be mislead
Left there in tatters

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to go because
Something's on my mind
And I won't get better
No matter how hard I try

[Chorus]
Whoa! Yeah
You just got to be
The best thing for me

[Verse 2]
Evil hides
In dark places
But now I find it
In familiar faces

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to go because
Something's on my mind
And I won't get better
No matter how hard I try

[Chorus]
Whoa! Yeah
You just got to be
The best thing for me
