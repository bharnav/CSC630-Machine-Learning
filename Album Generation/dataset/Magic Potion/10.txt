[Verse 1]
In the elevator I pick my floor
And if I want to battle I pick my war

[Chorus]
Hold tight
Hold on
Hold tight
I was blind for a time
Now I find
The choice is mine

[Verse 2]
And I get seasick on dry land
And I hear voices saying "do what you can"

[Chorus]
Hold tight
Hold on
Oh
I was blind for a time
Now I find
That the choice is mine

Hold tight
Hold on
Oh
I was blind for a time
Now I find
That the choice is mine

[Outro]
The choice is mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The choice is mine
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
