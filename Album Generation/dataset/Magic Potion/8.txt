[Verse 1]
Well I came to see
And what I found was not alright with me
Desperation, suffocation
And it'd been the same thing all along

[Chorus]
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon

[Verse 2]
Now I know times are changing
And the people need rearranging
So now it's written here in song

[Chorus]
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon

[Verse 3]
Now our boys they're falling
Our leaders are all appalling
And you can bet by God
Good will is gone

[Chorus]
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Oh, goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon, hey
