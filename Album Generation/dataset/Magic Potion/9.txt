[Verse 1]
What's behind your black door?
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
May take a week, honey, it may take more
I want to know, I want to know

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Got to doubt your condition
I want to know, I want to know
It would end my suspicion, yeah
I want to know, I want to know

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
When I see it start to open
Can't you hear me begging please?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
