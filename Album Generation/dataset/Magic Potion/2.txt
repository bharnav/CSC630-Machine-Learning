[Verse 1]
When I was thirteen
My mom said "Son
You're the one I adore‚Äù
Now I'm old and wise
When I see your eyes
You're the one I adore

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
Will you be true
Till life is done?
Be the one I adore, oh
You're the one I adore

[Outro]
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
