[Intro]
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I don't want to go to hell
But if I do it'll be 'cause of you
And a young man's going to make mistakes
'Til he hits the brakes

[Chorus]
My heart's on fire
With a strange desire

[Intro 2]
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
All those birds on the wire
Are going to say I'm a liar
But we all know in the end
They never were my friend

[Chorus]
My heart's on fire
With a strange desire
