[Verse 1]
What price for ghosts of armies
Laid bare in your republic?
This is a song about
A hundred and sixty-two year war

[Verse 2]
It slow-beats on its nations
This sunlight stains the day long
Its shadow stretches from here
It's shaping what scares us

[Chorus]
We will run from them
They will run for us
We will run from them

[Bridge]
Close my eyes
To figure it out
Who has won this battle
Who has won this battle

[Chorus]
We will run from them
They will run for us
We will run from them

[Bridge]
Close my eyes
To figure it out
Who has won this battle
Who has won this battle
I can't see the danger to it
[?]
And I can't see the danger to it
What if we turn out?

[Outro]
And I see another day
I see another day
And I see another day
I see another day
