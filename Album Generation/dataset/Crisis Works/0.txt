I'll solve your problem to the first one*
Who comes along
This argumentum gotta fight too, gotta fight too long
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
Don’t fight the … I will fight it
I will start the war
And don't come off … see this game is right for me
I will point back at you
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
I wanna be, I wanna be a number for you
I wanna be a number for you
I'll solve your problem to the first one
Who comes along
This argumentum gotta fight too, gotta fight too long
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
Your plans are over, I'm not your number
I wanna be, I wanna be a number for you
I wanna be a number for you
I wanna be, I wanna be a number for you
I wanna be a number for you
