Holding on
We will run
Time to let you off the hook
And we should not ignore this feeling
And now we must
Take control
Take off all of our chances
And we have just ignore this feeling
We have just ignore this feeling
It's closer
It's gone amiss
And I have only one question
How can we control this feeling?
I do not run on good intentions, good intentions. [x2]
How can we control this feeling? [x2]
And now I know the best was not enough for you to stay. [x2]
So, how about I go change for you?
You're the only one I trusted
And I should not ignore this feeling
We hold, we're holding on to what we've got
We're not, we're not much of what but if, but if, but if you want to I will
To what's made for me was made for you
And now I know the best was not enough for you to stay. [x2]
So, how about I go change? [x4]
