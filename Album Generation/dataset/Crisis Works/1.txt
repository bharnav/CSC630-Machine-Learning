I've seen that face before*
Fifteen yards I go and now look
At you
And all before
I die
We used to tell ourselves
The best is yet to come, but
?
And then we have a go
At this
When we were young
We made some plans
But look at us
We're right back at the start
Oh, when we were young
We made some plans
But look at us
We're right back at the start
You said, "I've gotta go."
You said, "I've gotta save myself from,"
"From you,"
"And everything that goes,"
"With you."
And this is hard
I told everyone:
"This is for me,"
"And this is forever."
WELL
With you
They're not gonna see through
When we were young
We made some plans
But look at us
We're right back at the start
Oh, when we were young
We made some plans
But look at us
We're right back at the start
And so
And so
And so
And so
Even though
We'll find a way out
Of here
Even though
We'll find a way out
Of here
Even though
I'll find a way out
Of here
And even though
I'll find a way out
Of here
We've all made mistakes
Yeah, We've all made mistakes
And we've all made mistakes
And still we shine
And we've all make mistakes
Yeah, we've all made mistakes
Yeah, we've all made mistakes
And still we shine (shine and shine)
