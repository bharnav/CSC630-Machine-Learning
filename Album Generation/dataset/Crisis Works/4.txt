People in buildings, they live, live short, live shortly
But what about the war?
Show that in hard times love is what you, is what you see
What about the war?
Why should we stand here?
And why should we, should we leave?
You couldn't even try
Beg for an answer and all you get, you get is a nothing bunch of lies
And we'll all pray stop, it's where the dead fail
I guess, there has to be, out there, something special. [x2]
