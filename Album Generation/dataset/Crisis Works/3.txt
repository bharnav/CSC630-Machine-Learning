It is hard to understand that your to blame for the masquerade
Disaster on the hill. Accept this out stretched arm. It's yours to fill
Closer, lean in to pull you from the edge
Some of us leaving might need it to care

[Chorus:]
So, into these arms I will fall
It's never coming back. (Can't feel light.)
So, into these arms I will fall
It's much to late for that. (Can't feel light.)
You can't get out of bed. Your day waits to begin. Head full of sin
The night has took its tole. These walls won't keep the secrets you have told
Closer, lean in to pull you from the edge
Some of us need it
You must need it again

[Chorus x2]
