[Verse 1]
View from the sky to the sea
Step off the bayou into sound
I'm at Deepwater Horizon
The end is just a whisper away

[Verse 2]
This is where I could fall
Torpedoed silent into the future
And I'll surf this beach if I want to
Crossing the sand is crossing out everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Now hand in hand in the surge
Hold on to what you've got
I'm trying to navigate home
Through a hole in the world

[Chorus]
This is where I could fall

[Bridge]
Yet you still stand by my side

[Outro]
This is where I could fall
