(feat. Queenz Deliz)

(Verse 1:)
My girl call me up she throwin a party
I click over and call everybody
Hittin' up a mall to get so sexy
It's Friday and I got my money

(Pre-Chorus:)
Ladies shake your hips get wit 'em
Fellas grab your crotch and flick 'em
Throw them hands up do your thizzle
If you feelin' like a mil

(Chorus:)
I'm feelin' like a million bucks
Just got paid jumped in my truck
Boomin' system movin' through me
They think it's dude
But it's me they see
(Repeat)

(Verse 2:)
Boyz go crazy when they see me
They know I know how to do the damn thang
I move my body left to right
They be checkin' me out like I'm a website

(Pre-Chorus:)
Ladies shake your hips get wit 'em
Fellas grab your crotch and flick 'em
Throw them hands up do your thizzle
If you feelin' like a mil

(Chorus:)
I'm feelin' like a million bucks
Just got paid jumped in my truck
Boomin' system movin' through me
They think it's dude
But it's me they see
(Repeat)

(Queenz Deliz Reggaeton Rap:)
Me ven caminando como un millon
Brillo como un diamante amarillo
Me preguntan quiren saber quien soy yo
Pero les digo estoy aqui con Subliminal
Dominicana, Venenzuela, Colombiana
De donde es Jamaica Queens para
Saben que este juego me pertenese a mi
Yo no lo voy a dejar asta no verlos sufrir

(Breakdown:)
All my ladies in the place say oh!
And all my fellas in the place say oh!
Drop them tops show 'em what you got
Throw them hands up in the air and say oh!
(Repeat)

(Chorus:)
I'm feelin' like a million bucks
Just got paid jumped in my truck
Boomin' system movin' through me
They think it's dude
But it's me they see
(Repeat)
