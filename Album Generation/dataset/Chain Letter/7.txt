Now you can say I'm addicted
I admit I'm afflicted
By the way you affected me so hard
I am helpless, boy you're just like a drug
You're like the illest bug
The way you're makin me sick
I just can't handle it

[Pre Chorus (2x)]
We steady breaking up, making up
Boy, ain't I good enough
Tell me what's wrong with us
Tell me what's wrong with us

[Hook (2x)]
I got whatchu want
I got whatchu need
Tell me why you don't love me

So while we going in circles
Boy you wanna show boat tellin all of ya friends
How you got me trippin'
I know I been on a slow route cause you cheated without doubt
But I ain't trying to to find another man
My 1st reaction was I invested too much time
You think I'm packing and you must lost your damn mind

[Pre-hook]
Where is the love you don't show me
I'm in love, but love don't love me
Boy I can't believe you cheated
I forgive you, then you cheated
Come on, come on, come on
I just like an idiot, I just can't put up wit this
Come on, come on, come on

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]
