(Spoken)
Keep the party goin’

He walked right by me
I knew he was a hottie
I had to back it up so I can go and say hi (hottie)
He had a cute little booty
My thoughts moved through me
I had to get them digits
Gotta mack to him smoothly

[Pre-Hook]
And I say hey boy
You looking kinda cute
Won’t you slip me them digits on the cool
Wanna hook up with you real soon
Hope I ain’t to Aggressive for you babe

[Vamp]
I see you looking baby, don’t be so shy
Better catch me now, now, now [2x]

[Hook]
Love don't pass us by… By
Don’t let love pass us by… Pass us by

Everything is right about him
He's just my type
Ain’t no slippin’ my pimpin’
Gotta lock his thang tight
Though I'm not that kinda girl
There's a first for everything
When I see something I want
Cause I’m spoiled as can be

[Pre-Hook]
And I say hey boy
You looking kinda cute
Won’t you slip me them digits on the cool
Wanna hook up with you real soon
Hope I ain’t to Aggressive for you babe

[Vamp]
I see you looking baby, don’t be so shy
Better catch me now, now, now [2x]

[Hook]
Love don't pass us by… By
Don’t let love pass us by… Pass us by

[Bridge]
You could be the one to marry me
A house, a dog; you can be my baby daddy

[Hook]
Love don't pass us by… By
Don’t let love pass us by… Pass us by

I see you lookin’ baby
(Keep the party goin’)
Baby
(Come on)
I see you lookin’ baby
Oh, baby you
Baby

[Hook]
Love don't pass us by… By
Don’t let love pass us by… Pass us by
