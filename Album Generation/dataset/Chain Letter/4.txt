Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh hey
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I wish I could be that girl in the magazine everybody sees
Sheâ€™s so pretty
I wish I could be
When I close my eyes I see what you want me to be
That girl

[Hook]
Wish I could be your Cover Girl
Mascara and lipstick
I would be so pretty
A little blush, not too much
But maybe you'll notice that I could be your Cover Girl
Or accept me for me
Cover Girl

[Verse 2]
Boy, when you're alone with me I'm takin' good care of you
Givin' everything you need
I don't know if it's good enough for you cause you're always in the TV When you're right here next to me
I know I'm not Halle Berry, girls from videos, I just want to be someone you can hold
I just want to be the one for you
Baby, baby

[Hook]
Wish I could be your Cover Girl
Mascara and lipstick
I would be so pretty
A little blush, not too much
But maybe you'll notice That I could be your Cover Girl
Or accept me for me
Cover Girl

[Bridge]
Boy, I love you just the way you are
And if you feel the same way bout me
Beauty is only skin deep, baby
Boy, I don't need accessories to magnify my beauty
Could you just love what you see

[Hook]
Wish I could be your Cover Girl
Mascara and lipstick
I would be so pretty
A little blush, not too much
But maybe you'll notice that I could be your Cover Girl
Or accept me for me
Cover Girl

[Fade]
