(Verse 1)
To whom this may be concerned
To those who may want to learn
I'm writing this to you
The reason I won't be here no more (no more)
Reason I won't live I yearn (I yearn)
The reason I won't be on this earth
Cause I will die if you were to leave

(Chorus)
Oh, look what you've done
It's like a disease
I'm dying from a broken heart
Oh, look what you've done
Your the remedy
I'm dying from a broken heart

(Verse 2)
Some may not understand the words I sing
They have no idea how that feels me
They don't know why I'm an angel in my dreams
'Cause if you leave me babe I will die
With this broken heart I can't survive
I need you in my life
It would kill me if you were to leave
(if you were to leave baby)

(Chorus)
Oh, look what you've done
It's like a disease
I'm dying from a broken heart
Oh, look what you've done
Your the remedy
I'm dying from a broken heart

(Bridge)
I'm loosing time, I need you here
Don't walk away, Won't you please help me
'Cause I'm beggin', I'm on bended knee
Won't somebody come and rescue me

I'm pleading, I'm on bended knee
I can't make it with out you next to me
Can somebody come and save me
Can somebody come and set me free

(Chorus)
Oh, look what you've done
It's like a disease
I'm dying from a broken heart
Oh, look what you've done
Your the remedy
I'm dying from a broken heart

(Bridge Outro:)
I'm loosing time, I need you here
Don't walk away, won't you please help me
'Cause I'm begging, I'm on bended knee
Won't somebody...
