(Breakdown:)
We like chain playa's shinin' clean
Screwed up tape throwed off that lean
So where u at playa? (Where u at?)
We like em rollin' swisha sweets
We like dem balla's makin' "green"
So where u at playa? (Where u at?)

(Jermaine Dupri Rap:)
I was at a jam the other night
I was sippin' on three
And the feelin' was right
I met a little sumthin' tryna do a little sumthin'
Man shawty had her own look planned
She was pullin' on a nigga
Hand playin' with a nigga
Pants all up on me
When we started to dance
First I just thought she was just playin' wit me
Until I heard all the stuff she was sayin' to me
Like...

(Hook:)
Playa where u come from?
