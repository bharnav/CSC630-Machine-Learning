(feat. Kilo aka J.R.K.)

[Verse 1:]
You can roll up your contacts
You can shrug up your shoulders
You can swing ya weave from left to right
'Til you reach Minnesota
We got the spot held down and baby girl you can't hold us
I know u wish u were the shit
Thas why you wish you was on us

[Pre-Chorus:]
You think you cool man
You and your crew man
Well I got news man
I ain't no illusion so:

[Chorus:]
Whatcha lookin' at!
Whatcha lookin' at!
Whatcha lookin' at!
U know u don't want none of dis
[Repeat]

[Kilo:]
We in da ghetto slangin' yee-yo
Somebody yelled here come the po-po
Flush the do
We out the back do
Back 2 jail
I'll die before I go oh-oh-oh
Me and my crew sold up the block
Betta watch out da block is hot!!!!
Me and my crew sold up the block
Betta watch out da block is hot!!!!
Oh-Oh-Oh

[Chorus:]
Whatcha lookin' at!
Whatcha lookin' at!
Whatcha lookin' at!
U know u don't want none of dis
[Repeat]
