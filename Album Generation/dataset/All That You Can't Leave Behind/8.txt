[Verse 1]
When you look at the world
What is it that you see?
People find all kinds of things
That bring them to their knees
I see an expression
So clear and so true
That it changes the atmosphere
When you walk into the room

[Chorus]
So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

[Verse 2]
When the night is someone elses
And you're trying to get some sleep
When your thoughts are too expensive
To ever want to keep
When there's all kinds of chaos
And everyone is walking lame
You don't even blink now, do you
Or even look away

[Chorus]
So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

[Bridge]
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait till I'm stronger
Can't wait any longer
To see what you see
When I look at the world

[Verse 3]
I'm in the waiting room
I can't see for the smoke
I think of you and your holy book
While the rest of us choke

[Outro]
Tell me, tell me, what do you see?
Tell me, tell me, what's wrong with me
