[Verse 1]
In the days
When we were swinging from the trees
I was a monkey
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees
I could taste
I could taste you even then
And I would chase you down the wind

[Chorus 1]
You could go there if you please
Wild honey
And if you go there, go with me
Wild honey

[Verse 2]
Did I know you?
Did I know you even then?
Before the clocks kept time
Before the world was made
From the cruel sun
You were shelter
You were my shelter and my shade

[Chorus 2]
If you go there with me
Wild honey
You can do just what you please
Wild honey
Yeah, just blowing in the breeze
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild

[Verse 3]
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
Where you left me
Are you still growing wild
With everything tame around you?
I send you flowers
Cut flowers for your hall
I know your garden's full
But is there sweetness at all?

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh
What is soul?
Love me
Give me soul

[Chorus 3]
If you go there, go with me
Wild honey
Won't you take me, take me please?
Wild honey
Yeah, swinging through the trees
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild
