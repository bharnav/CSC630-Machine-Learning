I never thought I'd get here; I was so far away
I didn't believe in love, thought it was just a game
People played
Everything changed when I met you
I touched your hand, you took my heart
And you led me to a better place, just the two of us
In the dark...
This is my idea of heaven, lying here with you
This is my idea of heaven, nothing else, I'd rather do

I never thought you'd get here, why'd you make me wait?
And when I looked into your eyes, I recognised your words
My faith
I've been living in a lonely shell, with no windows, to the world
How in God's name did you find, a lonestar
Loneliest girl...
This is my idea of heaven, lying here with you
This is my idea of heaven, nothing else, I'd rather do

To feel your heart, beating
To feel our limits, meeting
This is my idea of heaven, ooh
In heaven, love is everywhere
There is no pain, there are no tears
In heaven, love lasts forever, it doesn't, disappear...
This is my idea of heaven, lying here with you
This is my idea of heaven, nothing else, I'd rather do

To feel your heart, beating
To feel our limits, meeting
This is my idea of heaven, ooh
This is my idea of heaven, lying here with you
