I'm happy and at ease, with love as it has turned out to be now
You, will be the man I like, besides when all is said and is done with
And we will fly, into a brand new sky

There's something in the air, I need it, I want more of it
A certain dive'll make it but I don't, I'm loving it

I never hesitate to fall, I forget how much I want it, get all in
My dreams ripping the seal, I hope you don't get to use me and my dreaming
'Cos they will fade, into, brighter days

There's something in the air, I need it, I want more of it
A certain dive'll make it but I don't, I'm loving it

Maybe, as long, as we're together
Maybe, this love, is never over
You may stop your dreaming

There's something in the air, I need it, I want more of it
A certain dive'll make it but I don't, I'm loving it

There's something in the air, I need it, I want more of it
A certain dive'll make it but I don't, I'm loving it
