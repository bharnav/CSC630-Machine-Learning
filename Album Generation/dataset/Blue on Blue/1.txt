Dreamed I was in a desert
Without any love
Storm grey clouds
Hovering above
Silence all around me I was wondering alone
And I realized there is nothing anyone can really own

And I wished for guidance
And I wished for peace
I could see the lightning
Somewhere in the east
And I wished for affection
And I wished for calm
As I lay there
Nervous in the light of dawn

It's hard to change
And it's hard to move
It takes years for rough
To be made smooth
You can use up all of your
Precious energy
To be tossed like a shell
From the hungry sea

And I wished for guidance
And I wished for peace
I could see the lightning
Somewhere in the east
And I wished for affection
And I wished for calm
As I lay there
Nervous in the light of dawn
As I lay there
Nervous in the light of dawn

Hold me in your arms
Until I fall asleep
I'm so tired of
Me

And I wished for guidance
And I wished for peace
I could see the lightning
Somewhere in the east
And I wished for affection
And I wished for calm
As I lay there
Nervous in the light of dawn
As I lay there
Nervous in the light of dawn
