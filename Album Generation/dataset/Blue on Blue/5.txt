Making love, behind shades
An open book, let the print fade
You may feel you're opening, but I'll be undercover
Until you need me, that's where I'll be

I'm talking to you, not the wailing one
If that's what you do, this lake may fall

Between the lines, can you read me?
Between the lines, that's where I'll be
Between 'hello', and 'I would give you the moon'
Between 'I love you' and, 'I, I'll see you soon'

As long as you've been screaming, I think you listen
'Cos I tried getting my words, off the ground
I'm shaking my fist, trying to feel like I'm something, not just the long way around

I'm talking to you, not the wailing one
If that's what you do, this lake may fall

Between the lines, can you read me?
Between the lines, that's where I'll be
Between 'hello', and 'I would give you the moon'
Between 'I love you' and, 'I, I'll see you soon'

I won't hide, from you, I won't cover my ears
You've gotta get through
One day, my eyes will be revealed when I try to conceal them

Between the lines, can you read me?
Between the lines, that's where I'll be
Between 'hello', and 'I would give you the moon'
Between 'I love you' and, 'I, I'll see you soon'

I'm talking to you, not the wailing one
If that's what you do, this lake may fall

Between the lines, can you read me?
Between the lines, that's where I'll be
Between the lines...
Between the lines...
Between the lines...
