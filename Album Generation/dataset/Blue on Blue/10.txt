I know I've been gone
For a long, long, while
I've been singin' a song
When all I want is to see you smile

About the time I get there
I forget why I'm gone

I wonder, why just a little
I'm always wanting something more?
Life is a riddle
I wish, I had the answer for

Love breaks your heart
To teach you to be strong
I die just a little
So I can live a little bit more

Like your eyes
You can have rainbows without rays
In the morning light
I'll be holding you again

Don't forget our music won't disappear
'Cause there's no end

I wonder why, just a little
I'm always wanting something more?
Life is a riddle
That I don't have the answer for

Love breaks your heart
To teach you to be strong
I die just a little
So I can live a little bit more

I will sing to you
When the road sings me to sleep
Maybe you stay with me
And I will give you songs, you can keep

I wonder, why just a little
I'm always wanting something more?
Life is a riddle
I wish, I had the answer for

Love breaks your heart
To teach you to be strong
I die just a little
So I can live a little bit more
