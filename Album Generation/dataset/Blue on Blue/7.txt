I've been walking just a little bit taller
My problems seem a whole lot smaller, and I've been thinking the reason must be you
When I'm feeling the tears start to swell up, I look and you and go right ahead and well up
'Cos you put your head right next to mine and I'm in love
I'm in heavenly love

You're my angel tonight, you make everything all right
You're my angel tonight, and you help me find the light I lost again
Lalalalalala, all again, lalalalalala

The world seems a little bit better, every time you and I are together and this feeling is gonna keep revolving
Tonight I feel the rain on my shoulders, I imagine that I should feel colder but I know that I'll be with you when I get home
So I'll hang on

You're my angel tonight, you make everything all right
You're my angel tonight, and you help me find the light I lost again
Lalalalalala, all again, lalalalalala

And when we find ourselves where we started before
We'll go back and start the clock all over again
You're my summer, you're my winter, you're my every reason

You're my angel tonight, you make everything all right
You're my angel tonight, and you help me find the light I lost again
You're my angel tonight, you make everything all right
You're my angel tonight, and you help me find the light I lost again
Lalalalalala, all again, lalalalalala
Lalalalalala, all again, lalalalalala
Lalalalalala, all again, lalalalalala...
