[Verse 1:]
If you ask me to come, I'll say, "Go"
If you say you love me, I'll say, "Sure, if you say so"
Whatever you tell me, I won't believe you
And if you try, try to make me
Ooh, I would like to know
Which one is willing to lose?

[Chorus:]
All along the wall between us
I see a teacher there for us
I look at the moon and see right through it
I lean on the wall there for us

[Verse 2:]
There is a door where I am standing
Without a key, without a clue
Without you, I am wondering
Wondering about you
It's a cold cold night, are you gonna call me?
Tell me about how I go on and on
About you being like it used to be
How it's all about me
Ooh, I would like to know
Who is the wounded one?
Which one will make the move?
Which one is willing to lose?

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You're my Heaven and my Hell
And my feet, the only sound
You're the shadow in my mind
I am hollow all the time

[Chorus]

I see a teacher there for us
I look at the moon and see right through it
I lean on the wall there for us
