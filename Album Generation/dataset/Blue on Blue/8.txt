Everything is green, everyone is blue, and me too
Be careful for what you dream, 'cos my dream was you
And you came true

I tried to know you, but to know you, is to be blue
And I'm blue, and I'm blue

I'll say goodbye to me, I'll say goodbye to you, 'cos I can't move
The world won't bend, you know, for you to see the love, is worth all the trouble

I tried to know you, but to know you, is to be blue
And I'm blue, and I'm blue

(There is a dream that I can't fit in) There is a dream that I can't fit in
A lead that I can't fill, all of my hopes have been diminished, you're not having it, I'm trying to give, oh

I tried to know you, but to know you, is to be blue
I said goodbye but I'm still in love with you
And I'm blue, and I'm blue
