Not yet, no heart or flower
Nothing speaks to me
I am your indolent soldier
No authority have I
Daydreaming, fetal feeling, on the void again
I am close, getting closer, closer to the end

Oh my lover, morning's after me
No more running
Face the dawn and turn your back on me

Blue eyed lizard, I am ordered to withdraw
Strip mined my own mind
With a needle needle crawl
Replace, abandon a love that couldn't give no more
Is it wrong?
To be long for a world I've never seen before

Oh my lover, morning's after me
No more running
Face the dawn and turn your back on me
A crack in the brances hung from the family tree

Morning's after me
The other side, the boy the soldier be
Into the light, into the void, I am free
Another life morning after
A crack in the branches hung from the family tree
