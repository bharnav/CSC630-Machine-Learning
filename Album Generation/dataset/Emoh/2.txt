Hit me like a kick to a thickening gut
The beat has done beaten me up
No one's gonna lift me out of this rut
The groove has done ground me to dust
I'm knocking on the wrong cocoon
Spun another web of lies

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight

Did you feel the beat in a fetal curl?
Could you be original, caterpillar girl
Crawling up the vine
Splitting your spine

Flowing through the motions
Leave your shell behind

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight
Away...
Look out
The birds like me
They want you now
They want you now
Caterpillar Girl

And then you break through
And dry before my eyes
Take me with you
Where you hide tonight
