Where'd the kitty come from, and where'd the kitty go
The kitty's always hungry, I told the kitty no
So the kitty had to ramble, she had to roam
Where'd the kitty come from, where did the kitty go

Now Hector was the son of a mountain lion
She heard him crying, she followed him in
And she became the apple of my eye
But when Hector couldn't love her
My Daykitty said goodbye

She belonged to another family up the street
I knew they couldn't love her even half as much as I
I love the kitty in the morning
Love her every night
The day she left me, I hung my head and cried

Where'd the kitty come from, and where'd the kitty go
The kitty's always hungry, I told the kitty no
Did she have to ramble, did she have to roam
Where'd she come from, where did the kitty go

You know she returned the very next day
We took her to the doctor, the doctor did say
The kitty weren't a woman
No the kitty was a man
Took him home, he ate a whole can
Now he and Hector are friends
I think he's gonna stay
I think he really loves us, all he wanna do is play
And you should see him sleeping in my lovers arms
I know you'd wanna keep him
But Daykitty is ours

Now where'd the kitty come from, and where'd the kitty go
The kitty's always hungry, I told the kitty no
So the kitty had to ramble, the kitty had to roam
Where'd the kitty come from, where did the kitty go

... Wherever he came from, now he's got a home
If he ever leaves again, I'll be home
