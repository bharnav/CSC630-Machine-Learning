Out on the streets
That's where we'll meet
You make the night
I always cross the line
Tighten the belt
Abuse ourselves
Get in our way
We'll put you on your shelf
Another day
Another way
We're gonna go
And then we'll see you again
I've had enough
I've had enough
All the same she said
I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up with me
I knew right from the start
You put an arrow through my heart
Round and round
Well, love will find a way just give it time
Round and round
And what comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, why, why yeah
Looking at you
Looking at me
The way you move
You know it's easy to see
The neons lights are on me tonight
I've got a way
I'm gonna prove it tonight
Like Romeo to Juliette
Tounge in time
I'm gonna make you mine
I've had enough
We've had enough
All the same
She said
I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up with me
I knew right from the start
You put an arrow through my heart
Round and round
Well, love will find a way just give it time
Round and round
And what comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, why, why yeah
Round and round
Well, love will find a way just give it time
