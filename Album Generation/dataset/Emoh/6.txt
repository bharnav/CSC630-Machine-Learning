If I could be your lover, be your lover true
One day to be discovered lying next to you
But I know my lack of grace continues to turn you off
And this could be my fate here never to be touched
Wish I could be, if I could be

I feel it in the morning, nothing going on tonight
And I get the feeling that my love for you's not right
And I can't help thinking that you might not like my style
Watching television let me chew on you awhile

Then face down
So face down
Love me tonight
Love me tonight

But what if my fortune turns, will I turn away?
The battle of the heart we wage, the quiet game we play
What if it's me unequal? I'm the one who's not
Excited forever with it in your touch
I'd miss you way too much

But you'd feel it in the morning, nothing going on tonight
And you'd get the feeling that your love for me's not right
We're always turning but never turn away
I'll try to be patient tell me everything's OK

Hmmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Hmmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Hmmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Love me tonight
Hmmmm, hmmm, hmmm
Love me tonight
