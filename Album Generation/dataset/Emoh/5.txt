It's a puzzle that served us well
I think you're funny, and you love my smell
But not enough, a lifetime of stuff we could want
We were simply buried alive
Trapped in a rapture tied to the sky
Cuddle on the couch, tranquilize
And then you left me, if only in your eyes
Don't you want me?

Rusted halo, use your wings
Hands on your hip Miss Didn't Miss a Thing
You're not mine, though you wear that ring on your finger
One crush had me crawling away
You crush me, brush me aside
But how could I be surprised?
That in between my shadow and your light
I did lose you

Fly without me, never be denied
Let it happen, fall you'll be alright
I will catch you

Fly without me, never be denied
If you love me, tell me with your eyes
They never lie

It's been a long year this year
Good or bad, I can't tell from here
What a thrill, mop up the spill with my heart
There's a puzzle in your angel eyes
A piece we may never find
A piece we may never find, at the same time
In between my shadow and your light
There's an answer
In between my shadow and your light
