Rolling from your brat sarcastic eye
A California tear, a drop of gold
Maybe you were cold, yeah, so was I
Holding back, holding back the year

The year before the poison took its toll
Made you paper thin, me wrinkled old
Eventually yeah, finally it caught up
I held you back, grabbed you by the arm
I played upon your fear
Rolling down the window won't I
Order up some breakfast if I can
Hold me back, hold me by the arm
Wipe away my tear
Wipe away my tear

The story ends with friends and early nights
A kitten grown to cat and no more fight
This is how we stay together love
Holding back, holding back the year
Hold me back, grab me by the arm
Whisper in my ear
Holding back the year
Holding back the year
