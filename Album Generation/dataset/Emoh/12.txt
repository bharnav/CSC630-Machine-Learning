My blood ran hot, I turned to liquid
The day I held your hand in mine
It happened so slowly
Then there wasn't any time

You held the air between us carefully
The season turned behind the wheel
I became what you believed me to be
Fell the way you made me feel

Out of my imagined life
The circle in my brainn
The pattern trap that holds me back
If you could love me I could find a way

Now what of what the heart is wanting
That this day may not allow
Changes, planning
Things that cannot happen now
Change is happening right now

Out of my imagined life
The circle in my brain
The pattern trap that holds me back
If you could love me
I could find a way, away
