Who are your royalty, who are you trying to please
Who will you follow tonight
I know that look you get playing dumb for respect
There when our eyes just met, off with you, go play the room

What do you have in mind, kind of Frankenstein
Pieces of people you know
Collected, rearranged, who's around, how to change
How to be perfectly cool
I've seen you bend and shape, turn on me I can wait
Soon we'll be here all alone
Slowly reappear, not tonight I fear
You've found a new you to be
Someone, nothing like me

Don't let me pick a fight
Let me say goodnight and go ome
Before I'm enraged
You are getting too close to the throne

Could be in me, my jealousy, making things ugly again
Making me curse your name, light a fire of blame
Burning what good things we had
Making me nothing but sad

No, it's not me, I am one of the many
You've used and betrayed, in your way
On your way
And I know you don't know what you do

When you find your king
When you find your queen
You'll do anything but try
To be honest and true, not hide
