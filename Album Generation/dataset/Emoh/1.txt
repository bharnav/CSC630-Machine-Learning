Look at you hiding behind your sweater
What I want to say
Let it fall away
I don't care

If we're alone, can be trusted on my own
I can never bring you home

Second guess I drift in all directions
Once impressed, half undressed all day
I'm not strong You don't believe
I may be wrong
That I can never bring you home

If I do and don't resist you
I'm too in love to really miss you
In fact I'm frozen over joy

Yes I did and yes I want to
But nothing good can come to
Someone pretending he is alone

Yes I did and yes I want to
But nothing good can come to
Someone pretending he is alone
Who can never bring you home
