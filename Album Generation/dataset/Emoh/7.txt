For balance and control, a battle rages in my soul
Am I monkey, am I man?
One finger holding back the dam
Confusion was alright, until it kept me up at night
Heavy breathing ok, until you took my breath away

Now I feel like I've just begun
I feel I've just begun
There's no worry, we're all undone
I feel I've just be.. feel I've just begun

Am I ever overconfident?
Have I ever been untrue?
I've been over and under and through
Nothing much at all, oh there's so much more to do

Now I feel like I've just begun
I feel I've just begun
There's no hurry, no race to run
I feel I've just be.. life has just begun

Something ended, before it ended
(Feel a sunset in your eyes)
We're alright
