I know you've given all that you can give to me
I know there'll come a day I understand
Until then I'll be trying to solve your mystery
And wonder why I couldn't make you stay

Smiling through denial, my specialty
I thought that was a good thing for a while
You gave me all your secrets were you testing me?
How could I do anything but smile?

Reenact your legendary tragedy
And do to me what has been done to you
Is that the only point to all this misery?
Is there any reason I should cry?

Heal takes time
And you gave me all you had
I know in time I will believe
That I loved you
Did you love me?
Did you love me?

Heal it takes time
And you gave me all you had
I know in time I will believe
That I loved you
You loved me
You loved me
