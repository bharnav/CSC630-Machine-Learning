Immaculate conception, yeah right
Crazing Mary, good that you lied
A test tomb baby, seed of the lord
Breaking the law with the man next door

Blame it on it an angel, they'll believe
Joseph will wonder but you know he won't leave
Cause they all love you, I still do
Magic in the air swirling all around you

Mary, Mary under veil of stars
You changed the world, you broke my heart
Thank you Mary, you saved me too
They'd stone us both if they ever knew

You sold out the manger, well all right
The mystery baby got a supernova spotlight
They say that he's the one
Brother Joseph got a king for a stepson

Mary, Mary under veil of stars
You changed the world, you broke my heart
Thank you Mary, you saved me too
They'd stone us both if they ever knew

Mary kissed me, we lost control
The oldest story never told
Crazy Mary, forever divine
They'll never know the baby's mine

Mary, Mary under veil of stars
You changed the world, you broke my heart
You changed the world, you broke my heart
Thank you Mary, you saved me too
They'd stone us both if they ever knew
They'll never know the baby's mine
