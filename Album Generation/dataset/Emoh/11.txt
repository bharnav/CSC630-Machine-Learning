I've been up, down, knees, cloud
Fading into view
Rise and fall, don't we all, love to be confused

Make it natural naked fun
Force it make it wrong
Wait a day, a year, far too long
Don't you feel abused?

Drifting through the night, nodding at the moon
Waited till the day withdrew, confused

Are you here to give it back?
Are you afraid I won't let go?
That I'm a warm denier, a cold desire
Remote without control

Cross the border through your room and into mine
If there's something you want
Let it tell you what to do
Tonight let's feast on you, confused
