The river winds 'round these little green hills
And stays in the woods for days
We were built to consider the unmanifested
And make of love an immaculate place

I hear a smile and a tear in you voice
Don't lay the groundwork for a case of remorse
When you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind
I'll come back the way that I came
Shot of dixie hemlock will take care of the pain

Now a man keeps his money folded square in his pocket
And doesn't take everything that he could
He'll rise like a lion and line himself up
With the poor, the fair, and the good

When you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind
Will you hang a lamp at the end of the lane?
Black-eyed Susans from the Maryland shore
We'll trim back the thorns around the hospital door
More will be seen than will be understood
Go with the poor, the fair, and the good
The poor, the fair, and the good
