Where's the paper bag that holds the liquor?
Just in case I feel the need to puke
If we'd known what it'd take to get here
Would we have chosen to?

So you wanna build an altar on a summer night
You wanna smoke the gel off a fentanyl patch
Aintcha heard the news? Adam and Eve were Jews
And I always loved you to the max

I love you to the max (x3)

(Cassie) If it gets really really bad, if it ever gets really really bad...

(David) Let's not kid ourselves. It gets really really bad

Punks in the beerlight, burnouts in love
Punks in the beerlight, Toulouse-Lautrec
Punks in the beerlight, two burnouts in love
I always loved you to the max
I love you to the max (x5)
I love you to the...

Max!
