Where does an animal sleep
When the ground is wet?
Cows in the ballroom
Chickens in the farmer's corvette

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

How does an animal see
Once the sun is set?
Bandits in the capital
Limited civilian unrest

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

What kind of animal
Needs to smoke a cigarette?
Grass in the pasture
Is sharper than a bayonette

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed

Happiness won't leave me alone
Says a bird in his nest
Get a load of this fuckin' view
Its the best in the west

Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony
Sometimes a pony gets depressed
