Baby, won't you take this magnet
Maybe put my picture back on the fridge
I must've been crazy to let you get away like you did
Like a brown bird nesting in a Texaco sign
I got a point of view

[Chorus]
And the kicker is that
I'm getting back
Into getting back
Into you

I guess over time we became ducks
I never seemed to see you much
Then the world turned, time got away
We fell out of touch

I've been working at the airport bar
It's like Christmas in a submarine
Wings and brandy on a winter's night
I guess you wouldn't call it a scene

Now my ex-wife's living in the suburbs with her guru and her mom
Now she finds her consolation in the stardust of a bong
You can call it a spinoff, say it's a knockoff, title it part two

[Chorus]
But I'm getting back
Into getting back
Into getting back into you
