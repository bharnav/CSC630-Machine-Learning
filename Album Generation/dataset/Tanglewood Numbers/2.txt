I've been living in a k-hole
Ever since you went away
I've been down here day after day

I'd rather live in a trash can
Than see you happy with another man
Closed sign swinging in the window of the liquor store
Better get inside the kingdom and close the door

Andre was a young black Santa Claus
He didn't want to be like his daddy was
Better take the gun with you when you go
He'd rather be dead than anything he knows
Girl in the special economic zone

Closed sign swinging in the window of the liquor store
Better get inside the kingdom and close the door
