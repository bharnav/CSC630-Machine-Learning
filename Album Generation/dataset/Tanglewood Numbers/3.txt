Gold and Green
Red and Blue
Are the lights on the signs that line Charlotte avenue
From the corner window, I watch the falling white flakes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes

Animal shapes, animal shapes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes

We have no goodwill, no goodwill to give
To those who try to take away the things we need to live
Friend, this is from your friend, off of Natchez Trace
The last dream left worth believing starts with animal shapes

Animal shapes, animal shapes
Nothing better get in the way of whatever it takes

Later on, somewhere else, I said some things I didn't mean
Yes, I know everybody's on a first name basis with the king
From a corner window, I watch the falling snowflakes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes

Animal shapes, animal shapes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes
