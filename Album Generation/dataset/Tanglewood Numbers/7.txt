I heard they were taming the shrew
I heard the shrew was you
You might as well say fuck me cause I'm gonna keep on
Keep on loving you

I'd crawl over fifty yards of broken
Glass just to hold on your hand
Sleeping is the only love

I had this friend his name was Marc with a "c"
His sister was like the heat coming off the back of an old TV
Their folks were slain in their Red Boiling Springs home
It was the worst of the Lord, some of the worst of the Lord

Later I come to find
Life is sweeter than Jewish wine
Give a box of candy or a foot massage
Some people don't take the time

I'd craw over fifty yards of burning
Coals just to make it with you
Sleeping is the only love

Sleeping is the only love
