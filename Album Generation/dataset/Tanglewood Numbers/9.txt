There is a place past the blues
I never want to see again
There is a place past the blues
I never want to see

Black planet
Black freighter
Black sea

Police conversation 1783

I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world

I could not love the world entire
There grew a desert in my mind
I took a hammer to it all
Like an insane medieval king

I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world
I saw God's shadow on this world

I could not love the world entire
There grew a desert in my mind
I took a hammer to it all
I took a hammer to it all

I saw God's shadow on this world
