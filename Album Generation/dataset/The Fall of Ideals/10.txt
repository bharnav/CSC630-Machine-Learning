[Verse 1]
Eyes fill with hatred
When they fall upon me
You worship gods of violence and bigotry
Forgetting lessons learned that prove these the wrong ideals

[Verse 2]
Don't let me follow in the footsteps
I won't embrace these wrong ideals
This thirst for violence, domination
It only serves your wrong beliefs

[Chorus]
This is, my indictment, of your beliefs
This is, my indictment, of what you hold dear

[Verse 3]
Your evil consumes you (Your evil consumes you!)
A jealous few incite ignorant followers
Invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us
For fear that I embody what you fear

[Chorus]
This is, my indictment, of your beliefs
This is, my indictment, of what you hold dear

[Bridge]
My eyes have seen the horrors that you
Commit in the name of your god
Your god is violence!
Your god is unholy!
Your god is violence!
Your god is unholy!

Watch out!

[Guitar Solo]

Eyes fill with hatred, when they, fall upon me
Invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us
For fear that I embody what you fear!

Your god is violence!
Your god is unholy!
Your god is violence!
Your god is unholy!
