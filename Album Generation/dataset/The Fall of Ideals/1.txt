[Intro]
No more

[Verse 1]
No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward
Never has the blood in my veins
Flowed so fiercely as when I feel this around me
I am whole

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

[Verse 2]
Now I feel the passion burning
This, what drives me further, strengthens
My resolve to push me further

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believe
That I am not alone
I'm not alone

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

[Bridge]
Give me hot steel go!

[Guitar Solo]

No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward
Now I feel the passion burning
This, what drives me further, strengthens
My resolve to push me further

[Chorus]
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again!

[Outro]
I am whole again!
I am whole again!
