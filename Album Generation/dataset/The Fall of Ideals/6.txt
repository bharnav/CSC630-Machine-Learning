[Intro]
Yooooow!
I wish I was free of this

[Verse 1]
I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
(But she still haunts me and I)
Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
(But I know that would kill me)

[Chorus]
No!
Damn her; still, I choke on her lies
Still reeling from her last caress, her goodbye

[Verse 2]
Oh, how this sickens me
This wretched fools' affair
(I can't erase this from me)
And now it permeates
And every thought I feel
The anger writhes in my soul

[Chorus]
No!
Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high — I'm strong
No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling, I'm strong

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high — I'm strong
No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling, I'm strong

[Outro]
Yooooow!
I wish I was free of this!
