[Verse 1]
It may seem at last, days passing, mean nothing
But the sun that sets cause only pain
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

[Verse 2]
Her touch
Poison
Flows through my veins
No more
I denounce all your childish games

[Chorus]
Whispers, I hear your
Poison, flows in me
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

[Verse 3]
Love lost!
Arrogant whore!
Paint strife on this canvas
Failure!
I am a fool, I should have seen

[Verse 4]
Whispers, poison
Break my bonds again. (break my bonds again!)
Love lost, failure!
I should have seen
I should have seen!

[Chorus]
Whispers, I hear your
Poison, flows in me
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

[Bridge]
No more!
Lies!
No more!
Lies!

[Guitar Solo]

No more!
Lies!
No more!
No more lies!

It may seem at last, days passing mean nothing
But the suns that set cause only pain
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

[Pre-Chorus]
No more regrets
Face my fear alone
You made me whole
This I believe
Break these bonds again

[Chorus]
Whispers, I hear your
Poison, flows in me
Lost inside you, I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

Lost inside you, I'm not free of you!
Break my bonds again
