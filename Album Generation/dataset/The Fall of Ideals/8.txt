[Verse 1]
I will not relent, no, no!
Never live with defeat, never falter!
This, like the air that I breathe (like the air that I breathe!)
I will not choke on failure!

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will not choke on failure!

[Chorus]
I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling, I'm not broken yet
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs, now

[Verse 2]
I have suffered defeat, pain, loss
Still, I push to the edge, never falter
For this cements my beliefs (this cements my beliefs!)
I'll remain my own master

I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer defeat, never falter
For this cements my beliefs (this cements my beliefs!)
I will not choke on failure!

[Chorus][x2]
I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling, I'm not broken yet
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs, now

I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling, I'm not broken yet
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs, now

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I will not relent!
I will not relent, no, no!
I will not relent!
Never suffer defeat, never falter!

I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer, never falter
I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer, never falter
