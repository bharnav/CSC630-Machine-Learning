Summer comes and rain falls away
But the very next day it seems
The snow comes to stay

And you too will go just like the dog days do
I'll put on my hat, my gloves, my scarf
To keep the cold apart

But there are no hats, gloves, scarves for the heart
Just a cold wind that leaves its frosted mark

Don't forget that I will always love you
Just a reminder to help you pave your pathway
Fall it cools, winter it snows
Spring it rains, summer comes and you go

And in my silly mind I've gotten married to you
You're across town, don't even have a clue
Or these images that in ten years
I'll run into you and fall right back inside of you

Don't forget that I will always love you
Just a reminder to help you pave your pathway
Fall it cools, winter it snows
Spring it rains, summer comes and you go

Don't forget that I will always love you
Just a reminder to help you pave your pathway
Fall it cools and winter snows
Spring it rains, summer comes and you go

So when will we meet next and where will it be?
On a platform track in an old movie
Cause time moves in circles and can leave you anywhere

Fall it cools and in the winter it snows
Spring it rains, summer comes and you go
