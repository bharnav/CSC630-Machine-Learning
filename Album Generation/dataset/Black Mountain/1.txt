Don't run our hearts around
Don't hit 'em to the ground
Let's find a better place
And quit this whole damn race

I've planned our great escape
Through lens and wire
I'm fast but you are quick

Don't run our hearts around

What they said
What they said you could become
Hit the lights
You're the chosen one
What they said you could become

Don't run our hearts around
