Shot through the head
I'm coming up on an overpass
Rifle Eyesight was lying low in the high grass
The empty skull lolls
Milky cataracts peel
Limpid limitless swimming outside the cranium
Betrayers of children exposed by distortions
His property swelling Lenses Alien

Shot through the neck
I bled correct
Something called me back
A bleacher fixture kidless grinning aorta plaque

Guts for abduction
Well my friend that's another thing
We parted curtains to watch comings and goings
The sun distends through Lenses Alien
On Lake Sedation some drugged corrupt husk
Scrubbed up for the surgery
Waking splayed in fiberglass-pink
A silent space
A Planet Pain

But you can't bore a hole to a cavity where the soul lives
Vaseline Hands
The door slams behind us in a flesh lined heaven
Cities of coral complexity
Where drowning forms thrashed up from central densities
Having a stroke I learned a new way to see
Tea-colored trout lairs and gold frozen bodies
The crawlspace grave he improvised
Believe

At that bone altar
Oh I'm hollow and I'm bankrupt
Palpate its baby teeth nodules with insensate fingers
That raised ranch lambent bay windows say benign

At that bone altar
Oh I'm hollow and I'm bankrupt
Palpate its baby teeth nodules with insensate fingers
That raised ranch lambent bay windows say benign

But tell me what former police
Sits at the bus stop offering rides
