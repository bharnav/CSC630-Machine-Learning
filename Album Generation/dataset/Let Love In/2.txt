[Verse 1]
You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry
All you remember now
Is what you feel
The truth remains
In midnight conversations
I asked for this moment
But you turned away

[Verse 2]
Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled
I ask you for more
But you push me away

[Chorus 1]
And if we feel the silence
Holding this all inside us
Everything means more now than
Words could explain

[Chorus 2]
And if we feel the silence
Leaving this all behind us
Looking for
Something more to say

[Verse 3]
I don't know where I'm going
Only know where I been
But you move through my soul
Like a hurricane wind
We've been so lost for so long
I don't know how to get back again

[Verse 4]
And we're drowning in the water
That flows under this bridge
When you're fighting the current
You forget how to live
And I wanted to reach you
But I don't know where to begin
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled until today

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
And if we feel the silence
Leavin' this all behind us
When it's gone
What will you say?

[Bridge]
How do we hold on? [x4]
How do we hold, yeah?

[Outro]
You lie awake at night
With blue eyes that never cry
