[Verse 1]
You're liking what I say
Guess I was afraid you'd run away now
I'm loyal like a stray
Never going to turn and run away now
A passion junkie's fix is never satisfied
You're never going to break his heart so have some fun abuse it
Strange Love
You're a Strange One

[Verse 2]
You washed away your yesterday
I saw you cleaning up
A bucket full of doubts
And a little bit of power grabbing
When it's all done
What are you going to do
With you
A passion junkie's dog ain't got a collar on
He's never going to break so go ahead and shake him

[Chorus]
Strange Love
Breaks Us Down
Strange Love
Though nothing's going to break us now

[Bridge]
And you're acting suprised
Oh, all of the time
Into your charms
Slips my life

[Chorus]
