[Verse 1]
And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Verse 2]
I need someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Bridge]
I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Outro]
Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
