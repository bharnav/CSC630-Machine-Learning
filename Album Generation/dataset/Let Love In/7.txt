[Verse 1]
You said you'd light a candle
And you'd say a prayer for me
I feel the light has dimmed and gone
Half the world is begging
While the other half steals
Where did everything go wrong?

[Chorus 1]
Some days I can't believe
Others, I'm on my knees
Trying to be heard

[Chorus 2]
I was your anger
And you were my fear
Now that it's over
Of course it's so clear
But you were no angel
And I was no sin
Somehow I can't let it go
I can't let it go

[Verse 2]
And half the world is sleeping
While the other half dreams
You close your eyes
And then you're gone
And maybe my intentions
Have been misunderstood
I know you feel so beautifully wronged

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
And laughter is my soul's release
But we're not smiling anymore
And can't we try to win this peace?
'Cause we're never going to win
Never going to win this war

[Chorus 2]
