[Verse 1]
Why are you so green
How can you say that to me?
When did you fall from grace?
You've got a dirty face
And it's killing me

[Chorus]
Why don't you listen?
Why don't you listen to me?
I'm drownin' but I never felt so free

[Verse 2]
Can you follow me?
Will you justify me please?
Said you're wrong
Said you're gone
I'll guess I'll wait another night
For what you're going to say
Back to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I try
But I never try too long
When you're gone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Why don't you listen / hear what you're missing
