[Verse 1]
I want to help you
But I don't know how
I want to soothe you
But i can't speak out

[Pre Chorus]
I have many fears about rejection
I have many memories of pain
I have always been a little shy
So i'll turn and look the other way

[Chorus]
Other way
Other way
I will turn and look the other way

[Verse 2]
I want to hold you
But i am afraid
I want to touch you
But i'm not that way

[Pre Chorus 2]
I have many doubts about my motives
I have many fears about my greed
I have always hurt the one that i love
So i'll turn and look the other way

[Chorus]

[Pre Chorus 2]

[Chorus] x3

[Outro]
The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
