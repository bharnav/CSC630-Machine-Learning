[Verse 1]
When you're out with your friends
In your new Mercedes-Benz
And you're on drugs
And you show up late for school
Cause you think you're really cool
When you're on drugs
And you put on your headphones
And you step into the zone
When you're on drugs
But the world don't care
If you are or are not there
Cause you're on drugs

[Chorus]
Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

[Verse 2]
And you twitch in your seat
Cause you wanna hit the street
When you're on drugs
And you cause such a fuss
Cause there's no one you can trust
When you're on drugs
And the best of your days
Will all vanish in the haze
When you're on drugs
And you wish you could quit
Cause you're really sick of it
But you're on drugs

[Chorus]
Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

[Bridge]
I want to reach a higher place
Where things will never be the same

[Chorus]
Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

[Outro]
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
