[Verse 1]
When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue

You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness

[Chorus]
You are my best friend
And I love you, and I love you
Yes I do

[Verse 2]
There is no other one that can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you I need you

[Chorus]

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying

[Chorus](*2)

[Outro]
Yes I do...
Yes I do
