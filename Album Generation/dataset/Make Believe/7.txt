I tried my best, I gave my all
Sometimes my best wasn't
Good enough for you
Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be
The meanest person in the world

[Chorus:]
So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me my friend

I never thought that anyone
Was more important than
The plans I made
But now I feel the shame
There's no one else to blame
For all the broken hearts
Are scattered on the field of war

[Chorus]

Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be
The meanest person in the world

So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
And in my heart I feel it's true
So I will be there with you
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me my friend
(I really want a friend)
