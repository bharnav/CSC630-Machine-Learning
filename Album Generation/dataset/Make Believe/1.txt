[Verse 1]
What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight
All I have to do is swing
And I'm a hero, but I'm a zero

[Verse 2]
Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable
Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
And I just pass through...

[Chorus]
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 3]
Get your hands off the girl
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander...
Can you blame her?

[Chorus]
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

[Bridge]
Tell me there's a logic out there
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come
Tell me there's some hope for me
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth
Oh..!!

[Chorus]
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

[Outro]
Singing...
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
