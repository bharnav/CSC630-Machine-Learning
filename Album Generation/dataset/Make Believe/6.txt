One more time
I have crossed the line
Now you won't be mine
Anymore

One more dream
Vanished up in smoke
Now i have no hope
Anymore

[Chorus]
Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world

One more loss
In a losing life
Doesn't hurt so bad
Anymore

[Chorus]

[guitar solo]

One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world

[Chorus]

I can't tell you
I can't tell you
I can't tell you
How the words have made me feel
