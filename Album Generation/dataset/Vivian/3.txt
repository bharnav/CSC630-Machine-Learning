(chorus)
You know i really loved you baby, but you had to ruin everything
Now im not gonna cry im just sayin' we could have been good together, damn
You know i really loved you baby, but you had to go and ruin everything
Now im a big girl im just sayin' we could have been good together, damn

So tired of waking up to your voice on my answerin' machine
Sayin' the things that two years ago you could never say to me
You must've called pretty late, you know im asleep, and you're ashamed to talk to me
And ashamed you should be cause you treated me so badly when i loved you

(chorus)
You say you miss me you love me i have moved forward you have moved back and why
You realized you made the biggest mistake well babe it's to late cause
I...
Am happy right now no ain't got a man just happy with my damn self
And i admit i loved you baby but i ain't crazy and dont want you back

(chorus)
It's so very nice to see that you developed a conscience
Over the years i accept your apology
But no i dont want you back why couldn't you see it then
Is it because you werent ready?
But my world dont revolve around you only me.........

(chorus)
