[Chorus x2:]
I'm cursed with loving you, baby
It hurts cause you'll never know it
I was put here to hopelessly love you
And you ain't thinking of me
That's the torture I go through

[Verse 1:]
It's been a long long time now
And I'm still trying to get you
Out of my head, of my heart
Of my whole damn soul

This love is still lingering
It's getting old
But it ain't dying
It's not even trying
And I can't fight it

I just bury it at the bottom
Hoping you might find
You are my love where my first
And now this love is just a curse
Oh, Yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I don't know why I even called
Thinking our time has come again
Cause the first time wasn't right

No, we were too young
I was too serious
You wanted to have fun
And now I look at us
And see How good it could be

If we could only get past the past
And see that the love we had is there
If we try it could last

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
I'll be always loving you
I'll be always loving you
No matter what or where
I'll always care

[Repeat Chorus x4:]
