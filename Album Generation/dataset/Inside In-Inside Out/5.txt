[Chorus]
But you don’t love me the way that I love you
’Cause if you did, girl, you would not do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

[Bridge]
But all I see of you is when you’re not so busy
Oh, you’re not so busy

[Chorus]
And you don’t love me the way that I love you
’Cause if you did, girl, you would not do the things you do
You turned my life around and for that, I am glad
However much I love you, this love is getting bad

[Verse 1]
And oh, my darling, you could choose
The words that only you could use
But you know you’ll always be my girl, girl
I’ll take you out just for a bite
And show you all the city sights
But you know you’ll always be my girl, girl

[Chorus ]
But you don’t love me the way that I love you, oh
’Cause if you did, boy, you would not do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

[Bridge]
But all I see of you is when you’re not so busy
Oh, when you’re not so busy
Girl, do-do-do

[Outro]
But you don’t love me, you don’t care, woman
And you don’t love me, you don’t care, oh, woman
’Cause you don’t love me, you don’t care, woman
You don’t love me, you don’t care, woman
