[Verse 1]
Take me back to the place where I loved that girl for all time
Why must life just take away every good thing one at a time?

[Chorus]
I want it back, well, yes, I want it back
Well, yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want your love

[Verse 2]
How can I not even cry for such a big thing in my life?
The pain, it takes the heart of me to turn around and say goodbye

[Chorus]
I want it back, well, yes, I want it back
Well, yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want you

[Bridge]
How did you do it, females?
It's always you do it, angels
You always keep me on the run
So how did you do it, angels?
And always you do it, females
You always keep me on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I want it back, well, yes, I, I want it back
Yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want your love
But I can't let myself love you
