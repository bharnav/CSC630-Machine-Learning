I have thought that you have come back lately
To take my soul away from me
'Cause when I see you
You rip my heart out
But all the same you're not to blame
Baby baby I love you still

But I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am
I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am

Do you remember how I met you, child?
I was down and I fell for you completely
When I wanted your heart and
You didn't want me now you did
But now you did

I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am
I need your heart dancing next to my heart
In love I am

Baby, do you love me still?
'Cause I miss you
I miss you
Baby
I miss you
