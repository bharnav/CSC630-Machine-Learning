[Verse 1]
Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
I fell in love at the seaside
I handled my charm with time and sleight of hand
Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
I fell in love at the seaside
She handled her charm with time and sleight of hand, and oh

[Bridge]
But I'm just trying to love you any kind of way
But I find it hard to love you, girl, when you're far away
Away

[Verse 2]
Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
But I fell in love on the seaside
On the seaside, in the seaside
