[Verse 1]
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Honey bee’s got two lies and she’s got me

[Chorus]
I tried to love her back
And then I shrunk back into my wrap
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I’m not the only one

[Verse 2]
Yes, I see the way she looked at me
Oh, she’s got an eye for an awkward guy like me

[Chorus]
I tried to love her back (she’s just a girl)
And then I shrunk back into my wrap (she’s just a girl)
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I’m not the only one
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I’m not the only one
Yeah

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do

[Chorus]
I tried to love her back (she’s just a girl)
And then I shrunk back into my wrap (she’s just a girl)
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I’m not the only one
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I’m not the only one
Yeah

[Bridge]
Do, do, do, do, do

[Outro]
I tried to love her back
And then I shrunk back in my wrap
And then I tried to love
I tried to love her back
