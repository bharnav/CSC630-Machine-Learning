[Verse 1]
You, you ain't got no love today
You, you ain't got no love today
Don't let them bring me down

[Verse 2]
You, you ain't got no love today
Don't let them bring me down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down

[Verse 3]
Don't let them bring me down
Don't let them bring me down
Got no love
Got no love
