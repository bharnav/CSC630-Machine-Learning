I can see that you're not ready for this. But I've waited for
Chaos since childhood my friend. And my life has all been a miss
What happens when things just keep going?
When the tides all subside & the fire is weak
And the world still exists in American bliss
It's time to let go. You're moments from death and all you
Worry about is your politics
Who caused the rapture?
Who brought this on?
(I did)
Would you have done it differently, (of Course)
I will accept this as, a natural couse
Embrace the eye witness; I've seen this dream
I'm so happy to be the last man standing...
(I'm so happy to be the last)

I could have done more...
Since my breaking point...
I could have done more, since my breaking point, I have
Fallen to crutches. All as the stellar sunset of evolution
Drips down my home
