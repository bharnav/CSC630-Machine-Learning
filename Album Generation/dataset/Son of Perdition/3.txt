My god was formed in the
South with a smile, And
Anger pent up till pearls
Brighten the sky, I need you
But when it's turned
I am sparse, Worthless, selfish
And sick for a start
I stole for my high and let
The revulsion rot inside...
Carving through my brain with an attentive pen
I stop myself from fixing things
Will it be the cane that
Pushes you to your dreams?
Or the cold clammy palms
With their impatient feet
Will it be the cane that
Pushes you to your dreams?
Or the regret you grasp
When the raptures believed
And we are gonna explode...
Blaze up into a crackling
Should-have
The sun has had its time
Our kind created nothing more than disease
Greeting a challenge with ease, Go, and pay, the respects
You ow To whoever saves you, I must scramble
Like the rodent I am
[Solo : Funderburk]
Will it be the cane that
Pushes you to your dreams?
Or the cold clammy palms
With their impatient feet
Will it be the cane that
Pushes you to your dreams?
Or the regret you grasp
When the raptures believed
