I remember I was thinking
You might be a friend
I remember I was thinking
This could be the end
But I never did, I never dared
Never cared enough
But I never did, I never dared
Maybe I was scared

And at times I have been hoping
Hoping this could be
Something more than hoping
Someone would follow me
No one ever did, no one ever dared
No one cared enough
No one ever did, no one ever dared
Maybe they were scared

The only one that got my back
Is my shadow, my shadow
