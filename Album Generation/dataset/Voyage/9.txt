Through the fear and fire
Past love and lust for gold
Within the darkest hour
There is still hope

And in the dead of night
Out somewhere in the sky
The sun will always shine
Burning with hope

And it will never ever go away

After all their lies
And how it haunted me
And what they made me be
There was still hope

Following the wind
To make it possible
Deep down I knew
That's what I'll do

'Cause it will never ever go away

When all is dead
You're feeling mislead
Just let it go, let it go away

Words they said
Have gone to your head
Just let it go away

Through the fear and fire
Past love and lust for gold
Within the darkest hour
There is still hope
That you'll come back to me

And you would never ever go away

When all is dead
You're feeling mislead
Just let it go, let it go away

Words they said
Have gone to your head
Just let it go away

Now feel my heart it's racing
Carrying the flame
All my bones are aching
I'll never be the same

Climbing up the endless
Learn to be your own
Drums sounding like thunder
Bring the boys back home
