Murder the art of the insane
A breed of terror born to destroy
Sickening thoughts, minds feeding on death
Craving for pain

The face of death, evil descends
From the throne of fatal contempt
Illusions embraced, evil seduce
Acts of man, with nothing to lose

Following the path
And my wisdom you will gain
Follow the one
In darkness and pain

Scenes of horror a call from beyond
Acts of lust, kill for fun
A black heart the devil's soul
Pure as stone, remorse for none
