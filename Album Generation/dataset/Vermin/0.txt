Elements of war
In cold human detest
Scan the world
Invade, kill the rest

No remorse
Come forth, demonize
Break through
Infest their soul

In silence of night as hell returns
Evils might completes
Raise the flag of hate
And praise shall be won
For the unborn son

Thou shall suffer in vain
Seal the world with contempt
Enslave and condemn
