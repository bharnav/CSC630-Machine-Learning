Signs through the end of time
Like a plague of sorrow
Pain infects the mind
Pollution injects

Demon's craving death
Infested souls
Demon's craving death
In silent force

Poison straming
Through the veins
Like acid reign
Dead eyes starring
Through the flesh
Searching to feed

Alien of foreign race
Possess and breed
Inside the wallsof thoughts
Feeding on life
