Darkness redeem us
From saviours of sin
Temptations of lust
The thorns from within

Souls dressed in vanity
Drained we shall die
Open your eyes
And be gone with the lies

Raised in disease
United we fall
Killed by the saints
More evil than all

Sons of the holy might
Children of war ready to fight
Raised by the book of lies
Evil behold dressed in disguise
