Sorrow the cause of my pain
Like thorns ripping in skin
Torment of silent screams
Awakes me from lifeless sleep

A storm of rage crushing all
That remains hidden inside
A war within human souls
That devour the spirit of man

The chain of life is upon me
Devil spawn raised to be possessed
Buried down below me
My soul lies dead
And awaits the arise
Pure is the faith
Strong is the wind
That leads towards
The endless pain

Life shall suffer
Crushed to remains
Dissolved into dust
The fuel to regain my pain
