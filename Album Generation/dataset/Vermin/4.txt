Dreams of fear
Wake up and be afraid
My kingdom awaits you
One force so black
In darkness domain
Rest eternal, eternal is mine

One soul one fire
To light the flame
Of the fall-en's defeat
Summon the dark
Walk through the flames
Death returns as evil awaits

Summon the beast, follow my path
The ancient arrives
Crucify those who we despise
Feed our cross

It's nothing to save
All will be lost
Lord of command
Bringer of hate
