[Vocals: Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro]

[Verse:]
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world

[Verse:]
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

[Chorus:]
All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Verse:]
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial

[Verse:]
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

[Chorus:]
All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Chorus:]
All I wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Chorus:]
All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Outro:]
(Oh...oh-oh...ee-oh...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah...)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...)
