[Verse 1]
If I never get back home
There's no garden overgrown
No widows in the walls
No widows left alone

[Verse 2]
No shirts to hang or fold
No kid out in the cold
No widows on the walls
No widows on the phone

[Verse 3]
If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all year
With just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

[Verse 4]
If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love above
No punishment below

[Chorus]
When they shake, say the wings won't break
When they shake, say the wings won't break

[Verse 3]
If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all year
With just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

[Verse 4]
If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love above
No punishment below

[Chorus]
When they shake, say the wings won't break
When they shake, say the wings won't break
