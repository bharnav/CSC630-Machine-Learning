[Verse 1]
You wanna climb up the stairs
I wanna push you back down
But I let you inside
So you can push me around

If I leave before you
And I walk out alone
Keep your hands to yourself
When you follow me home

[Hook]
I don't want love
I don't want love

[Verse 2]
We wake up with pounding heads
Bruised down below
I should have built better walls
Or slept in my clothes
So if I see you again
Desperate and stoned
Keep your prison locked up
And I will leave my gun at home

[Hook]
I don't want love
I don't want love

I don't want love
