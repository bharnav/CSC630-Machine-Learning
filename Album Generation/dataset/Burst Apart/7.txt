[Hook]
So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

[Verse 1]
They want to conquer you
Abandon you
I want to burden you
Belong to you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They want to think for you
Pour drinks into you
They want to look at you
While I look everywhere for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I want to sever you
Defend against you
I want to speak for you
As if I know what youâ€™ll do
