Feeling the lie and
Watching the full moon shine
Hearing the time creep on
Feeling the pain inside of your enzyme
Fear on good soul
Maybe it's time you move on
I thought this a miracle
But I'll never be the one for shameless feeling you
Stream
Maybe it's time we move on
Fear on good soul
Ah maybe it's time we move on
And time we stray
Just in line
And holdine the same red line
Moving on your face
Turning???
Inside of warning sign
Fear on a good soul
I thought this a miracle
And I'll never be the one for shameless feeling you
Stream
Maybe it's time we move on
Fear on good soul
Maybe it's time we move on
And time we stray
I'll never feel love
I'll never feel love for illusions
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time we stray

Stream
Oh maybe it's time we move on
Fear on good soul
Oh maybe it's time we move on
And time we stream
I'll never feel love
I'll never feel love for illusions
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time we stray
