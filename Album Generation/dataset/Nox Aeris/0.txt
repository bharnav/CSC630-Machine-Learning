Ghost's, they follow you home
Inspite of all you've learned
Inspite of all you, try and hide

Wake up, it's ticking in your head
Bleed out, it's killing you instead
Wake up it's ticking and it's killing you inside

Down in flames
Your burning now
There's a fire inside of you
Here we waste, all our life
And all our time, in flames

Faith, it finds you awake
Crawling on you knees
Crawling back the same old way

Wake up, it's ticking in your head
Bleed out, it's killing you instead
Wake up, ticking and it's killing you inside

Down in flames
Your burning now
There's a fire inside, of you
Here we waste, all our life
And all our time, in flames

(In flames! )

Down in flames
Your burning now
Here we waste, all our life
And all our time, in flames

Down in flames
Down in flames
Down in flames!
