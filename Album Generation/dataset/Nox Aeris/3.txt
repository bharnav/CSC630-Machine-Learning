Caught in line stuck fooling round each lie
Parilyzed and forcing the same smile
Carry on pleading your case
Head down loading the lie
Calling your name
Wearing you down
All that she gave, came from your lie
A million arms
Way out of range
Where will it end
Where will it all end
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise to no one at all
Where will it all end
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise to keep this in mind_?
How long will you lay down now
Pressurized and fearing your name call
Wearing down all that you came for
Stuck in line waiting on your turn
Head down grinding your teeth
Calling your name
Wearing you down
All that she gave came from your lie
A million arms
Way out of range
Where will it end
Where will it all end
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise to no one at all
Where will it all end
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise to keep this in mind_?
How long will you run
How far will you run
How far will you run
How far will you run
How far will you run
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise to no one at all
Where will it all end
How far will you run now
How long will you lay down
Tomorrows the promise so keep this in mind_?
How far will you run
