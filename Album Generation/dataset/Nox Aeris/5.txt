Here lies the waste of
All of your crimes
All that should lie
Buried now
Alone and useless
Killing your voice
Watching your time
Time closing down
Carry the weight
Of the burn of your change
Carries the weight of you
Stay down
Play dead
The more you move your neck
The more it steals your air
You're in above your head
Stay down
Play dead
Caught in your own device
Stealing your own design
You're in over your head
(Over your head)x3
Caught in the shoals
Of the riverine calls
Where the snake lies
Over you
Carry the weight
Of the burn of your change
Carries the weight of you
Stay down
Play dead
The more you move your neck
The more it steals your air
You're in above your head
Stay down
Play dead
Caught in your own device
Stealing your own design
You're in above your head
You're caught in this lie
Losing air
(Over your head)x3
Sit right
Sit still
Changing your mind
Sit calm
It comes
Burning your eyes
Sit right
Sit still
Changing your mind
Sit calm
It comes
Burning your eyes
Stay down
Play dead
The more you move your neck
The more it steals your air
Stay down
Play dead
Caught in your own device
Stealing your own design
You're in above your head
You're caught in this lie
Losing air
