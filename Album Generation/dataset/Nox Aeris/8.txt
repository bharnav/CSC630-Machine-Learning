I'm watching the days cleave
I'm fearing the use crawl
I'm wearing the face of
Know one that I know
And know one that I become
And know one that I can love
I'm hearing the wind fall
I'm chasing the storm that comes

[Chorus]
You're sick of the sun gods
You're sick of the sun that drains
That always rains down
Always rains
And you won't try
I'm always moving
Always rains down
Always rains down
I'm chewing the days off
I'm peeling the hours off
Spending the time on
Sparing us both the fall
I'm sparing us both the crawling
I'm saving us all you've saved up
Hearing the wind call
I'm chasing the storm that comes

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Too tired to run
Too angry with
Bearing it open
Believing the sign
Always rains down
Always rains
And you won't try
I'm always moving, I'm always moving
Always rains down
Always rains down
