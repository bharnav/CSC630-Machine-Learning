The stain that comes
Rushing out in space
They cried, it falls
Holding up this sinking place
War device
Simple sounding chime
A strange calm
Its slipping down its sinking fate
Polarized and frozen now
As the memory of your face
Stones that fall
Clearing up this space
The walls we climb
Setting up this sinking place
War device
Now a warning chime
A strange calm
Its pressing up this sinking fate
Polarized and frozen now
As the memory of your face
Fear rises and cold inside
Its the same mistake
The fame erased
Its the same mistake
The fame erased
Something comes on
Over my shadow
Someday summer bench
Splitting us
Splitting away
Something came on
Over us
Leave us alone
Someday summer bench
Polarized and frozen now
Like memory of your face
Fear rises and cold inside
Its the same mistake
The fame erased
Its the same mistake
The fame erased
