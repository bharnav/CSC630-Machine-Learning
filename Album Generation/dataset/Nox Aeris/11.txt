We loom
And we pray
And we crawl all around the room
And we feed off our own
Stained inside
By all we hide and
We're always apt to say
We'll never feel the same
It's not a lie
It's already in you now
We're always apt to say
We'll never feel the same
It's not a lie
It's already in me
The stains we hide
Always rely on
Believing the lie
Carved out in your mind
The stains we hide
Bury us all alive inside
'til it wears you out
Covered up
We're covered now
In stains
In stains
In stains
The stains
We aim for the light
We avoid our eyes
And try to feel like
We're alone
Stained inside
By all we hide
We're always apt to say
We'll never feel the same
It's not a lie
It's already in you now
We're always apt to say
We'll never feel the same
It's not a lie
It's already in me
The stains we hide
Always rely on
Believing the lie
Carved out in your mind
The stains we hide
Bury us all alive inside
'til it wears you out
Covered up
We're covered now
In stains
The stains
The stains
The stains
The stains
The stains we hide
Always rely on
Believing the lie
Carved out in your mind
The stains we hide
Bury us all alive inside
'til it wears you out
Covered up
We're covered now
In stains
The stains
