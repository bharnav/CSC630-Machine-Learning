She paints a world inside her room
A sea of violet covered stars
She finds a home inside this cold
She never sleeps enough to ever feel sane
I'll leave the light on
I'll leave the light on for you
Stay awake until the morning smiles
And finds you lifeless;
So lifeless and still so alone
Stay awake until the sun burns through
And leaves you lifeless
So lifeless and still so alone
Carry along this strange
Feeling you always hide
Carry along this face
Kicking the strings inside
I'm sorry it always seems like
I'm feeling the same mistake
I'm sorry it feels like
Hearing the same excuse
I'll leave the light on
I'll leave the light on for you
Stay awake until the morning smiles
And finds you lifeless;
So lifeless and still so alone
Stay awake until the sun burns through
And leaves you lifeless
So lifeless and still so alone
I'll leave the light on
I'll leave the light on for you
Stay awake until the morning smiles
And finds you lifeless;
So lifeless and still so alone
Stay awake until the sun burns through
And leaves you lifeless
So lifeless and still so alone
