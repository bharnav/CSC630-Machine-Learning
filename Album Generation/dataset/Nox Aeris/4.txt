Verse 1:
You aim all your arms
You take aim and send out a sign
To the army around you
They all stand away

Bridge:
You realize the faster that they run
The more space they run out of...

Chorus:
You're killing off the shadows
You bury them all the same side down
They keep calling out your name
You're killing off the shadows
You're killing 'em all the same way now
They keep calling out your name

Verse 2:
It seems all these signs...
It seems like they steer you the wrong way
Fearing your own face
They learn all your moves

Bridge:
You realize the faster that you run
The more space you run out of...

Chorus:
You're killing off the shadows
You bury them all the same side down
They keep calling out your name
You're killing off the shadows
You're killing 'em all the same way now
They keep calling out your name

Verse 3:
(Before you're gone...)
Pay your dues and then you're done
(A Pound of Flesh before you're gone...)
Pay your dues and then you're done
Ohhhhh...

Chorus:
You're killing off the shadows
You bury them all the same side down
They keep calling out your name
You're killing off the shadows
You're killing 'em all the same way now
They keep calling out your name
Outroduction:
They all know your face...
They all keep calling you
They keep calling out your name
