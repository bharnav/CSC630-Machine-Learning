Oh yeah
Oh, no
Alright

Downtown in the shade (Alright)
Staring at the sunshine in my face (Alright)
Telling me to come and hide, come and play (It's true)
I'm telling you the sun never goes away (It's true)
And all I do is talk, talk, talk all day (I didn't want it anyway)
And I'm talking my life away (I didn't want it anyway)
And I'm staring at the sun again (I say yeah, yeah)
And everything's fading (I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

Downtown in the clear (Alright)
All I know is nothing ever changes here (Alright)
And I know there's no excuse and no defense (It's true)
But my summer, summer, summertime it never ends (It's true)
And all I do is talk, talk, talk all day (It doesn't matter anyway)
And I'm laughing my life away (Doesn't matter anyway)
And I'm staring at the sun again (I say yeah, yeah)
'Til everything's fading (I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

Oh, yeah
Oh, no
Alright

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Alright
