All I want is everything
Everything that I'll ever be
All I want is everything
Everyone that's coming for me
Nothing happens and everything has changed
All I want is everything to stay the same

Will you give in?
Will you give in?

All I want is everything
All the words and the truths between
All I want is everything
Everything you're keeping from me
Nothing happens and everything has changed
All I want is everything to stay the same

Will you give in?
Will you give in?

I've been staring back in my eyes for a while
I think they'd never stop moving

All I want is everything
All the things that you think of me
All I want is everything
All you've tricked yourself to believe
Nothing happens and everything has changed
All I want is everything to stay the same

Will you give in?
Will you give in?
Will you give in?
Will you give in?
