(Verse)
I spent my whole life surrounded
And I spent my whole life alone
I wonder why, I never wonder why
The easiest things are so hard

(Bridge)
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want -

(Hook)
Something
Something for nothing
Something
Something for nothing
Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser
I'm accused and accuser
But nothing's unconditional

(Verse 2)
I hold the whole world accused
And I only got myself to blame
I wonder why, I never wonder why
The easiest things are so hard

(Bridge)
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want -

(Hook)
Something
Something for nothing
Something
Something for nothing

(Guitar Solo)

(Bridge)

(Hook)
Something, (I just want, I just want love)
Something for nothing
Something, (I just want, I just want love)
Something for nothing
Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser
I'm accused and accuser
But nothing's unconditional
