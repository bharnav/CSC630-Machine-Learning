All this time I should have known
One of these days you'd follow me home
Mess up my room and proceed to tempt me
And no matter how good I am you learn to resent me, yeah

Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire

I'm stingy with words
All binge, no purge
You put the broke in broken hearted
You put the art in retarded

Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire

Stop it, drop and roll
Stop it, drop and roll
Stop it, drop and roll
(Stop it, stop it, stop, stop, stop, stop it)
You're on fire
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire
Stop, drop and roll you're on fire
