Me and the ocean, me and the sea
I don't think so, I don't think it was meant to be
Take me off somewhere cold
Gradually just growing old
And someday maybe make of me an honest man

Yeah? Well...

I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke

Down by the ocean, walk by and see
All these people - they look so, they look so happy to me
What if all I want in this world
Turned out just to be an honest girl?
Turned out just to make of me an honest man?

Oh yeah? Well...

I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke

I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Life in this town makes it hard to see
Things that are right in front of me

Yeah

(Ba ba ba bada)

Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
I find in this town that it's hard to see
Things that are right in front of me
