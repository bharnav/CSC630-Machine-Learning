Hey sweet Eliza
Remember me
I'm a liar
But not a cheat, no...
I think it's safe to say
That I got carried away
Eliza, it's fooling anyone

Forgive me if I'm out of line
I can't control myself sometimes
I think I'm sick but I might be well
I think I'm broke but it's hard to tell
I think I feel like I've never felt for you, ooh

Hey sweet Cassandra
Remember me
You are no longer
The one I need, mmm...

I find it hard to tell
That I'm finally be an angel
And silence isn't fooling anyone

Forgive me if I'm out of line
I can't control myself sometimes
I think I'm sick but I might be well
I think I'm broke but it's hard to tell
I think I feel like I've never felt for you, ooh

Ooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

I think I'm sick but I might be well
I think I'm broke but it's hard to tell
I think I feel like I've never felt for you

Forgive me if I'm out of line
