[John Linnell]
Here comes

The last page
All I need is an ending


Nearing
The end of the last page
And the end of my whole book


Yeah
What to do with these loose ends?
I should change the beginning
But I shouldn't be typing
While I'm driving
While I'm making a phone call
While I'm searching through the glove box
While I'm writing it all down
While it's happening

They're gonna be so impressed

When they get a load of me



It's like I've got two
Extra pairs of hands
Two to write, two to steer, one to scratch
My head, and one
To cover my eyes which would
Help me to think up an end

Yeah
Some kind of punctua-
-tional mark
Some kind of
Some kind of

Some
Kind
Of

Trou-

-ble

Up

A-

-head

What

The

Hell?

What

The

Hell?


[John Flansburgh]

This truck
Is driving out
Of my mind
But this truck has a mind
Of its own

Which is a lucky thing
'Cause my leg
Is so short, that I can't
Reach the brake

This truck is driving out
Of my mind
But this truck has a mind
Of its own
Which is a lucky thing
'Cause my leg
Is so short that I can't
Reach the brake


Something is nagging at me

But never mind, it's gone

This truck
Can practically find its
Own way without my help

Maybe I should lie back
And cover my eyes
I think I'll do that

Yeah
Now I'm totally resting
I'm reclining
While I'm driving

Why

Have

I

Not

Tried

This

Un-
-til
Now?

I'm

Letting

Go

I'm

Letting

Go
