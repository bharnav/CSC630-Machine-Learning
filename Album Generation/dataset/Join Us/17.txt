[Verse 1]
I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

[Verse 2]
From across a crowded room you can feel me staring
And you know that I can see how it is
There's so much pleasure to be had from mystery and secret plans
But you don't like me
'Cause I can read your mind

[Chorus]
I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

[Verse 3]
I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

[Verse 4]
You like cigarettes, swimming laps, potato chips, Battleship, cats, and Court TV
You like shadow puppets, Woody Harrelson, reading in the bath, Nirvana, and baseball caps

[Verse 5]
You can hear me talking
Right up till I stop
When I do, I'm gone to you
But you are always there

[Vere 6]
I can hear the friendly words of advice that I'd be offered
If I had a friend to offer me advice
I'd be told to let it go and that I care too much
But this is not about me
And you don't want to know

[Chorus]
I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

[Outro]
You like Bollywood, snow machines, daguerreotypes, beauty contests, and cruise control
You like booster rockets, cutting with a fork, Terminator 2, the morning, and William Tell
