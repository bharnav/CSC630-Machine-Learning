Your new haircut is so unfamiliar
But they only know you that way
Your new teases are so hilarious
Well I never thought I'd hear you say

That I did the driving and the falling knives
Seemed anything was worth a try
You never said it but I think I get it
And maybe you were right

That I miss you Seven
I miss you Seven

Did you see me the way I imagined
Every eyelash a picket or a wire
Did you tease me when I went out of fashion
And your interest in me had expired

Well I stopped
But how can I really stop
And stay stopped?

I miss you Seven
(the distance helps me only so much)

Is it asking too much
Would you say that I
Am the last thing you want
To remember me by

I miss you Seven
(the distance helps me only so much)
