Did you say what you wanted said?
And now you're just putting the days to bed
Young actors want to play and play
And you'll play, but you're working

Call applicants and stole cornering them
We're all waiting for the big day
If you feel crazy that you're still crazy
It hasn't happened for a few days
Well just wait

In hindsight you're gonna wish you were here
You keep scratching at the old paint
But the wood is still there
And the room is still there

If you're trying to feel the wind
Well that's a window you're pressed against

You never told me your secrets
So I guess they stayed safe with me
Tall orders from such small shoulders
And invitations on blue paper

But I'm bailing water and bailing water
'cause I like the shape of the boat
You asked me and I told you
And you asked me and I told you and I told you

In hindsight you're gonna wish you were here
You keep scratching at the old paint
But the wood is still there
And the room is still there

If you're my anchor then I'm throwing you over the side
Before I have the time to say
I never wanted anyone this way
But I'm smoking cigarettes when no one else does
And if I hold you now will I be holding a snowball
When the season changes and I'm craving the sun?

Are you still training for the big race
By hoping the runners will die?
Churning the words of your disgrace
But it's how you are when you're down that counts

And you know we're a good thing
It's been a long time since you said
Put down your camera and let me ask you
Is this new move just to keep moving?

In hindsight you're gonna wish you were here
You keep scratching at the old paint
But the wood is still there
And the room is still there

If I kiss you now like sun streaming in a tavern's door
Would you wonder what I'm kissing you for?
