It's familiar
But not too familiar
But not too not familiar

It's a new craze
Hey good girls
Do you wanna?
Just say hey I wanna
Just say hey I wanna

It's a departure
It's a departure
It's a departure
It's a departure

It's a new craze
Hey good girls
Do you wanna?
Just say hey I wanna
Just say hey I wanna

I like the old days
But not all the old days
Only the good old days

It's a new craze
Hey good girls
Do you wanna?
Just say hey I wanna
Just say hey I wanna

Hey good girls
Do you wanna?
Just say hey I wanna
Just say hey I wanna

Hey good girls
Do you wanna?
Just say hey I wanna
