Fight, we can try
I'd love an answer that isn't sly
Or so, so you say
Don't toast the day before the twilight

For you I'm a pushover
I would if I could, I would
I just want you to say come on
Wish me luck wish me love

Unkind girlish walk
Like a deed to the world without the talk
As you wade through the crowd
I sit next to you, the seat still warm

For you I'm a pushover
I would if I could, I would
I just want you to say come on
Wish me luck wish me love
