I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

The way that she smiles me down
She claims to be clowning
I finally long for someone
Teaspoon

Two can just bleed into one
But only one does the bleeding
She calls me the alphabet gun
Teaspoon

I know I wasn't made to play on a team
You weighed your suitcase down but it still wouldn't sink
I know that crime doesn't pay
But I don't know any other way

She orders the pilot to land
She just wants to hold the man
Well I am her pilot today
Teaspoon
