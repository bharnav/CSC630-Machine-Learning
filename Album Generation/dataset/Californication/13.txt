[Verse 1]
One shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
Until death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

[Chorus]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
Looking fine, you're looking fine, get on 1999
Its right on time

[Verse 2]
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

[Chorus]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
Looking fine, you're looking fine, get on 1999
It's right on time


[Verse 3]
Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated

[Outro]
Oh Lord!
