Close to my skin, I'm falling in
Someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, I'm left alone
In another zone

John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail, yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste
Of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme

[Hook]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody closer can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun, cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do
I really do

Come closer now so you can lie
Right by my side
Sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself

[Hook x2]

Close to my skin, someone who's been
I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard

John says to live above hell
My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell
