[Verse 1]
Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand
To celebrate you is greater now that I can
Always my man

[Verse 2]
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for, misunderstand
All in a hand
Just like you cause you made me all that I am
All in a hand

[Chorus 1]
A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And any damage done will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

[Verse 3]
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior, he's just a man
All in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver, anyone can
Always my man

[Verse 4]
I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you, face in the sand
Safe in your hand
You were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand

[Chorus 2]
We are the red hots
And we're loving up the love-me-nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And everything he does will be alright
Call out my name
Call and I came

[Outro]
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man

[Instrumental]
