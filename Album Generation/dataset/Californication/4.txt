Get on top
Get on top

Hit me
Come get me
I bite but she bit me

[Verse 1]
Go-rilla, cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me ’cause I’m an ass killer
You’re ill but I’m iller

[Verse 2]
I’ll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top

[Chorus]
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

Get up
Come sit up
I light but she lit up

[Verse 3]
Grass hopper, show stopper
The life of a wife swapper
Come with me ’cause I’m a big bopper
You do but I wopper

[Verse 4]
Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

[Chorus]
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

[Instrumental Break]

Get on top
Get on top

Hit me
Come get me
I bite but she bit me

[Verse 5]
Speed baller, Rhodes Scholar
Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar
Come with me ’cause I’m a free faller
You hoot but I holler

[Verse 2]
I’ll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top

[Outro]
Get on top
Get on top
Get on top
Get on top
