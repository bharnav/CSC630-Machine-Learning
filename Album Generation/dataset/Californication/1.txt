[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first
Under water where thoughts
Can breathe easily
Far away you were made
In a sea
Just like me

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits
In your eye
Microcosm
You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in
Your head fields of space kid

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty Cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Guitar Solo]
