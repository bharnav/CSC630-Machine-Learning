[Chorus 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Chorus 2]
Little lune
All day
Little lune

[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Chorus 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

[Chorus 2]
Little lune
All day
Little lune
Little lune
All day
Little lune
