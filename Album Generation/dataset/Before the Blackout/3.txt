We built this up together on a shaky ground
Before too long it started crumbling down
So I got out before the whole thing hit the floor
But you knew better I'd be back for more
And when I finally did it was strange to see
That you rebuilt it with no help from me
The same foundation but the rest is new
You made this it belongs to you

It all went by too fast
No time to react
Once you fire the shots
They can't be taken back

You spread your roots and make your things for all of me
The ground is soft but there's no room to breathe
You had to push and force into abnormal growth
We could have dreamed it if we took it slow
But from the highest branches there's much thinner air
And things are different when you're way up there
Now all I want is you to come back down
And start again on level ground

It all went by too fast
No time to react
Once you fire the shots
They can't be taken back

I went and left you for dead
But you just got up again
And every fight just seems to make you stronger
I tried to tear this apart
But it was blown from the start
Cuz you just had to grab them all and run

From the highest branches there's much thinner air
And things are different when you're way up there
Now all I want is you to come back down
And start again on level ground

It all went by too fast
No time to react
Once you fire the shots
They can't be taken back

It all went by too fast
Never could react
Once you fire the shots
They can't be taken back
