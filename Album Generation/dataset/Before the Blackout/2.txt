Close the door, turn off the light
You'll never see the bloodshot eyes
Cause you never come around
The pictures that had lined the halls
I smashed and through against the wall
Yeah you cut them all down
Because you never come around
So maybe one day
I can get the thought of you
Out of my head

You gotta lot of nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
You gotta lot of nerve to show me what your all about
You gotta lot of nerve to hold me then forget me
Like a bad dream

Traded me in hopes to find
Some happiness in one more lie
Yeah you had it figured out
Was there a hint of honesty
In anything you said to me
Yeah I wrote it all down
So I could scream it out loud
And maybe one day
I could hold it up above
Your pretty blonde head

You gotta lot of nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
You gotta lot of nerve to show me what your all about
You gotta lot of nerve to hold me then forget me
Like a bad dream

Made me promise that you'll try
You told me everything is gonna be fine
Again the second time
I hope its not another lie
You figured it out
Tore it all down
Lock it all up
So I could scream it out

You gotta lot of nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
You gotta lot of nerve to show me what your all about
You gotta lot of nerve to hold me then forget me
Like a bad dream
Like a bad dream
Like a bad dream
Like a bad dream
