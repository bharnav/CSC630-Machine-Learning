Walking by your house
I wonder if your home
Then I see the light turn on
And I think I should go
A place where I can stay
And think about the days
That we were holding hands
And time would fade away
Now those days are gone
I don't know what went wrong
Was it something I said
Or maybe I waited too long
To open up my eyes
And finally realize
That everything you said was just another fucking lie
So now it's over and my life's turned upside down
My head is spinning but I can't hear a sound
That's when I think to myself

Now that I've made sense of all this
I hope it kills you to think of what you missed
You don't mean anything to me
I'm never gonna get the years back

The summer's almost gone
And here we are as friends
To sing the same old song
That we've heard time and time again
It's never gonna change
Words all stay the same
So I will turn my back and then we'll go our separate ways
'Cause now those days are gone
I don't know what went wrong
Was it something I said
Or maybe I waited too long
To open up my eyes
And finally realize
That everything you said was just another fucking lie
So now it's over and my life's turned upside down
My head is spinning but I can't hear a sound
That's when I think to myself

Now that I've made sense of all this
I hope it kills you to think of what you missed
You don't mean anything to me

Now that I've made sense of all this
I hope it kills you to think of what you missed
You don't mean anything to me
I'm never gonna get the years back
[x4]

I'm never gonna get the truth behind the lies
There's nothing left to find
So here's my last goodbye

Now that I've made sense of all this
I hope it kills you to think of what you missed
You don't mean anything to me

Now that I've made sense of all this
I hope it kills you to think of what you missed
You don't mean anything to me
I'm never gonna get the years back
