Locked down and alienated, confused and complicated
Now it seems you still have my heart
Shot down and unaccepted
Sometimes i get the feeling everything was finished from the start

But im scared of what ill find
The search for answers just keeps going nowhere
All i know is that its killing me inside
As i raise this final bottle to the sky

Here's to promises that die
Here's to all the nights we said our last goodbyes
As we burned another day off all our lives
Here's to memories that will fade, like the photographs that scream of better days
Its all weighing on my mind

Knocked down and devastated
Refused and understated
Now I see how you stole my heart
Now I'm forced to breathe without you
Sometimes I get the feeling everything is tearing us apart

But im scared of what ill find
The search for answers just keeps going nowhere
All i know is that its killing me inside
As i raise this final bottle to the sky

Here's to promises that die
Here's to all the nights we said our last goodbyes
As we burned another day off all our lives
Here's to memories that will fade, like the photographs that scream of better days
Its all weighing on my mind

But im scared of what ill find
The search for answers just keeps going nowhere
All i know is that its killing me inside
As i raise this final bottle to the sky

Here's to promises that die
Here's to all the nights we said our last goodbyes
As we burned another day off all our lives
Here's to memories that will fade, like the photographs that scream of better days
Its all weighing on my mind, weighing on my mind (my mind)
Weighing on my mind
