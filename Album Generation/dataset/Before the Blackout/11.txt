1871 was the year underneath an October sky
When a windy city man had set out with a plan to set a fire but nobody knows why
So Pegleg headed out back with a match and a bucket of kerosene
Little did he know that the wind would blow through the streets with anarchy

Pegleg didn't have an alibi
He didn't have a story to tell
But he bought his one way ticket straight to hell
Cuz he burned the whole damn city
Watched it all go down
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground
Yeah he burned that beautiful city
He torched that beautiful town
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground

Flames spread fast every night
While they passed through the alleys and the dead end streets
From suburban doors to the lakefront shore demolishing everything
And pegleg never got blamed for the mess made
Said he never broke the law
But all that remained was the charred black stains
Proving every things his fault

Pegleg didn't have an alibi
He didn't have a story to tell
But he bought his one way ticket straight to hell
Cuz he burned the whole damn city
Watched it all go down
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground
Yeah he burned that beautiful city
He torched that beautiful town
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground

Of all the books printed on his terrain
None raised the flag on one mans legacy
Now everybody knows the truth of the stories being exposed
So Pegleg's going down in infamy

Cuz he burned the whole damn city
Watched it all go down
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground
Yeah he burned that beautiful city
He torched that beautiful town
Yeah he burned all of Chicago to the ground
