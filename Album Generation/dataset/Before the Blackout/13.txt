I've been driving this road for the third straight day
These are thoughts from the past not to pick my brain
And now I feel I'm screaming to the world
Cuz this highways going nowhere
And the lines have all been blurred
By the rains falling down in front of me
So I clear the windshield just to find
Another cross to mark the passing of a life
It's a crystal clear reminder
That all things come to an end
And I wonder when that end will come for me

When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
And the bells just don't chime anymore
It's a tragedy that we can't see
Our lives on the other side of every single smile

I've been asking myself for the third straight night
If there's truth in the writings that shape our lives
Now I feel I'm screaming to the world
Do these sermons run in circles
Are they spoken by design
To erase the thoughts of insecurity
And maybe were just never meant to find
The answer to the question we've all kept inside
Give me something to believe in
Give me anything at all
Cuz right now this world just feels like its too small

When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
And the bells just don't chime anymore
It's a tragedy that we can't see
Our lives on the other side of every single smile

I won't cry
Not tonight
I won't back down without a fight
I won't cry
Not tonight
I won't back down

When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
And the bells just don't chime anymore
It's a tragedy that we can't see
Our lives on the other side of every single smile

I won't cry
Not tonight
I won't back down without a fight

When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
I won't lie down without a fight
And the bells just don't chime anymore
It's a tragedy that we can't see
I won't lie down without a fight
