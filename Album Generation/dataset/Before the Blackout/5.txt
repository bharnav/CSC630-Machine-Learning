The conversation died last night
On the heels of another fight
And you had so much more to say
And now my telephone is blind
I put my final on rewind
To hear my music going on and on and on

There's nothing in this world that touches me like you do
It helps my to unlock emotions I never knew
It's never gonna change
It's always gonna feel this way until I can't hear it anymore

I been in love
I been in love
Since I turned on my stereo

Remember silence died last night
Cut off by these city lights
Leaving so much more to say
I've walked these streets 1,000 times
With these songs locked up inside
It helps to keep me moving on and on and on

There's nothing in this world that touches me like you do
It helps my to unlock emotions I never knew
It's never gonna change
It's always gonna feel this way until I can't hear it anymore

I been in love
I been in love
Since I turned on my stereo

You make me
You save me
You make me
You change me

There's nothing in this world that touches me like you do
It helps my to unlock emotions I never knew
It's never gonna change
It's always gonna feel this way until I can't hear it anymore
Until I can't hear it anymore

I been in love
I been in love
Since I turned on my stereo
