There's something buried deep between these lines that you will never see
It's something that they don't want us to figure out
Were suffocating under all the lies and picture perfect smiles
The presidents and photographs in magazines
And no ones listening

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down

There's something wrong when television is the basis for our lives
They want us to believe in everything we see
It's getting harder now that all the innocence has passed us by
Now everybody wants to get something for free
And no ones listening

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down

And everybody wants the truth
But they're too scared to face it
They just don't accept what's happening
We just sit back and watch the world destroy itself when
We all know something's wrong

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down
Until it all comes crashing down
