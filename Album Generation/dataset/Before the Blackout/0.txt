Well lately
It seems i've wasted every single opportunity
To get this right
And maybe
It's all because the inspiration
That's inside of me
Has been denied
From all I want
And all I need tonight

So come with me
Just take my hand and
I'll make sure to show you everything
We'll trace these lines
Of empathy and
Self destruction to avoid responsibility
I'll bite my tongue
For all I want
And all I need

So I'm holding out
For a piece of good advice
To get me through this
To help me face another night
We'll set a course for the end of time
And maybe then I
Will finally get this whole thing right
