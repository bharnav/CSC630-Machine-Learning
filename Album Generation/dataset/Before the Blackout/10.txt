16 kid and just in the scene
But you've learned you have to play their games
Sold out through the chemical route because its easier to pass the blame
Instead of listening they pawn it off on someone else
To try their hands at easy answers

Take these push the buttons and tweak
Manufacturing a new disease
Lump sums making zeros and ones
As your forced into dependency
Instead of listening they pawn it off on someone else
To try their hands at easy answers

Giving up and taking it back to
Square one every morning
And you can't get out of bed
Daily rush to reformat again
Going through the motions
Forget and fall back down
Normal's not the norm you're used to now
Instead of listening they pawn it off on someone else
To try their hands at easy answers

Giving up and taking it back to
Square one every morning
And you can't get out of bed
Daily rush to reformat again
Going through the motions
Forget and fall back down
Normal's not the norm you're used to now

Climbing up a wall that never ends
Close your eyes
Swallow and give in
