It's frightening
How you can see the changes happening
When they move so fast
And lightning
Except the odds are growing
These lonely times will strike me twice
The screams of 1,000 voices
Are whispers inside my head
The echoes of self defense

So how many times will it take
To cover up the past mistakes
And hide behind a crying you face of shame
And how many nights will I hide
And blink under the blackened skies
I've cursed out so many times

Its biting
When the cold wind blows through weathered eyes
And blistered skin
It's quiet now
It's like the calm before the raging violence of the storm begins
And when this comes crashing down
I'll fall harder than before
I'll start this all over now

So how many times will it take
To cover up the past mistakes
And hide behind a crying face of shame
And how many nights will I hide
And blink under the blackened skies
I've cursed out so many times before

I'll beg for the ending or just for forgiveness
I'll wait in the shadows of a battle I'm close to losing

So how many times will it take
To cover up this smiling face of silence
This face of shame
And how many nights will I hide
And blink under the blackened skies
I've cursed out so many times before
