It's 2 a.m. and I'm not asking too much
Else tonight, so I light a cigarette
And watch the flame burn to my fingers
As I think and reflect on the years that have gone by
And now I'm feeling like a king with one breath I'll take it all

Into my head I won't forget all of the times
That we shared, we watched a good friend fade away
Just like our future on our own, no destinations
In life, only thing's kept the same
But I'm still feeling like a king and there's just one thing to say

I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between
I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between

It's 4 a.m. and I am just about to end
This night because I'm out of cigarettes
I'll watch the stars burn through my window
As I think and reflect on the years that have gone by
But I'm still feeling like a king and there's just one thing to say

I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between
I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between

Time is running in circles inside my head
4 years of memories, I won't forget
Time's running out, time's running out
Time's running out to say goodbye

Time's running out, time's running out
Time's running out to say goodbye
Time's running out, time's running out
Time's running out to say goodbye

I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between
I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between

I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between
I will wait for you while you wait for me
And I'll meet you somewhere in between
