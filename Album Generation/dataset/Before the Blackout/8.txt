Chalk it up to the public's request for a style that they just don't understand
Chalk it up to the difference between the industries supply and demand
Say please with the stab of a knife to the heart of what you've always believed
Well I'll pull that bloody knife back out and wave it at the pessimism in me

Say goodbye to all the preconceptions that you had
Say goodbye to everything you know
Take the time and draw the line to what you have and what you think you'll find
Cause I know
Let's hear it for lack of origination
It's all the same thing if you look at it right
I can tell you without any hesitation
That this will not survive

So what's the catch what's the trick to the trade
Is it luck or is it all just a game
What's the rule for the pile of charades
Is it all about what's in a name
Say please with the stab of a knife to the heart of what you've always believed
Well I pull that f**king knife back out and wave it at the pessimism in me

Say goodbye to all the preconceptions that you had
Say goodbye to everything you've known
Take the time and draw the line to what you have and what you think you'll find
Cause I know
Lets hear it for lack of origination
It's all the same thing if you look at it right
I can tell you without any hesitation
That this will not survive

Three cheers for the loser generation
It's all the same thing if you look at it right
I can tell you without any hesitation
That this will not survive
Tonight

Let's hear it for lack of origination
It's all the same thing if you look at it right
I can tell you without any hesitation
That this will not survive

Three cheers for the loser generation
It's all the same thing if you look at it right
I can tell you without any hesitation
That this will not survive
No this will not survive
So kiss it all
Goodnight
Kiss it goodnight
Kiss it goodnight
Kiss it goodnight
