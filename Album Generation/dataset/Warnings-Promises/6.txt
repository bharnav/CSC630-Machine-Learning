There is a long forgotten voice
I know it's not your voice, cause it's always strained
I wake up hearing unfamiliar voices
Convinced they're trying to explain
That if my words were clearer
Then maybe I would know what I'm trying to say
Just as those long forgotten voices
Disappear back into rain

If I was born the same day that you died
Should that make me try
I was born the same day that you died
Should that make me feel more alive

Not just sometimes but always
I know what I know
I know what I know
I know what I know

I tune the radio to drown out these voices I don't know
I'm suddenly an empty house, that almost fills up with home
There are days and nights, when I don't need to close my eyes
And they feel as real to me like analogy in disguise

If I was born the same day that you died
Should that make me try
I was born the same day that you died
Should that make me feel more alive

Not just sometimes but always
I know what I know
I know what I know
I know what I know

Not just sometimes but always
I know what I know
I know what I know
I know what I know
