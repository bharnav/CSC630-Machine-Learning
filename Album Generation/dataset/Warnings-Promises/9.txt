All the mistakes I made I made because
I didn't know myself very well
And by this stage I feel like
I really should know myself
I'm forced into a sponsored silence
Where I'm only paid
If I don't say
What I want to say

Open up your eyes and see
I can't throw it all away
Open up your eyes and see
I can't give it all away
I couldn't even care what you say
Change
You changed everything
And blame it on your obvious ways

I gamble my praises
And fill the jukebox full of my favorite phrases
As we cling to the nightclub walls
We whisper the words, we whisper them wrong

So we screamed out the wrong words
To our own song
And with a kiss that tasted like drugs
Which tastes like we'll never ever make it home

Open up your eyes and see
I can't throw it all away
Open up your eyes and see
I can't give it all away
I couldn't even care what you say
Change
You changed everything
And blame it on your obvious ways

Throw me around
First you've got to count me down
Don't you think you should count me down
Before you throw me around

You throw me into another move I can't remake
It changes everything
Open up your arms and say
Give it all away
I couldn't even care what you say
Change
You changed everything
And blame it on your obvious ways
