Everything is always changing
And nothing stays in the same place for too long
I've been too long awake
And everyone seems like they're slowly changing
No one stays in the same place for too long
I've been too long awake

Together we're younger than you are
Forever you're older than we are together
If we had so much to do

Together we're younger than you are
Forever you're older than we are together
