All the walls of your house
Were painted in deep blue
You're at that indecisive age to choose colours that reflect you
And everything and nothing
Is in the space between all things
That fascinates as much as it agitates
Words turn me into what I say
As you pull your yellow stained fingers
Through your unkempt hair
I noticed that the corners of your jeans
Were folded neatly into squares
Your thoughts are the strangest place that you've ever been
Stranger even than Los Angeles
It's like a cinema where they never ask you to leave

So I wait and I wait
And concentrate on being as far away
From fate so I wait
And concentrate on being as far away

She had a north Atlantic film star grace
That's why her tears are out of place
That kind of sadness has more style
So nothing will make her smile
Except as soon as anything happens
She'll drag me on the street
And hand in hand we stand protesting
While everyone is still asleep

So I wait and I wait
And concentrate on being as far away
From fate so I wait
And concentrate on being as far away

So I wait and I wait
And concentrate on being as far away
From fate so I wait
And concentrate on being as far away

I wait
I wait
I wait
I wait...
