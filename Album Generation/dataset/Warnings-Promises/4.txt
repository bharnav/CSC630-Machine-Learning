It's always 3am in your world
So I'm drinking this as if I hadn't slept
Telling stories which tell their stories themselves
You didn't even hear them
I thought to somewhere else
As long as I go somewhere, you'll still be trying to see
As long as I go somewhere, you'll still be trying
As long as I go somewhere, you'll still by lying to me
As long as I go somewhere

If you're so sure that you don't need love
Only this is if I hadn't slept
As laughter smiles back in your direction
But you're protected by the smoke from your cigarette

Then you tried
To hold my hand
Under the table
But it's far too vague
To be meaningful

As long as I go somewhere, you'll still be trying to see
As long as I go somewhere, every night has a hold over me
As long as I go somewhere, you'll still by lying to me
As long as I go somewhere

And you held me like I was a shadow
But completely without any mystery
And you compared me to a shadow
Which in itself is some kind of victory
