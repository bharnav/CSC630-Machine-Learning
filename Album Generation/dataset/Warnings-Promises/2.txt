History is made, not repeated
And you hide behind words that make you feel needed
And what you read in those books made you so conceited
So in order for love to be true
My dreams will have to
Become my only rules
I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
I see through all your promises and warnings

I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
I see through all your promises and warnings

Wake me up on into a world outdated
And the older you get the more you seem jaded
As you search for the quotes to make it seem complicated
So in order for love to be true
Even my nightmares
Become my only rules

I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
I see through all your promises and warnings

I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
But I've seen through
Every promise is a warning

I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
I see through all your promises and warnings

I want a warning
I want a warning
I want something more than a warning
I've been warned about you
I've seen through
For a promise of a warning
