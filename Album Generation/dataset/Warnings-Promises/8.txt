By the harbor
I harbor the strangest memories
Older than I could ever be
Stranded in nostalgia

So, tonight I'll try harder
But it's hard to fix
This spotlight on me
In a cast that's taken places
I'm unsure of where I want to be

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
I'll climb El Capitan
And jump off to cheers
From the crowd

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
And I hope you take your camera
To photograph my tears
As they hit the ground

No one even listens
The same way
That no one ever laughs
I'm taking the car out of the snow
And wondering where
The summer went to
Circled by your secrets

I'm hoping they don't include me
At least I'm in good company
Because there's no one
Else around, except me

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
I'll climb El Capitan
Just to watch the world slow itself

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
And I hope you took your camera
Silence makes the loudest sound

It seems far too easy
To say the same things
I'll choose my own way
To use my life up

Finally found a new way
Say the same things
In imaginary ways
I'll use my life up

You were looking at pictures in the distance
Hoping to see, the future in your pictures
Of the distance, hoping to see
The future looking at pictures in the distance

Hoping to see, the future through your pictures
Of the distance, hoping to see
The future looking at pictures in the distance

Hoping to see, the future in your pictures
Of the distance, hoping to see
The future looking at pictures in the distance

Hoping to see, the future in your pictures
Of the distance, hoping to see
The future in your pictures
