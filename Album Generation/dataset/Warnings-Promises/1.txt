I go outside to find the middle of nowhere
Everyone needs their own empty stage
Just like the sky with no beginning or ending
I like reading a book without a last page
Stop and turn around
And see it with your eyes closed
You don't need to welcome me home
Stop, turn around
Try looking with your eyes wide open

As we live our lives through a series of glances
And you smile without smiling for a whole another year
I think we need a little bit more understanding
I think the future is already here

So I won't ask you to
Stop and turn around
And see it with your eyes closed
You don't need to welcome me home
Stop, turn around
Try looking with your eyes wide open

Welcome home
Welcome home
