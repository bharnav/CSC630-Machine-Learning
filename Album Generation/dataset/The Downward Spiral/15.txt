Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scrapped off my Knees

I drink the honey
From inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive

Help me get away
Help me get away
Help me get away
Help me get away

You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

I broke apart my insides
Help me get away from myself
The only thing that works for me
Help me become somebody else

I want to fuck you like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal

I want to fuck you like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal

I want to fuck you like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal

I want to fuck you like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal

I want to fuck you like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal

You get me closer to God

You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you
