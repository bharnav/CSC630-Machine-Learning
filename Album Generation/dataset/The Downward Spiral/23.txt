Everything's blue in this world
He couldn't believe how easy it was
He put the gun into his face
Bang!
(So much blood for such a tiny little hole)

Problems do have solutions, you know
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed
In one determined flash

Everything's blue
Everything's blue in this world
All fuzzy
Spilling out of my head
