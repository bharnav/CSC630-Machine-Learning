[Verse 1]
Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

[Chorus]
They keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

[Verse 2]
Where figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring of blood
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

[Chorus]
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

[Whispered: Verse 3]
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me

[Chorus]
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
