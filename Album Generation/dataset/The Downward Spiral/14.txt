[Verse 1]
This world rejects me
This world threw me away
This world never gave me a chance
This world's gonna have to pay
I don't believe in your institutions
I did what you wanted me to
I'm like the cancer in your system
I've got a little surprise for you

[Chorus]
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there? Did you not realize?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
Burn

[Verse 2]
I look down from where you're standing
Flock of sheep out on display
With all your lies propped up around you
I can take it all away

[Chorus]
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there? Did you not realize?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
I'm going to burn this whole world down

[Bridge]
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)
I never was a part of you (Burn)

I am your savior (Burn)
I am corruption (Burn)
I am the angel (Burn)
Of your destruction (Burn)
I am subversion (Burn)
Secret desire (Burn)
I am your future (Burn)
Swallowed up in fire
