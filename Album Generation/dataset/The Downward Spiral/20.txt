[Verse 1]
You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you
I broke apart my insides
I've got no soul to sell
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away

[Chorus]
I want to fuck you
I want to taste you
I want to feel you
I want to be you

[Bridge]
Just like an animal
Just like an animal
Just like an animal
Just like an animal

[Verse 2]
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
You tear down all my reason
You see through what I hide
You make me perfect
Help me get inside

[Chorus]
I want to fuck you
I want to taste you
I want to feel you
I want to be you
I want to fuck you
I want to taste you
I want to feel you
I want to be you
