[Verse 1]
Wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect
I reject
Photographs I took of you

The towns I passed through
So many faces
So many places
I have got to have a memory
I have never been there
I have never been there
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

[Verse 2]
I can't remember
Give me your reminder
I can't remember
Give me your reminder
I collect
I reject

Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
(Now girl... only it's flavor... bow down here)

[Verse 3]
Keychains and snowstorms
The taste of your sweat
The look in your eye
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
(Wet as it is... the whiter the honey)
I collect
I reject
I collect
I reject

Memorabilia
(Goodies come in here all day)

Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
I can't remember
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
I can't remember
I collect
I reject
I collect
I reject
I collect
I reject
I collect
I reject

Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
