[Verse 1]
We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed

The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

[Verse 2]
Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place

Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
"Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet"
Great, now it's raining

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street
