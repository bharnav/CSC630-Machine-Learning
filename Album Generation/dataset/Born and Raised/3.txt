[Verse 1]
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone

[Pre-Chorus]
What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

[Verse 2]
Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

[Pre-Chorus]
What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

[Bridge]
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

[Outro]
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
