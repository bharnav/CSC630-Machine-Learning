[Verse 1]
Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

[Chorus]
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

[Verse 2]
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

[Chorus]
I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man

But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in

[Bridge]
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

[Chorus]
I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find

[Bridge]
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia
