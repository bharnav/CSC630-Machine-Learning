[Verse 1]
Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame

I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Verse 2]
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Electric country blues guitar bridge]

[Verse 3]
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote "Blue" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Instrumental outro]
