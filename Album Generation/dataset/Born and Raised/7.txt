[Intro]
Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing

[Verse 1]
It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words

[Chorus]
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

[Verse 2]
Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's

Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard

[Chorus]
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

[Bridge]
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb

[Outro]
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
