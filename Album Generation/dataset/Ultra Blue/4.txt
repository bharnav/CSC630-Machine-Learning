[Hook]
When you walk away, you don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go."
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

[Verse 1]
You're giving me too many things lately
You're all I need, you smiled at me and said
"Don't get me wrong, I love you
But does that mean I have to meet your father?"
When we are older you'll understand
What I meant when I said
"No, I don't think life is quite that simple"

[Hook]
When you walk away, you don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go."
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

[Break]
So simple and clean

[Verse 2]
The daily things (like this and that and what is what?)
That keep us all busy are confusing me
That's when you came to me and said
"Wish I could prove I love you
But does that mean I have to walk on water?"
When we are older you'll understand
It's enough when I say so
And maybe some things are that simple

[Hook]
When you walk away, you don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go."
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

[Bridge]
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before

[Hook]
When you walk away, you don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go."
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

[Bridge]
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before
