Yeah!
Alright!

[Verse 1]
Well, we've got no choice
All the girls and boys
Making all the noise
Cause they found new toys

Well, we can't salute you
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit you
That's a drag

[Chorus]
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
Yeah!

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looks

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Well, we've got no class
And we've got no principals
And we've got no metal detectors
We can't even smoke in the parking lot!

[Chorus]
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out completely

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looks

Out for summer
Out till fall
We might not come
Back at all!

[Chorus]
(School's out for summer) School's out for summer, kiddies
(School's out forever) I never went to school
(School's out for summer) If I did, I would've majored in killing
(School's out with fever) If I did, I would've majored in you

School is out for summer
School is out...
Completely
