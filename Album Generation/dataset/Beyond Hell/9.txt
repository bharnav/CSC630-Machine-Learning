[Burp]

He proudly sports his rare GWAR hoodie
When he puts it on
It gives him such a woody
Ha!

[Verse 1]
Zit-scarred and unpopular
He's at the show alone
Running his mouth to no one at all
Later he cries bitter tears
He met his idol and he got punched
All he wanted was an autograph
The smell of his acne, it's heavily bunched
He fell down and everyone laughed

[Chorus]
You're the Ultimate Bohab (Bohab!)
Stricken with gout (Gout!)
If you don't have any drugs
Get the fuck out
Bohab!
Bohab!
Bohab!

[Verse 2]
It's your dream come true
Your crummy zine got a GWAR interview!
You'll ask the questions, it all goes to tape
But ask the wrong one and your ass will get raped
But not by a dude, that would be gay!
But if that's what the band wants, I guess it's okay
We're not gonna rape you so don't you fret it
You brought a woman, oh, she's gonna get it!

[Chorus]
Cause this is how we roll, this is what we do
We're fucking your girlfriend right in front of you
And we know that's not your girlfriend by the way
She's only with you cause you got her backstage
And you also...gave her...money...

Bohab!
You're the Ultimate Bohab
Stricken with gout
Bohab!

Ahhh!
[Yelling]

Bohab!
You're the Ultimate Bohab

[Verse 3]
Your face makes her sick
As soon as she's in there, she's getting the dick
But not from you, from the entire band
So whip out your cock and lay a wad in your hand

[Chorus]
Soon she is dead, but before we chuck her
Come on over here, kid, there's still time to fuck her!
A festering hole where there used to be a crotch
We feed her to bears, all that's left is her watch

You're the Ultimate Bohab
Bohab!
You're the Ultimate Bohab

You gave your life with pride
But people that had known you
Didn't care that you had died
The last issue did real well
Your interview was suicide
You followed GWAR to Hell
