[Verse 1]
Cross-creviced chasms vast
And endless plains of unshaven ass
Our time in Hell draws to the last
We call upon the Master of the Pit
Have you got a toilet? I must take a shit!
Open your gates, Lord of Hate
Or your front porch is gonna get it!

Very well, I'll use my sword
It's very good at smashing doors
We call you out
Overrated Overlord!

The root of all evil and hatred and shame
So many victims, so many names
But
They are all the same

Ereshkigal?
Charun?
Helel ben Shahar?
Lucifer, Satan
We know who you are!

[Chorus]
He is the one who will not be named
He is the one who will not be blamed
For nothing!

[Verse 2]
The realm of the sun, we have left far behind
And damned in the darkness
We've groped with the blind
Cannot remember time!
We summon the Lord of Hell
So come forth now, I have your smell
Cologne?
Cheap shit, and lots of it!

[Chorus]
He is the one who will not be named
He is the one who will not be blamed
He is the one that is turning the screws
The Lord of the Underworld
Let's give the Devil his due

"Welcome, GWAR, to my domain
It's nice to be called on by so many names
What's this I hear about you kicking my ass?"

[Solo]

[Chorus]
He is the one who will not be named
He is the one who will not be blamed
He is the one that is turning the screws
The Lord of the Underworld
Let's give the Devil his due

[Verse 3]
Cross chasms vast
And endless ass
Our time in Hell
Draws to the last

The legions of Hell
Lay broken and shorn
The brothers of GWAR
Have slain through the storm
The gate, it is riven
The Master is slain
The Fortress of GWAR
Is now ripe to reclaim
We wasted Hell in the name of GWAR!
Though we really don't know where we are
