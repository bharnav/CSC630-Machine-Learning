This journey
Without time
Always the beginning
Yet perpetual end
Found we'd never left
This time, a battle un-won
In the center of it again
This time, death is at our command
Returned to our former glory
The never-ending story

I'm back!
Back in crack!

[Verse 1]
Broke the gates of Hell
Deposed the Overlord
Took a dump on the floor
Seconds later, I'm bored
My armor is spiny
My regrets, they are tiny
I have no concern for the life I trash
But since we last parted
I'm right back where I started
Except that our castle is thrashed!

[Chorus]
Back in crack
I am still alive
I smell the stench and taste hot blood
Once again, I guess we didn't die
One can only try
As hard as I

[Verse 2]
There is no secret I have for you
Everything is as it seems
The acts of the drama, they number scant few
So enjoy the ruin of dreams
Sometimes you have to burn everything down
So you can have nothing at all
And even though I have lived on the sun
Looks like a trip to the mall!

[Bridge 1]
Back in crack!

[Verse 3]
Horror and hatred are all that I know
Misery, madness, and worms
This journey brought no satisfaction
Has defined no ultimate terms
If anything, I have gained nothing
Except just for staying alive
And I suppose that is something
When you've tried as hard as me to die

[Chorus]
Back in crack
I am still alive
I smell the stench and taste hot blood
Once again, I guess we didn't die
One can only try
As hard as I

[Bridge 2]
Back in crack!

GWAR has returned from the pit of Hell
At least I think that's where we were
Sleazy sent over a nine-ton crack boulder
He said "Way to go, welcome back to the world"
From someone who's been to Hell and back
Prophetic insight, I profoundly lack
Hell's full of pussies and God is a dick
But the run was sure good for some kicks, bah!

Back!
In crack!

[Verse 4]
There is no secret I have for you
Everything is as it seems
The acts of the drama, they number scant few
So enjoy the ruin of dreams

[Bridge 3]
GWAR went to Hell and we faced all our fears
Now we are back so let's go have some beers
Secure in the fact that we are without peers
GWAR for 10 million more years!

Back in crack!
