From beyond the grave
Beyond all sound
Beneath the world
In flames, we found
A menace spawned
From time so deep
And from that abyss
Death did creep
To take from us
What we could not give
And steal the life
Of those who would live
He comes through time
To finish his task
Steal our might
Tear off our mask
With the stuff of life
Jizmoglobin
He comes through time
To slob on my knobbin'
Against this foe
This matchless strength
His fiendish servants
His probing length
He comes to devour
All that we are
And if he succeeds
It's the death...of...GWAR
Will there be a new Master?
The children will cry
For in this new world
Even death...can...die
