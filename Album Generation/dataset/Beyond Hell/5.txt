Tor!
Tormentor!

[Verse 1]
Born into the fog of war
It left a scar
He watched his family turn to sludge
He was appalled
They often are
Because!

Here are the skulls of the vanquished
Here are the weapons he used
The more strength you have, the more that he hates you
You must be consumed

This is his story
Festooned with glory
This is history
It's not a sin
Festooned with finery
You'll find him in the winery
Festooned with filigree
These are the maggots
In the wounds

[Chorus]
Tor!
(He is Tormentor!)
Mentor!
(Tormentor!)
Attack-or!
(He is Attack-or!)
Tor-men-tor, tor, tor!
(Tormentor!)
Hey!

[Verse 2]
You must retaliate
He moves!
His armor crinkles
Like a ferrous dinosaur
That sound
Is the sound of his armor!

Here are the skulls of the vanquished
Here are the weapons he used
The stronger you are, the more that he hates you
You will be consumed

Festooned with filigree
This is history
This is his story
An allegory!

[Chorus]
Tor!
(He is Tormentor!)
Mentor!
(Tormentor!)
Attack-or!
(He is Attack-or!)
Tor-men-tor, tor, tor!
(Tormentor!)
Ahh!

[Solo]
Go!
Because!

Say!

[Chorus]
Tor!
(He is Tormentor!)
Mentor!
(Tormentor!)
Attack-or!
(He is Attack-or!)
Tor-men-tor, tor, tor!
(Tormentor!)
Hey!

It was said he once cracked a smile
It is said his blood was made of bile
It is said his thews are mighty
It is said his views are righty
His loins
Heave with sap!
(Tormentor!)
Tor!

[Evil laughter]
