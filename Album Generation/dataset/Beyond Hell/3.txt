[Growling and gargling]

The halls of our keep
Rock with ruin and war
The walls cry and crumble
Broken, the sword
The tombs and the tomes
The world's honeycombed
We must possess the under-earth

Down...
Down...
Down!

(Go to...Hell!)

[Chorus]
Toll the bell!
We're going to Hell!
Here we seek the fruit of creation
Bloodstained wine
It sweetens our time
Here we seek the final salvation
(We're gonna go to Hell!)

[Verse 1]
I'm headed to
The promised land
Swam boiling surf
Trod bloody, bloody sand
As pissed-off pilgrims
We'll travel below
And seek the finest filth
That Hell can bestow

A realm of madness, the cringing of queens
A realization, the crushing of dreams
The worm-gnawed fruit of all your pretty schemes
Between Heaven and Hell, all is not what it seems
From what I've heard, it's a pretty cool place
A sea of urine where rats eat your face
A sadist like me can pursue his vocation
I'm going to Hell because I need a vacation

(We're gonna go to Hell!)

[Chorus]
Toll the bell!
We're going to Hell!
(Hell!) Here we seek the fruit of creation
(We're gonna go to Hell!)
Write it in slime
Blood sweetens our time
Here we seek the final salvation
(We're gonna go to Hell!)

[Verse 2]
The lies
They told you
Laid the foundation for this place
The book
That they sold you
Worship this god, but do not look at his face
Beneath
Our keep
The tunnels run so deep
To reclaim our right, we retreat from this fight
And enter now the land of the dead!

[Chorus]
(Hell!) Toll the bell!
We're going to Hell!
(Hell!) Here we seek the fruit of creation
(We're gonna go to Hell!)
Bloodstained wine
It sweetens our time
(Hell!) Here we seek the final salvation
(We're gonna go to...)

[Verse 3]
Is this what you fear?
That the sum of your life will...
Leave you here?
Or do you think when you die you are done?
The pain of your death has only just begun
I'm headed now to join the damned
Into the oven, the dead souls are jammed
We come for the master, the king of the cruel
This is the place where it is better to rule

You're seeking Heaven but you're not allowed in
Your soul is falling and you never can win
The game is fixed but there's no one to blame
Heaven and Hell? They are one in the same

Ah, yes
All abandon
Abandon all your hope
Ye who enters here
Ohh...
All abandon
Abandon all your hope
Ye who enters here!
(Ye who enters here)
And you can go to Hell!
Yes! Yes! Yeah!
Ohh...
All abandon
Abandon all your hope
Ye who enters here
(Ohh...
All abandon
Abandon all your hope
Ye who enters here)
Ah, yes, my children
And you can go to Hell
You can go to
You can go to Hell!
