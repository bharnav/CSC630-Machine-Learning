[Sample from Evil Brain From Outer Space]
"If this evil force can be stopped and destroyed before actual nuclear war begins, then the universe will be safe."

[Verse 1]
Why the hell are they trying to kill us?
Why did they nuke my crib?
Don't want to cry like a baby
But somebody hand me a bib
This fucking sucks, where is Sleazy?
Abandoned us so long ago
Where are my oceans of Bohabs
To prop up my flaccid ego?

[Chorus]
Trapped in the under-earth
I seek my Murderer's Muse
Trapped in the under-earth
I am so fucking confused

[Verse 2]
It's not that I just got my ass kicked
Though it did hurt, I admit
It's more like I am a huge asshole
Constantly talking belligerent shit
I hate them, they hate me, I hate you (Weeee!)
Everyone's sucking their cocks
It's times like this that I wish I was dead
Somebody saw off my fucking head!

[Chorus]
Trapped in the under-earth
I seek my Murderer's Muse
Trapped in the under-earth
I am so fucking confused

Musings of a murderer
Comfort to the damned
Here in Hell
Nothing goes as planned
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!

[Bridge]
Heaven and Hell, your life and your death
Everything's the same
You have no power over fate
Nothing is to blame
Woe to the children and woe to the chalice
My maggot-mind musing, pulsating with malice
Defeat the host of Hell
Or become their slaves!
A Slave!

[Solo]

[Sample]
"Already many of the mutants, disguised as human beings, are walking the streets of Earth's cities"
"The creatures [want to?] rule the universe!"
"Killing every human in their path."

[Verse 3]
Across the dead sky gleaming
He was nailed to the flaming Krosstika
All your bad and all your good
They'd kill each other
If they could

Murderer!
Murderer!

[Chorus]
Trapped in the under-earth
I seek my Murderer's Muse
Trapped in the under-earth
I am so fucking confused

Hitler arises, his crimes are so vast
He must merge with your Jesus
Right at the ass!

A new being
Behold...
Jitler!
