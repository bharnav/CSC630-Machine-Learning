[Verse 1]
They came from the sun
From the east, from the west all around
So fate's die is cast
They marshaled their forces and found us at last
So it's come to this
The child is the destroyer
The young god comes to slay

War!

Son kill the father
For blackness is all that I crave
Shells explode across my hide
Take me, death, I am your slave
For I don't have soul (soul, soul...)
And I don't have a heart (heart, heart...)
Come then and face me
But first you must suffer my wrath

[Chorus]
Hatred of all things alive
War is all we know

[Verse 2]
They say war is a last resort
For me, it's the only way
I have tried reading their poetry
It suits me better to slay
All that I touch seems to break in my hands
Then it just bursts into flames
The piteous pleadings as innocents die
Only an odor remains

So burn the bitter butter
Prepare the murder machines
Bring me my scabbard, my halberd, my hauberk
Fetch me my enchanted greaves
My walls, they are melting
The drugs, they aren't helping
Is it time for the old gods to die?
"To arms!", the only cry

[Chorus]
Hatred of all things alive
War is all we know
The humans must feast on their gods
We know it fucking blows

Yeahhh!

[Bridge]
Hatred is a seed that's easy to sow
Buckets of blood will help it to grow
And raised on high, the fetid throne
Death is fate's master
He sits
All alone...
(All alone, all alone, all alone)
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all ahh...

They say war is all we know
Haha, if only that were true
No matter how I work my schedule
There's always other things that I do
But excuse me now, there's a tank at the door
And that slave's head just rolled 'cross the floor
He tries to say something and that something is puke
Right about then the pigs set off a nuke

[Solo]
War is all we know
Ah!
Hatred...

[Verse 3]
When I said I loved war, I lied
It fucking sucks on the losing side!
And speaking of which, my face is on fire
A lightning withdraw, we quickly retire
A flurry of carnage, my brain pan is nicked
To my unending shame, my ass just got kicked
And as the shells fall in a relentless hail
The fortress was gutted and we had to bail

[Chorus]
Hatred of all things alive
War is all we know
The humans must feast on their gods
We know it fucking blows

Hatred of all things alive
War is all we know
The humans must feast on their gods
War is all...
War is all...
War is all we know
