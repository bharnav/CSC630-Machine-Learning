Destroyed!

[Verse 1]
He's got plenty of drugs
But he can't find his guitar
Winds up drowning in puke
With a needle in his arm

[Chorus]
This is a plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
This is a plea for junk
Anything that I can use

[Verse 2]
I'll shoot junk in my eye
I can't die!

Whoops! I'm already dead!
Maggots are writhing inside of my head

[Chorus]
This is a plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
Desperate for anything
Anything that I can use
A plea for drugs
From me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die

[Bridge]
See me falling, see me sprawling
See me going through your purse
See me crying, see me dying
See me roll off in a hearse

Ay!

[Chorus]
This is a plea for drugs
This is an appeal from me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die!

[Verse 4]
I'm pathetic, yet magnetic
That is, until the drugs are gone
Then I am a total dick
Until I get a good buzz on
Don't wanna fucking shoot myself
That would make a mess
I really should O.D. on junk
I think that would be best!

[Chorus]
This is a plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
This is a plea for anything
Anything that I can use
A plea for drugs
An appeal from me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!
