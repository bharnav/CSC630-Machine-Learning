Ay!
(Eighth Lock!)

[Verse 1]
No one to see, nowhere to go
Nothing to do, no one to know
Eighth Lock
Eighth Lock!

Nothing will live, nothing will grow
No one will care, no one will know
Eighth Lock, you never can win
You only get out by not going in

[Pre-Chorus]
They put me into the ground
Lost without light, without taste, without sound
Beneath the barren mound
They put me in a place they call Eighth Lock

[Chorus]
(Eighth Lock!)
But I'm getting stronger
(Eighth Lock!)
Not very much longer!

[Verse 2]
No one to see, nowhere to go
Nothing to do, no one to know
Eighth Lock
Eighth Lock!

Nothing will live, nothing will grow
No one will care, no one will know
Eighth Lock, you never can win
You only get out by not going in

[Pre-Chorus]
Who the hell am I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
And what did you do to my hands?
I'm getting stronger

[Bridge]
They built this place with steel
And painted it with mud
It's constantly on fire
They put it out with blood
They said it was a prison
But became so much more
The maze it built into itself
They had to bar the door
Bar the door!
Quickly, you fools!

Nothing to do, nowhere to go!
The floating eyeball is to be feared
The pupil hides a maw
They say that children run this place
That's how they missed the fatal flaw

[Chorus]
Eighth Lock, you never can win
You only get out by not going in
No one to see, nowhere to go
Nothing to do
Eighth Lock, you never can win
You only get out by not going in
No one to see, nowhere to go
Nothing to do, no one to know

[Solo]

When you come to Eighth Lock
It's like some vile rebirth
Where devils delve into your life
And demons deem its worth
The food comes through a hole
My cellmate is a troll
The warden, he has hooks for hands
We all play our roles
We all play our roles!
Or wind up
On a pole

(Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock
Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock!)

A diabolic construct
(Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock!)
As flesh runs rife with worms
(Eighth Lock, Eighth Lock)
Somehow flesh and metal merge
As bloated larvae squirms
The things within, they made with rules
Ahh...
They steal the souls of those they think are fit to play their hateful games
