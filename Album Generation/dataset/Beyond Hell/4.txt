We stand before the gates of Hell
Smeared with filthy bacon smell
Not all cops are pigs
Some of them are dicks
It is their duty to beat you
With a big fucking stick!

I love the pigs!

[Verse 1]
The cheap allure
Of human manure
You busted her for junk
And soon your dashboard
Was spackled in spunk

[Chorus]
You stopped for a bit
But you couldn't quit
I love the pigs, I love the pigs, love the pigs
You killed and killed again
And got away with it

[Verse 2]
The body count rose, yet
Yet, still I craved more
Fighting just crime had become such a bore
That one magic night when I raped with a mop
That sure got around the shop!

'Til an AK took my head off
In a drug deal gone way wrong
By some weird Asian dude
That they called Knobby Tong
Still they called it suicide
At the funeral, the sergeant cried

[Chorus]
You stopped for a bit
But you couldn't quit
I love the pigs, I love the pigs, love the pigs
You killed and killed again
And got away with it

[Bridge]
You wanted to do right
But right, it felt so wrong
The filthy streets ate your soul
That's how you wound up
Deep in this hole

See them in their grandeur
White Knights of the Realm
They are all my children
Follow me to Hell!
Follow me to Hell!

[Verse 3]
But Satan smiled upon you
You became a god
It became your resurrection
Un-death of the damned
Resplendent in his harness
His flanks are flecked in seed
Cybernetic knucklehead
Centurion of greed

[Chorus]
You stopped for a bit
But you couldn't quit
I love the pigs, I love the pigs, love the pigs
You killed and killed again
Killed again and killed again
And killed again and killed again
Killed again and killed again
And killed again and killed again
And killed again and killed again

They combined a man with a hog
Then they sewed on the dick of a dog
Good with a club, but not a great shot
I guess even Hell needs a cop

Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop

Renegade cops who, as priests, wield their clubs and their guns get to have all the fun
Renegade cops who, as priests, wield their clubs and their guns get to have all the fun
[???]
(Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop
Guess even Hell needs a cop)
