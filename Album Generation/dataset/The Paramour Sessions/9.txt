[Verse 1]
I live the days of war
I live the nights of love
I suffer to survive
I gotta, gotta, gotta stay alive
I hear the battle cries
The fists are in the sky
I know what I'm fighting for

[Chorus]
No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

[Verse 2]
This is a call to arms
It's time to go to war
It's time to rant and rave
Gotta, gotta, gotta make a change
Down on the devil street
Is where everybody meets
I know what I'm fighting for

[Chorus]
No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

[Bridge]
What goes around comes around baby!
You'll get yours one day, that's right!

[Verse 3]
I want it all
And I want it now
Make no mistake
Give it to me straight

[Chorus]
No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

Lies!
Lies!
Lies!

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

[Bridge]
What goes around comes around baby!
You'll get yours one day, that's right!
