[Verse 1]
I surrender, I know I've been a pretender
You can have this guilt, this misery I wear so well
I wave my flag, I sound the alarm
Somebody stop me before I do any harm
I surrender, I know I've been a pretender
I'm living a dead life, I'm staring into the headlights
Of a get away car that will take me out of my mind tonight
Crash and burn, SOS
Somebody help me get out of this mess of a dead life
I'm burning under the spotlight

[Chorus]
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will fight again
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will rise again

[Verse 2]
Take a look at these hollow eyes
One last look before I say goodbye
To this candle-lit nightmare I feel I can never escape
So watch me fall from grace, watch me carve my hate
In the heart of a lover I feel I can never escape my fate

[Chorus]
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will fight again
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will rise again

[Bridge]
I see you on your cloud looking down
I'm on my knees today but you don't notice me
I see you on your cloud looking down
I'm on my knees today but you don't notice me

You don't notice me, you don't notice me, you don't notice me
I'm screaming while I pray, while I pray, while I pray
You don't notice me, I'm sick of you, God, I am done with you

[Outro]
I see you on your cloud looking down
I'm on my knees today but you don't notice me
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will fight again
My heart is a fist drenched in blood
My soul will rise again
