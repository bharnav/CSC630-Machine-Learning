[Verse 1: Jacoby Shaddix]
Listen up, turn it up and rock it out
Party on, I wanna hear you scream and shout
This is real, as real as it gets
I came to get down to get some fucking respect!
Taking it back to a hardcore level!
You better be ready, put your pedal to the metal!
Taking it back to a hardcore level!
Better be ready, put your pedal to the metal (oh!)
Go!

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix & with Jerry Horton]
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved

[Verse 2: Jacoby Shaddix]
I want domination
I want your submission
I see you're not resisting
To this temptation
I got one confession
A love deprivation
I got a jet black heart
It's all fucked up, and it's falling apart

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix with Jerry Horton]
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved

[Verse 3: Jacoby Shaddix]
I got another confession
I fell to temptation
And there is no question
There was some connection
I gotta follow my heart
No matter how far
I gotta to roll the dice
Never look back and never think twice

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix  with Jerry Horton]
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved

[Bridge: Jacoby Shaddix]
Take the past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on, I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal, you get no respect
You're gonna get yours, you better watch your fucking neck
Take the past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on, I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal, you get no respect
You're gonna get yours, you better watch your fucking neck

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix with Jerry Horton]
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa, I never give in
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved

[Outro: Jacoby Shaddix]
Whoa, I never give in (take the the past, burn it up and let it go)
Whoa, I never give up
Whoa, I never give in (take the past, burn it up and let it go)
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
