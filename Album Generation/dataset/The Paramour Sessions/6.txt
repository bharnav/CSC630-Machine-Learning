[Verse 1]
You say I'm looking really bad, you say I'm looking really sick
And I don't even care, I never really did
So when push comes to shove and I slap you in the face
Just remember one thing

[Chorus]
When it's time you fill the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says
My time is running out

[Post-Chorus]
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

[Verse 2]
So when I'm out of control and I'm out of my mind
Just remember one thing, I think I'm just fine
So catch me when I fall, I won't remember anything at all
So catch me when I fall

[Chorus]
When it's time you fill the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says
My time is running out

[Post-Chorus]
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

[Chorus]
When it's time you fill the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says
My time is running out

When it's time you fill the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says
My time is running out

[Post-Chorus]
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
