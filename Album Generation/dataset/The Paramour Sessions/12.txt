[Verse 1]
It feels like I'm looking at life
Through a telescope, because I'm so high
And the ground never seemed so far away
Truth shall be told one day
I'll be under ground one day

[Chorus]
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave

Roses on my

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm looking at life
Telescope, because I'm so high
And the ground never seemed so far away
Truth shall be told one day
I'll be under ground one day

[Chorus]
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave

I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave

Roses on my grave

[Bridge]
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

[Outro]
It's my redemption (time for redemption)
Time for redemption (it's my redemption)
It's my redemption (time for redemption)
Time for redemption

I'll see you on the other side
I'm waiting on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'm waiting on the other side
