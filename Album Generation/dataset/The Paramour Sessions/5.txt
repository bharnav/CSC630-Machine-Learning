[Intro]
I devise my own demise
I devise my own demise
I devise my own demise
I devise my own demise

[Verse 1]
I can't control everything
And I can't forget just what I've seen
These memories take me away
To a better place than I am today
Than I am today!

[Chorus]
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing

[Verse 2]
It is time to say hello, goodbye (hello, goodbye)
To fade away, fade away alone (motherfucker, goodbye)
I just want you to take, take me back home (take me back home)
To a better place that I've never known
That I've never known!

[Chorus]
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing

[Verse 3]
I can't control everything (death is the only way out)
And I can't forget just what I've seen (death is the only way out)
These memories take me away
To a better place than I am today
Than I am today!

[Chorus]
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing
I devise my own demise
Here's to life, the life I'm losing

[Outro]
This life I'm losing (this life I'm losing)
This life I'm losing (this life I'm losing)
I devise my own demise
(own demise, own demise, own demise, own demise, own demise)
