[Verse 1]
Die a little everyday
Break the silence, when you say
You don't love me anymore
In my face you slam the door
Making up, making out
Falling in and falling out
When you kiss me like a stranger
That is when we are in danger

[Chorus]
Fly around
The fire
In and out
Of desire

I gotta love you, I gotta have you
Don't wannna let you down again

[Verse 2]
When I kiss you like a lover
That is when we discover
We are burning in the fire
This love will never tire
When I tell you that I need you
Please believe that I won't leave you
You're a diamond, I'm a heart
Living in this house of cards

[Chorus]
Fly around
The fire
In and out
Of desire

I gotta love you, I gotta have you
Don't wannna let you down again
I gotta love you, I gotta have you
Don't wannna let you down again

[Chorus]
Fly around
The fire
In and out
Of desire

I gotta love you, I gotta have you
Don't wannna let you down again

The fire
In and out
Of desire

I gotta love you, I gotta have you
Don't wannna let you down again

[Outro]
Don't wanna let you down again
Don't wanna let you down again
