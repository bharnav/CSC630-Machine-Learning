[Verse 1]
I refuse to be a victim
I refuse to be a slave
I keep on burning my bridges
I keep on fucking up everything
Running from desperation
And god knows where I've been
I don't know where I'm headed
But I'm going too fast, I think I'm going to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to crash
I'm going to crash
To crash

[Chorus]
It's time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal
No time for hesitation
Time to be an animal

[Verse 2]
Looking at my reflection
I don't like what I see
So I ask myself a question
Do I got what I want or do I got what I need?
I'm not afraid of the future
Or spinning right out of control
I don't know where I'm headed
But I'm going too fast, I think I'm going to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to crash
I'm going to crash
To crash

[Chorus]
It's time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal
No time for hesitation
Time to be an animal

It's time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal
No time for hesitation
Time to be an animal

[Verse 3]
I refuse to be a victim
I don't wanna fall again
I know where I'm headed
God knows where I've been

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to crash, I'm going to crash
I'm going to crash, I'm going to crash
I'm going to crash, I'm going to crash
I'm going to crash, I'm going to crash

[Chorus]
It's time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal
No time for hesitation
Time to be an animal

It's time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal
No time for hesitation
Time to be an animal

[Outro]
Live, love, life
Live, love, fight
Live, love, life
Live, love, fight
