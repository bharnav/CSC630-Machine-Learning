[Verse 1]
Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
I'm getting lonely, I need somebody to hold me
I thought I'd never miss her, she cut me out of her pictures

[Chorus]
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living?

[Verse 2]
Somebody tells the truth, somebody lives a lie
I can see right through, the story is in your eyes
I know what they're saying, there is no need for explaining
There will be nothing better than when I burn all your letters

[Chorus]
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living?

Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living?

[Post-Chorus]
We never fell in love, we only fell apart

[Bridge]
We only fell apart
We only fell apart
We only fell apart

So we pick up the pieces and put 'em together
We said this was gonna last forever
Pick up the pieces and put 'em together
We said this was gonna last forever

[Chorus]
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living?

[Post-Chorus]
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart

[Outro]
Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
