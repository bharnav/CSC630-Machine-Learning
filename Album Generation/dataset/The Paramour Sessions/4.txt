[Verse 1]
In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Verse 2]
Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin
In this moment, I'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine

[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Bridge]
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Bridge]
One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

[Outro]
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
