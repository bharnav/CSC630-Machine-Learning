Reports coming in now indicate the mass hysteria continues to spread throughout the globe. It is not yet confirmed by officials what is causing these horrific events, but it is suggested by certain sources, that these creatures that are now being spotted throughout the world are neither human, nor are they wild animals. It is strongly advised that people should stay indoors, and if you encounter one of these beings, DO NOT try to make contact with them. They will attack without warning.
