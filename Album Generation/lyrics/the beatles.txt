Made for John LennonWe're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandAlthough your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with youI tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no replyWhat have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to beYes, it's so hard loving you, loving youAs I write this letter 
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you
You, you, you
I love youThat boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy
This boy
This boyAll of my life
I've been searching for a girl to love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had, breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him 
Go with him 
You can go with him, girl 
Go with himBecause you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm livin' the bluesPick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909
Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna callingPlease remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
As long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and bluesHad you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ahWait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been aloneToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too muchJust to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with youThat's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with meA taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back  for the honey  and youGotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Aah!  You gotta
Wait, wait a minuteNow that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, loveFrom me, to you
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied, oooh
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
To you, to you, to youEverybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down 
And leave you flat 
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said todayI used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?Uh, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la

'Cause, baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Don't leave me all alone (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Come on home (
Sha la la la la la la
)
'Cause, baby, it's youSince you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more
