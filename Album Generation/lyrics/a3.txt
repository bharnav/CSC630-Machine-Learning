Run it back, I got dudes not holdin' back
Hulvey on tracks with dudes who traveled
I buss down crazy like this, I never lack
Tryna get checks, not stripes, ain't feelin' that
[Verse 5: A3 &
Hulvey
]
Yeah, off all these dudes and Iâ€™m hitting the deuce
Cutting the light you know He is the luz
Talk to my God you know that I never lack
Ride with my brothers, I'm goin' to Never Land, uh
I got Peter Pan type of hops 
I got Peter Pan type of hops 
I got Peter Pan type of hops 
I got Peter Pan type of hops 
I got Peter Pan type of hops
I already told y'all, "Summer's mine"
It's God Always, or God know ways
And you can catch me jumpin' over every wall
The enemy tried to put up, you heard?
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
