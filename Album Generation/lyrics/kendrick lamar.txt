Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? 
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble 
Sit down

Sit down 
Be humble 
Bitch, sit down 
Be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble 
Sit down 
Be humble 
Bitch, sit down 
Be humble 
Sit down
